Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller. Go ahead, Jon.
Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Bob McDonald and Teri List join me this morning. I'll begin today's call with a
summary of fiscal year and fourth quarter results. Teri will cover business highlights by operating segment. Bob will
then provide his perspective on our progress against our growth strategies and objectives, and I'll conclude the call with
our outlook for the next fiscal year and the September quarter. Bob, Teri, and I will have plenty of time for questions
after our prepared remarks. Following the call, Teri, John Chevalier and I will be available to provide additional
perspective as needed
Last year when we provided our initial guidance for fiscal 2010, we shared our choice to invest behind a strong
innovation pipeline and our continued commitment to simplification and productivity. The plans we outlined were
focused on executing our overarching growth strategy of serving more consumers in more parts of the world more
completely with an objective of returning our business to profitable value share growth.
Our going-in guidance for organic sales was plus 1 to plus 3% reflecting both the slowdown in global category growth
and our commitment to grow market share. Our initial core earnings per share guidance was minus 1 to plus 3%. We
have delivered on each of these objectives.
Global value share is up nearly half a point for the past three-month period. We're growing share in businesses
representing nearly 60% of sales and momentum is building sequentially in essentially every region around the world.
All regions held or grew share for the first time in 11 quarters.
Organic sales grew at 3%, at the high end of our going-in expectations. Importantly the volume growth that underpins
this accelerated each quarter from a reduction of minus 2% in Q1 to growth of plus 8% in Q4.
In conjunction with our cost and productivity efforts, our top line progress enabled us to exceed our core earnings per
share targets. Against our going-in objective of minus 1 to plus 3, core earnings per share increased plus 6% including a
negative 2 percentage point impact from Venezuela.
We delivered record adjusted free cash flow of $14 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 125%, well above
our long-term target of 90% or higher. In April we increased our quarterly dividend by 9.5% making this 120th
consecutive year we've paid a dividend and the 54th consecutive year the dividend has increased. In addition to raising
the dividend, we increased our share repurchase levels as the year progressed repurchasing $6 billion of P&G stock.
Consistent with our strategy, we have accelerated the expansion of product portfolios vertically, horizontally, and to
new geographies and launched significant upgrades on some of our biggest brands. We have considerably strengthened
our portfolio divesting the pharmaceuticals business which did not fully leverage our core capabilities and acquiring
Ambi Pur and Natura which do.
We are operating more fully as one company, coordinating and scaling our activities in markets and across categories.
Our overarching growth strategy of touching and improving more consumer lives in more parts of the world, more
completely is working.
Moving to April-June results, organic volume was up 8%, our strongest organic volume growth in almost six years. All
six business segments, all five geographic regions, each of our top 17 countries and 19 of our $23 billion brands
delivered organic volume growth in the quarter. Shipments also increased to 14 of our top 15 global customers.
All-in sales were up 5% including a 1 point benefit from foreign exchange. The foreign exchange impact and in turn
all-in sales were somewhat lower than our guidance due to the significant strengthening of the dollar since we provided
guidance in April.

Organic sales were up 4%, within our guidance range. Pricing changes reduced sales by 1 point, consistent with the
impact we saw in our third quarter. Mix reduced sales by 3 points. Geographic mix accounted for about half the total
mix impact as shipments in developing markets grew at a 12% rate compared to a 5% rate in developed markets. The
balance of the mix was driven by category and price tier mix, about equally split.
EPS for the quarter was $0.71, in the middle of our guidance range of 0.68 to $0.74. As you know, we intentionally
provide a guidance range versus a single point estimate and do not chase foreign exchange or commodities or back off
on investments simply to deliver a top of range number or an external estimate. Our actions are guided by a desire to
advance our strategy and by our overriding objective of creating long-term value for shareholders.
During the last quarter, we chose, for example, to make value corrections in a few key markets in the Central and
Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa region, to reduce price gaps that had widened due to increased competitive
activity. We could have waited to make this investment, but we felt it was right to address this issue right away.
We chose to increase our investment behind the Pampers Dry Max innovation and we increased media and
merchandising support across several other brands and markets. We made the choice to call a bond which created
higher expense in the quarter but will lower future financing costs and is value accretive. These and other choices kept
us from delivering at or above the high end of our guidance range but were the right value accretive choices to make.
As we expected, operating margins were noticeably lower than prior year. This was due to higher marketing support
levels behind the launch of important initiatives such as Pampers Dry Max, Fusion ProGlide, Crest 3D White, and the
Pantene restage which drove essentially all of the SG&A increase for the quarter.
The lower operating results were largely offset by a low tax rate driven by a number of small items. On the year, the
effective tax rate for continuing operations was 27.3%, in line with our beginning of year guidance of 27 to 28% and
above last year's rate of 25.9%. As we've indicated in the past, quarterly tax rates can be more volatile as audits are
resolved, as reserve balances are adjusted, and as geographic mix changes.
Stepping back, we're pleased with our fiscal year results and the trend of the business. Volume growth and market share
have accelerated throughout the year delivering organic sales growth at the high end of our initial expectations. Core
earnings per share grew ahead of going-in expectations. We had a record cash year and returned through dividends and
share repurchase over 100% of net earnings from continuing operations to shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Teri to provide some additional perspective on our quarterly results.
Teri L. List, Senior Vice President and Treasurer
Thanks, Jon. As Jon indicated, overall market share growth was positive with all regions flat or growing share for the
first time in 11 quarters. Volume growth was also strong across the company, up 8% organically with developing
markets up 12% and developed markets up 5%. This geographic split was the primary driver of the mix effect on sales
growth. You'll see how this impacted the business segments as we go through the results.
Starting with beauty, organic sales increased 5% driven by 8% organic volume growth. Geographic and category mix
reduced sales by 2% as developing markets grew disproportionately at 14% and retail hair care and skin care grew
faster than the Prestige and Salon Professional categories. Price reductions, mainly in developing regions impacted
sales by 1%.
Retail hair care grew unit volume low-teens with share up slightly led by the North America Pantene restage. Pantene
North America shipments grew over 30% behind the base brand restage, which shipped in May. The launch is off to a
good start with Pantene U.S. all-outlet share up more than half a point for the month of June behind strong awareness
and trial building merchandising and consumer commercialization programs.
Head & Shoulders delivered high-teens global volume growth led by our Scalp Care innovation in Asia and Central and
Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Female skin care grew volume double-digits with positive share trends. In the U.S., Olay all-outlet value share of the
facial moisturizer segment was up almost 2 points behind the continued strength of the Olay Pro-X line and the Olay
Regenerist rollerball eye treatment innovation. Olay also had strong results in developing markets, more than doubling
shipments in India, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines.
Female blade and razor global shipments were strong in both developed and developing markets with Venus volume up
over 25% and global value share up over a point, above 53%. U.S. all-outlet share is up over 4 points to almost 51%
driven by recent initiative launches, including the introduction of the premium Embrace disposable razor and the
introduction of the Simply Venus razor, the entry-level priced disposable razor in the Venus line up.
Professional hair care volume was down, reflecting continued market weakness and impacts from our actions to
streamline the portfolio. In Prestige beauty, unit volume decreased mid single-digits due to initiative timing.
Grooming segment organic sales were up 12% on volume growth of 9%, positive pricing of 2% and positive mix of
1%.
The male blades and razors business delivered double-digit organic volume growth with all regions contributing.
Fusion led the growth with shipments up 40% on a global basis, gaining 2 points of global market share and continuing
to grow share in every quarter since launch in 2006. In North America, Fusion shipments increased over 70% behind
the launch of Fusion ProGlide in June. In the second week of launch, ProGlide became the number one razor in the
category.
In Latin America, strong blades and razor shipments were driven by commercial innovation, which included major
sporting event advertising and product tie-ins with MACH3 and Prestobarba disposable razors.
In India, strong customer programs and continued strength of the new and more affordable MACH3 razor increased
shipments over 50%.
Male personal care unit volume was up mid single-digits. Developing markets were up double-digits.
The U.S. male body wash business delivered 45% share in June with both Gillette and Old Spice growing ahead of
competition. U.S. Old Spice increased shipments high single-digits and market share grew almost a point to make Old
Spice the No. 1 male body wash brand. This growth has been driven by the Smell Like a Man, Man marketing
campaign which has generated almost 1.2 billion impressions since February 2010 and with the recent Twitter
campaign became the No. 1 all-time most viewed sponsor channel on YouTube.
Volume in the appliances category was up mid single-digits, driven by a combination of strong growth in developing
markets where shipments increased over 20%, and global strength in the dry shave category, which grew share about
1.5 points
Moving to Health Care, organic sales increased 2% on a 5% increase in organic volume. Mix reduced sales by 3% due
mainly to strong volume growth in developing markets where volume was up high single-digits with the Central and
Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa region up double- digits.
Oral care shipments increased high single-digits. Western Europe delivered strong volume growth behind the continued
success of Pro-Health toothpaste in Belgium and Holland as well as on the base Crest and Oral-B franchises. In the
U.S., Oral Care shipments increased behind recent initiatives and share increased almost 1 point. Crest 3D White
launched in March and is exceeding internal objectives. The 3D White regimen has reached an 8% value share of the
U.S. Oral Care market.
In Mexico, the Crest brand grew its toothpaste share by nearly 4 points to 12% behind the Pro-Health expansion.
Oral-B toothpaste shares in Brazil continue to exceed expectations growing in all channels in which we compete. In
India, Oral-B volume almost doubled behind our toothbrush distribution expansion program and entry point brush
innovations.

Feminine Care volume grew low single-digits. While global share declined slightly, the business grew in Western
Europe behind vertical portfolio expansion in the U.K. and Belgium with the January introduction of mid-tier Always
and premium-tier Tampax Pearl. Personal healthcare shipments increased low single-digits as we held market share.
Snacks and Pet Care organic sales were up 3% with organic volume up 7. Geographic and product mix reduced sales
by 4% but was partially offset by one point of positive pricing. Snack volume increased high single-digits with growth
across all regions. Western Europe and Latin America led the growth, increasing market share about a point each
behind strong consumer and customer support of World Cup commercial initiatives.
Pet Care volume was up mid single-digits driven primarily by solid growth in North America behind the Eukanuba and
Iams with PreBiotics initiatives.
The Fabric Care and Home Care segment increased organic sales by 1%. Volume grew 7% led by double-digit growth
in developing regions. Geographic and product mix reduced sales by 3%. Value corrections in North America, Western
Europe, and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa impacted sales by 3 percentage points.
Fabric Care shipments increased mid single-digits for the quarter behind incremental pricing investments. Tide led the
category with double-digit growth. U.S. Tide gained over 1.5 points of market share behind strong retailer support.
Western Europe also had a strong quarter increasing share over 1.5 points driven by the Acti-Lift innovation and the
Ariel professional laundry additives launch.
Results in Germany were particularly strong and were driven in part by the endorsement of Germany's consumer
testing group getting the Stiva seal of approval.
In developing markets, Fabric Care shipments grew high single-digits. Much of this volume was delivered in Central
and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa markets where we invested in pricing corrections to reduce gaps versus
competition.
Tide in India was also strong almost doubling shipments for the quarter, driven by Tide Naturals, our value tier
powdered detergent launched in December.
Home Care delivered another strong quarter with shipments up high single-digits. Home Care increased U.S. share
points to over 30%. Febreze U.S. market share grew by more than 4 points with strong growth on the base business as a
result of increased brand support and enhanced distribution. Dawn grew U.S. market share by more than 4.5 points and
now has over a 46% share of the hand dishwashing category.
Western Europe shipments increased double-digits as we added more consumers to the Home Care portfolio through
strong consumer-focused initiatives. Developing market shipments grew close to 20%. Turkey was a strong contributor
to this growth with the recent successful launch of
Fairy Automatic and Hand Dish Care.
Battery shipments increased double-digits for the quarter. Shipments and share grew across all regions with global
market share increasing by almost 1 point to 26%.
Baby Care and Family Care delivered organic sales growth of 5% and organic volume growth of 9%. Mix reduced
sales by 3% due mainly to strong growth in developing markets where unit sales grew close to 20% and faster growth
of value tier products. Pricing decreased sales 2% behind value corrections in Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Japan.
Baby Care shipments were up high single-digits and global market share increased over one point with all regions
growing share. Developing markets increased shipments double-digits with China delivering over 30% growth behind
continued distribution expansion and the launch of a size stretch initiative in January.
The Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa region also delivered strong growth as countries such as
Russia, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia each increased shipments more than 15%.

Western Europe Pampers' unit sales were up mid-singles driven by the continued success of Pampers Simply Dry and
the initial pipeline shipments for the Pampers Dry Max launch. Pampers' share of the Western Europe diaper market
continues to grow, up almost 3 points versus year ago to over 56%. While Pampers' shipments were relatively flat in
North America as retailers adjusted inventory back to normal levels following the March launch of Dry Max, share
increased about 1.5 points.
Family Care shipments were up double-digits driven by mid-teens growth of Charmin and high single-digit growth of
Bounty. Charmin improvements were delivered through geographic and portfolio expansion. Shipments of Charmin in
Latin America increased over 75% as we filled out our presence in the Americas expanding into six countries in
Central America. Charmin Basic shipments increased almost 50% through distribution gains and the launch of Basic in
Canada.
Bounty shipments were up behind the launch of product upgrades coupled with the brand restage to focus on Bounty's
clean benefits. Charmin's all outlet value share of the U.S. toilet tissue category up is more than 1.5 points to almost
29% and Bounty's share of the U.S. paper towel category is up about one point to over 46%.
That concludes the business segment review, and I'll hand the call over to Bob.
Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Teri. P&G's purpose to touch and improve lives now and for generations to come is inspiring and it's tightly
and deliberately linked with our financial goals. P&G's purpose informs our strategic choices. It leads us to bigger and
better innovation. It drives quality of its execution. It compels us to make a difference in areas like sustainability and
social responsibility.
Last year we updated P&G's growth strategy to overtly connect it to our company's purpose. Simply articulated, our
overarching growth strategy is to touch and improve the lives of more consumers in more parts of the world more
completely. This strategy unleashes creativity, commitment and peak performance in employees. It attracts talent and
partners. It builds goodwill with external stakeholders and it ultimately drives financial returns and results.
We are executing against all three dimensions of this growth strategy in all of our businesses around the world. In fiscal
2010, we reached an additional 200 million consumers, bringing the total we serve to 4.2 billion, on track toward our
goal of serving 5 billion consumers by 2015.
We increased global average per capita spending on P&G products by over 2%, roughly on pace with our annual goal
of 3% per capita spending growth. We increased global household penetration of P&G products by about 2% – or 2
percentage points to nearly 61% on track toward our goal of 70% by 2015.
And as Jon summarized, we delivered organic sales growth, core EPS growth and free cash flow productivity at or
above the high end of our initial guidance ranges for the year.
As I told you on the fiscal year-end earnings call last year, we are not going to accept sustained market share losses.
Last year at this time, our global market share was down about a half a point versus prior year levels. Today, our global
market share is up nearly half a point and is accelerating. Last year we were building market share in businesses
accounting for only about a third of our sales. Now we are building share in brands and countries accounting for about
60% of sales. And as Jon mentioned, global market share is up and accelerating.
Innovation has and will continue to be the heart of our success. In fiscal 2010, we invested nearly $2 billion in research
and development. We again spent about 50% more than our closest competitor and more than most of our competitors
combined. This leadership level of investment is multiplied by our open innovation approach with external partners,
which leads to an effective investment in innovation that far exceeds the reported spending.
One measure of the strength of our innovation program is the U.S. IRI Pacesetter Report, the annual list of the biggest
innovations in our industry as measured by sales. Over the past 15 years, 125 P&G innovations have earned a spot on
the top 25 Pacesetters list, more than our six largest competitors combined. Based on this track record, IRI recognized

Procter & Gamble as the most innovative manufacturer in the consumer packaged goods industry for the last decade,
presenting the company with its Outstanding Achievement in Innovation award.
We are leveraging innovation to expand our portfolio vertically, horizontally and geographically and to continually
improve the efficacy of our existing product portfolio. I'll provide just a few examples of how innovation brings our
overarching growth strategy to life starting with male grooming. We continue to grow the Gillette Fusion brand and
have now increased market share of this premium priced offering for 18 consecutive quarters. We recently launched
Fusion ProGlide. ProGlide offers a significant advancement in shaving performance and comfort. Our consumer testing
shows that men prefer ProGlide over Fusion by a wider margin than Fusion was preferred over MACH3. ProGlide
cartridges are priced 15% above Fusion. After just two weeks in market, ProGlide has already taken leadership as the
number one razor in the United States with an all outlet value share of 37%.
We recently launched a new mid-tier MACH3 razor specifically designed to better meet the needs of emerging market
consumers. As a result, MACH3 shares are at record levels in India, Brazil and Argentina. In India, MACH3 razor
value share has grown more than 10 points and almost half of the incremental growth has come from consumers who
have traded up from double-edged blades.
We continue to innovate at the low end as well to ensure all consumer needs are being properly served and to stimulate
future systems growth. Gillette Vector, Prestobarba 3 and MACH3 disposables are all performing well and are being
expanded to additional markets.
Several important horizontal portfolio expansions of the Gillette brand in the male personal care are also underway. In
February, we launched a complete line of Gillette male grooming solutions in Brazil. Based on early results, we are
now expanding Gillette male personal care products to more countries in Latin America.
In March, we introduced a scientific face care regimen under the Gillette name in China. In June, we introduced
Gillette Fusion ProSeries in North America. ProSeries is an advanced line up of male skin care products, which fully
leverages P&G's skin care technology for the first time ever. After only the first few weeks of launch, ProSeries has an
11 share of the U.S. male skin care category.
Moving to Fabric Care, we're expanding our portfolio vertically with premium innovations such as XL Gel in Western
Europe. XL Gel is a new to the world gel that gives superior cleaning performance and saves energy because it cleans
well in cold water. It allows for controlled dispensing and is consumer preferred by a margin of two to one. XL Gel is
priced at a 10% premium and continues to perform well with value shares growing in all major Western European
markets.
Our newest laundry brand, Sarasa, was introduced in Japan in September and is off to a strong start. Sarasa is priced at
a 15% premium versus the category average and is designed for consumers who want a laundry detergent that cleans
well, but also provides natural and gentle benefits. We introduced Tide Naturals in India in December quarter and Ace
in Columbia in the September quarter. Tide Naturals is priced 30% lower than regular Tide, enabling us to reach a
much broader spectrum of Indian households.
Ace or Ace is a mid-tier laundry brand, which complements Ariel stain removal equity and bold softness equity.
Innovation and expansion of the Ace brand in Latin America have delivered continual growth for many years. In fact,
we are pleased to announce that Ace has become P&G's 23rd billion-dollar brand.
We grew our Fabric Care portfolio horizontally with Tide Stain Release and Ariel Professional in laundry additives and
Bounce Dryer Bar in the fabric enhancer segment. Both innovations continue to exceed our expectations. In our lead
market of Turkey, Ariel Professional is over a 15 share. In the United States, Tide Stain Release shares exceed 10% and
the year one retail sales will be about $80 million while Bounce Dryer Bar shares are nearly 6%.
Finally, we expanded our portfolio geographically with the introduction of Ariel into Uganda and Senegal during the
December quarter. This follows the launches of Ariel into Kenya during the September quarter and is part of our
strategy to dramatically increase our presence in East Africa.

We also continue to expand our Oral Care portfolio. We extended our portfolio vertically in several key markets by
leveraging our breakthrough and premium priced Pro Health technology. Crest Pro Health is off to a strong start in
China with initial shipments ahead of our expectations. The equity benefit we've created is positively impacting other
parts of our Oral Care business in China. Blend-a-med Expert, which uses the Pro Health formula, was recently
launched in Germany and has pushed total blend-a-med value shares to nearly 11%.
In Mexico, the Pro Health expansion has helped the Crest brand grow its toothpaste share by nearly full 4 points to 12%
of the market. We expanded our Oral Care portfolio horizontally in North America with our launch of Crest 3D White.
3D White is a new premium priced regimen comprised of toothpaste, brush, rinse and white strips that work in
combination to clean, whiten and protect teeth while providing significant health benefits. In fact, when these products
are used together, consumers can start seeing results after just one day, a powerful claim for beauty seeking Oral Care
consumers.
Finally, we expanded our Oral Care portfolio geographically with the introduction of Oral-B toothpaste in Brazil,
Belgium and the Netherlands. In Brazil, toothpaste and toothbrush shares continue to exceed expectations. Based on the
success of our launch in the pharmacy channel, we started a nationwide expansion of Oral-B toothpaste in January. The
launch in Belgium and Netherlands is also going well with Oral-B toothpaste approaching double-digit shares and
driving P&G to overall Oral Care market share leadership in both countries.
I've talked previously about 2010 being a year of big innovation, but this is just the beginning of an incredibly strong
multi-year innovation program. Many of our recent innovations including Pampers Dry Max, Fusion ProGlide, Crest
3D White and the Pantene restage just launched in North America between March and June. They will have a much
bigger impact on fiscal 2011 than they had on 2010 as we continue to build trial and repurchase in North America and
expand them to additional markets.
Dry Max will expand across Western Europe this year. Our Fusion ProGlide plans call for a geographic rollout to over
40 countries over the next two years. The new Pantene formulations will also follow a staged expansion over the next
two years. And we will continue to bring new innovations to market.
In Fabric Care, we have just launched Tide Acti-Lift in North America. The Acti-Lift technology is designed to deliver
deep cleaning of fibers, break up dry stains and provide a whiteness boost. Acti-Lift is rolling out to nearly all of Tide
Liquid detergent variants. We're also launching an upgrade to Ultra Downy April Fresh fabric softener. We have
improved the formulation to provide an entire week of motion-activated freshness. This improvement lets consumers
enjoy the clean sheet day experience for a whole week.
We're planning a 33% compaction across all of our powder laundry detergent brands in the U.S. as well as formula
upgrades on Tide and Gain powders. Compaction is beneficial for our customers, for our consumers and for the
environment. Customers will realize supply chain efficiencies. They can use this as an opportunity to drive category
growth. Consumers will benefit from improved formulas and more convenience with a lighter, smaller carton.
Compaction is also better for the environment using up to 33% less corrugate, nearly 6,000 fewer trucks and saving
about 900,000 gallons of diesel fuel. The compacted laundry powder product will begin shipping in February 2011.
We closed the acquisition of Ambi Pur in early July. This will expand our air care footprint from 17 to 84 countries.
Oral care is introducing a new Crest clinical line of products to treat two of the most common Oral Care problems,
gingivitis and tooth sensitivity. The Pro Health Clinical Gum Protection toothpaste is our most advanced formula,
clinically proven to help prevent and reverse gingivitis. Crest clinically Sensitivity toothpaste provides the maximum
strength available over the counter. Crest Clinical will start shipping in North America later this month. These are just
some of the innovations we'll be launching this year.
We are supporting our innovation program with strong levels of marketing investment. We delivered a 20% increase in
consumer impressions this fiscal year with most of the increase in the second half behind many of the innovations I just
described. To invest, we must save. We are strengthening our efforts in this area with a culture that continually
simplifies the way we work and increases productivity.

A good example of how we're becoming more productive is the digitization of P&G. We are standardizing, automating
and integrating systems and data so we can create a real-time operating and decision making environment. We want
P&G to be the most technologically enabled company in the world. We project a 20 to 25% reduction in spending areas
that benefit from digitization and we're targeting a seven-fold increase in real-time data availability. By getting the right
data to the right decision makers at the right time, we can become increasingly efficient and productive.
We are increasingly operating and competing as one company. Our individual categories, brands, countries and
functions are all critical and each has a unique value to add. But at the total company level, we can create scale
advantages by allocating resources more strategically and efficiently than any individual business can do on its own.
The combination of the individual components is greater together as one company than just the sum of the parts. And
we are focused on maximizing this total value.
We are working across our businesses and markets to better coordinate the execution of our innovation program and
leverage the scale and breadth of our brand portfolio. P&G's sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team in the 2010 Winter
Olympics is a great illustration. Not only did we sponsor 16 Team U.S.A. athletes with 18 leading brands, but we
seized a unique opportunity to sponsor the moms who have dedicated their lives to nurturing their Olympian children.
The U.S. program was both effective and efficient. The Proud Sponsor of Moms campaign generated a record 6 billion
consumer impressions for our brands and the TV ads delivered 30% higher recall by our target consumers. The
program helped accelerate share growth and we estimate it resulted in nearly $100 million in incremental sales.
Based on the success of the U.S. initiative, we are taking this idea global. Just last week we announced a worldwide
partnership agreement with the International Olympic Committee beginning with the sponsorship of the 2012 Olympic
Games in London. As part of this agreement, we are launching our Proud Sponsor of Moms campaign globally. The
international reach of the Olympics will expose consumers worldwide to P&G's full line up of global leadership brands.
As Jon said, we are pleased with the progress we made this last year. We delivered results ahead of our going-in
expectations in nearly every area, but we still have some significant opportunities for improvement. Our results on
some big brands and some big categories have been soft. Downy Fabric Enhancer share is several points below where it
was two years ago. We are launching innovations and making consumer value corrections that will reverse this trend.
The U.S. Oral-B Power Toothbrush business has been under pressure for two years due to the economic crisis. As the
leader in that segment, it's up to us to get it growing again.
The Salon Professional business has been engaged in a multi-year integration and brand streamlining process. We're
near the end of that work and it's time for that business to start growing again.
Battery shares have improved since the consumer value intervention we made in the U.S. in January, but to build
long-term value for shareholders, we need to accelerate innovation. We need to continue our disciplined cost reduction
and cash management efforts. We need to take even more cost out because there is still more investments that we want
to put in to better serve the world's consumers and keep driving profitable market share growth.
If we can build on our successes, address our shortfalls and implement our purpose inspired strategy with excellence,
we should continue to accelerate growth on both the top and bottom line and create leadership levels of value for our
shareholders.
Thank you. And now I'd like to turn the call back over Jon.

Thanks, Bob. I'll close with guidance for the current fiscal year and quarter. We expect fiscal 2011 organic sales growth
to accelerate with organic sales up 4 to 6%. This is based on estimates of global market growth in the range of 3 to 4%.
Our market growth outlook assumes developed markets continue to grow at about 1 to 2% and developing markets
grow at about 6 to 8%. Included in our guidance is the expectation that mix will continue to have a negative impact on
sales growth as developing markets continue to grow three to four times faster than developed markets.

Also included is an expectation that pricing will be neutral to slightly positive for fiscal 2011. Pricing will likely still be
negative in the first half of the year and turn positive in the second half as we annualize many of the strategic
adjustments we made last fall. We are largely on pricing strategy on our key brands and in our key markets, though we
continue to monitor our price gaps versus competition.
Foreign exchange related pricing will likely be positive due to Venezuela and we expect modest changes in
promotional spending. Based on this, we expect all-in sales growth of 2 to 4%. This includes roughly a 3% negative
impact from foreign exchange rates and a 1% benefit from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. We expect
core earnings per share growth to accelerate to plus 7 to 9%. This translates to fiscal year 2011 earnings per share in the
range of 3.91 to $4.01 compared to prior year core EPS of $3.67.
This guidance assumes current spot rates for foreign exchange. It also assumes we're able to continue to source
sufficient dollars to fully support our operations in Venezuela. We expect to deliver free cash flow productivity of at
least 90% and are planning to repurchase between 6 and $8 billion of stock in fiscal 2011.
Turning to quarterly guidance, our quarter-to-quarter earnings growth will be heavily influenced by the base period
trends including marketing spending, commodity costs and foreign exchange rates. As a result, first half earnings per
share growth rates will be lower than growth rates in the back half, the opposite of last fiscal year.
For the September quarter, we expect organic sales growth of 3 to 5% reflecting continued strong volume momentum,
partially offset by mix and to a lesser degree pricing. All-in sales are expected to be up 1 to 3%. This includes a 3%
negative impact to net sales from foreign exchange and a 1% positive impact from the net of acquisition and divestiture
activity. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.97 to $1.01 per share, in line to up 4% versus prior
year core earnings per share of $0.97.
As I mentioned, higher year-on-year marketing spending and commodity costs are two of the main factors affecting
core earnings per share growth in the September quarter. Compared to prior year, all-in GAAP EPS of $1.06 earnings
per share will be lower by 5 to 8% reflecting the pharmaceutical divestiture gain in the base period.
In closing, we are pleased with the progress we are making and excited by both the trend of the business and the
opportunities that lay ahead of us this year. Bob, Teri and I would now like to open up the call for questions.

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Nik.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Just a quick question, Jon, for you on the gross margins. If you can provide some context on the 50
basis points in terms of cost saves and commodities and operating leverage and negative mix just to see how those all
interacted with each other that would be very helpful.
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: Sure, Nik. As you know, gross margin was up about 50 basis points.
Within that, there's about 200 basis point improvement in savings, which is consistent with what we have been showing
in recent quarters. That's – and there's also volume leverage on top of that savings number, so all in, that benefit is call
it roughly 300 basis points.
And then offsetting that is the combination of mix and price, which is about 200 basis points and commodity costs
which are up year-on-year at about 50 basis points. I'm sure I got one of those numbers not exactly correct, but
directionally, those are the trends that are affecting the gross margin and allowing us to improve it going this quarter
and I expect further gross margin improvement next fiscal year.

Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - John Faucher>: Yes, thanks. So in looking at the organic revenue growth guidance, you guys put up 4% on a
plus 2% comp this year, and you're looking for similar to better growth off of a tougher comp, especially with a weak
start to the year in terms of what you guided for the first quarter. So I guess it's a two-part question, is it just simply the
price-mix or at least the mix going from negative to neutral that drives that acceleration, and can you walk us through
the year in terms of the path that's going to get you to that range given the weak start to the year? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. Let me try to answer two questions there. One, explain the
sequential improvement in organic sales growth rate year-to-year as well as address your question on the quarterly
trends within next fiscal year. As we have said several times during the call, we're really seeing some pretty strong
momentum in our business. Volume we talked about growing sequentially from minus 2% in Q1 to plus 8% in Q4.
We're seeing, if you look at share growth trends sequentially, 12, 6, 3, 1 month improvements in literally every one of
our regions, so that gives us a significant amount of confidence going forward that we're going to continue to grow.
Then when you layer innovation on top of that, and as Bob said, most of our big innovations launched at the end of the
year, we'll be leveraging them for the full year next year so they will benefit 2011 to a greater extent than they even
benefited 2010, and as you indicated, we'll start annualizing some of the price decreases that we took earlier this fiscal
year, and as well, the divergence in growth rates between the developing markets and the developed markets will
annualize as well.
If I just give you some perspective there, if you look at the difference between developing market and developed
market growth rates, Q1 of last year, developing markets grew one point faster than developed markets. Q2, it was
even. Q3, it was five points ahead. Q4, it was seven points ahead. That's what's driven the increase in the negative mix.
That should annualize as we go through next year. So that and the pricing annualization are the primary factors for why
organic volume growth will accelerate sequentially quarter-on-quarter as we go through the year. So hopefully that
answers your question, John, and obviously we would be happy to provide any more detail after the call.
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: John, further color on that is the fact that
many of our initiatives as we talked about are doing better than we expected, and are somewhat capacity constrained.
We're adding capacity as we speak. We've got one of our most aggressive ever capacity adding programs going in
place. We have roughly 20 plants under construction, five on the drawing board, five getting ready to start up. And
we're adding all of that capacity and still keeping our capital spending roughly 4% or less of sales. So we're – the
growth is good. It's strong. It's accelerating. And we're adding capacity.

Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Lauren Lieberman>: Thanks a lot. I was wondering – I know, Bob, in your prepared remarks, you talked a bit
about launch activity in Fabric Care, but I think a question on everyone's mind after looking at the results this quarter
with the combination of price and mix but let's just focus on price so significantly negative, what do gross margins look
like in that business? What's the outlook for profitability in Fabric Care and overall kind of category dynamics? Or was
this the quarter where there is significant pricing adjustments and here things kind of normalize to what's a more
traditional performance of that business?
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Lauren, we're very bullish on our Fabric
Care business. We are the leading company in the world. We have been growing share over an extended period of time.
Many competitors have chosen to exit that business. If I step way back, when I joined the company in 1980, we
competed with Unilever and Colgate in the United States. They're no longer in the business, and we're continuing the
grow market share. And in that business, market share and margin correlate. So I feel very comfortable with the

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Hey, good morning, guys. I'm just looking at the EPS guidance for next year, and I think you said
there was negative 3% currency and then probably a 2% help in the base period from a lower tax rate, maybe I'm wrong
on that number. So it looks like there's a 7 to 9% core EPS growth rate, but if you added those other two factors back
in, doesn't it mean you're doing 12 to 13% EPS growth rate? And I'm wondering what's driving that? And then just your
outlook broadly on the consumer and if you're seeing pockets of strength anywhere relative to the last six months or so?
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: Why doesn't Bob handle the consumer question, and I'll then explain
the math on next fiscal year?
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: As we talked, Bill, we're certainly seeing
greater strength in developing markets than developed markets. Our organic volume growth in developing markets was
12% above year ago, which is an outstanding result given the global economic recession. In developed markets, our
volume growth was 5%. That was comprised with pretty even growth between North America and Western Europe,
both up about 5 and 4% respectively, North America, Western Europe. In Japan, we grew 11%. We talked about some
of our new innovations in Japan, so in a market that's been in an economic funk for nearly 20 years, we grew volume
11%.
The developing world, greater China was about double-digits, Central Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa over – high
double-digits; Latin America, high single-digits; and the Asian region with Korea, high double-digits. So the kind of
growth we're seeing is obviously with stronger growth in developing markets than developed markets. And where we
innovate and we innovate well, we're able to grow.
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: And on core EPS, yes, we're guiding to 7 to 9% growth on core EPS.
There is an element of an FX headwind, which we're overcoming. We're overcoming that through a combination of
factors. One, hopefully continued significant volume leverage. Also as I mentioned in response to Nik, we continue to
expect gross margin to improve as savings and productivity offset the impact of higher commodity costs. And
remember, we have – we spent $1.2 billion the past two years in restructuring costs, and we do that to earn a return.
And so those savings as well should enable us to move forward with a program which continues to invest significantly
behind our innovation and our strategy while delivering this kind of core EPS progress despite the small FX and
commodity headwinds.

Next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Hey. Thanks, guys. So the market growth rate you guys are assuming, the plus three to
four, I think that's in line with what you have traditionally seen. So does your outlook basically assume that we're at
normalized growth rates across the globe in your categories?
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: I would say that the market growth centers more closely on three than
it does four, just based on what we're seeing today, so it's still slightly below history which tended more towards four.
But it's certainly getting better. As we indicated in our prepared remarks, we see growth continuing to be
disproportionate, developing market driven, with only one to two points of growth in the developed world, which is
lower than we've seen historically.

<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And when I answered Bill's question, I
was talking about our, in a sense our volume growth rates by geography. And what I should have also mentioned was
it's important to remember that from a value standpoint, North America and Western Europe were basically up one
point in Q4. So we're obviously growing share in those geographies when we're shipping at 4 and 5% and the market is
only growing up one. Japan was down one, and obviously with volume growth rate up 11, we're growing share there.
So our share growth is strong behind our innovation, but the market growth rates particularly in value terms in
developed markets are virtually flat.

The next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. Please proceed.
<Q - Wendy Nicholson>: Hi. My first question is actually just a follow-up, Jon, to something you said. When you
walked through the gap between the developed and the developing market organic growth rate over the course of the
year, has that been driven by a change in the rate of local market growth, or has that been a change in where you've
seen more market share expansion?
And then my actual second question, my own question, is just the fact that the margin expansion or the market margin
contraction, if you will, was so severe in the fourth quarter, I'd love to get a feel for actually how much advertising was
up in the fourth quarter, because it strikes me that given how big the June launches were, May-June, launches were, did
you really spend that much that late in the quarter? And I'm wondering if that absolute number once we see the K,
advertising as a percentage of sales is actually going to have picked up all that much?
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: Okay. The first, the follow-on question, on the divergence of growth
rates in the developing markets and developed market, that is a function of both of the items that you mentioned, which
is further divergence of actual market growth rates as well as a reflection of our portfolio expansion program and
therefore our share growth in those markets. So it's both.
In terms of advertising, year-on-year advertising spending was up $1 billion. We've talked about how that was back
half loaded. In the fourth quarter, advertising expenditures drove a 400 basis point increase in SG&A, which explains
essentially all of the operating margins, the difference between gross and operating margin. And, put simply, we would
have been crazy to do anything else. If you look at the strength of the innovation program that was coming to market,
we literally took every resource available to us and put it behind those innovations because we believed so strongly in
them.
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And Wendy, having said what we said
about the increased spending in Q4, for the year advertising spending was roughly 10%, 11% of sales, which is
historically what we generally do. Of course, that's because we were growing the top line at the same time.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph Altobello>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question in terms of the tailwind you guys got this year
from commodities and currencies, could you quantify that and what you're expecting in terms of the headwind from
both of those two items in fiscal '11? And then secondly, Oral-B in Brazil, it sounded like you expanded the
distribution on that pretty significantly in the first half of calendar '10. Are you now fully distributed on that line?
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: In terms of the commodity and FX benefits that we had last year,
which certainly was part of our going-in construct in terms of how we were going to fund innovation, we ultimately
saw between those items a little less than $1 billion of year-to-year help. And your question on Oral Care, I'll let Bob
answer.

in Brazil is going really well. We are near full distribution now. Shipments are ahead of expectation. We continue to
see distribution ahead of target after only about one year in market, although remember we just started the full
distribution in January. We're growing value share in all channels where we compete and value shares in certain lead
accounts are as high as 10 to 20%. Manual brush shares have grown since the launch. We have retaken and continue to

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Sawyer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Andrew Sawyer>: Yes. Thanks, guys. I just had a quick one on tax rate for next year. You guys saying it will be
in the normal 27, 28 range. And then quickly on levels of spending into next year, I think in the prepared remarks, you
said that you expect promo spending to be relatively stable. With ad spending back up towards the 11% of sales range,
should we also expect pretty stable levels of spending, and if so, I guess the point being that this is a – you've now
returned spending levels to a point where you're comfortable that that will continue to drive the volume momentum?
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: In terms of tax rate first, yeah, we would expect next year's tax rate to
be the same as this year's, which is somewhere between 27 and 28% excluding any big one-time items. The – on
advertising, you're right. We'll be holding promotion relatively steady year-to-year. We'll be increasing advertising,
doing that in line with sales. So the percentage should stay about the same.
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I want to also remind everyone that the
quality of the advertising is also important, and as you look at, for example, Smell Like a Man, Man, which won a
Grand Prix Lion at Cannes, when you look at, for example creating shows like Secrets of a Mountain or The Jensen
Project where we know that advertising that airs in family-friendly programming is more effective than that that
doesn't.
When you look at our shift from TV and traditional forms of media to other forms of media, we're not only talking
about a spending level, but we're talking about a significantly increased effectiveness of the advertising. All you have
to do is look for example at our ad called You Never Walk Alone which supported the 2010 Winter Olympics in
Vancouver, and generated 6 billion impressions that we didn't pay for to see how effective that money is being spent.
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: And I'll just add one more thing. We continue to work to coordinate
activities, innovation and marketing as was the case with the Olympic campaign across our businesses, and that yields
both gains in efficiency and as Bob said gains in effectiveness. So we're very comfortable headed into next year in
terms of both the level and the quality of the support that we have against the business.

<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm very excited about the changes at
Walmart, Ed. We see Walmart under the leadership of Bill Simon in the U.S. getting back to the traditional way that
Walmart has grown their business. We have as you can imagine a very strong partnership with Walmart, like we want
to have with all of our retail customers, as evidenced by our co-production of the movies The Jensen Project and
Secrets of the Mountain.
We know that Bill Simon has the complete trust of the leadership of the Walmart – of the Walton family and of the
leadership of Walmart, and we see him doing things to make changes to things like Project Impact and the clean aisles
to make sure that Walmart gets its top line growth going and attracts more shoppers. And we have a very strong
partnership. We're working hard against aggressive growth targets, and we're very excited about – and see the changes
as very positive.
One thing I want to add, just to clear up any misconception, is some of the historically low prices that you have seen
from Walmart in tabs and elsewhere have not necessarily been supported by spending by Procter & Gamble.
Oftentimes our retail partners decide to invest their own money in merchandising our brands in order to attract traffic.
It's a very common procedure in the industry to use leadership brands like ours to attract traffic, but we're very excited
about Bill Simon's leadership of U.S. Walmart.
International Walmart is doing extremely well under Doug McMillon, and we're partnering with Doug and his team.
And Sam's Club is also doing well under Brian Cornell, and we're partnering very well with Brian and his team.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.
<Q - William Chappell>: Thanks. Good morning. One housekeeping and then one question. On the housekeeping, can
you give a little more color on the other income line in the quarter? And then on the main question, can you talk a little
bit about where the advertising was spent, which you stepped up in the quarter? I mean, it seems like the men's shaving
was the biggest area where we saw a lot of TV support, and I didn't know if there were changes of if it's more
reactionary to the success of Hydro year-to-date?
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: On the other income, really the year-to-year change is just a
reflection of a difference in the presence of small divestiture gains. We had none of those this quarter, and that's really
all of the difference.
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: On the advertising, Bill, basically any of
the new brands we launch we raise the level of marketing spending in order to achieve certain awareness and trial
objectives. I think perhaps the reason you saw a disproportionate increase in ProGlide is that you're the target audience,
so I hope you went out and bought the razor and are using it.

<Q - Jason Gere>: I was just – I guess in context of your outlook for that 1 to 2% category growth in developed
markets and the 5% in volume, I mean, I guess one, the first question I guess, is really as you look at that breakdown,
the 5%, can you talk about how much of it was really innovation driven, whether that was pipeline fill? And then how
much is really the consumer really getting attracted to lower pricing right now? I'm just thinking about the consumer. It
just feels like maybe we're not hitting a double dip recession but consumers really are fighting back and they want to
shop more on deals. So guess if you can break out between those two aspects and how you see that building over the

next couple of quarters? Thanks.
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Jason, we – as we said in our remarks,
we've had successful growth both on the high end of our portfolio and in the middle and lower tiers of our portfolio. So
we see in developed markets, we see a bifurcation where our new initiatives like ProGlide and others that are premium
priced continue to do very well. And I would say they appeal to the people with jobs.
At the same time, we also see and we talked about this in the reduction from our volume growth rate to our sales
growth rate, we see a mix effect as consumers without jobs or in challenging positions trade down. And they may trade
channels. They may go to a channel where they think they can find a more competitive offer. And so that trading down
is an impact.
I frankly expect that to continue, and that's why it's important for us to innovate all along our vertical portfolio, both at
the high end, the middle end, and the low end, and that's why we talked about it so thoroughly in my comments, is that
we got to appeal to all consumers. I think the economic recovery in the United States will be uneven. I think we're
seeing that already. We don't expect a double dip recession like you don't, but we've got to keep innovating and keep
growing at all areas of our vertical portfolio.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Lane with Jefferies & Co. Please proceed.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: Yes. Hi, good morning, everybody. Just real quickly, not to read too much into four-week
Nielsen's, but back in June, the Pampers market shares dropped about four points versus May, and Huggies bumped up
about four or five points as well. It doesn't seem like that category bounces around that much. So I wondered if your
all-channel data showed the same thing and if you can just sort of give us some color on what was going on there?
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: Well, not to focus on four-week Nielsen data, but you see a lot of
choppiness in that data that's really driven by promotion cycle as much as it is anything. If you look at the last three
months and what we're seeing in July, we continue to be very happy with our progress both on a sales and a share basis
for Pampers.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: It just seems like a four point sequential change was just bigger than you usually see?
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: All-outlet was less – was much less than that.
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm very excited about our Pampers
business, Doug. If you look, Pampers Dry Max is the biggest innovation since we launched Pampers. It's now only a
very small part of the brand. We're going to be expanding it across the whole brand. And I think some of the changes
we've talked about on this call in the retail environment you'll see playing out in the marketplace that will strengthen
the Pampers brand.

And our next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Constance Maneaty>: Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the compaction of powdered detergents,
what's driving that, what the impetus for it is? It's easy to see compaction in liquids where you take out a lot of water,
but what do you take out in the powders? How big is that category? I assume you're leading it? And then finally, when
will we get XL Gels in the U.S.?
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Connie. I've been working on
the compaction of powder laundry detergents in the United States since I joined the company in 1980. Basically in the
beginning, we started by taking out fillers. There are certain things in a powder laundry detergent that are required in

order to process the product through the manufacturing cycle. And as we've invented newer and better technologies,
we've been able to compact. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're planning a 33% compaction which as well
will be a formula upgrade, meaning we've been able to improve the ingredients in the detergent which has allowed us to
remove some of the process fillers and other things.
This compaction like other compactions benefits everybody, because it means the product requires less shelf space per
load, less transportation cost per load, and of course everyone in the supply chain saves money and the consumer saves
based on the space they save at home and of course they get a better product. So there's going to be 33% less corrugate,
6,000 fewer trucks, and we're going to save about 900,000 gallons of diesel fuel. So compaction is always a good thing
and something that we want to do, because it improves life for everyone.
In terms of XL Gel, XL Gel is designed for the kinds of washing machines that exist in Europe, which are horizontal
access washing machines. We always are working on improving our technology for U.S. machines, but it would require
a different formulation in the U.S., and you can rest assured we're working on that. Similarly, Gel as a form is a form of
compaction, so it's also good for consumers, good for retailers, and good for us. So stay tuned, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Calyon Securities. Please proceed.
<Q - Caroline Levy>: Good morning, everybody. Two quick ones. Could you address accounts payable in the cash
flow statement? It just looks like that was a huge positive. And also just given how the stock is trading, this was clearly
a disappointment, but you sound very bullish on your business. But I would like you, please, just to address where you
did feel any disappointment in terms of the margin trends. Not brand-by-brand or anything, but on those big businesses.
Was it in any way disappointing that margins were down over 700 basis points in one area?
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: First on the payables, as we mentioned, we significantly accelerated
our advertising spending as we went through the year, which resulted in a higher payables balance at the end of the
year. And you'll recall that some of our big innovations were launched in the month of June, which is driving that. The
-
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Relative, Caroline, to optimism or
pessimism, I'm very optimistic on our business. Our results in fiscal 2010 were ahead of our original expectations, and
I'm really happy with the trend of the business. Our fourth quarter unit volume grew 8%, the highest growth rate in
nearly six years. Volume grew in every business segment, every region, every key country. We also built market share.
We're growing market share now in about 60% of our business versus half of that a year ago. All regions held or grew
share, which is the first time in 11 quarters that happened. We over-delivered our going-in fiscal year core EPS growth
objectives and we generated $14 billion in free cash flow, and the payables line is one of the reasons why. We
increased our dividends for the 54th consecutive year and repurchased $6 billion in P&G stock, returning more than
100% of our earnings to shareholders. So I can't be anything but optimistic realizing that these growth trends will
continue.
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: Operating margins by definition are lumpy or choppy by quarter. We
expect to have continued operating margin expansion. We had – we expanded operating margins on the full fiscal year
basis. We'll do that again next year, so we don't take – we don't really look at it frankly on a quarter-by-quarter basis.

about $400 million of investment again next year. Much of that is focused on productivity and simplification initiatives
with the objective as Bob described in his remarks of creating a faster more agile operation. And we'll continue doing
that.

Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi, guys. Thanks very much for making the time to take my question. I guess I'm still hearing a lot
from investors about a little bit of a lack of confidence in your guidance. Particularly in the context that this is the
second quarter in a row you've been very optimistic, you've said things are getting better, you've said most things are
better than expectations, but you're actually showing stacked deceleration in top line growth. And you're actually barely
at the low end of your top line guidance especially in this quarter where you just spent so much back in advertising.
So when you get down to it, I guess there are two pieces to it, one is trying to understand more about the top line.
You're guiding to acceleration in organic sales even though you're going to face tougher organic sales compares, the
consumer clearly isn't getting any better, competition is really starting to push back which may stifle a little bit of your
share growth. You're lapping at least in the first – the back half of the year the best innovations in something like 20
years.
And then on your bottom line, you're talking about a 2 to 4% net sales growth translating to 7 to 9% EPS growth. I
guess how do you build confidence in the investor base that you're actually are guiding appropriately or are in control
to put it bluntly given some of what we've seen over the past couple quarters? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: The first point I would offer is in terms of confidence for next year, it
goes back to what Bob was just describing, and it's just an incredible momentum that exists across the business that we
fully expect to continue. And that's what gives us confidence in the top line guidance.
From the bottom line standpoint, I mean, first of all we over delivered on a fiscal year basis our core earnings per share
growth last year, so the notion that we're somehow providing irresponsible guidance certainly doesn't resonate here. We
delivered the quarter right in line with our anticipated guidance range. We wouldn't be providing guidance of 7 to 9%
next year if we weren't comfortable in it. We are. One way to think about it simply is organic sales growth of 4 to 6%,
take a midpoint of 5, bring that down to the bottom line, add two to three points of benefit from share repurchase which
we're talking about at 6 to 8 billion, and you're home. So I think it should be deliverable.
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The hardest thing to do, Ali, I think, is to
run a business where you're delivering balanced top line and bottom line growth and growing market share at the same
time. I think the fact that we're growing market share in 60% of our business and that growth rate is accelerating is
proof positive that this business is strong and growing. At the same time, we have the strongest innovation program we
ever had, and we're operating more as one company than ever before. And I think you can see the impact of our
program in the marketplace.

which of your value products, which products that created a negative mix shift in developed markets drove that?
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: Well, it's – there are two things going on. First of all, it's price-mix.
We've taken – we made several price corrections in North America on things like batteries, on things like detergents, on
things like paper towels earlier in the fiscal year, and those continue to impact until they annualize the price-mix line.
We also continue to see significant growth on our, for instance our basics offering, Bounty basic, Charmin basic, and
some of the other items that we've tried to make available for consumers who are seeking a better price.
<A - Teri L. List, Senior Vice President and Treasurer>: And, Alice, I'll just point out also the – like for example
retail hair and skin grew faster than Salon Professional or Prestige. That has an effect as well.

Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris & Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: Hi. I was wondering if you could just talk about innovation a little bit more in terms of
you've talked about expanding into adjacent categories and representing that's like white space opportunity for you
guys. In FY '10, it seemed like Tide Stain Releases was one of the main launches that got you into a new category. Am
I forgetting others, and do you expect more of that kind of white space opportunity growth in FY '11? And did you also
say the number of innovations would actually be greater in FY '11 than FY '10?
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Linda, it's Bob. It depends how you
count innovations as to whether or not they're greater. As Jon said, remember that we launched the big innovations this
past fiscal year in the fourth quarter. As a result, we don't – we only have a few weeks, frankly, of impact so far of
things like the new Pantene, Fusion ProGlide, and so forth. So the full-year effect will be next year. So if you measure
in terms of full-year effect, certainly next year's program will be stronger than this year's because of the carryover
impact if nothing else in addition to the new items we're launching.
The biggest opportunity we have is to get all of our categories into all of our countries around the world. We have
about 36 product categories and we're in all those categories in the United States where we've been for 172 years. But
in countries like China where we lead, we're in just over a dozen, probably about 16 categories in China. So we have
work to do to adapt those categories for the Chinese market. But that's a huge part of our white space activity. That's
why you see us rolling out things like Oral Care around the world. That's why we did the Ambi Pur acquisition. That's
why we've rolled out Olay, our leading skin moisturizer to about 15 new countries in the last year. So we've got a lot of
work to do to simply get the categories we're currently in into all markets.
At the same time, we're working to develop new categories such as Swiffer, such as the ones you've mentioned. And I
can't give you too much perspective on those since we would rather surprise the competition rather than let you know
about them in advance.
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: I would just add to your list of horizontal portfolio expansions and
adjacencies, last year you mentioned Stain Release. There was also the Bounce Dryer Bar, Gillette ProSeries in several
countries, Olay skin care for men in China. I talked next year about expanding Gain into the dish care segment. And we
talked about Crest 3D White, which is really a horizontal expansion into the seam between beauty and health. So I don't
want you to get the impression that it's a one-trick pony here.
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Crest 3D Whites is an interesting one
because we are in the beauty business unlike some of our competitors, and to the degree that there are Oral Care
consumers who are beauty conscious, we have an opportunity to take our knowledge from beauty care and use it in
healthcare in order to meet that increasing need.

Our next question comes from the line of Victoria Collin with Atlantic Equities. Please proceed.
<Q - Victoria Collin>: Hi, Jon. Hi, Bob.
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Victoria.
<Q - Victoria Collin>: Hi. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the advertising spend. I know you spend a lot
on new product support, but with some of the additional spend you put through in the quarter repositioning yourself in
categories where you've lost share previously, maybe if you could split that out for me?
And I wondered also if at the start of the quarter it was clear that you were getting a tax benefit, which enabled you to
ramp up the advertising spend higher than you would otherwise? Because the way I'm thinking about it in terms of the
operating margin, I wonder if you could steer me a little bit into Jon you said the operating margin is going to be up
year-over-year in full-year '11, but what are the main drivers of that? Are we going to see a negative mix or will higher
advertising spend be a larger push down on the operating margin as we look forward?
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Victoria, as we compare year-on-year,
you would see a higher level of advertising in Q4. If you remember Q4 a year ago, our top line actually declined. We
lost market share, and we said we weren't proud of that. In fact, when we announced the earnings, that was where we
said we're drawing a line, and we're going to stop losing market share. We're going to grow market share profitably. So
if you indexed our advertising in Q4 versus year ago, you would see a dramatic increase since we cut advertising in Q4
a year ago in order to deliver the profit results we delivered. So you would see higher levels of advertising on
established brands, and that's the reason we're growing market share on 60% of our business today, is we're supporting
it with advertising versus year ago.
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: And Vicky, your question on the tax rate as the quarter progressed, I
think you have it almost exactly right. We started to see some benefits as we went through the quarter both as a result
of favorable audit settlements, as a result of geographic mix, and we reinvested that money in support of growth behind
our big initiatives. So that's exactly what occurred.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please proceed.
<Q - Mark Astrachan>: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Building on a previous question about cost savings,
curious does the level of reinvestment make you reconsider the thought process behind increasing your cost saving
initiatives? And then relatedly, could you just give us a refresher on how you make those decisions on what to fund?
<A - Jon R. Moeller, Chief Financial Officer>: Well, as Bob said towards the close of his remarks, we need to take
more cost out because there's more investment we want to put in to further our purpose, our strategy, and our financial
objectives. So if anything, the level of intentionality on cost savings continues to increase as we go forward. We don't
constrain funding for cost savings to any level. If we have a good project, we'll fund it. That's why our restructuring
spending varies from year-to-year and is a very fluid process, and we're constantly identifying new opportunities,
evaluating them, and if they're smart, funding them.
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I would say, Mark, we have our strongest
cost savings program that we've ever had during my career with Procter & Gamble the last 30 years. I talked about it in
my prepared remarks. We're trying to simplify our operation. We're reducing levels from seven to five to the CEO.
We're reducing the number of ineffective product initiatives. We're reducing the number of SKUs. We're making the
ideas that we have larger so that we're spending behind larger ideas. Simplifying the operation all the way down to
simplifying the raw materials is a big idea.
The other big idea that we're working on is the digitization of the company, and I talked about the potential productivity
improvement of that. Many of our new products today we design using simulation and modeling versus bench scale
kind of prototyping that we did years ago. That gives us a much faster cycle in innovation. It also leads to a much more

productive spend. I mean, know we talked about the fact that we spend about $2 billion a year on R&D, but we didn't
talk about the fact that that $2 billion is much more productive because of our open innovation system with outside
partners and also because we're using modeling and simulation and digitization a lot more than ever before.

Our last question comes from the line of John San Marco with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed.
<Q - John San Marco>: Thank you. Good morning. I get to 50 basis points of market share gains implied in the 4 to
6% organic growth. I guess the first question is do you think that's a sustainable rate of market share gain over the
long-term? And then in the more immediate term in fiscal '11, can you characterize the possibility that your planned
positive pricing as the year progresses would be at risk if the competition starts to play catch-up and expand some of
the price gaps that you've invested hard to close in the last couple years?
<A - Bob McDonald, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the market share progress that
we're on is sustainable. I think it is sustainable because of our strong innovation program and our strong go to market
activity. Remember, as we bring these innovations to market, at the same time we're working to increase the
distribution of our product.
For example, right now we're working with the Chinese government on something called 10,000 Villages where we
expand the distribution of our products into rural areas of China to reach more Chinese consumers and to create
economies where economies never existed and as we do that, that obviously creates more people to use our products
and helps us get to the 5 billion consumers that we've targeted over the next five years, four years now that we have
remaining. That's how we reached the 200 million extra – more consumers this fiscal year. So we're going to continue
that, and I do think the market share gains are sustainable.
