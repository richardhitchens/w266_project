MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allstate Corporation third quarter 2012 earnings conference call.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session, and
instruction will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Robert Block, Senior Vice President, Investor
Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Robert Block
Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for Allstate's third quarter earnings conference
call. First Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik, and I will provide some color on our results for the quarter, and then we'll go into
a question and answer period. Also on the call are Don Civgin, head of Allstate Financial and Esurance; Judy Greffin,
our Chief Investment Officer; Sam Pilch, our Controller; and Matt Winter, head of Auto, Home, and Agencies. Don
Bailey, who leads the emerging businesses, will not be able to join us today since he's on the East Coast as the result of
Superstorm Sandy.
Last night we issued our press release and investor supplement and filed our 10-Q for the third quarter. We also posted
a slide presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These are all available on our website.
Beginning with slide 1, this discussion may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Actual
results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2011, our 10-Q for the third quarter
2012, and our most recent press release for information on potential risks. This discussion will contain some

non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website. And I will be
available after this call to answer any follow-up questions you may have.
Now I'll turn over to Tom for his perspective on our performance.
Thomas J. Wilson
Well, good morning. We appreciate you spending time with us today.
Before we discuss results, let me say a few words with Hurricane Sandy, which I know personally affected many of
you. First, I hope you're all getting your lives back together. As you know, this was a massive storm, affected most of
the eastern half of the country. If you look on slide 2, you can see the breadth of that. Putting it in comparison to other
events, this is at least twice the breadth of Hurricane Katrina. The good news is that the wind speeds were substantially
lower than Katrina and more like last year's Hurricane Irene. In fact, wind speeds were two-thirds of Katrina. And as
you know, the damage is exponential as that speed goes up. And while it's of course too early to call ultimate damages,
several modelers have put out insured loss estimates – EQECAT at $5 billion to $10 billion; AIR was at $7 billion to
$15 billion, with economic losses at twice that amount. If the storm's damage is over $8 billion in insured losses, that'll
make it the fifth-largest hurricane in U.S. history. Of course, a lot of the damage at this point would appear to be caused
by flooding. That is covered by your auto insurance. As you know, the federal government provides flood insurance,
and it's typically not covered by people's homeowner's insurance.
And, of course, in these times of trouble, that's when our company, Allstaters, do great work on behalf of our
customers. We have 1,100 catastrophe claim adjusters out in the field as we speak, another 500 at our service centers.
We have 24 mobile claims centers. We're out reaching out to customers. We're doing advertising. We're walking the
neighborhoods. We are very proud of the fact that we are either among the first if not first to be there for our customers.
It's sort of a point of pride for us. We're out there helping them find a place to live, get food, clothing, assess their
losses, and Allstaters really do an amazing job providing for the needs of our customers, being empathic and supportive
at this time.
As you know, customer focus is our central to our strategy. In fact, we just got the J.D. Power Auto Claims Satisfaction
results this week, and our overall satisfaction on auto claims increased significantly. We are now in the
high-satisfaction tier, above the industry average and several other well-known insurance brands.
Now, we all want to know, of course, how much this storm will ultimately cost us, and it's obviously too early to
estimate the impact of that storm. However, the catastrophe is not expected to have a material impact on our overall
financial condition. Obviously, at this time, our focus is on our customers, not our monetary losses. Ultimately, of
course, we do provide an estimate for cat losses in a month if it surpasses $150 million. We typically do that by the
third Thursday of the following month. Because this event occurred at the end of a month, and it involved such
extensive damage, we may not have enough information to develop a credible estimate by November 15, because the
way that Thursday falls, it's really 15 days after the end of the month. But soon as we have an estimate, we will put one
out.
Now let's move on to discuss results for the quarter. I'll focus my remarks on our performance relative to our 2012
priorities, then Bob and Steve will cover the quarterly results in greater detail.
So, moving to slide 3, our strategy, of course, is to provide unique products to each of the four customer segments in
the marketplace, which you can see on the top there, and it is working. The Allstate brand serves those customers who
prefer to purchase competitively priced branded products and want local advice and counsel. In this business, we've
introduced several new differentiated products, including Claim Satisfaction Guarantees, Drive Wise, Good Hands
Roadside, and House & Home. In the third quarter, premium and unit growth continued to be impacted negatively by
our efforts to improve homeowner returns broadly across the country and our actions to improve profitability in a few
large auto states, which as you know we started last year.

We did see positive premium growth in total for the Allstate brand, as homeowners, emerging businesses, and standard
auto outside of New York and Florida all contributed to that increase. Additionally, Allstate Financial's new issued life
policies sold through the Allstate agencies to the customers in this segment increased as well. And, of course, we
continue to look for ways to improve the growth trajectory for standard auto, one of our four lines, identifying market
opportunities to expand homeowners and emerging businesses, and then support our agencies so that they can grow
their business profitably.
The self-directed segment that prefers a branded experience, that's served by Esurance, that's lower right. Since they
were acquired last October, Esurance has exceeded our growth expectations with policies in force increasing 22% since
the beginning of this year. The GAAP combined ratio remains elevated, as one would expect, given the amount of new
business we're writing and the way the accounting works for direct businesses. We are closely watching the loss ratio,
since maintaining auto profitability is one of our four priorities.
Progress is also evident in the advice and brand-neutral customer segment. That's up top, served by Encompass. The
growth and profit transfer of that brand are also positive.
If you move to slide 4, let's review our financial performance for the third quarter. On a consolidated basis, we
generated $723 million in net income on improved underlying margins and lower catastrophe losses while growing
premiums. Operating income of $717 million converts to $1.46 per diluted share. That's our best quarterly result in five
years. Book value per share grew to $42.64 per share. That's 22.4% better than the third quarter of 2011. And lastly, we
produced a return on equity of 13.6% and 15% on a net income and operating income basis, respectively. That is on a
trailing-12-month basis. Now, I recognize we set a goal of 13% operating income return by 2014. Keep in mind that
while we made good progress on improving the profitability of the business, the weather has been fairly good over the
last 12 months, so there's more work to be done before we feel like we've achieved that goal.
We also established four priorities for 2012, and we're on pace to achieve all of them. Maintaining auto margins is
critical. The underlying combined ratio in the quarter was 93.7%. That's an improvement from the third quarter of
2011. The homeowners underlying combined ratio improved 7 points, as rates continue to work into the P&L and
weather remained relatively benign, and the benefit of our underwriting actions. This is a result of five years of hard
work to reposition this business. Annuity returns remained relatively flat, and the reduction in contractorholder funds
was lower, due primarily to the low interest rate environment. Going forward, we'll continue to look for opportunities
to accelerate that reduction.
Property liability insurance premiums grew 5% from the third quarter of 2011, largely due to the acquisition of
Esurance. Both the Allstate brand and Encompass produced positive premium growth rates in the quarter. In that
customer segment served by the Allstate agencies, however, auto and homeowner policies declined. Reversing this
trend is a key priority for Matt's team. Don Bailey's team has done a nice job of repositioning Encompass and growing
the roadside business, where the new product, Good Hands Roadside, now has over 0.75 million members. We actually
changed the disclosure in the investor supplement to see the policies in force on a slightly different way this quarter.
The Allstate Financial team, led by Don Civgin, is growing life sales through Allstate agencies and the benefits
business.
Judy's team continues to proactively manage the investment portfolio, which led to solid total return performance of
2.4% in the quarter and 6.3% through September. Net investment income of $940 million declined 5.4% from last
year's third quarter, and that's primarily due to reduced Allstate Financial liabilities and lower yields which, of course,
you're all familiar with. And then limited partnership results were down a little bit this quarter as well. The portfolio net
unrealized gain increased in value during the quarter to $5.7 billion at the end of September. From a capital utilization
perspective, we repurchased $153 million of our stock, and that's at a slower rate than in the previous quarter. As we
said in the third quarter, as we move through cat season, we tend to slow that program down a little bit.
We feel good about the results for the year but also recognize there's a lot more work to be done. So let's hear from Bob
and Steve.

Thanks, Tom. Let's take a closer look at the details for property liability and Allstate Financial for the third quarter.
Beginning with property liability on slide 5, we show both the top line and combined ratio results overall written
premium grew 5% from third quarter 2011 to $7.06 billion, primarily due to the acquisition of Esurance. The growth
rate increased from the second quarter 2012, as both the Allstate and Encompass brands also contributed to the positive
result.
Looking at the results by line, Allstate brand standard auto declined by 0.2% from third quarter 2011, and then were
similar to the second quarter 2012. Excluding New York and Florida, the two states where we have implemented
significant profit improvements over the last 18 to 24 months, Allstate brand standard auto grew by 1.4%. New issued
applications of 460,000 remained slightly below the prior year but were at the average level produced over the last six
quarters, which ranged from 451,000 to 472,000. The retention ratio remained at 89.0%, down a tenth from the third
quarter 2011. Policies in force declined sequentially as the level of new business was not sufficient to offset the renewal
losses.
Allstate brand homeowners net written premium of $1.69 billion increased 3.2% compared to the third quarter of 2011.
The favorable impact of rate changes on average premium more than offset the decline in units. We continue to see
great changes in order to achieve our stated return goals. In addition, we are rolling out our new product, House &
Home, now in 17 states, including five states that rolled out in the month of October. Encompass continued to show
positive results in both premiums and units, with increases of over prior year of 5.3% and 3.8%, respectively. Esurance
contributed $282 million in premiums written during the third quarter and increased units sequentially to 962,000, a
22.4% gain since the beginning of the year.
On the bottom half of the slide, we provide the combined ratio results for property-liability and by brand on a recorded
and underlying basis. The recorded combined ratio for property-liability was 90.2%, significantly better than the prior
year, due primarily to lower catastrophe losses and an improvement in the underlying combined ratio. Year to date
September, the underlying combined ratio was 87.4% or 1.5 points better than prior year and below the bottom of the
outlook range we provided at the beginning of 2012 of 88% to 91%. If we matched the underlying combined ratio we
recorded in the fourth quarter of last year of 90.7%, it would put us in the lower end of that range. Now, this is not a
prediction or a forecast, just creating some context for why we didn't adjust the range at this time.
During the third quarter, we completed our annual comprehensive review of the discontinued lines and coverages
reserves. We made some minor adjustments to the reserves for an impact of $42 million. The recorded combined ratio
results by brand indicate significant improvement for both the Allstate and Encompass brands, due primarily to reduced
catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio also improved for the Allstate brand and Encompass, where in
Esurance, the reported and underlying combined ratios remain elevated.
On slide 6, we provide charts detailing loss trends, rate changes, and combined ratio for Allstate brand standard auto.
As shown in the upper-left-hand corner, after increasing over prior year in the second quarter, gross frequencies for
both bodily injury and property damage declined 1.2% from the third quarter 2011.
In the upper-right-hand charts, the calendar year paid severity results for property damage showed a little acceleration
from second quarter, increasing 3.9%. Bodily injury calendar year paid severity rose to a 6.8% increase over the third
quarter of 2011. Now, bodily injury severity tends to be volatile from period to period, and the mix of state and report
years contributes to it. But over a two-year period, the increase is in line with inflationary factors. There's some
pressure on the most recent report years, primarily in New York and Florida. However, the overall [ph] allowance
(15:06) trends remain well within our pricing actions.
In the lower-left-hand chart, we provide the approved rate changes for the last four years. For the last four quarters,
we've averaged about 3% in standard auto rate changes. And the lower-right-hand chart displays the combined ratio
trend since the beginning of 2010. And over the last few years, the combined ratio has remained very consistent, in the
mid-90%'s range.

Slide 7 looks at the underlying combined ratio trend on the top of the page and the underlying margin components on
the bottom of the page for standard auto. In the top chart, you see that we've averaged an underlying combined ratio of
95.1% over the last four quarters. And on the bottom of the page, you can observe that the average earned premium,
which is the red line, has remained above the average losses line shown in blue, meaning that the margins are getting a
little better each quarter. Maintaining auto margins remains a top priority for us.
On slide 8, we provide similar statistics for homeowners. In the upper left, we have approved rate changes for the last
five years, and over last four quarters we've received approvals for almost 7% rate increases on a countrywide basis.
We will continue to seek needed rate changes in order to hit our return objectives for this line of insurance. In upper
right, loss cost trends excluding catastrophe losses are displayed. For the third quarter, frequency decreased 11.4%,
while paid severity increased 5.8%. These results led to a reduction in the underlying combined ratio of 7.1 points, as
shown in the lower left. We continue to believe that about half of the improvement in the underlying results are
sustainable and half are the results of the milder weather.
Slide 9 provides a better look at the underlying loss trends for homeowners. The top chart gives the underlying
combined ratio, and one can observe the improvement we've achieved in the last several quarters. On the bottom, we
display the trends for the average earned premium and average losses over time. The trend for the average earned
premium in red reflects the favorable impact of rates increasing steadily since 2010. The trend for losses, in blue, is far
below the prior years and gives rise to our hesitation to take full credit for the margin improvement we've enjoyed this
year. That said, improving homeowners returns is a priority for 2012, and we have been successful thus far through the
first nine months.
Now turning to Allstate Financial, where we continue to shift the focus to underwriting products and away from
spread-based ones. The results reflect successful execution of this strategy. Total premiums and contract charges of
$563 million increased 2% in total and 3.6% for underwritten products. Allstate agency life unit sales contributed to
this result, increasing 6.9% over the third quarter 2011. Consistent with the strategy of reducing spread-based products,
contractor holder funds were reduced by $722 million from the second quarter and $2.2 billion from year-end 2011.
Given the low-interest-rate environment, we have not made as much progress in reducing annuity liabilities as we
would have liked, and we continue to explore a variety of options to execute this strategy.
Net income for Allstate Financial was $131 million for the third quarter, down $61 million from the third quarter 2011.
The primary reasons for this reduction were realized capital losses in 2012 versus realized capital gains in 2011, along
with lower operating income results. Last year, we executed a sales program designed to harvest gains, accounting for
much of the difference. Operating income was $97 million for the quarter. During this quarter, we completed our
comprehensive review of assumptions for deferred policy acquisition, or DAC deferred sales-inducement cost and
secondary guarantee liability balances. This resulted in a $27 million pre-tax charge to income. In 2011, we conducted
this review in the first quarter of the year, resulting in a $6 million pre-tax charge to income.
Looking at the operating returns by line, life insurance declined 2.2 points to 9% from year-end 2011, due to worse
mortality experienced in the last several quarters and the impact of the annual DAC unlock study. Accident and health
continued to produce solid returns at 16.6% as of September 2012.
With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, Bob. We continue to proactively balance portfolio yield and return objectives in this challenging
low-interest-rate environment, delivering strong investment results with a total portfolio return on a GAAP accounting
basis of 2.4% for the quarter and 6.3% through the first nine months of the year.
On slide 11, you can see longer-term trends in the composition of our portfolio. We ended the third quarter at $93
billion in amortized costs and a fair value of $99 billion, reflecting improved valuations, which along with portfolio
income and improved underwriting cash flows from our property liability business, more than offset the ongoing

reduction from Allstate Financial's spread-based business. The chart on the left-hand side of the slide helps to illustrate
the results of our proactive steps to enhance the profile of our portfolio from a risk and return perspective. Note that the
drop in the portfolio's amortized cost resulted primarily from our planned reductions in Allstate Financial's liabilities
As we headed into the financial crisis, we proactively reduced financial sector and real-estate-related exposures while
increasing the liquidity of the overall portfolio. Coming out of the crisis, we have favored the strong fundamentals and
stability of credit, including high-yield, over public equities. During the most recent quarter, we opportunistically
reduced risk by selling $722 million of structured securities, realizing a loss of $119 million. The securities increased in
value over the course of the year, justifying the sale into a strong market. Collectively, these actions have resulted in a
strong, well-positioned portfolio.
We have been proactively managing interest rate risk by optimizing our fixed income portfolio's position on the yield
curve, focusing on intermediate-term securities. This will reduce reinvestment risk and lessen the sensitivity of our
portfolio's value to increases in interest rates. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the results of these actions
in the scheduled maturity profiles as a shift away from the "Due after ten years" category. We are contemplating
reducing our interest rate risk in the property-liability portfolio further by selling additional long-dated securities and
reinvesting shorter on the yield curve. We expect gains to be realized in the sales and the portfolio yield to decline as
these sales and reinvestment are executed over the next several quarters.
If you turn to slide 12, highlights our portfolio income and yield trends. For the third quarter of 2012, net investment
income was $940 million and total portfolio yield was 4.3%, below both the prior quarter and third quarter of 2011.
You may recall that we prospectively changed our classification of equity method limited partnership results to net
investment income but realized capital gains at the beginning of the year, which brought us in line with the reporting
practices of other peers. Although investment income on limited partnerships of $22 million is below the prior-year
quarter, this income is $177 million higher on a year-to-date basis. The increase reflects the change in classification, as
well as an improvement of $50 million in limited partnership performance. Excluding limited partnership results, the
portfolio yield was comparable to last quarter and the third quarter of 2011.
On slide 13, you can see that we realized losses of $72 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to a realized gain
of $264 million in the third quarter of 2011. Our portfolio management actions and other trading activities generated
approximately $24 million in net trading losses, including the $119 million loss in the sale of structured securities I
mentioned earlier. Impairment and write-downs are $46 million and continue to trend significantly lower than
prior-year periods. Derivative results in the current year reflect reduced usage as we are managing more of our rate risk
in the cash market through portfolio positioning on the yield curve. In the third quarter of 2011, interest rate derivative
valuation losses reflect the significant decrease in rates in that period.
We finished the quarter in a strong capital position, as shown on slide 14. Shareholders' equity of $20.8 billion
increased $2.5 billion from year-end 2011. Statutory surplus rose to $17 billion. And deployable assets at the holding
company level reached $2.3 billion at the end of the third quarter. We continue to buy back our stock, purchasing $153
million during the quarter. That leaves $166 million as of quarter-end on our current $1 billion buyback authorization.
Our book value per share came in at $42.64, on the strength of our operating performance, improved portfolio
valuation, and active capital management.
Now let's go to the question and answer session.

Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein. Your question,
please.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking the time. Obviously, it's a real priority for
you guys to be out in the field, and we all appreciate you not pushing back earnings. The question I would ask is,
recognizing that you can't comment on an actual estimate; of course, it'd be way too premature. But you are getting
reports of first notice of loss here, out there in the field talking to customers. You have some sense of the volume of this
storm. I'd love to get a sense of, from these operating metrics, sort of where you are, say, in perspective – in relation to
Hurricane Irene last year. And then similarly, you probably are starting to get a sense of the mix and composition of the
claims that you're actually going to have to adjust. And I'd love to get a sense, especially when we think about severity
going forward, is this going to be driven by lots of large total-limit losses, or are you going to see more sort of modest –
far many but – maybe more than previously, but sort of many more sort of smaller losses that are sort of damaged
ancillary structures and things like that?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Hey, Josh, this is Tom. You're in correct in saying it's way too early. Even on loss counts,
it's a little difficult, because sometimes people have cell phones, they can get access to it, sometimes they don't. I can
tell you we're very busy. We also do, as you know, flood adjusting for the federal government, write-your-own-flood,
we're one of the bigger handlers of that program as well. So we take all of those claims in. Anybody calls us, a
customer, we go out and see them. So it's really too early to tell on either the volume, the mix, or the severity.
What I can tell you is when we do the – our estimate, we'll try to give you as much information as we can at that point
in time. I can tell you that from the risk management standpoint, we are down in policy counts in all of the affected
areas by a reasonably substantial amount. And if you're interested in that, Matt can give you more details on it. But we
are – the actions we've taken over the last five years in places like New York, New Jersey, all up along the East Coast,
have reduced the policy counts we have there in the sort of 10% to 30% range. And that will obviously impact what our
losses are relative to what they would have been. But what you really want to know is what are they going to be, and I
can't give you any more clarity than that.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: I certainly understand. The investors, I think, at this point are sort of obviously dealing
with modeling firm estimates, and I think you guys are sort of sophisticated users of the models and you've got a lot of
your own data and your own perspective over time. I'm wondering what sort of – to use the phrase sort of "known
unknowns," model errors and historic biases that you think historically, perhaps, we've seen, that you guys might be
watching for as you handicap the estimates themselves. And one topic of conversation I think people are curious about
is whether this has the possibility of being something like Ike, which ended up going further inland and ended up
driving sort of surprising levels of losses with what would have been perceived to be modest wind further inland than
typically models would have suggested at the time. Thanks so much.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Josh, maybe I can give you a comment on the models and then a suggestion maybe on how I
can help you sort out what you're trying to get to as you look to impact on us. We do obviously have our own models.
We buy all the models from everybody else, and we have our own policy data actually loaded into that. So we have a
wide range. Matt and his team have done a number of scenarios, but I tell you it's a really wide range. So it's – the
number could be low. If could be higher. What I think you could do to give yourself some comfort as to how big it
could be would be to look at – go to the website and put in gross losses into the Reinsurance section. And it's got that
interactive model, which will tell you what the net ought to be. And you can see that at certain levels, our reinsurance
programs kick it, which caps our exposure.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: Okay. Thanks. Good luck.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Oh, Bob tells me it's not interactive. Sorry, Bob.
<A - Robert Block>: [indiscernible] (29:14)
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I guess the interactive part is you'll have to [ph] put it in (29:16). I thought we were a little
more sophisticated than that, Josh. Sorry. But Bob can help you if you need help.

Our next question is from Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital. Your question, please.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: I didn't expect to be in so soon. I guess, first, Tom, when I look at the auto results, obviously
very good. I think you said it was a 93.7%, I think, accident year. But if I add on sort of normal cats of a couple points,
that's high 95%'s, which, again, is a solid result. But I'm wondering can that get better? Can we get that – in the past,
we've obviously seen low 90%'s, but even a 94%, 95%, is that possible given rates are starting to improve? Or is 96%
kind of the best you can do in the current rate environment?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: First, I just wanted to give one point of clarification. The information we provided is
calendar year, not accident year. So -
<A - Robert Block>: The underlying is in accident.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: The underlying is what I'm -
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay, the underlying is accident.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Well, the underlying's ex cat, so I took the underlying and added 2 points of normal cats to
it.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay. The way we look at the auto business is it generates really good returns for us. So
return on capital at that level, we've shown some slides before, depending what you want to assume in terms of capital
levels, is in the 20% range, plus or minus. That's a really attractive return on capital. We'd like to grow that business at
those kind of returns. So I would rather see us grow it, maintain auto profitability, than squeeze a few extra dollars out
of margin.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Got it. And that actually led into my follow-up which is I was going to ask how is the
outlook for that? I believe there was an internal memo that hit one of the news wires that suggested you're broadening
your targets. And maybe the tone of that seemed to be a little bit more optimistic about growth going forward. And
certainly with competitors, some of your big competitors having to chase rate to improve their profitability back to
where it used to be. It would seem maybe you're in a little bit of a sweet spot here.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Let me maybe provide an overview on growth in total, and then Matt and Don can give you
some more detailed perspectives on both the Allstate brand, Esurance, and Allstate Financial, because I think you have
to think about it in total if you think about our strategy. So first, our strategy to focus on those four segments, have
competitively differentiated products in those segments targeted to those customers. The largest segment, as you point
out, is the advice- and brand-focused one that's served by the Allstate agencies. The overall policies in force are down
there, which is largely as a result of the homeowners actions we've taken, which was intentional on our part to improve
returns in that business. Along with that, standard auto is down a little bit, partly due to the homeowners, partly due to
New York and Florida. Matt can talk about what his opportunities are there to grow.
I think the biggest opportunity is to improve customer retention, because his new business levels are kind of running
about where you would expect them to be. We have expanded the disclosure, as I mentioned earlier. You can see Good
Hands Roadside, which serves that segment largely, is up substantially, but we don't count it as a policy since they don't
pay us until they actually use it.
The advice and brand-neutral segment that's served by Encompass, the independent agencies, is up slightly. We need to
recapture some lost market share there. Esurance is that self-serve branded segment. We're growing at a rate as fast as
we're comfortable with. And then Allstate Financial is growing the life policies sold to that lower left-hand segment

and our benefits business.
Matt, do you want to make some comments more specifically to the – I guess you were after standard auto, so we can
zoom in there if you want.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Sure, it's Matt. I'll comment a little bit first on some of the drivers. So Tom mentioned our
two primary drivers that have impacted growth have been our homeowners return improvement actions and some of the
auto profitability issues in New York and Florida. And I'll take it up one higher level and I'll say that I think our
fundamental approach to the marketplace is to be very proactive and very disciplined. And sometimes that creates a
first mover disadvantage on us, where we're first to take action, where we see a need to do risk mitigation, we're first to
take rate where we see emerging environmental and economic trends, and we're first to take proactive action that
actually can sometimes impact our growth prospects.
So I think you know that we have about 16 states where we're either closed for homeowners new business or have
significant new business restrictions in them. I think Sandy is a good indication of why we did that, and it will prove to
have been a good move for us to reduce our exposure in some of these coastal areas. But all of those actions, whether
they're profitability actions in New York and Florida on auto or these homeowner actions, have an impact on our ability
to grow. And as Tom said, you can't take all of these profitability actions. You can't do the non-renewals. You can't do
reinspections. You can't tighten underwriting without some impact on our retention. And that is really what we see as
our prime opportunity for growth at this point, because we think we were early in most of these actions and we were
proactive. And as a result, I think we're further along on that timeline, and we are at the point of stabilization, and we
are at the point where we are beginning to see pockets of growth.
You mentioned broadening the target. We have several growth initiatives out there, including broadening the targets
and price optimization work, some additional work to analyze our ability to grow even faster in selected areas. And so
we have those pockets of growth emerging. We have about 20 states right now that had positive year-over-year PIF
growth in standard auto, and our hope is over 2013 and 2014, we will dramatically improve that number without losing
any of our discipline on the profitability side.
So our first mover disadvantage, I think, at some point will work into a first mover advantage where we will emerge
out of this cycle faster than some of our peers, and we'll be able to take some of the growth opportunities that are
presented to us, which I think are many at this point.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Great, thank you. So it sounds like you'd be disappointed if we don't see growth in standard
auto for 2013.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: I don't remember saying that, exactly, but you'll draw your own conclusions.
<Q - Ian J. Gutterman>: Very good, thank you.
<A - Don Civgin>: Hey, Ian, good morning, it's Don. Let me just give you a quick update on Esurance. As Tom said,
of course, we acquired Esurance so that we could grow in that self-directed segment in a profitable way. That's been the
goal, is to grow market share profitably. Since the acquisition, we've done a number of things. We've linked the brands
together, so it's Esurance, an Allstate company, which has played well. We've clarified their position in the market,
through their features and their technology. We've developed the new ad campaign. And we've thrown a lot of weight
behind the new ad campaign intentionally.
And here's how I would characterize where we are today. I think we're very happy with the results we're seeing. The
response rate with new quotes is up dramatically. The conversion rate is up. The retention rate's up. I mean, you can see
a over 22% improvement in policies since just the beginning of this year. That's a big number. What you're also seeing,
though, is a high combined ratio. Part of that is intentional. The advertising model, the accounting model, is such that
we have to expense that advertising in the quarter we take it, even though the value of the policy continues to linger on
through retention.
And so we are watching the GAAP combined ratio, but I'll be honest: We're more interested in the economic combined
ratio. If we're convinced that we're writing good business that will be profitable over its life, and we are, then we're

comfortable tolerating the GAAP loss ratio being over 100% for some period of time. We also have a little bit of an
elevated loss ratio in the third quarter. [ph] Gary (38:19) and his team are watching it closely. We're working together
to make sure that we have all of our resources between Allstate and Esurance on the job. I'm confident that number will
get back in line. But all in all, I'd tell you the growth prospects for Esurance are going so far very well, and I think
we're very optimistic about the future.

Our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Langen McAlenney. Your question, please.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Good morning, everyone. I need some – little bit of help on your reinsurance slideshow, given
that I can't plug the stuff into a spreadsheet. You give an example of a hurricane going through New Jersey, which
seems to have its own cover, and there's two different covers, which I don't quite understand how they interact. But I
think you talk about a $700 million-type loss working its way down to $200 million net. But maybe if you could just
give – if the number was $10 billion in the three states, simply how – what the gross and the net numbers would play
out, that would be helpful.
<A - Robert Block>: Bob, I can give you a call back later and we can walk through the steps. The contracts in New
Jersey all work together.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Okay.
<A - Robert Block>: So it's – I'll give you rough numbers, but it's about $150 million retention, and then it's 95%
reinsured, up to the top of the contract.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: But we can walk through it.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: But that's New Jersey.
<A - Robert Block>: That's New Jersey property losses only. That does not include auto.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Right. And then of course, and as I said, auto, flood is covered, and this hit 21 states. So it's
a big storm. So – but we can help you sort it...
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: But you had a $10 billion sort of loss in the other two states, what would the net number be?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: First, I assume you're talking about $10 billion as the industry level -
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Right, right.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: – versus us. [indiscernible] (40:29)
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: And let's say you had 10% to 12% of that, so $1 billion gross. What would the net be?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I think it's highly dependent on the mix of which states and what type of losses. But if you
want – and you come up with two or three different scenarios – Bob can show you how those would work through the
reinsurance program, and you can come up with an estimate on it.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Okay. And I think others might be interested in it as well. But on Encompass, it looks like a
mini breakout from what's been a troubled line for a long, long time. I mean, you're growing premiums and the
underlying underwriting is improving. Am I overreacting to this quarter, or do you think you got the horse running the
right way around the track finally?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, I guess it all – I would agree. I think, first, this business is a good business for us to be
in serving that customer segment. Second, as you know, that business is probably down $700 million or so in premium

over the last three or four years, and so it's got some room to come back. Some of that, of course, was intentional
because we were in places we didn't want to be from a cat management standpoint, but there is room to grow that
business. Three, we do have new leadership there. Don Bailey has got a new leader in place there. We like the results
that he and the team are now driving. So I would hope to be able to see it continue to grow. I'm not sure what breakout
is; we all have different assessments of breakout. But I think if you look at what's going on in that customer segment,
and the companies who serve that segment largely through independent agencies, I think we're well positioned to grow,
yes.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: I was referring to the underlying profitability, underlying combined ratio.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Oh, the breakout on the profitability.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Right.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Sorry, I thought you meant breakout on growth. The profitability has gotten better. I like the
trends. I'd like to see the combined ratio come down a little, but I'd like to see the business grow as well. So I don't
think we're going to – that business, as you know, we've had that business – shortly after we bought it, we took the
combined ratio down from 117% down into the low 90%'s. I don't expect it to get into the low 90%'s at this point in the
cycle given where the competitors are, but I think it can be better than it is today, and I think the business can grow at
the same time.

Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS. Your question, please.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Yeah, good morning, everybody. Just two quick questions here for you. The first one,
looking at the slide on the underlying margin trends on the standard auto business, looking at underlying loss trends and
what's going on there, I'm just curious. Maybe you can talk about kind of the difference between the paid loss trend and
what you're showing here, the incurred loss trend. Because the paid loss trend appears like the last couple of quarters
it's been above where your averaged earned premium per policy has been.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Yeah, Brian, it's Matt. So you have all the issues that come up with paid loss trend, and I
guess BI paid severity is a good example of that. So you look at BI paid severity, and it looks fairly dramatic, but as
Bob said in his opening comments, about half of that increase can be accounted for as the change in the mix of claims
settled by report year, and a shift in the state mix, and the other half is consistent with the medical CPI. So we do have,
I guess, some distortion that's always present when you look at the paid versus incurred, but I think if you look – and
I'm assuming you're referring to the bottom chart on page 7 of the presentation, the underlying margin trend – I think if
you look at that consistent pattern over the last several quarters with the nice trend line between earned premium and
the losses, I think our goal is to manage that, and our goal is to look at the loss trends in aggregate. I think it's
somewhat dangerous to focus on the attribution analysis of each component.
We have – a term Tom and I throw around a lot here is "false precision," and we can get trapped in our own net. And
we look at it – and we do the attribution analysis, and we try to understand each of the drivers, whether they're medical
inflation or whether they're report year or shift in state mix, but then we look at the aggregate loss trends and the
aggregate premium trends, and we look at our rates that we're taking, and our attempt is to manage some of those levers
so that each of those – on one quarter, one is going to go up, the other is going to go down. It's like pushing on a
balloon. And our job is to manage the overall size of the balloon and how much air is in there and the pressure being
exerted on it.
And I think history will show that our team is exceptionally good at managing that. They manage each of the
components. They manage loss trends very carefully, while maintaining a good customer experience and good
customer treatment. And they're very proactive in looking at emerging economic and environmental trends and taking

rate where it's appropriate and warranted and mandated and justified. And so I wouldn't get too caught up in the paid
volatility. I'd get a little more focused on the underlying trends, and that's why we've tried to show them to you in the
slide presentation.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Yeah, very helpful. That was great.
<A - Robert Block>: Brian, it's Bob. Just a couple of things to keep in mind. Remember, while you're looking at the
paid severity trends, you also have to look at the frequency trend. Frequencies are down. And the fact that bodily injury
and property damage together make up about 45% of the standard auto losses. So there are other coverages that are in
there, collision, comp, uninsured motorist, and everything, where the trends are good as well. So you're looking at two
of the big covers, but there's still other pieces to that puzzle, and also the fact that I think you can tell from our
reporting on reserves, our reserves are reasonable and they're accurate.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. And just one quick one on the life insurance business if possible.
Your investment spreads really kind of improved this quarter. Wonder if there's anything unusual going on there.
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: Our investment spreads, Brian, did get a lot better. I think you see several things going on.
Some of it is what you'd expect. So we continue to work on crediting rates, and that's being offset somewhat by the
lower yields in the portfolio and the continuing lower asset levels. But the investment spread, the biggest impact is the
option valuation from the equity index annuities. I think to look at apples to apples, you're going to have to take that
out. And then you get back to what I said, which is the crediting rate's offset by yields and the asset levels.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question's from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Hey, thanks. In regards to Hurricane Sandy, it looks like insurance regulators in at least a
few impacted states are saying the storm won't technically be classified as a hurricane; therefore hurricane deductibles
won't apply. So I was curious how the difference between a hurricane versus tropical storm classification impacts
Allstate.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: First, if you're interested in the science of it, a hurricane is – it gets its energy from the
water. The winter storm or northeaster gets its energy from the temperature differential in the air. And so that's why it's
been classified that way. The tropical cyclone deductible probably will not be triggered up in the Northeast, and we're
prepared for that, and that's what's fair and accurate for our customers. It may or may not – I'm not sure where we are
down in the far Southern states. There may be a few states where – but the damage is much less severe down there than
where the hurricane turned in.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: So would you say the kind of estimates that a lot of the reputable firms are put out there
are taking into consideration that the higher deductibles wouldn't be triggered?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I don't know for that – I don't know, Mike. Not everyone has a tropic cyclone deductible. I
don't know how good their models are on that. It's, of course, very complicated, because even when you have it in the
marketplace, not every policy has it on it, and so I would say to the extent it is not triggered, industry losses would
obviously be higher than when it is triggered, because that's a higher deductible than you would have on a normal
all-peril policy. But I don't think it would substantially alter the numbers, which are such big, wide swaths anyway
now. The ranges are billions of dollars. So I don't think it would impact it much.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay. And in regards to, Tom, the 13% ROE target, on a normalized catastrophe load
basis, obviously, so where will most of the increase come from now given that you guys seem to be getting close to the
goal within homeowners, not looking to increase auto profitability. I guess I do recall at the Investor Day you talked
about unlocking capital within the life insurance segment. Maybe you can update us on that. Thank you.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay. First, my entire team is raising their hand saying they're going to deliver it. They each
want...
First, I think – I would say we're above that target for the last 12 months, and I think that is reflective of where we
would hope it would come from, which is maintaining auto margins, improving returns in the homeowner business, and
getting returns up in the life business. Then, of course, there were two things that happened this quarter, which we
wouldn't expect to happen every quarter. One is [ph] low pats, (51:30) and the other is the change in the investment
spread we just talked about. So we still have work to do to fill up the profits ahead of that.
So homeowners is – we feel very good about where it's at. Matt and his team are working hard on it. We've been at this
for a while, as you know. We're definitely in a much better position. We're doing a good job on auto profitability. We
do have a little bit of a headwind in the life business with low interest rates, which is – starts to drift over into the
property-casualty business. We're going to work to manage our way through that and still achieve our goal, but there's a
little bit of a headwind there.
To the extent we can reduce the size of the annuity business faster, we will seek to try to do that. It was down almost $4
billion over the last year; I think it's like $3.8 billion. But it was only down about $700 million in the last quarter, so
you can see that that rate of decline is down a little bit, and that's because low interest rates and people don't want to
surrender their policies. So Don and his team are hard at work trying to figure out other ways we can reduce the size of
the annuity business, not the life business. The life business is getting good returns for us – the life insurance business.
So to the extent we can reduce that business, that of course frees up capital, and we get a higher return out of that as
well. So we have a little more work to do on all fronts, but we're feeling good about where we're at.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: So I guess just as a final follow-up, then, so within Allstate Financial, should we be
looking at the statutory capital? Because that amount of capital has kind of been staying the same over the last year.
The annuity portfolio has been running off; traditional life has been growing. So should that number be expected to
drift downwards if the current run rates continue?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I would – as the size of the – as Steve pointed out, the size of that portfolio is down about
$20 billion or so in the last three or four years. As that size of that portfolio comes down, I would hope we could have
dividends out of that business, which would be the statutory capital, yes.

Our next question is from Matthew Heimermann of JPMorgan. Your question, please.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: Hi, good morning, everybody. Couple questions. One, just on homeowners. I was
just trying to get a better sense of what the underlying improvement was. On my math, adjusting for the non-cat
weather that you've – benefit you've quantified in previous quarters, it looks like year to date we've got about 470 basis
points of improvement, which is a little faster than I think the run rate you all have talked about in the past. And I'm
just curious if you could remind us, I think the difference is there was some adverse weather in 2011. So just remind me
if I'm thinking about kind of the puts and takes right.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Matt, it's Matt. I'm trying to understand your question a little bit. Are you asking about
what component is sustainable and what component is based upon the lower-than-normal cat quarter?
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: Well, you've quantified the lower-than-normal cat. And so if I look just at loss ratio,
I'm getting year-to-date improvement, nine months over nine months, of about 470 basis points. And I think historically
when you've talked about – so that seems high to me, relative to what you've talked about, kind of your expectations of
core margin improvement. So, one, I guess, comment on whether or not that perception is correct, about how 470 might
compare to your run rate expectation. And then, secondly, if it is, in fact, a little bit faster, is that attributable to the fact
that 2011, I think in 1Q in particular, had some unfavorable weather that might be making that look a little bit better?

I'm just asking because I want to make sure that as I think about next year, I'm not botching anything up.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Well, that is true. So we had some unfavorable weather that exacerbates the year-over-year
view, but also I think the other way of looking at this is that this is a fairly volatile business, and trying to do it over
year over year while we're declining and if in selected areas on the coast, is a little distorted, because we're changing
the mix of the housing. We're changing the risk profile of the homeowners business as a overall block. And so trying to
compare year over year as if it's a stagnant, steady mix is a little distorted.
I think we're changing the risk profile of the business a little. House & Home as you know – it's gone in. It was 12
states in third quarter, as I think Tom mentioned, another five in October, so 17 states. That has a different risk profile,
and we underwrite roofs differently. We assess the risk differently using some tools that we're used to using on the auto
business. And so while we're we are seeing normal year-over-year improvements where you could back out some of the
things, we're also seeing a changing homeowners business, which I think is going to continue to improve. And so I
would say that the quality of what is there is higher than it was even a year ago. And I think a lot of what you are seeing
that you can't get to mathematically is a result of that change in quality of the business.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: Okay. And then as we play that forward into the next year, do you feel – is that
something we should expect to continue to help a little bit on the margin as we go into next year, or now we kind of – is
the impact going to be less dramatic?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Well, it'll be less dramatic. As we put in House & Home, we tried to put it in, in the
highest-leverage areas first. And so we clearly wanted to maximize the early impact of the shift, and a lot of our efforts
on non-renewal and reduction of homeowners in the coastal areas and high-risk areas is well into the latter part of the
timeline. So I would not straight-line it. I think you'll see a continued improvement as a result of those two efforts, but
not at the same pace as we've currently experienced it.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: Okay. That's helpful. Sorry that that took so long for me to ask the question in a
way that made sense.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: No, no, no, no, and I'm sorry I was struggling with where you were going with it. So I
wanted to make sure I was answering what you were truly asking.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: Yeah, that was helpful. Then I guess just one on Sandy, and this just goes to – one
of the – and I'm going to bring up Katrina, not because I think that should be the baseline we think about the loss, but
because there were a lot of adjusting issues. Because surge is really a big potential loss driver here. Whether it's insured
or uninsured or government insured is a different question. But Katrina, right, there was some regulatory push to cover
flood losses with wind, and there was a lot of gray as to what caught – in some cases that was because there was a lot of
gray and there weren't houses left to actually adjust. I'm curious, when you think about Sandy based on – and I know
it's early, but do you think – how is the gray area in this loss, wind versus flood, on the personal lines side contrast with
kind of your experience with Katrina? Is that something that gives you a lot of pause, recognizing that normally when
you get big events the ties usually go to the policyholders. But I'm curious more whether or not there'll be as much
gray.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Let me give you a quick answer because I want to make sure we get a couple other
questions in here. Of course it's too hard to tell. I haven't been on the ground out there, so it's hard for me to see. I will
tell you that as it relates to Katrina, we did very well on wind versus flood. We were proactive about our approach to
that. And, of course, the issue there was house on the coast, big hurricane comes, house is gone. Was it the wave and
then the wind came, or was it the wind and then the wave came? And trying to sort that out. That doesn't appear to be
the situation here, but it's way too early to tell what the issues will be. I will tell you that we have a history, though, of
doing what's right for our customers and giving them what they paid for.
<Q - Matthew G. Heimermann>: All right, thanks for that. Yep. Sorry, didn't mean to cut you off if there was more.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: That's all right. Can we go to the next question?

The next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your question, please.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Good morning, everyone. How aggressively do you plan on rolling out Drive Wise next year,
and is your intent to use that to augment growth, augment profitability, or both?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, we don't disclose which states we're going to do it in, Adam, but I will tell you, we
like what we see. The customer uptake is a little higher than we thought it would be initially. We think we have a
slightly different offering than other people because the device stays in the car, as opposed to coming out of the car,
which gives us the ability to have a different customer relationship, which says that it should work on both of the
elements you've talked about.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Okay, thank you. And one follow-up question. It appears that you'll make more money this
year than you have in probably four or five years. How is that going to reflect when you think about the buyback for
next year?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, obviously, I can't comment on what we'll make this year, because we are still trying to
sort through Sandy.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Sure.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: But I'd like that to be the case, obviously. And let me maybe just go up to capital. We are
obviously well capitalized. Today we have plenty of capital, any which measure you want to put it at. We also generate
substantial capital, and we have access to capital in the marketplace. So we have three sources of funds from which we
could buy back shares or use our capital to grow the business. Obviously our preferred option is to grow the business,
particularly in the auto business, where we're getting very high returns.
Occasionally, we make what I would call modest acquisitions, whether that be Esurance or Encompass or the benefits
business we bought. And we've gotten good returns on those, but those tended to not – they tend not to be a big portion
of our utilization of capital. Of course, as you know, about 80% of the capital we return to shareholders through
dividends or share repurchases, and that has been our history for a long time. When you look at dividends, we, of
course, make the decision – the board makes the decision every quarter. Right now when you look at our dividend
rates, whether that be payout or yield, they look a little low relative to where our stock price is, and earnings are. So
we'll consider that in the beginning of the year as to what we should do with the dividend.
And then on share repurchases, we're not obviously done with the current program. When we are, we'll look at all the
sources of capital we have, either the capital on our balance sheet today, our capital generation potential, or ability to
access capital, because, as you know, there are some pretty attractive markets today in what are equity-like securities to
use that to restructure and lower our cost of capital. So that's the way we think about it. When we get done with this
one, which we're pretty close on, we'll be thinking our way through them.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks a lot.

Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. One question I just have – when you
look at insured losses that will come out of Sandy, how much of that ends up getting absorbed – do you think will end
up getting absorbed by the National Flood Insurance Program?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Really hard to tell, Mike. We don't really – it's almost impossible to tell right now. I will tell
you that if you want to go way up, the National Flood Insurance Program ends up being a net drain on the U.S.
government. It really is a – if it was your business, you would seek to restructure that business, charge accurate prices

relative to where people's houses were. You'd try to expand the coverages so you weren't only insuring those houses
that get flooded two and three times. And Congress has struggled with that over time, but their losses are – the net
losses will probably end up being bigger than they would need to be if you ran it as a private business rather than as a
political entity.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got it. Great.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: But I can't give any estimate for the exact number. I just – I have no idea.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great, and then just maybe one on Allstate Financial. I mean, it seems like – I mean, clearly
moving more towards a underwritten profile as opposed to a spread business. I mean, what is your kind of expectation
for that business longer term? I mean, it doesn't seem like, other than the life product, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of
operational synergy or overlap with your captive agent platform. Just trying to understand, where do you see that
business moving as you execute your transitional strategy there?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay. Well, we look at it a couple of ways, Mike. First, we look at it strategically as it
relates to our customers, and then we look at it to say, where do we get a decent return? So strategically as it relates to
those personal-touch loyalists down in the lower-left-hand corner who want advice and a relationship and want branded
products, they want to buy all things – more things from one person, rather than multiple, because they don't just feel
like having 15 different relationships. Life insurance, some retirement products, obviously fit into that category, and so
– and we do well there. The life sales, I think, are up, Don, 6% or 7% this year so far, and we like what we have there
in terms of bundling. Yeah, that's good for the customer.
That said, that doesn't mean we need to make everything we sell. So we sold the VA business in 2006. Our fixed
annuity business today, we use a lot of outsourced products. We have some proprietary products still in that channel,
but we've used outsourced products. On the annuity business, if we don't like the returns we'll get on it, we'll just sell an
outsourced product with someone who has a different return objective on it.
On the life insurance business itself, just life insurance policies, we're getting pretty good returns on our capital, well
above our cost of capital there. And so we've done that. But we try to separate into two things: What do we need to do
for our customers, and then what do we need to do for our shareholders? And we manage our way through that. And
that's why we're taking the size of that annuity business down, is we have don't need to have shareholder capital
employed in that to execute our strategy.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Okay. Thank you very much.

And our final question today is from Randy Binner of FBR. Your question, please.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in, and this is another Allstate Financial question. But I appreciate
all the commentary on trying to kind of redeploy capital out of particularly the annuity business into what you perceive
to be higher, kind of better risk-adjusted returns in really the other protection businesses. And so I guess, just as I think
about modeling to the extent you're successful in getting folks to give up those annuities and then you're able to free up
capital from the annuity business, that takes time, and then reallocate it. I'm just trying to think if there's going to be
kind of a doughnut hole or a lag in the earnings that you generate as you transfer that capital around. And so I guess I'd
be kind of interested in your thoughts on that approach, how that affects 2013 earnings. And then I'm not sure if I've
heard this in the commentary, but are you thinking about kind of more aggressively trying to go after annuity holders
and maybe giving them lump-sum payouts or other incentives to surrender?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: On the last part of your question, the answer would be yes, we are actively looking at that.
On the 2013 earnings capital generated from accomplishing that, I would say not likely to have a meaningful impact on
overall earnings. So if it – you could do the math that for every $100 million of earnings, Allstate Financial, even if you
redeploy it into something – some of that business, we've redeployed and get a higher return than what it's getting

today, even in investing, but it would not be meaningful for us.
<Q - Randy Binner>: So I guess it happens gradually enough over time that there isn't a big block of capital that needs
to get upstreamed and reallocated and then earned against – it's more of a gradual process. Because, I guess in our
model, it seems like as you move capital out, there's a little bit of a lag, but it seems like it's more of a gradual process
from your perspective.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I would say – I'm sure there's a lag. But it's not – in terms of the overall scope and
projections of the company, if you were to change auto frequency by half a point, it would have a bigger impact than
this would. So you're right, but I would just say as it relates to Allstate Financial, we're approaching it as a do-it-smart,
do-it-when-you-can, and so, don't look for sort of a simple, easy solution where it all goes – you just change it all – and
you got to kind of do it by line. So Don's got the annuity business broken into a whole bunch of different segments.
Some he cares more about than others. And those that are the biggest in the hole, he's working harder on than those that
are earning a positive or above-cost-of-capital return. So it's highly segmented, this strategy.
<Q - Randy Binner>: All right. That's helpful. Thanks.
Thomas J. Wilson
Let me close and just say, first, thank you. We had a good quarter. We're on track for all of our four priorities. Those of
you who are still in the queue, Bob is available today, working all day. So feel free to reach out, or he'll reach out to
you. And as it relates to Sandy, we're working hard to do what our customers pay us for. We'll provide additional
perspective on loss estimates when we can give you a more informed perspective. So thank you very much, and we'll
talk you to next quarter.
