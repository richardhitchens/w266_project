Robert A. Niblock
Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. We delivered second quarter comparable sales growth of 4.5%,
driven by improved transaction growth of 0.9% and a 3.6% increase in average ticket. We're pleased with our improved
top line performance versus Q1 and the acceleration of our comp growth through the quarter as we built momentum
with successful holiday events and enhanced messaging, driving traffic improvement to end the quarter with comp
sales of 7.9% in July.
Our U.S. home improvement comp was 4.6%, with broad-based project demand across private categories and
geographies. We achieved positive comps in 13 of 14 regions and in all product categories. Appliances led product
category growth with high-single digit comps, leveraging our investments in customer experience both in-store and
online.
We achieved strong comps in lawn and garden as we capitalized on seasonal demand. We also continued to advance
our pro business, driving outperformance in rough plumbing and electrical and lumber and building materials.
While we're pleased with our sequential comp growth through the quarter, we are disappointed with some aspects of
our performance during the first half of the year. In the first quarter, we identified an opportunity to drive more traffic
with improved messaging and an optimized promotional strategy. We amplified our marketing messages in early June,
and we're pleased with our traffic growth.
However, in the second quarter, comp growth was constrained as a result of disruption caused by changes to our store
staffing model earlier in the year, which became more apparent with increased traffic.
While we remain confident that the leadership model is right for our long-term growth, change brings certain
short-term challenges. I'm proud of the way our teams are responding diligently to respond to these challenges, filling
open positions, learning new roles and adapting to the new model. But we also recognize an opportunity to invest in
incremental customer-facing hours to ensure that we're providing an excellent customer experience in light of increased
traffic. We're taking these decisive actions to ensure our results meet our expectations going forward.
We continue to advance our omni-channel strategy, driving 43% comp growth on lowes.com this quarter. A year ago,
we upgraded our online shopping experience to make it easier for customers to find the products and information
they're looking for. In fact, Internet Retailer recognized us with an Excellence Award for Web Redesign of the Year.
We will continue to make omni-channel investments to ensure we're supporting customer needs and seamlessly
connecting with them whenever, wherever and however they choose.
During the quarter, we made further progress to enhance our product and service offering for the pro customer,
delivering another quarter of comps above the company average. In addition to Central Wholesalers last year, we
further expanded our pro customer reach and share of wallet with the acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters.
These acquisitions are a significant step forward in our strategy to deepen and broaden our relationship with new and
existing pro customers, enabling us to better serve the multi-family housing industry through expanded products and
services.
Internationally, we delivered solid mid-single digit comp growth in both Canada and Mexico. We continue to make
great progress with our RONA integration, including the conversion of our first RONA big-box store to a
Lowe's-branded store, where we're combining the best of Lowe's store experience, merchandising and brands with the
best elements of RONA's strong pro offerings to create a new, stronger Lowe's for the Canadian market.
And we remained excited about the successful execution of our e-commerce strategy, improved operating efficiencies
and the further rollout of appliances across our national footprint in Canada. We continue to unlock the full value of the
acquisition, which will culminate in over $1 billion of realized revenue and cost opportunities.
For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.68. These results included a $96 million gain from the sale of our
interest in the Australian joint venture. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.57, a 15% increase over last year's adjusted
earnings per share. Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased

$1.25 billion of stocks under our share repurchase program and paid $299 million in dividends.
Turning to the economic landscape for the second half of the year, the home improvement industry should continue to
see solid gains as consumer health remain strong and economic fundamentals continue to support solid spending
growth. Persisting job and income gains should continue to drive disposable income growth. And favorable revolving
credit usage continues to hover near the highest rates of the current economic expansion, supplementing the spending
power generated by stronger incomes.
The outlook for housing remains bright as household formation in the first half of the year is encouraging and expected
to continue amid steady job gains. Home price appreciation should persist as housing demand continues to outpace
supply and mortgage rates, drifting lower from their post-election levels, should support home affordability in the near
term.
Our second quarter consumer sentiment survey underscored similar favorable trends. Consumers continue to have a
favorable view of the national economy and their personal financial situation. Over half of consumers believe their
home value is increasing and have strong expectations for continued appreciation, resulting in strength in home
improvement project intentions.
Looking ahead, we're focused on further strengthening our operating discipline and investing in capabilities that
maximize value for customers and shareholders. We will continue to leverage our new store leadership model and
make necessary investments to customer-facing hours to further improve the customer experience. We will also
enhance our marketing efforts and leverage promotions in key areas to drive sales in what we believe is a supportive
macroeconomic backdrop for home improvement. We're confident that these investments position us for future success.
We will also continue to capitalize on our strengths in capturing project demand in the marketplace and further invest
in specific actions required to better serve the needs of pro, DIY, and DIFM customers. We've seen positive customer
response to our evolving omni-channel capabilities, continuing to meet customers at every critical moment, whether
they choose to connect in the store, online, in their home, from their job site, or through Lowe's contact centers.
Importantly, I would like to thank our more than 290,000 employees for their passion and commitment to serving
customers. Before I close, I want to stress that we are taking decisive action. The team is focused on executing the
plans we have in place to capitalize on our strong position in the market.
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick D. Damron
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. As Robert shared with you, we saw significant improvement in our Q2
comp sales, as we drove increased traffic to our stores and lowes.com. We successfully leveraged holiday events
designed to take advantage of spring and summer project demand with amplified marketing messages, compelling
offers, and an integrated omni-channel experience.
In fact, we built momentum as we moved through the quarter, reflected in our significant traffic improvement in June
and July. Value perception was a thing we discussed in Q1, and I'm pleased to say that we made great strides this
quarter. We took a surgical approach to selecting the right products and price points to message in the right media
channels, successfully highlighting Lowe's everyday competitive pricing.
In the second quarter, we achieved positive comps in 13 of 14 regions and posted positive comps in all product
categories. We delivered a 4.5% comp with balanced performance in both indoor and outdoor categories. As we
capitalize on a supportive macroeconomic backdrop and customers' continued desire to invest in their homes with our
project inspiration and expertise, events, and targeted promotions, we drove above-average comps in categories, such
as appliances, lawn and garden, lumber and building materials, and rough plumbing and electrical.
We drove high single-digit comps in appliances, leveraging our investments in customer experience both in-store and
online. We know that an omni-channel experience is critical for appliance customers as they gather information to give

them confidence in their selection.
In-store, we have invested in a best-in-class experience with an extensive product showroom and a broad selection of
leading brands as well as expert associates who can provide valuable advice and appliance suites which allow
customers to visualize how their appliance purchase will look in their refreshed or remodeled kitchen.
And online, we have continued to invest to enhance the customer experience with improved product search, integrated
and upgraded product videos, enhanced presentations like 360° views, extended descriptions of specifications, and
simplified groupings to make it easy for customers to fully research our extensive appliance options and make their
selection with confidence.
Our omni-channel customer experience, together with leading brands, breadth of assortment, competitive pricing,
knowledgeable sales specialists, as well service advantages of same- or next-day delivery, haul away, and facilitation of
repairs and maintenance continues to drive our performance in appliances.
We capitalized on seasonal demand, driving above-average comps in lawn and garden with particular strength in live
goods and lawn care, as well as double-digit comps in patio. Once again, we saw continued strength from the pro
customer with comps above the company average. Pro demand drove solid comps in rough plumbing and electrical as
we captured pro sales by improving our assortment with destination brands like SharkBite, the industry leader in
plumbing fittings.
We continue to be excited about the effectiveness of destination brands in attracting pro customers. This strength is
evidenced with the addition of A.O. Smith, the leading brand of residential water heaters which drove double digit
comps in the category. Pro demand drove strong comps in lumber and building materials.
In addition to our outstanding portfolio of brands, we're also deepening and broadening our relationship with the pro
customer across all categories with our strong value proposition through our 5 Ways to Save, as well as our
omni-channel offering through our growing pro services team, and LowesForPros.com.
We continue to evolve our capabilities to better connect with the pro across channels and make it simpler for them to
do business with Lowe's. We're seeing the pro engage in more – more in the channels that best fit their unique needs,
whether that's online with LowesForPros.com, at the market level with our Account Executive ProServices or AEPs, at
the store level with our dedicated team of specialists, or our growing national pro services team.
The addition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters complements our acquisition of Central Wholesalers last year and
further expands our capabilities to service multi-family property management customers throughout the country with
enhanced product and service offerings while strengthening our platform for future growth with this important
customer.
We continue to leverage targeted marketing as well as pro-exclusive offers to grow our share of wallet with existing
pros while also generating new business. We're also driving increased awareness of our enhanced buy-in-bulk program
with new signage in-store, messaging on LowesForPros.com, and marketing campaigns to showcase the great values
we provide for the pro.
We remain focused on leveraging our omni-channel capabilities to help DIY and DIFM customers throughout their
project journey. This quarter, we drove 43% comp growth on lowes.com driven by events, as well as continued strong
customer response to the investments we made to enhance our online shopping experience, such as optimized
functionality and display for touchscreen devices to support a better mobile experience, improved product and content
recommendations, refined search algorithms, improved click-to-chat capabilities, larger product images, optimized
assortments informed by digital line reviews, and expanded product views including video content.
We're also leveraging our MyLowes platform to drive brand loyalty. Our simplified military recognition program
allows active duty personnel and veterans to register through MyLowes and receive 10% off their purchases every day.
We're also offering free parcel shipping exclusively for MyLowes members.

Our interior and exterior project specialists are another critical element of our omni-channel strategy and a
differentiated capability in capturing and servicing project demand for the DIFM customer who needs a bit more help
navigating their project.
We're advancing our omni-channel experience, making it even easier for customers to engage with our in-home project
specialists and request services on lowes.com. And we're working to centralize our process for providing installation
quotes, allowing for greater efficiency and consistency. We're rolling out this capability in the flooring category over
the course of the year, with all U.S. markets online by Q1 2018.
As Robert discussed, comp growth improved sequentially through the quarter, but was constrained as a result of the
disruption caused by our changes to our store leadership model earlier in the year. Those changes streamlined
management to provide better leadership and accountability. Specifically, we reduced the number of assistant store
managers and eliminated the department manager role, and created the service and support managers in an effort to
increase stores' focus on training and empowering associates to deliver and improve customer experience.
We are confident that the leadership model is the right one for our long-term growth. To more fully capitalize on our
strong traffic trends and ensure we're delivering an excellent customer experience, we are investing in hours at the
customer service associate level. As we look forward to the second half of 2017, we are excited by our new floor tile
reset, which showcases leading style options, simplifies the shopping experience, and helps the customer visualize how
their new floor will look in their home.
We're also proud to announce the launch of Scott Living indoor furniture, with fully coordinated collections from Drew
and Jonathan Scott of HGTV's Property Brothers available on lowes.com. Our digital showroom features coordinated
looks and design tips, helping customers envision their newly decorated space. We will continue to focus on optimizing
our digital marketing efforts to deliver customized messaging and compelling content to the right customer at the right
time, driving improved engagement and increased sales. While we've already seen positive results from these efforts,
media optimization is an ongoing process.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Marshall.
Marshall A. Croom
Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter increased 6.8% to $19.5 billion, supported by
total customer transaction growth of 3.1% and average total ticket growth of 3.5% to $71.40.
RONA sales were approximately $1 billion, or 3% of sales growth. As a result of the calendar shift from the 53rd week
in fiscal 2016, this year's second quarter included one less week of spring and one more week of summer than last year.
While this had no impact on comp sales, it did decrease second quarter total sales growth by approximately $285
million, or 1.7%. Comps sales were 4.5% for the quarter, driven by an average ticket increase of 3.6% and improved
transaction growth of 0.9%.
RONA was included in the comp calculation for the first time in the month of July. Looking at the monthly comp
trends, comps grew 0.6% in May, 5.3% in June, and 7.9% in July. As Robert and Rick indicated, we were pleased with
our improved top-line performance versus Q1 and the acceleration of our comp growth through the quarter as we build
momentum with successful holiday events and enhanced messaging, driving traffic improvement in both June and July.
During the quarter, we continue to capitalize on market opportunity as we open four new stores in the U.S., which
drove 80 basis points of growth. Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.21% of sales, a decrease of 23 basis points
from the second quarter of last year. The decline was primarily the result of promotional activity and excessive benefits
from value improvement, and 10 basis points of inflation.
SG&A for the quarter was 20.16% of sales, which leveraged 101 basis points. In last year's second quarter, we recorded
an $84-million loss on the settlement of a foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of the RONA acquisition.
This provided 46 basis points of leverage this year. An additional 49 basis points of leverage was driven by a

$96-million gain from the sale of our interest in the Australian joint venture. Also, we drove 20 basis points of
favorable leverage primarily as a result of our new store leadership model. Somewhat offsetting these items was 10
basis points of deleverage in advertising as a result of our efforts to amplify our consumer messaging.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $357 million, which leveraged 20 basis points. Operating income
increased 98 basis points to 12.2% of sales. The comparison to the prior-year loss on the foreign currency hedge
possibly impacted operating income by 46 basis points. And the gain from the sale of our interest in the Australian joint
venture also possibly impacted operating income by 49 basis points. Interest expense for the quarter was $159 million,
which leveraged 10 basis points.
Effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.2%, compared to 38.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The
year-over-year change in our effective tax rate is primarily the result of the gain from the sale of our interest in the
Australian joint venture. The gain represents the proceeds in excess of book value, but did not result in tax expense in
the quarter due to a reduction of previously-established deferred tax valuation allowances.
Earnings per share on a GAAP basis was 1.68% (sic) [$1.68] for the quarter. The gain from the sale of our interest in
Australian joint venture increased EPS by approximately $0.11 for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.57,
a 14.6% increase over last year's adjusted earnings per share of $1.37.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion. Inventory, at $11.4
billion, increased $803 million or 7.6% versus the second quarter of last year. It was primarily driven by appliances that
support sales growth, as well as timing associated with seasonal builds. Inventory turnover was 4 times, an increase of
11 basis points over the second quarter of last year. Asset turnover increased 8 basis points to 1.86.
Accounts payable of $8.6 billion represented a $953 million increase or 12.4% over the second quarter of last year due
to the timing of purchases and terms improvement.
At the end of the second quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.21 times. Return on invested capital was 17%.
The net impact of the gain from the sale of our interest in Australian joint venture and prior-year charges negatively
impacted ROIC by 153 basis points.
Now, looking at the statement of cash flows. We generated strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $5.1
billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. As we allocate capital, we are focused on investments that align with our strategic
priorities: to expand our home improvement reach, develop capabilities to anticipate and support customer needs, and
generate profitable growth and substantial returns.
Our recent acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters demonstrates how we've made strategic investments to
further grow our pro business by expanding our ability to serve the multi-family housing industry. The transaction is
expected to be slightly accretive to earnings this year. After strategic investments, we look to return excess cash to
shareholders.
In the quarter, we paid $299 million in dividends. And in May, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share
repurchase agreement, which settled in the quarter for approximately 6.4 million shares. We also repurchased
approximately 9.4 million shares for $750 million through the open market. In total, we repurchased $1.2 billion of
stock in the quarter. We have approximately $2.6 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. First, as we've discussed,
we were pleased with the acceleration of our comp growth through the quarter, the result of our amplified marketing
messages, compelling offers and integrated omni-channel experience. The incremental investments we've made in these
areas are paying off, and we'll continue those investments into the second half of 2017.
Second, as Robert and Rick shared, we've also made the decision to reinvest in incremental customer-facing hours in
the second half. We believe this will allow us to more fully capitalize on our strong traffic trends and ensure we're
delivering an excellent customer experience.

Finally, we are seeing incremental pressure from a private label credit card program due to increase in program costs
driven by higher losses, as well as casualty claims due to increased workers compensation costs.
We still expect a total sales increase of approximately 5% driven by a number of factors. First, we are forecasting a
comp sales increase of approximately 3.5%. Second, the RONA acquisition drives about 2% growth. And also, we plan
to open 25 stores which represents approximately 1% sales growth.
Keep in mind, total sales growth will be reduced by roughly 1.5% related to the comparison of 52 weeks in 2017 versus
53 weeks in 2016. However, on a GAAP basis, we are now anticipating an operating margin increase of 80 basis points
to 100 basis points as a result of the investments and incremental expense pressures that I just described. Remember, a
full year of RONA results versus roughly seven months last year will pressure operating margin by an estimated 15
basis points to 20 basis points for 2017.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 36.9% this year. For the year, on a GAAP basis, we are now expecting earnings
per share of $4.20 to $4.30. Please refer to page 13 in our supplemental reference slides for a summary of adjustments
as you compare 2017 to 2016.
We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.9 billion and capital expenditures of
approximately $1.4 billion. This result in estimated free cash flow of approximately $4.5 billion for 2017. Our guidance
does assume approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2017.
Regina, we're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First just on the store labor hour investment, is
that full time or part time? Is that weekend, weekday? Help us a little bit more about what you're going to be adding
there.
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Sure, Pete. This is Rick. We are primarily focused on adding the incremental labor to the
weekend time frames, as well as high traffic area timelines during the week. The effort is to continue to retain our
seasonal labor from our spring hires, as those still have significant knowledge, and we're simply retaining those who
were historically we would be moving down from a stacking labor standpoint into the fall from the peaks of summer.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. That's helpful. And then I know back in the December meeting, kind of the three-year
plan that was laid out had some benchmarks, 25 basis points of flow through, around 50% OpEx growth as a
percentage of the sales growth. Obviously 2017 numbers aren't meeting those objectives. Curious, do we need to
rethink the longer-term outlook a little bit here? Maybe you assume a little bit more OpEx, a little less flow through? Is
that how we should be thinking about it? Just curious. Your thoughts here?
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: Yeah, Peter, this is Marshall. We are maintaining our targets that we previously
communicated back in December. Obviously, this year won't hit those targets, but productivity is still alive and well.
And it's actually helping us offset the incremental investments we're making this year.
And we know we've got more runway to go as we move forward, so the investments we're making from staffing, again,
we're leaning into it to take advantage of the increased traffic, leaning into optimized promotions and knowing that
we've got opportunities to utilize price optimization tools, continuing value improvement efforts and continuing to
evaluate promotional effectiveness.
So longer term, we've got other productivity measures for optimizing labor, leveraging fixed cost, reducing indirect
spend, lower depreciation and enhancing profitability in Canada.

<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Peter, this is Robert. As Marshall outlined, we're still holding to our three-year guidelines
that we gave last year, and productivity is still a key focus that we're working on. We've seen actually a lot of benefits
from our productivity efforts, as we've outlined.
Part of those is part of what Mike McDermott and his team did is amplifying and improving our marketing message,
particularly when we look at opportunities in the digital space. We saw great results from that, including the improved
traffic performance that we saw in the stores, and we think we've got a better opportunity to capitalize on that.
So what Rick and his team are doing is saying, let's hold the labor that we normally would've been pulling back on, see
if we can do a better job of capitalizing on that and see if we can drive incremental sales through the process. So that's
what we're doing. We're reinvesting some of the benefits of productivity into what we feel is a strong macro
environment, so.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. Make sense. Thanks so much, guys. Good luck.

<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Hey. This is Joshua Siber on for Simeon. On gross margins, what's going to enable you to
make numbers in the back half because it looks like gross is expected to be up? Just curious. Your thoughts there?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Yeah. This is Mike McDermott. Obviously, as we communicated at the end of the first
quarter, we needed to focus on improving our value perception and making sure we were amplifying our marketing
reach with our customers. We did that by leaning hard into changing our anchor points and communicating critical
values to customers. We're also continuing to improve our competitiveness both on in stock as well as special order
items, and that's putting some level of pressure on gross margin.
We've got optimization efforts in place, working closely with our vendors to make sure we're improving our, first, cost,
as well as pricing tactics making sure that from a head-core-tail perspective we're competitive on head items where
required, and we're working hard on pricing tail items to make sure we're harvesting profitability to offset that
investment. So we've got a lot of work underway at the merchandising team to balance the improvement of value
perception with our cost position.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Okay. And then the long-term EBIT margin guidance of 11.2%, it's a pretty substantial
expansion from what's expected to be in 2017. So how do investors gain confidence in that margin opportunity? And
do you think this happens in the back half or in 2018?
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: Again, just recognizing that those are three-year targets, so it won't be all accomplished in
2017. So it'll be baked into the productivity opportunities we have moving forward. Again, leveraging the traffic driver
with marketing optimization. Again, focusing on optimizing labor. As we move forward, that will continue to be an
ongoing discipline. So even with the reinvestment in back half of the year, we'll still leverage payroll in 2017.
And, again, let's talk about the other opportunities we have from a productivity standpoint to drive towards that 11.2%
EBIT growth, that target that we set. So, obviously, very excited with what we have in the pro space with the
Maintenance Supply Headquarters, an opportunity to grow and expand that footprint and leverage back into our
existing store base.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks, and good morning. So just curious how would you think about the shift of the
spring business in 2017 between the first quarter and the second quarter. And to play devil's advocate, we've heard
others such as Tractor Supply and Scotts talk about a very strong July. So what gives you the confidence that July's
strength is actually driven by your actions versus the weather working with you that month against the backdrop of
what's been a pretty tough year otherwise?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: This is Mike McDermott. I can lay some foundation there. Actually, it feels good as
we take a look at our July performance, it was very well-balanced across categories, and we certainly enjoyed positive
performance across all products and outside and inside, indoor categories. So it was not all isolated to just seasonal in
the June and July timeframe.
To that same message, we did enjoy an extended spring, which clearly our lawn and garden business did perform above
the average and the team took full advantage of those weather conditions to really highlight the quality of our products.
The merchants and the growers did a fantastic job on the quality of live goods, and we feel really good about our
performance of our private label Sta-Green fertilizer, seed and soil products. So innovation, as well as market demand
served us well.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: And can you talk about your view on share in pro and DIY. Obviously, you are stepping
up advertising dollars that sounds like dollars spent, not necessarily promotional level, and you're also stepping up the
commitment on the labor hours. So, is there something that you're seeing on the share side in either pro or DIY that is
causing you to step up these investments?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Yeah. We continue to see both macro environment opportunities, as well as
favorability in both the pro and DIY markets. Pro outcomes are average again this quarter, so we continue to feel good
about that. We see an opportunity to continue to expand our penetration in that category. Pro represents about 30% of
our sales and about 50% of the home improvement markets, so again a lot of the investments we're making and the
actions we're taking we think will yield fruit. From a DIY perspective, we saw nice advancements in our DIY product
categories, again, both interior and exterior, giving us positive momentum going into the back half.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks very much. Have a good back half.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Chris.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning. Two things. First of all, curious as you'd think about the investment that you've
outlined today. What do you expect or where do you expect the payback from that to show up? It's the first thing I'd be
curious.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, Eric. I'll start. As we said, and you saw it from the comp trajectory in the quarter,
May was not what we had anticipated by the time we got through the month and the Memorial Day performance. Our
incremental investments in marketing and the enhanced focus on digital had not been fully kicked in by then. As we
saw that kick in and we saw the incremental traffic that we're driving into the stores, we were very pleased obviously
with the trajectory through the quarter. But recognize that we probably had an opportunity to have provided better
customer experience and even better capitalize on the trend.
So our belief is that we held onto these labor hours that we've got, people that are trained in the stores that Rick and his
team have trained. As we get into the fall, we'll continue to monitor that, as Mike and his team work to even further
optimize our marketing message. And we hope to see that translate into better experience, continue to drive better
in-store experience and better sales trajectory.

We've put a lot of effort into our online experience here over the past year or so as highlighted with the 43% growth in
the quarter. We think there's an opportunity to improve our in-store experience as we head into the fall of the year, and
we hope then that that resonates into capturing additional sales from the traffic that the marketing team is driving into
our stores.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: So does that – as you look at – you affirmed the full year comp guidance of 3.5%. Does this
investment – should we believe or expect that this could create upside to that sales guidance if you get payback from
this, or is this more defensive of defending your ability to just get to that original target?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, I think – yeah, we're still early in the process. Obviously we're excited about the
trends that we're seeing. But we're investing because, one, first of all – first and foremost to deliver our guidance for the
year because we've been slightly short of that for the first half of the year, so it's to make up the shortfall. And to the
extent that we execute well, hopefully some upside to those numbers. But we'll not bake that in, so.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: And then secondly, in terms of the point of emphasis, I guess I came into the year hearing the
productivity focus, the 11.2% margin target and seeing you making decisions that seemed more of profitability. Now it
sounds like there's a little bit of a shift to balance more of driving sales and sales growth. Even Marshall's comments to
– the comments regarding price optimization and even labor optimization while labor's being invested here. Is I guess
the central goal, Robert, or is the focus improving the sales growth or is the focus improving profitability?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: I think it's both. So as I've indicated, Eric, we've had actually great success from our
productivity efforts. We've still got lot more work to do there. But we've said all along that productivity is not just
about cutting costs; it's also investing back into areas that matter most to the customer.
And we think, as we said, we knew we had an opportunity to improve our marketing as we've had new tools and we've
continued to better optimize that. The team's working to get better leverage out of our marketing spend. We saw an
opportunity there. We're pleased with, like I said, the online performance, the traffic we're driving into our stores. And
we think there's an opportunity to even capitalize further on that. So it's partially using that productivity savings to
invest in a better experience and capture share in what we think is a robust marketplace. And with that, then we think it
allows us to achieve those three-year targets that we laid out.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Eric.

Your next question comes from the line of Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alan Rifkin>: Thank you very much. Robert, you said that the second quarter comps were disrupted by the store
staffing that you'd outlined. Yet, can we infer from the sharp acceleration in your July comp that you think those issues
are largely behind you? And if so, why then is your comp and revenue guidance for the back half of the year not been
lifted? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: I'll start, and then ask others to jump in, Alan. But certainly, as we indicated, we do think
there was some disruptions from the model. The further we get away from the change, obviously people are getting
settled into their new roles. And we've talked about some of the attrition with some of the prior department managers,
and then their pushing in into permanent roles has actually gone faster than we had originally budgeted. So we knew
there was some disruption. But the further we move away from the change, people are getting settled into their new
roles. I'm pleased with the way the team is responding.
As we indicated, we're a little bit behind of where we anticipated when we laid out our guidance for the year, thus the
revisions in guidance. But more than anything, the work that we've done, as I've said, from a marketing standpoint to
sharpen our messages and the enhanced efforts, we're seeing a great performance online and we're also seeing better
traffic trends coming into our stores. So we're using that as an opportunity.

If you think about the changes that we've made from a management standpoint of getting the right management
structure in the store, it allows us to put more associate customer-facing hours on the floor of the store to take
advantage of that opportunity. So we think that's going to drive additional sales, but we don't want to get ahead of
ourselves from a guidance standpoint.
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Alan, I would say that we're making investments, as Robert said, to capitalize on our traffic
growth and better leverage the long-term benefits of the model that we have in place. The reality is our omni-channel
environment today requires us to continually evaluate how we're meeting the needs of our customers, and that will
continually drive change both in how we meet those needs. It requires us to be perpetually learning, training, ideating
and getting better every single day, and I think those changes are beginning to pay off and it shows in our June and July
performance.
Our teams remained extremely focused on serving the customer. Their dedication to serving the customer is second to
none, and I'm extremely proud of what they've done and how they've led through that change throughout the year. And
we'll continue to make sure that we support them with the resources and the training and the tools they need to be able
to meet the needs of our customers every day in this environment.
<Q - Alan Rifkin>: Okay. Thank you. And then a follow-up, if I may. With respect to appliances, you guys continue to
put up terrific comps with high-single digit gains in this quarter. Obviously, with the recent news about Sears and
Amazon, are there any changes contemplated in terms of marketing within this category? Thanks.
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Alan, this is Mike McDermott. Well, certainly we don't take our number one position
on appliances or our continued growth in market share in the category for granted. We've made significant investments
over time to be the number one player. And our customers continue to tell us that a focus on omni-channel engagement
and experience is what they expect and what they desire.
So we're very, very focused on continuing our leadership from selection, through enjoyment, through the service
proposition, all the way through to retirement and making sure that our displays, our well-trained associates, our
expansive brand and innovation portfolio continue to make a difference.
And on the second quarter, we grew at three times the market in the appliance business. The operations team added
inventory to make sure we could take advantage of the opportunity. Rick and his team increased staffing. We added
delivery drivers and we continue to take advantage of the market by providing great experiences.
So from a marketing perspective, we're going to continue to lean into the category as we have and make sure that
digitally we've got great content online, fantastic navigation. And obviously we're going to maintain our competitive
posture from a pricing perspective. So I feel good about the appliance business. Feel good about continuing to grow our
number one position.
<Q - Alan Rifkin>: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is around conversion. I know you guys have
been able to track conversion pretty well historically. If you could give us a sense of what the trends have been like
lately, that would be helpful in framing some of the changes you're making?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Yeah. Glad to. As we look and we talked about the increased traffic that our marketing efforts
were driving into the stores, we saw an opportunity to continue to improve our conversion. Conversion is something
that, quite frankly, we always want more of. No matter where we are, we always want more. And our store operators
are working extensively in making sure that our people in the stores and our associates in the store, the time they're
there, the customers are there, that we're merchandised correctly and that we're executing the fundamental basics of the

business inside the box.
I'm extremely pleased with the progress they're making and the efforts they're taking. And we see that as an
opportunity, thus the investment in labor into the back half of the year to ensure that we continue to make sure that we
meet the needs of the customers when they come in. So we feel good with where we are. We still know there's
opportunity for us to continue to get better, and we're making the investments necessary for us to be able to do that with
the teams.
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: The other thing I'd add to that from a dot com perspective, we saw balance
improvement and strength actually in traffic, conversion and ticket across all product categories. So, as it relates to the
omni-channel experience, we really look at conversion both in-store and online, and to Rick's point, so we'll continue to
invest there to make sure it improves.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: That's helpful. And just to understand, for the back half of the year, the primary improvement
in sales trends that you're expecting is coming from conversion as opposed to improvements in traffic, right?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Well, actually would anticipate a more balanced view of transactions and tickets as we move
into the back half of the year versus the first half.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to just clarify on the updated EPS guidance for the year. So
there's no change in sales. Is the change just SG&A, or did you, guys, lower the gross margin expectation also? I think
at one point you were expecting it to be flat for the year.
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: Yes. As we updated in our guidance, we're expecting about 10 more basis points of
incremental gross margin pressure driven by some of the actions that we're taking leaning into the amped-up, amplified
marketing that we are doing that's helping drive that traffic. So that's putting pressure on the gross margin line for the
year. So, it actually went from about 20 basis points of drag to about 30 basis points, if you think about that from the
year's standpoint.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Okay. Understood. And then so as a follow up on the pricing strategy, it feels like the
discussion around promotional activity, value perception, even marketing has escalated quite a bit over the last few
quarters. Can you help us understand that trend a little bit better? What is causing that? What are you seeing in the
marketplace perhaps? And how should we think about that in the context of what's been a pretty stable EDLP type of
strategy in the space over time? Thanks.
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Yeah. This is Mike McDermott again. We certainly saw an opportunity in the first
quarter to get more competitive as it relates to our promotional strategy, specifically around holidays. So, obviously,
that was seen in our value-perception metrics. We leaned in there, we matched the competitive intensity of the
marketplace in some of the select categories where we saw some expansion of aggressiveness.
But for the most part, as we go into the back half of the year, our focus is really exposing the values that we already had
in our plan. So some of that's going to be – some of that margin pressure is going to be mix-oriented, but we feel good
about our position. We got to focus on optimization to make sure that we're making the right investments, but a big
focus on the macro environment strength and our ability to jump in and take advantage of that.

<Q - Michael Baker>: Thanks. I just want to clarify a little bit this quarter what happened as you said you're below
plan year-to-date. And it seems like the sales are on plan; correct me if I'm wrong. So is it that the gross margins were
below plan year-to-date, or expenses are above plan year-to-date? And if it's the expenses what I'm trying to reconcile,
it sounds like you didn't have enough labor earlier in the quarter, I suppose, in May, to drive sales. So I'm just trying to
figure out how expenses overran. Is it really just because you ramped up so much in June and July?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Mike, this is Robert. We started off – in Q1, we indicated that we were behind. We missed
our sales plan. We thought we'd make it up over the next couple of quarters, so we're still in the process of working
towards that. As we've said, we did as we talked about in the first quarter call, I and Mike had indicated we had an
opportunity to, one, enhance our marketing message, things like making sure we're highlighting the price points to
lower end of the – the price points at the appropriate time.
As well as we also saw opportunity to invest more in digital and that's part of what drove our online performance. We
had great payroll leverage in the second quarter. We think there's an opportunity to invest a part of that to capitalize on
the traffic that the marketing team is driving in. And then, from a SG&A standpoint, I'll let Marshall talk about it, he
talked about some of the onetime drivers and some of the most specific things that were above what we had planned in
the quarter and through the back half of the year, so.
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: Yes. While we leveraged retail operating hours, we did have the incremental advertising
spend along with a couple of other items I alluded to, some of the pressure we'll see in the back half with the casualty
claims, workers comp claims and costs there. We saw a little bit of that in the second quarter. And also, we've sort of
been competitive in the marketplace from an appliance standpoint, put a pressure on delivering fleet, but the bigger
drivers are in the back half or leaning into the marketing message to reinvest in that, and to try to capture more of the
sales that we're seeing coming through to offset some of those back-half pressures.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay. Makes sense. As a follow up, you did slightly lower your store count outlook for the
year. What's behind that, and how does that play into the guidance?
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: So we came in with a plan I think of roughly 35 stores. We've since gone through and
scrubbed and evaluated certain locations and some of them we decided not to open at this time or we'll defer until a
later point in time.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, we have an approximate number, Mike. We had a couple that have slid into 2018.
We've had a couple of sites that we chose not to move forward with, so we thought we'll go ahead and update the
guidance on that. So but didn't make any change to our sales guidance.
<Q - Michael Baker>: So are those big box stores, Canada, Orchard Supply? Just curious which ones are sliding.
<A - Richard D. Maltsbarger>: So this is Richard. It was a relative mix primarily within the Canadian market and our
Orchard operation is where we decided to either postpone and/or observe some of the changes that we're making before
we proceed. Or as Robert said, we have taken a few sites where we've made different decisions and we approved those
estimated last fall.

<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, flooring continues to be an important category for us. We were certainly positive in
the category, actually we posted very strong performance in carpet, vinyl and laminate flooring, but saw some
opportunity in floor tile as well as hardwood. We're in the middle of a significant reset in the floor tile category. It's
obviously becoming more and more important as customers lean in to the new and innovative styles.
But we have felt disruption as we ramp down our existing assortment. That reset should be complete by the end of the
month, and we anticipate to be back on a growth trajectory above the average on the other side of that reset.
<Q - Michael Goldsmith>: That's helpful. And then with regards to incremental labor being put into stores, is this
broad-based or is it focused on specific categories?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: We're looking at it from a perspective of analyzing the data as we look at our marketing plans
as we move into the second half of the year. We're investing those hours against those categories where we're putting
the additional weight from the marketing investments that we're making. So it will be more – most of it will be spent
into those categories.

Our final question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Good morning, and thanks a lot for squeezing me in. My first question relates to
juxtaposing the recent results and the guide for this year against your reiterated long-term guidance.
So your productivity initiatives have been underway for a period of time. The profit growth and the margin trajectory
that you're generating in absolute terms are quite solid. Is it possible that looking for the kind of incremental margins
that the guide, the long-term guide calls for is ambitious in an environment where you need to invest? In omni-channel,
you're facing wage pressure. Not many retailers are putting up operating leverage just as we think about the appropriate
forecasting context for 2018 and beyond.
<A - Marshall A. Croom>: Just thinking, Matt – it's Marshall – at this point in time, we're comfortable with
reconfirming the guidance as we lean into the back half with some of these incremental investments. Again, we have a
better line of sight to not only productivity efforts that we're driving this year, but in 2018 and 2019 above and beyond
that, and also looking at what we're leveraging from 2017 into 2018 and 2019 from the capability builds, how we're
leveraging the pro, continuing to take a look at our comp and staffing complement and how we're trying to match labor
to traffic that we're seeing. And fixed costs, indirect spend, I mentioned earlier.
So again, at this time, we're comfortable with those longer-term targets and the productivity at this point in time. If we
have a better line of sight to revise that, we'll provide that on an upcoming call.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks for that. And then – oh, sorry.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: And, Matt, this is Robert. I would just say also keep in mind that we've made quite a few
changes this year both with our store labor model. That will settle in overtime as people settle into their new roles. The
incremental, what we're doing from a marketing standpoint as we continue to refine and get better at that. So I think
there's opportunity for additional leverage against those things as we settle into the new cadence there.
And then keep in mind that Marshall took you through some one-time items, the IBNR and other stuff that he talked
about and credit losses that we think will moderate. Those things don't necessarily repeat as we get into the next two
years of that three-year guidance.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks for that, Robert. And then by way of my follow-up, just a couple cleanup items on
