Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Good afternoon to those on the call, and welcome. The TNT Express cyberattack and Hurricane
Harvey posed significant challenges to our operations in the first quarter. I'd like to thank the FedEx team for its
extraordinary support of humanitarian relief efforts and our teams' commitment to the Purple Promise, which simply
states I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.
I strongly believe FedEx will emerge from the cyberattack as an even stronger, more resourceful company. And I'd like
to thank the thousands of FedEx team members who worked tirelessly to remediate the TNT system's problems and
take care of our customers.
We're confident of our prospects for long-term profitable growth, and we reaffirm our commitment to improve
operating income at FedEx Express segment by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017. Our
overall goals remain to increase earnings, cash flows, returns, and margins.
I'd like to make two points about expected FY 2018 performance. Absent the cyber terrorist attack on TNT Express,
our annual guidance likely would've remained unchanged. And, second, FedEx Ground operating profit is anticipated
to exceed FY 2017's. We appreciate those who e-mailed questions prior to the call, and we'll cover as many strategic
topics as possible based on this input.
Alan, Rob and Dave, respectively, will address the effects of the cyberattack in greater detail. Raj will discuss the
economy, pricing, and the upcoming peak season. Alan will then come back on and conclude with prepared comments
with a deeper look at the first quarter FY 2018 guidance and other financial and operating results.
Let me note that today is the last earnings call for Chris Richards, our EVP, General Counsel and Secretary, who will
be retiring at month's end. We'll miss her untiring work ethic and in-depth knowledge that helped make her a 33 years
of service to FedEx invaluable. Thank you, Chris. Mark Allen, Senior Vice President, Legal and International General
Counsel at FedEx Express will succeed Chris, as previously announced.
Alan?
Alan B. Graf Jr.
Thanks, Fred. Good afternoon, everyone. On June 27, our TNT Express global operations was one of many global
companies to be hit by a new strain of malware. Rob will cover the specifics of the attack and recovery next, but the
attack resulted in a significant business interruption and financial impact. As a reminder, effective June 1, 2017, we
moved to one reporting segment for our FedEx Express and TNT Express businesses, the FedEx Express segment.
We estimate the cyberattack reduced FedEx Express first quarter operating income by approximately $300 million or
$0.79 per diluted share. The net impact of the cyberattack on Q1 operating income was predominantly lost revenue,
much of which dropped to the bottom line due to the fixed cost nature of the TNT network. Also, we incurred
incremental third party costs related to the recovery effort.
Reduced international earnings from the cyberattack also increased our effective tax rate for the quarter. Based on all
these factors, we analytically determined the net impact on operating income to be approximately $300 million.
Because the net impact was primarily related to revenue transactions that did not occur, the financial effects of the
cyberattack are reflected in our adjusted earnings.
Because our intra-European domestic businesses recovered more quickly, the impact from lost revenues was and
continues to be more heavily weighted towards our higher-yielding international shipments, resulting in a more
pronounced impact on profits. It is taking longer to restore our international business due to the complexity of clearance
systems and business processes. We are now focused on finalizing the restoration of certain key customer-specific
specialized solutions and systems in time for the peak season.

Incremental expenses were associated with IT infrastructure enhancements, additional staffing and overtime to recover
volumes, and additional provisions for service failures. These expenses were partially offset by lower purchased
transportation expenses due to lower volumes.
While significant progress has been made on restoration of our operations and IT systems, TNT revenues, volumes and
profits remain below pre-attack levels. As we look ahead to the remainder of FY 2018, we expect to experience
ongoing, but diminishing financial impacts from the cyberattack in the form of lower revenues and higher investments
to further improve and strengthen our IT infrastructure.
The expected ongoing impacts from the cyberattack are reflected in our updated guidance for FY 2018. Despite the
significance of the impact of the cyberattack on our results, we reaffirm our commitment to improve operating income
at the FedEx Express segment by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in FY 2020 compared to FY 2017.
With that, I will turn it over to Rob and rejoin later in the call to discuss our quarterly results in detail and our fiscal
2018 guidance.
Rob?
Robert B. Carter
Thanks, Alan. The TNT systems were impacted by a new strain of malware that attacked a vulnerability in Microsoft
Windows. Like the attack experienced by many other global companies, the attack on the TNT systems originated in
Ukraine from specific tax preparation software.
This was not an ordinary cyberattack. We believe that this attack was the result of a nation-state targeting Ukraine and
companies that do business there. It is widely believed that these were weaponized cyber tools that were stolen from the
U.S. government. Of note, the attack was completely contained to TNT and did not impact any FedEx systems or those
of our customers. In addition, all of our customers can be assured that there was no loss of customer data to third
parties.
From the onset, our global IT teams have been working tirelessly to rebuild the TNT technical environment to be more
resilient. As a result, the TNT security posture is much improved. Leveraging every available resource, we've restored
the TNT systems to a near-normal state with virtually all critical systems up and available. We are now focused on the
restoration of certain key customer-specific solutions and systems. We expect these IT capabilities to be restored by the
end of September, enabling business-as-usual operations with full capabilities across all customer segments.
At the time of the attack, there was already work underway to replace TNT legacy systems with FedEx technology. In
the wake of the attack, these efforts have been accelerated. We've hardened all of TNT's servers and workstations,
introduced additional network security controls, rebuilt active directory, and have started enhancing the segmentation
of the TNT network.
We operate integrated transportation networks that are dependent on our global IT systems to operate efficiently. The
recovery and restoration of TNT Express' global operations and IT systems has included every facility, hub and depot.
Many systems that were not impacted by the virus were also fortified and rebuilt to ensure additional focus on security.
Our diligent and purposeful approach across a global network reaching more than 200 countries has added time to the
recovery.
Our business, operational and IT teams are converting adversity into advantage by revisiting our integration strategy.
Integration efforts will be expedited. This will enable us to reduce dependency on TNT legacy systems and will also
broaden services and capabilities through our powerful combined networks.
Based on the accelerated integration schedule, as well as the introduction of newer, more secure technology, there may
be an increase in integration spending on technology. We continue to refine our integration plans and, as a result, the
timing and amount of integration expenses and capital investments in any future period may change as we implement

our plans.
I want to extend my deepest gratitude to the IT teams that have worked around the clock to restore the TNT systems
and make them more secure in the process. I also want to thank my business partners who've worked side-by-side with
IT teams to get the business up and running again. And, most importantly, I want to thank our customers for their trust
and confidence. We are using the crisis to emerge stronger than ever.
Now, Dave will add his perspectives.
David J. Bronczek
Okay. Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Given the discussion around the impact of the cyberattack on
TNT, I thought it very important to point out the underlying fundamentals of the FedEx Express business remain very
strong. In particular, International Export Package revenue for the segment grew 4% in the quarter after absorbing the
impact of the cyberattack. And we have made significant progress on the recovery of the TNT business and IT systems.
Immediately following the attack, we implemented contingency plans that leveraged our global networks to minimize
the impact to customers, including transporting TNT Express packages within the FedEx Express network.
Key assets in the recovery have been the FedEx air network and the TNT European road network, which have allowed
us to retain a significant portion of our TNT customer base. These networks are the cornerstones for growing our
business and will be leveraged as we return our volumes to expected levels.
I'm very pleased to announce that our core shipping services are back in place with all TNT Express depots, hubs and
operating facilities. These milestones would not have been possible without the exceptional teams that have been
working on them. I like to thank all of our team members around the world for their amazing resilience, extraordinary
efforts, and dedication to restoring our operations in all of our systems.
Our operational teams remained focused on serving our customers and have made a critical decision in the first 24
hours after the attack, to keep our doors open for business despite being reduced to manual processes for pickup, sort
and delivery. Since then, we have returned to near-normal operations with the restoration of our pickup and delivery
systems, courier handheld technology, and intra-regional air networks.
In addition, we remain focused on our base business as we executed three key initiatives during the quarter that
enhanced our service capabilities. First, we launched a new 777 intercontinental flight, our around-the-world eastbound
flight. Next, the 757 service new flight from Stansted, England, to Geneva, Switzerland. And probably, most
importantly, we accelerated the completion of key upgrades of our Liège hub in Belgium.
From a customer perspective, our teams are executing a detailed, thorough, and customer-focused plan, targeting and
restoring customer volumes to our expected levels. This plan includes leveraging our senior officer team on sales calls
to instill confidence with customers so that we can fully meet their expectations.
Our service levels within Europe have been restored to pre-crisis levels. And in August, this past month of 2017, our
service levels were actually above those a year ago in August of 2016. Tremendous work by the operations team.
With strong service levels and operations returning to near-normal capabilities, our focus now shifts to finalizing the
restoration of certain key customer-specific solutions and their systems. We expect these IT capabilities to be restored
by the end of this month, enabling business-as-usual operations with full capabilities across all customer segments just
in time for peak shipping.
Our planning and execution work on the integration of FedEx Express and TNT continued in the first quarter despite
the cyberattack. Country integrations continued with executions launched in key markets around the world such as the
UK, China, and Poland. Recovery of the cyberattack required us to pursue solutions to stabilize the business and
leverage FedEx Express' capabilities.

These actions highlighted additional and expanded opportunities for accelerating our integration plans. Our initial plan
call out for the sequential integration of pickup and delivery networks followed by the integration of air and ground
networks. However, we instead are running these aspects of the integration now concurrently.
Additionally, we revised our integration plan targets and their opportunities in several key areas. Expansion and
acceleration of volume flows between the respective FedEx and TNT air and road networks by leveraging FedEx
network pickup and delivery technology. This expansion and acceleration allows us greater ability to move volume
through the lowest cost networks much faster. Next, accelerating migration of FedEx clearance operations and systems,
retiring dozens and dozens of legacy TNT applications.
Accelerating the combination of FedEx and TNT sales forces, coupled with faster migration of customers to FedEx
solutions, where the value proposition is aligned and rationalization of the product portfolio is sped up. And
accelerating rationalization of back office systems, including much more aggressive retirement of the TNT IT systems.
Certain high-cost systems and applications will not be restored.
These changes to our integration plan and the opportunities identified are not only expected to reduce risk, but also
accelerate the value; in certain cases, avoid high-cost solutions to knit legacy TNT and FedEx systems together.
Our updated integration plan further confirm that integration synergies will be realized through an optimized pickup
and delivery operation, the operation of one integrated global express network, improvement of the efficiency of staff
functions and, of course, through revenue growth. We continue to be extremely confident in the long-term value of this
acquisition for our shareholders, for our customers and, of course, for our team members.
So as a result of this crisis, we have emerged stronger. We remain laser-focused on delivering the Purple Promise to our
customers. The IT environment at TNT Express is more secure. And with operational capabilities near-normal and
service at pre-crisis levels, we are now positioned to meet the needs of our customers in advance of the upcoming peak
shipping season.
So, in conclusion, let me take a moment to commend our team members who provided outstanding service and
delivered a desperately needed relief during the recent hurricane in Texas, Florida, and the Caribbean.
FedEx has a robust contingency planning and disaster recovery capabilities. We have a philosophy of focusing on our
people first, ensuring our team and their families are safe. Not only is this the right thing to do, but it allows us to
resume operations and quickly assist communities and their recovery efforts.
Through preparedness and leveraging the power of our network, FedEx was able to position relief supplies and
equipment in Texas and Florida to immediately support recovery operations when the storm has passed. And the vast
majority of our network in Texas and Florida was back, up and operational within 24 hours of the storm's end.
Our FedEx team flew a relief mission to Miami just this past Friday that included $11 million of relief: generators,
water, medical supplies, and food. These are moments when the best of FedEx is on full display. And I commend our
team members that have done a great job in Texas, Florida and the Caribbean and, in fact, all around the world over the
last several weeks.
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Raj.
Rajesh Subramaniam
Thank you, Dave. I'd open with our economic update and outlook, discuss our revenue performance, and the business
conditions in each segment, and provide some commentary on broader industry trends and enhancements to the FedEx
portfolio.
As you can see on the slide, we continue to see moderate growth in the global economy. Our CY 2017 U.S. forecast is
mostly unchanged and reflects solid consumer spending and a rebound in industrial activity. Internationally, recovery
in capital spending is supporting higher global GDP growth and driving the best trade volume growth since 2011.

The next few slides show details of revenue, volume and yield performance by transportation segment. I'll just cover
some additional information in my remarks. Suffice it to say, we remain focused on pricing strategies that allow us to
grow volumes and increase yields across the portfolio.
For our U.S. Domestic Express business, yield per package excluding fuel surcharge increased 4% in the first quarter
due to our continued focus on revenue quality. Our international yields now include TNT and we have restated
numbers for the prior year to reflect this as well.
FedEx International Export Package revenue increased 4% year-over-year in Q1 despite being negatively impacted by
the cyberattack at TNT. We are seeing the best year for global trade in years. Excluding fuel and exchange rate impact,
yields were up slightly. The Ground volume and yields also grew as e-commerce continues to drive volume growth.
Excluding fuel, yield per package increased 4% driven by commercial services.
In FedEx Freight, revenue per LTL shipment increased 5% driven by our revenue quality efforts. Excluding the impact
of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per LTL shipment was up 4%.
Yesterday, we announced our intention to increase rates by 4.9% for Express, Ground and Freight in January. We'll
also implement other changes, including dimensional weight pricing on FedEx SmartPost packages.
Now, let's talk about peak. The FedEx team, consisting of more than 400,000 dedicated team members, are busy
preparing for the peak holiday shipping season. We expect, once again, to see record volume through our global
network with multiple days more than doubling our average daily volume.
In order to deliver exceptional service during this busy time, FedEx is increasing hours for some employees. And we
expect more than 50,000 team members will be hired across the FedEx operating companies for peak. We've already
begun filling positions within our Express and Ground networks, and believe we are well-positioned to successfully
deliver the holidays once again.
This year, we took a surgical approach to the way we manage peak surcharges by focusing on two things: oversized
packages and pricing programs for the small number of large retail and e-tail customers that drive the surge in peak
deliveries. FedEx will not apply holiday season surcharges except for packages that are oversized, unauthorized or
require additional handling. The pricing programs for large customers are designed to provide incremental capacity
during peak, while including some protection for FedEx if they come in below volume projections.
By focusing on these two areas and applying the peak oversized package surcharge during the entire peak season, we
expect to capture incremental revenue. And our approach appropriately aligns revenue with our incremental peak
investments without burdening our millions of loyal small business customers with a holiday delivery residential
surcharge. We are beginning a national marketing and sales campaign to ensure customers are aware of our peak
pricing, and we expect profitable volume gain and brand loyalty benefits.
This season, consumers will also see a dramatic increase in access to FedEx pickup and drop-off services as a result of
the significant growth in FedEx on-site across the country, including nearly 8,000 newly added Walgreens locations. At
online shopping stores, especially during the holiday season, we are pleased to work with Walgreens to offer this
convenient solution to our customers and are excited to work together to reach the significant milestone by October 31.
We believe we are well-positioned for another successful peak season, and look forward to helping the holidays arrive
once again for our customers around the world.
Let me now turn the call over to Alan for his remarks. Alan?

Thank you, Raj. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $2.51, compared to an adjusted $2.82 last year. The $2.51 reflects
the estimated negative impact of $0.79 from the TNT Express cyberattack and $0.02 from Hurricane Harvey.

Results benefited from higher base rates at each of our transportation segments. However, those benefits were more
than offset by reduced revenue and increased expenses resulting from the TNT Express cyberattack, TNT Express
integration expenses, higher costs at FedEx Ground, a higher tax rate, and the impact from Hurricane Harvey. Results
benefited from lower incentive compensation accruals.
Last quarter, we said we would recast the FY 2017 adjusted numbers to include the TNT intangible asset amortization
expense, that the prior year adjusted results would be comparable to our FY 2018 adjusted results. Therefore, the Q1
FY 2017 adjusted EPS of $2.82 now includes the TNT intangible asset amortization expense.
Express segment operating income declined due to the estimated $300 million impact of the cyberattack on TNT. Our
as-reported results included $88 million of integration expenses for TNT Express. Despite the significant challenges
this quarter, FedEx Express was able to improve base rates, grow international volume, and continue to manage costs.
Ground's operating income increased 3% due to the benefit from revenue growth and lower incentive compensation
accruals. Continued network expansion and staffing costs, higher purchased transportation expenses, and increased
self-insurance reserves drove the margin decline for the quarter.
As Fred already mentioned, we expect FedEx Ground's FY 2018 operating income and cash flows to exceed those of
FY 2017. FedEx Ground continues to grow significantly, and there are several key considerations that we focus on to
continually increase operating income as we grow. The first is customer mix. We've long recognized that FedEx
Ground does not yet have our fair share of small and medium customers despite our industry-leading speed advantage.
And we have recently accelerated our efforts to increase our small and medium customer volume.
Second is residential versus commercial mix. There are additional costs and significant operational considerations for
delivering residential packages. We had a significant increase in demand from two large e-commerce customers during
the first quarter.
Obviously, a shift in residential mix in any one quarter affects profitability. As you've seen in recent announcements,
we are focused on sending pricing strategies that ensure that we are compensated appropriately for the outstanding
service we provide, including generating appropriate yields for large customers with heavy residential mix.
Finally, given the traffic mix considerations I just outlined, we recognize that expenses are currently too high for the
mix of customers and residential packages that we've experienced. And we are taking steps to reduce costs in many
areas to align with current business mix and market conditions.
We are taking the steps necessary to continue to drive higher operating income and cash flows over the long-term,
increase capacity appropriately, and provide outstanding industry-leading service at FedEx Ground.
We also continue to build our network of convenient drop-off and pickup locations. This provides added delivery
options for our customers and creates opportunities to reduce residential delivery costs.
As Raj mentioned, one of the exciting things we are working on is significantly expanding the number of FedEx retail
locations, so that customers can conveniently access our services. We have 55,000 locations in our retail convenience
network, including 8,700 that offer customer package pickup and low-cost alternatives for residential deliveries.
This network includes: nearly 700 FedEx ship centers; close to 2,000 FedEx office locations, some of which are located
inside Wal-Mart Stores; nearly 6,000 FedEx on-site locations where customers can drop off and pick up packages such
as Walgreens, Kroger and Albertsons; 5,600 FedEx authorized ship centers which are third-party pack-and-ship stores;
1,500 Office Depot/OfficeMax locations; and approximately 40,000 drop boxes.
By the end of October, FedEx will be in nearly 8,000 Walgreens locations. The entire Walgreens chain nationwide will
offer FedEx pickup and drop-off services, all of which is new this calendar year and supports our e-commerce growth
strategy. In fact, by peak shipping season, 80% of the U.S. population will be within nine minutes of a FedEx Hold
location.

Now, turning to Freight, where results were outstanding. Freight's operating income increased 30%, primarily due to
the benefit from higher LTL revenue per shipment. Freight reported an operating margin of 10%, up an impressive 190
basis points. At Freight, we are modernizing our technology and focusing on revenue quality, which we believe will
continue to provide very good results.
Now, looking finally at FedEx guidance. We project adjusted earnings to be in the $12.00 to $12.80 per diluted share
range for FY 2018 before year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments, TNT Express integration
expenses, and certain first quarter FedEx trade networks legal charges, driven by continued improvement in base
pricing and volume growth. Absent the cyberattack on TNT, as Fred said and I would like to iterate, annual guidance
likely would have remained unchanged.
During the remainder of FY 2018, we will continue to execute our TNT integration plans. The integration process is
complex as it spans over (sic) 200 countries and involves combining our pickup and delivery operations at a local level,
our global and regional air and ground networks, and our extensive operations, customs clearance, sales and back office
information technology system.
The integration is expected to be completed by the end of FY 2020. We expect the aggregate integration program
expense, including the restructuring charges at TNT, over the four years to be approximately $800 million and expect
to incur approximately $350 million of these costs during FY 2018.
We do continue to refine our integration plans, however, particularly in light of the recent cyberattack at TNT Express.
As a result, the timing and amount of integration expenses and capital investments in any future period may change as
we implement our plans. The expectations for FY 2018 that I've outlined are dependent on fuel prices, the pace of
growth in the global economy, particularly in U.S. industrial production, and the recovery of lost volumes resulting
from the TNT Express cyberattack.
As mentioned on the call last quarter, our Q1 tax rate was higher than Q4's rate; and at 39.3%, it was also higher than
Q1 of last year. We are expecting our FY 2018 effective tax rate to be 35% to 36% on a GAAP basis, exclusive of any
mark-to-market adjustments. However, there is both risk and opportunity to this effective rate range, and the rate will
also vary from quarter to quarter as tax benefits and costs related to the TNT integration are recognized.
Our total capital expenditure forecast remains at $5.9 billion in FY 2018. Again, we reaffirm our commitment to
improve operating income at our FedEx Express segment by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in FY 2020 versus FY 2017.
Now, I will turn the call over to Fred to begin the question-and-answer session. I said 200 companies instead of
countries. We are in 200 countries. Thank you, Fred.
Q&A
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. We've got a number of questions. First one, back to Alan. Is FedEx
considering taking out insurance in order to mitigate the cost potential of future attacks? That came from Matthew Troy
of Wells Fargo. Alan?
<A - Alan B. Graf Jr.>: Matthew, for a number of years we have examined the cyber insurance market. For a long
period of time, it was very thin, didn't cover a lot of things that a company would look to cover, much more related to
personal information and things of that note. However, as a result of this attack, of course, we are re-examining where
the market is. We think it's getting deeper. And we are going to go out and see if there's something that we can develop
that would add protection for our company at a reasonable price.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Next question comes from David Ross of Stifel. Did Hurricane Harvey and
Hurricane Irma hurt operating performance due to airport closures? Or does clean-up relief demand end up making up
for some of those headwinds? I think we covered some of that. But, Dave, you and Raj may want to comment on it.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yes. I'll comment on it. Obviously, we're affected like everybody else. And when the
storms hit, we had to close down. We opened up right away. We had pre-staged materials for our employees and for the

communities in advance of the storms. Those things we could do. Unfortunately, for example, today in Mexico City,
they had an earthquake which we can't pre-stage.
So we have very little effect in our base business, I would say. We've recovered very well. And service has been great;
the customers have been great. I personally flew on that relief flight down to Miami and the communities down there
welcomed our help and our supplies, and so did our employees.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: On e-commerce, how much exposure does FedEx have by segment to traditional
retail? Please walk through the various impacts, positive and negative, on FedEx when a retail supply chain closes
stores or shifts more towards an omni-channel model. That's from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Raj?
<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: Yeah. Brian, we do not breakout our business by industry segment. But it's important to
recognize that retail is just one of the wide range of industries that we serve. Healthcare , automotive, aerospace,
financial services, construction, the list goes on and on. It's also important to recognize that we provide our services for
several retailers that are performing very well and are growing their business with FedEx. We continue to deliver
millions of packages to stores, which is obviously a B2B move.
As you said, more and more retailers are evolving their business model to compete with pure-play e-tailers, and we see
this as an opportunity to provide even better value for our customers. Whether it's fulfilling from store or a DC, we
have a portfolio of services that we can cater to their needs. And, furthermore, there are opportunities for retailers to
provide unique value to their customers by leveraging their infrastructure in combination with the services that we
provide. Thank you.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: How has the Fulfillment offering been received in a competitive market and what is
the ultimate market opportunity for FedEx? Again, from Brian Ossenbeck at JPMorgan. How is the rollout of FedEx
Fulfillment services progressing and what are the longer term revenue objectives for the service? Do you expect it to be
material or a complementary service? That's from David Vernon of Bernstein. So Raj and Henry.
<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: Yeah. Let me just kick it off. Thank you for the question. We think there is significant
potential for growth for FedEx Fulfillment, especially serving small and medium customers. FedEx Fulfillment is best
suited for companies who manage approximately 50 to 2,000 orders per day. And as you can imagine, this is a growing
customer segment and we are very excited about the opportunities ahead.
It gives the companies an opportunity to focus on their core business while we manage warehousing, fulfillment,
inventory, transportation management, reverse logistics and so on. We've opened a second fulfillment facility in
California earlier this month. And if customers use both our facilities in Fontana [ph] and in (39:32) Indianapolis, they
can reach 94% of the U.S. population in two days via FedEx Ground. Let me turn it over to Henry.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah. Let me just add, we opened up the first facility in February of this year in the 2nd of
June. This is a for-profit business. It drives ancillary transportation revenue, and we're pretty excited about the potential
for the business going forward.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: How far along is the SmartPost redirect program? And what percentage is being
redirected currently and expected by the end of FY 2018? Will FedEx be in position to redirect SmartPost volume to a
Ground courier this peak season? If so, in what percent of the network? And can you provide any additional color on
how this should impact earnings? Same two analysts. Henry?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah. Thanks for the question, David and Brian. SmartPost redirect, or what we call delivery
optimization, enables us to increase delivery density by matching a SmartPost package to a home delivery package that
is going to the same or adjacent address on the same day. We make these matching decisions in real-time and we're
seeing great progress, although this capability was only launched about seven weeks ago. We anticipate this will
continue through peak. And it's very important to remember that our objective with delivery optimization is to increase
density of delivery, the number of packages per stop, as well as adjacent deliveries.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Do your agreements with ISPs specifically allow for or prohibit FedEx Ground from
utilizing a form of personal vehicle drivers, to the extent such delivery options are available? Is Ground interested in

developing a solution that utilizes personal vehicles similar to the solution utilized among certain companies fulfilling
the home delivery component of B2C shipments? That's from Ben Hartford of Baird. Henry?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Thanks, Ben, for the question. FedEx Ground service providers can choose the type of vehicle
to deliver packages that best meets their business' needs while complying with the appropriate regulations. It is one of
the many decisions that entrepreneurs, who own these businesses, makes every day to ensure the best possible customer
service while considering safety, reliability, and what makes the most economic sense for their business.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: So we've had several questions on the Postal Services, raising prices on competitive
products, and what that means for rate expectations for calendar 2018 and what effect this might have on SmartPost.
And related, the peak season surcharge, would it be fully reflected in the price structure of the larger shippers? I
actually think, Raj, you answered the latter very well. Do you want to comment on USPS pricing on competitive
products?
<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: Sure, Fred. Brian, while I won't comment directly on the competitors' pricing strategies,
let me just say that we make pricing decisions based on the economic conditions, market conditions, and the value of
the service we provide. And we work to ensure that we receive an appropriate price for the value of our service. As
regards to SmartPost, there is no significant impact based on those actions. I don't know, Henry, if you're going to add
any more to that?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Would the company provide an update on automation and upgrade initiatives at
FedEx Ground? That's from Matthew Troy of Wells Fargo. And can you update us on the automation initiatives,
specifically loading trucks more efficiently? And that's from Jairam Nathan of Daiwa. Henry?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Okay. Well, thanks for the question, guys. Well, let me remind everyone that we have over 100
automated facilities in the network today and we believe FedEx Ground has one of the most automated sortation
networks in the industry.
Let me begin with the load side. The load side is a little bit less mature and developed. We are, however, employing
sensor technologies that ensures maximum use of trailer space during the loading process, thereby improving our load
factor. And this sensor technology includes tools that allow us to provide very quick feedback to our workforce about
loading techniques.
On the unload side, it's a little bit more mature and developed. We've had efforts underway in that space for almost two
years. We're examining two different systems that utilize the combination of robotic technology, including sensing,
movement and intelligence, with bulk unloading techniques. We're seeing some really good results in that area. Longer
term, our approach will be to figure out this technology as we move forward with new building designs.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: We had a couple of questions here about the composition of our various fleets, and
to some degree leading from those questions into our efforts on autonomous vehicles.
A very small percentages of the FedEx fleets are anything other than diesel. And the fuel efficiency, particularly in the
light diesel areas have been very significant over the last few years. In the Express sector, for instance, the sprinter vans
I think – am I not correct, Dave – have improved almost 100% over the last 10 years. So we do have some electrics in
the Freight sector. We have some CNG vehicles. And, obviously, all of us are looking for these announcements of the
heavier electric vehicles that have been promoted so much in the press.
In terms of autonomy, we have some significant efforts underway in evaluation of autonomous vehicles, but there are
none of which we would – none of these efforts are ready for Prime Time and are certainly not worth talking about
publicly at this point.
Jack Atkins of Stephens ask about CapEx spending for FY 2018, maintained at $5.9 billion. And specifically, have you
accelerated any specific IT projects versus your prior outlook? And if so, have you deferred any capital projects from
other segments of the business. Alan?

<A - Alan B. Graf Jr.>: Thanks for the question, Jack. We're managing this right now. We're just at the end of the first
quarter. I still feel comfortable with that number. It may not be the way I drew the play up when we did our business
plan, but I still feel pretty good with that number. I'd remind you of two things; you're going to have an airplane move
up a week or back a week and have a significant impact on that total. And, secondarily, I'm still waiting to see on tax
reform what that might do, and that could have an impact on our spending as well. Thanks for the questions.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: We have a couple of questions on China. Where does the domestic and export
Chinese market rank in priority? And what are the current or planned initiatives in the country? What's the impact from
the reports of thousands of Chinese factories forced to close as part of Beijing's ongoing battle against pollution? That
came from Helane Becker of Cowen. David Cunningham?
<A - David L. Cunningham, Jr.>: Thanks, Fred. [ph] Brian (47:35), China is the second largest economy in the world
with GDP growth expected to top 6% this year. And clearly, help plays a lead role in our global growth story. It's a
huge manufacturing base, continues to be a top priority for FedEx. Our primary focus is on the international business
where we are the leading B2B player.
Our commitment to growth is clear from recent investments that we've added capacity to that market. We launched a
Shanghai-Liège flight in April. We launched the eastbound around-the-world flight that Dave talked about earlier in
July. We have a new Shanghai hub that will open in November. So we continue to expect China to remain a growth
market for FedEx. We also have a long-standing presence in the Chinese domestic market, primarily focused on key
verticals where we have differentiated offerings versus local players.
And then, Helane, thanks for the question regarding the factories. This is just doing business in China. We do not
expect a material long-term impact from these closures. Thank you.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Thank you, David. I'd remind everybody that Dave Cunningham spent, what, 21
years in Asia? 22. So you're talking to somebody that knows the scene over there pretty well. Here's a question about
what do you see driving continued strength in international air cargo and express volumes. Raj?
<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: [ph] David (49:09), thank you for the question. Manufacturing growth has been robust
in the recent few months, and the inventory-to-sales ratio has been quite low. And, as I said earlier, the trade has been
strongest since 2011 and there is also synchronous trade growth across the globe. Also, the capacity addition has been
in check for both cargo and passenger airlines. So we see continued strength in the market. Thank you.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: So, Raj, as a somewhat related question, what percentage of your business do the
annual rate increases apply to directly? How much of your businesses, Express, Ground and Freight, is tariff business
versus contract business?
<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: As a matter of policy, we do not release that information. All I can say on this is, we are
committed to our pricing strategies that drive a balance between volume and yield growth. And as you can see, over the
past few years, we've done that very, very successfully. Thank you.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: So here's a couple of questions for the Ground segment. Henry, one from Allison
Landry of Credit Suisse. Given the strong growth in the returns business, how does GENCO fit into the equation in
terms of the current contribution to the bottom line for the Ground segment? And where do you see that going in the
next three to five years?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: It was Allison, right? Allison Landry? Thanks, Allison, for the question.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: It was from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Well, we acquired GENCO, FedEx Supply Chain, because of their return to dispositioning
capabilities; and they process hundreds of millions of returns a year. Their primary business is the business of repairing
or dispositioning if something comes back so that the merchant or ultimate seller of those goods doesn't have to deal
with it. The benefit to FedEx is, is that we play in the transportation side of that. So we get the double whammy here.
We get the ability to participate in the transportation and we get the value-add around the services that FedEx Supply

Chain provides.
Raj is probably better suited to comment on the growth returns in the industry based on what we're seeing with
e-commerce. But it's a significant place that we need to play going forward. Hence, the reason why we thought
GENCO was such a good fit to FedEx.
<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: I'll just say that returns represents 20% to 30% of all the goods transported through
e-commerce. And the fact that we have a terrific transportation portfolio and now with FedEx Supply Chain, we have
an end-to-end solution for returns.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Henry, there's a question about higher PT expenses at Ground. Are they related to
the ISP conversions or something else?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Well, purchased transportation expense is primarily driven by increased volume and higher
rates. Included in that number is postage. If you think about the fact on the ground network that all of our transportation
is purchased, whether it's P&D, line haul, or what we ultimately tender to the U.S. Postal Service, it all shows up in that
line and it moves pretty closely with the growth in volume.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. Here's one from Chris Wetherbee of Citi and Ravi Shanker of Morgan
Stanley. Chris asked, do you see recent moves by Amazon, in particular, its purchase of Whole Foods as indicative of a
trend to drive a greater combination of e-commerce and in-store fulfillment. Is this a good thing for FedEx?
And Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley ask, can you please share your thoughts on Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods,
as well as Amazon's launch of Instant Pickup points? Are e-commerce players moving towards brick-and-mortar
footprints? What are the long-term implications of this for FedEx?
Well, let me comment a little bit, and then maybe have Dave and Raj speak to this. Over the last year-and-a-half, there
have been increasing amounts of good analytical work, some of which have been done by the people on this telephone
call, that has exploded, if you will, the arcane nature of pickup and delivery operations. And we've been thrilled to see
that, quite frankly, because for many years now on this call, I and a number of others of my business partners here have
been saying that this is a very complex business with a lot of very sort of top line thoughts about it in previous years
and it's really quite complicated.
As I pointed out, we are a transportation company that serves 220 countries around the world. I don't know how many
billion people and how many millions of businesses, but it's substantial. And through our transportation networks, each
of those businesses can be connected one to the other. So that formula is N-squared. I mean, there are literally billions
and billions of potential combinations.
When it gets to the destination delivery station, then traffic of whatever nature, all of the industries that Raj mentioned
or the growing e-commerce can be combined together to be locally delivered. So we are a worldwide transportation
company that delivers locally, but we are not a local delivery company. And retailers are local delivery entities. And so,
that's where the misunderstanding has come.
The drivers of cost, as Alan mentioned in his comments, are the mix between very large customers and small and
medium customers because the yields are higher with the latter, given the purchasing power of the former. And the
second is the mix of commercial versus residential deliveries because the vast majority of houses, even with the growth
of e-commerce, do not get an e-commerce delivery per day.
E-commerce has basically been made possible by the Postal Service's mail deliverer – delivery routes and mail
personnel, putting small e-commerce packages in with the mail and delivering them for very low rates. That's
challenged, as has been well reported, including some excellent work by you, Chris, by the reduction of mail due to
digital disruption.
So my guess is that everybody that's in the e-commerce business is seeking to develop greater route densities one way
or another; the Walgreens on-site locations that we just mentioned, all of the efforts that Amazon is making, UPS is
making, and so forth. So I think at the end of the day, all of this is going to rationalize itself over the next few years.

E-commerce is not going to eliminate the retailing sector of the country. It's about 10% now, Raj?
<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: 10%.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: It's about 10%. It's certainly going to grow as a percentage. But will it be half? I
doubt it. And the business courier, anybody in this room, will it be 20%, 18%? Who knows. But I think you see the
purchase of Amazon of Whole Foods, they want to be in the grocery business. Groceries are heavy, hard to handle,
people like to come and see the produce and so forth. I've been in the grocery business twice, once as an Independent
Director at Malone & Hyde, which was a big wholesale grocery business, and later for many years as a Director at
General Mills.
And I have to tell you, it's one of the toughest businesses in the world with very low margins and very, very good
competitors. So I think there's going to be more of this. I think you're going to see e-tailers become more
brick-and-mortar. And I think you're going to see brick-and-mortar become more e-tailers. And how that all shakes out,
I don't know. But we believe as a management team that we have the assets in place to be able to participate in these
markets extremely well and we just have to, as Alan said, make sure we keep it in balance.
I mean, we had extraordinary growth this last quarter in a couple of our e-commerce customers that really were very
surprising to all of us. So same time you've got that going on, you have announcements like the Amazon-Kohl's
announcement just today, I think it was, about returns. And Best Buy has Amazon products. What is the – they have
their Alexa, yeah. My goodness, my grandkids love them. So they talk to Alexa all the time. So they're just laying
Alexas at Best Buys for sale.
So all of this is not quite as pristine as a lot of people would like to think about it. And I think over the next few years
there are lot of moving parts here. And you have to be flexible and nimble to be able to deal with the market as it
evolves, because you're not going to be able to predict exactly how it's going to evolve, that I can promise you. So sorry
for the long-winded answer, but it's not a question that lends itself to a simple reply.
So we've got a couple more here. Okay. Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Is TNT's customer mix skewed to lower price, less
service-sensitive businesses? Do you expect to change this customer mix over time to support the stronger profitability
in the combined TNT-FedEx Europe operations? Dave Bronczek's giving it to Cunningham because it's...
<A - David J. Bronczek>: [indiscernible] (01:00:07).
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay.
<A - David L. Cunningham, Jr.>: We're going to continue. I mean, TNT has a very strong base in Europe. We're
going to continue to leverage their road network capability in Europe, and Southeast Asia, and Australia, and the
Middle East with our intercontinental capabilities. The flights that we put in, in April and July build on that capability,
so 100,000 customers that ended up with improved value propositions, transit, and service. So we're going to continue
to build on that capability for the future.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, I was just going to add to that. I mean they have a great European road network, of
course. What Alan Graf actually commented about, their international business that's significant around the world was
what got affected the most, so that's the high-yielding customer. So we're working on all aspects of the TNT business
and we will get it back into the FedEx fold.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Ken Hoexter of BofA Merrill Lynch. Adding DIM weight to SmartPost, the post
office does not charge by DIM. Do you expect this to impact share gains or Ground packages flowing down chain to
SmartPost given your DIM charges there? Raj?
<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: Yeah. I'm not going to comment on the market share directly other than to say that
dimensional weight pricing is a very common industry practice and it allows us to make the best use of space in our
aircraft and where it goes and also encourages our customers to make packaging adjustments. Ultimately, efficient
packaging increases the sustainability of operations as well. So it's a common industry practice and we are very
comfortable with the changes we made.

<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Okay. I'm informed that this is the last one. This comes from Kevin Sterling of
Seaport Global. The strength we are seeing in air freight and the international export market, is it more cyclical? Or are
we seeing a structural change that you believe is more permanent? Do you believe the primary strength of the air
freight market is being driven by the need for speedy supply chains to deliver products in a more timely manner.
Outside of the speed-to-market are there any other factors at work?
<A - Rajesh Subramaniam>: Thank you for the question. As I said before, this is the fastest freight growth I've seen
since 2011. The trade growth is 1.4 times GDP for the first half of this calendar year and typically it's been roughly at
GDP for the last few years. So what's driving it? The manufacturing, especially in the technology sector, is a key driver
of this trend for this year. We expect that to be continued for the rest of the year. As to how far trade versus GDP goes
forward, I can't comment on that. That's too early to say.
Frederick Wallace Smith
Let me just close off here with something I think is very important for the people that follow FedEx to recognize,
particularly in a time where there's all this very problematic geopolitical rhetoric going on. The world is becoming
wealthier almost everywhere. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of people have risen out of property into the middle
class in China, in India, in Africa, these enormous populations. And they are all equipped now with cellular telephones
and access to the Internet, or the vast majority, and that more than anything else which is what put e-commerce on
steroids.
So you're seeing fundamental demand at the individual level drive companies to export and international e-commerce
to grow. That's why we put up CrossBorder. And I think a very big part of the increase in, quote, air cargo demand is
being driven by these e-commerce demands at the individual or the various country levels.
And we're very proud of the network that we've developed in India, and China, and Indonesia, and Southeast Asia; I
could go on and on, Mexico. And certainly wish our Mexican teammates well where there's earthquake. So that's a big
secular trend that is driving an awful lot of things. And I think that, as much as any type of cyclicality of traditional
product flows in, quote, air cargo is something that's here to stay.
So on that, I think we should tie it off and give it back to Mickey here.
Mickey Foster
