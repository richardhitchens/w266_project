For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.
David E. Simon
Okay. Good morning. We had a strong start to 2015. As you know, we closed on the acquisition of Jersey Gardens and
University Park Village, two great properties that we're excited to have in our portfolio. We created two joint ventures
with two of our long-standing retail partners; one with Hudson's Bay Company and the other was Sears Holdings,
which will serve as additional avenues for growth.
And of course we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance. As you know, results in the quarter
were highlighted by funds from operation of $2.28 per share, exceeding once again the First Call consensus by $0.03,
and that was achieved even though, we had a decrease of approximately $0.03 for the quarter due to the strong dollar
against the euro and the yen. And on a comparable basis, excluding the operating results from WPG properties in the
prior-year period, our FFO per share increased 6.5% or $0.14 even with a currency devaluation.
Let me turn to our operating metrics and cash flow, occupancy was 95.8%; leasing activity remains strong and healthy;
the Malls and Premium Outlets recorded leasing spreads of $11.19 per square-foot, an increase of 18.9%.
Now, let's talk about comp NOI, comp NOI increased 3.5% in the first quarter of 2015, compared to an increase of
5.3% in the first quarter of 2014. As a reminder, approximately 95% of our domestic property NOI is included in our
comp NOI calculation. And very importantly with respect to this quarter, our comp NOI in the first quarter was
negatively impacted by about 50 basis points due to a significant overage rent – retroactive billing within the Mills in
the first quarter 2014. And if you remember, we put in the Mills in terms of our comp NOI beginning last year. If you
wanted to understand our comp NOI on the Outlets and the Malls, it's approximately 4%, and right on our budget.
Total sales across our portfolio increased 2% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of last year, and I will also
point out there was a recent – Fitch affirming our A rating. They did a report that I would suggest that the analytic
community review, just to put in the back of your mind on our comp NOI growth. We have exceeded our peers by an
average of 240 basis points from the period of time of 2005 to 2014, I thought that was interesting reading and in any
event let's go to construction.
We continue new Premium Outlets in Gloucester, which will serve the South Jersey and Philadelphia areas and new
centers in Tampa and Tucson, as well as our Designer Outlet in Vancouver. All are great high quality major markets
and each is scheduled to open later this year. We are slated to begin construction on as many as three additional
domestic Premium Outlets in 2015 as well as three international Outlets in 2015 for a total of six. We are beginning site
work shortly at The Shops at Clearfork, which as you know is our new full-priced development in Fort Worth anchored
by Neiman. We plan on opening that in early 2017.
Yesterday, we were excited to announce our partnership with Swire and the Whitman Family for the retail component
of Brickell City Centre, which is anchored by Saks. We look forward to contributing our leasing and management
expertise to this signature project, which includes a significant residential component and that will open in the fall of
2016. And on Oyster Bay, which we are renaming Syosset Park, we have begun the approval process for what will be a
unique mixed-use lifestyle center with retail office, hotel, park for the families of the Oyster Bay area and residential
components. Initial feedback on our plan has been positive. We expect the process to go well. On the redevelopment
and expansion, we've got 24 properties across our three platforms in the U.S. and Asia for a total commitment of a $1.8
billion at the end of the first quarter.

During the quarter, we completed a 265,000 square foot expansion at Yeoju Premium Outlets in Seoul and recently
completed a 136,000 square foot expansion in Shisui, Premium Outlets in Tokyo, both off to great starts and let's not
forget construction continues on major redevelopment expansion projects at some of our most productive malls, all
under construction including, but not limited to Roosevelt Field, The Galleria in Houston, Stanford Shopping Center,
King of Prussia, Del Amo, and our Premium Outlets in Woodbury, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, and Chicago, all
under construction, all bringing significant amount of new square footage for 2016 and over the next 18 months.
Klépierre, we were pleased to have played the key role in Klépierre's acquisition of Corio, which became effective at
the end of March, creating the leading pure play retail property company in continental Europe. We now have a €21
billion portfolio in 16 countries and to remind the investment community, this was a €7.4 billion M&A transaction. We
are pleased to see the rebound in the European shopper, Klépierre will report the results next week, and we expect a
higher and stronger growth portfolio given the acquisition.
Capital markets. We expanded our $2 billion revolving credit facility to $2.75 billion and extended its maturity to 2020.
Our current liquidity including revolvers and cash-on-hands is over $6 billion. Our industry-leading balance sheet
continues to differentiate us from our peer group. As you know, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase program.
We have not yet repurchased any shares as a result of our trading window black-out due to earnings and the timing of
our buyback announcement and traveling. We are proud to announce yet another dividend increase of $1.50, which is a
year-over-year increase of 15% and a 7% increase from the first quarter of 2015. Again, nobody's got our dividend
growth. We will pay at least $5.90, an increase of nearly as I said 15% from last year.
So, let me turn to guidance, we've increased our guidance based on our view of the year again from $9.65 to $9.75.
Again, nobody in our peer group has the kind of growth that we have and we continue to feel very comfortable as I
mentioned to you on the comp NOI growth of 4% for the year for Malls, Premium Outlets and Mills and we are ready
for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Hey, good morning. It's Michael Bilerman here for Christy.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you doing?
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Great. So David, I was curious as how you think about your stake in Macerich at this
point. Do you sort of view it as a $470 million mall that's giving you a 3% yield that you think is potentially worth
$570 million or do you sort of view it as worth $470 million, you bought it for $370 million, you have a $100 million
profit and sort of take that money and go home?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, Michael, frankly, since we were not able to engage with Macerich even though we tried
very hard to as you know and we put what I felt was a unbelievable hell of an offer on the table, and I obviously tried
very hard to engage.
We have been so busy between the Sears and the HBC, finishing Brickell, doing Clearfork, making sure our
redevelopment is on time and on budget. The three new deals that we have internationally, I have really not had the
luxury of figuring out what I'm going to do with that stake. So at this point, I can't really answer your question, but at
some point, I'll address it in the near future, but we had just been too busy running the business, producing very good
strong results, raising the dividend, doing the buyback, doing all the redevelopment, all the new ventures that I haven't
really sat down and figured out what to do next. I'm open to your ideas if you have any though.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Yeah. I don't think I should publicly say that on a call. In terms of Europe and you
talked about the Klépierre-Corio transaction in being instrumental in that deal. As you think about potentially putting

additional capital to Europe when you originally made the stake, the euro was about a $1.30, you're under a $1.10
today, you obviously have some hedge because you have some euro-denominated debt, but I'm just curious as you
think about potentially taking your stake back up to a 30% level if that's in the cards in putting capital out given where
the euro is and how you sort of think about that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, that kind of opportunity is always on the table. I will say this, look we are up €1.4
billion in our investment, guys, right?
<A>: Yeah.
<A>: Yeah.
<A - David E. Simon>: So that's not too shabby of a trade if I can quote Adam Sandler, who is one of my heroes, I
quoted him last year – not last year but 2013 annual letter but all you talk about is Steve Ross letter, you never
mentioned mine, so.
But I thought I had a pretty good line in there, but I mentioned in our call, I think people lose sight. We did help
engineer a $7.4 billion European merger that again is not to – don't underestimate the fact and the role that I played –
that we played in putting together those two companies that, that was a €7.4 billion investment and as you know that
the capital going towards Europe and the timing of that deal I think is going to be very attractive for us in the long run.
So, I couldn't be more pleased with my investment, but we'll just see how that evolves. There are couple of other large
shareholders. They certainly haven't indicated to me any time that they're going to – that they're looking to get out, I
think they're very pleased with what has transpired since our involvement over the last three years.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: Hey, good morning, David, it's Christy here. You talked often about your larger regional mall
redevelopment and expansion projects, but I'm wondering with the new Hudson's Bay and Sears JVs and this maybe
more so with the Sears boxes, but does your new control over any of these boxes unlock any future potential major
redevelopment projects at any of your centers or is it too early to tell. And maybe you can just provide some general
comments on the future opportunities for investments that could arise from these JVs?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think that the JV with Sears clearly is all about redeveloping those boxes with Sears
potentially as a – taking some of that space and in some cases maybe not. And as also part of that deal, we bought the
La Plaza store which is a fantastic mall, does, I don't know, $750 to $800 a foot, it got a lot of demand. So that also
gives us the ability to look at expanding that mall. So, the answer – I don't want to put a number on it, Christy, but I
would definitely say that it's all about re-tenanting with Sears, maybe downsizing their stores. And in La Plaza,
certainly there is a major expansion in the works that we're going to move very fast on and that and that will – La Plaza
just as a general scope, Rick, it's a couple of hundred million bucks...
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah.
<A - David E. Simon>: ...at the end of the day. So, all of that was part of that – all of that was done in the mine to
foster redevelopment for sure.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Thank you. Some of it's related to Christy's last question. There seems to be more
churning in both the mall specialty and the mall anchor space. I'm just wondering from Simon's mall portfolio
perspective, is that actually an opportunity for you? I mean something you actually would welcome, just given your
dominant portfolio and the opportunities at a distance [ph] you'd be (17:41) from your peers?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I wouldn't say we have a – we don't use the word dominant here. We have a very high
quality portfolio that's produced outsized comp NOI growth with our peer over. I know we get focused on a quarter
here, a quarter there, but if you look over any kind of extended period of time, we've clearly outperformed our peer
group. I would say, there is not a lot of churning in the department store world. I think we have, Rick, one empty box
out of how many, Rick?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: 450 almost.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Yeah, and what is that one, I should know it actually?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It's in Oxford [indiscernible] (18:30)
<A - David E. Simon>: Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah that's a tough one. But in any event, like in Riverside, we got the Saks
building back, we're actually just approved internally yesterday a whole redevelopment of that box, so we are down to
one box. But clearly on the specialty side, we did lose a handful of retailers. And I think at the end of the day, there will
be an opportunity from it, obviously we're focused on re-leasing on that space, but we're going to put in better retailers.
And as you know, I mean, the retail business like any business in today's environment is Darwinian and the retailers
that are going away are relatively weaker ones.
There is a whole host of stronger ones in the pipeline that we would expect to be able to add excitement to our
properties and ultimately increase our cash flow from their participation in our building. So that's the nature of our
business. As you know Craig, we love showing the slide about the top 10 retailers in 1993 when we went public till
today. It's a little more going on today than maybe it was a year or two ago, but nothing that we're overly concerned
about and we're poised to do the work necessary to make these properties better and obviously having a high quality
portfolio like we do, we will make it – we'll make it happen.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. And then just besides your significant redevelopment pipeline efforts, are there
any emerging areas of real estate formats that you are looking to, down the road, that could be an area for growth for
Simon?
<A - David E. Simon>: Like other uses or...
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: I mean, obviously you haven't been that interested in high street retail. But is there – I
mean, just thinking, the Mall is a mature business, at some point, the opportunity for Premium Outlets slow; and then
what are you seeing maybe five years down the road that might be an opportunity to grow?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, where we – we have always looked. I think the Hudson Bay joint venture is going
to give us another avenue of growth in that whole single-credit tenant kind of business both internationally and the U.S.
Street retail potentially out of that, I don't know, the values there are pretty salty when the deals are – where we've seen.
So I think, Craig, we've always been creative in trying to find other areas. It will focus around retail real-estate. But
we're not concerned at all about not being able to find avenues of growth. But clearly we still got a pipeline of
redevelopment.
The Outlet business – our Outlet business is very strong. So, we posted great comp NOI numbers this quarter. Sales
were very strong. So, we see that growth continuing and then with the redevelopment that we're doing at some of our
iconic mall properties. Again these aren't pipe trains, they're – Houston, Galleria, Roosevelt Field, Stanford Galleria,
Del Amo, King of Prussia, I mean this stuff is maybe we should put on our website to show you the steel. But this stuff
is all happening. So we got plenty, plenty to say grace over right now.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Good morning, guys. Just a first question back on Macerich, what were the pursuit costs
related there, and I guess where do they fall in your Q1 numbers?
<A - David E. Simon>: It's another expense [ph] in there Don (23:09) and we have no more.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Are you able to give an estimate or...
<A - David E. Simon>: Immaterial. I mean I don't know, I don't want to – basic – immaterial. We do a lot of this in
house. You are looking at them.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: For better or worse, okay.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: And you work cheaply. So...
<A - David E. Simon>: Some may argue that. But the point is, for better or worse, you're looking at the M&A guy
here. Okay.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Okay. Maybe to switch gears, I'm just curious on occupancy. I think Q1 occupancy was down
a little bit year-over-year; and maybe I missed it in your remarks, but is that just a return to a more normal – what I will
call sort of pullback post-holiday, or is there something else going on there?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I would say Jeff, we clearly – normally, we're always going to lose 60 bps to 80 bps
from the seasonality part of our business, right. We had more than that this time, and that's all related to – I'd say
another 50 bps or so, all related to the bankruptcies.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: And again, we had planned that, that's why we were cautious on our comp NOI growth, so
there is no surprise there. Cautious being, I'd argue 4% is pretty significant when I look at other categories. I look at
office, I look at investor, or I look at across the platform, 4% ain't too bad. But nevertheless, it is a little bit lower and it
was all because we were planning the guys that we're on the ropes. And the guys that were on the ropes ended up on the
mat, so to speak. In the spirit of the upcoming Pacquiao, Mayweather fight, okay, they ended up on the mat.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: What I would say Jeff is, we expect that occupancy to go up as we move through the year
and get some of that space redeployed, which we're in the process of doing right now.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Yeah, because I think at the end of the fourth quarter you guys were looking for sort of flat
occupancy by year-end. I wasn't sure if that was still the case.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Look, could we be a few basis points below it, sure, but again you also have to factor in
we've got a lot of redevelopment going on. So, our portfolio is in a pretty significant – undergoing a pretty significant
activities going on. So, it'll be very close to that number.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: And I saw that David Contis was working on converting temporary space to permanent space.
How much do you guys have in the way of short-term tenancy today, and how does that compare to history?
<A - David E. Simon>: It's been going down pretty significantly. I'm going to say, again, we don't – in our occupancy,
we only include folks that have a lease of a year in. So, we do – sometimes we do year-to-year leases because we're
looking for a better group, but that number has been as high – the year-to-year guides have been as high as the mid-5%.
We're down about 4% now, Jeff, roughly – rough numbers right guys?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yep.

approvals to move ahead there?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, it is a process I think by the end of this year, we will be in a very good shape, but we
have a lot – there is a lot to go through. So, we're shooting the next six months or so, we're going to be very important.
But that's how we're thinking about the timing.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Hey guys. Good morning. I'm [ph] here with Jeremy Metz (27:58).
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you?
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: David, let me first ask you on the stock buyback. Do you intend to actually buy back any
stock around the current levels, or was it put in place as a placeholder? Or was it a statement to Macerich, or a little of
everything?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, no, I mean I think look the REIT market, I would say this obviously, I'm not going to tell
you when or how we're going to buy stock back, but I would say we wouldn't have announced it unless we were serious
about it. We couldn't buy any stock back, because we were in our black-out period when the announcement came. And
as I look at other companies and their valuation and I look at ours, and our growth prospects and our track record, I
continue to think we are extremely well positioned.
As I look at history year after year, quarter after quarter, and all that we've got going on, look at our valuation
compared to our peer group, I feel very comfortable that we are a very strong and good investment. Now, with the
added volatility in the REIT sector, we want to be able to take advantage of that volatility. So, I think you'll see us at
the appropriate times of volatility. And no statement, it had nothing to do with Macerich. Obviously, had that deal gone
forward, maybe the capital would've been allocated differently, but I look at our growth profile, I look at the history of
our results, I look at our balance sheet, I look at the peer group, I look at REIT valuations generally, and I think I can't
take a better investment than ours as we look forward.
So, we'll take advantage of volatility. We'll do this opportunistically and you'll see us in the market at the appropriate
times.

<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Okay. I appreciate that.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Can you talk a little bit about what's going on in the department store industry right now?
And I know you've got different motivating factors behind what happened with Hudson's Bay and with what's going on
with Sears. I guess a couple questions. One is, did you discuss with Sears or did they want to sell you more than what
you actually bought? I'm curious what you think of their, I will call it, spin rights offering and do you see other
department store companies also transacting with their real estate anytime soon?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I would say, Sears and us got comfortable with the portfolio. It wasn't dramatically
different from the beginning to where we ended up. And I think it's good to have that kind of relationship. I think it can
grow over time. I think they have valuable real estate and we see Seritage as being able to, as a company we wouldn't
invest in it unless we saw that going forward. So, and frankly, Hudson's Bay I think, I really like their management
team. I really like that real estate being a partner with them and their real estate, and looking for future growth
opportunities, gives us another avenue of growth. So, I see that as another very good opportunity.
Could other retailers take advantage of their inherent real estate value? Sure, but if they do it to the – to the extent or –
they've got a balloon, if they squeeze one end too high, you got to be very careful on how they do it. But if they're
thoughtful about how they want to take advantage of the real estate, I'm sure there's value to be made for their
shareholders, but that – that's not necessarily a focus for us. We're very pleased to have partnered with both these folks
and we expect them to grow. Rick?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The only other thing that I would add is that, it does put a spotlight on the fact that the
creditworthiness and operating stability of our department store companies I believe is greater than the analysts and the
investment community has recognized before and when we've said all long, we thought that they were in a stable
position. I think that's been borne out by the ability to add financial stability by taking a focus on the real estate assets.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: And David, did you separate out the Hudson's Bay venture from SPG, because you didn't
want a bunch of boring long-term net leases in SPG or was there something other than that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think it's part of SPG. First of all, it hasn't actually closed yet. We're closing when we
announce, it should be closing in the next -- by the end of the quarter probably. But we've always viewed that as
ultimately a standalone business going forward. That will help grow faster, the credit, the net lease retailer.
I mean we – they're great retailers. They – we're – how we're going to run that joint venture, they've got great real estate
entrepreneurs. We certainly can underwrite retail credit. We have ideas on how to grow that business. So ultimately
that business could in fact, end up separated from us. But we will want to add value to it through our deal-making
capabilities. And yeah, it probably if it ends up more focused on the credit, the credit lease business, it's – that probably
is better separated from SPG in a long run, but that – all of that's to be determined, Ross, as we go forward.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Appreciate it. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Good morning. David, just a few questions here. First, you brought up the rating
agencies in your comments. So two questions on that. One is, the 7% cap rate that they're using, clearly we've had a
number of demonstrable mall trades that show cap rates are well below, so curious if they're going to move away from
the 7%. And second on that is, as you guys entertain the Macerich to buy them, did the rating agencies do any pushback
to you guys on your rating? Or their view is they know who you are and even if anything was breached they know that

you would resolve that in due course and therefore a rating impact was unlikely?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I'll speak to the last, first. I mean, no, they have all the confidence in the world in
us that when it comes to doing a transaction of that nature that we did not expect to be downgraded or notched at all.
Right, Andy?
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: Right. We've done $40 billion of acquisitions and they've been very pleased with the results.
<A - David E. Simon>: And again, not that this is all that interesting any more, but part of the reason we were selling
assets to GGP was, in fact – the primary reason was in fact to make sure that our A rating would stay in place. As far as
the 7%, yes, they should update it. It's silly. I mean, but...
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: It's a disaster scenario.
<A - David E. Simon>: But they're being conservative. It's not market – I agree with you, but...
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: We agree.
<A - David E. Simon>: I don't know what to do about it.
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: It used to be 8%.
<A - David E. Simon>: It used to be 8%,
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: And 9%.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. Okay. So glacial compression there. Second question is, on the Hudson's Bay,
can you just talk a little bit about the challenges of having real estate in other people's centers and we've seen obviously
other companies in the past try and do that. It hasn't worked out. Is there a different perspective that you guys have on
making that work? Or how should we think that this time it may work versus what we've seen historically?
<A - David E. Simon>: That's not really even – there's no thinking that, boy, it's great to have – own real estate in
other people's centers. That's really not – this is a growth vehicle to go find other opportunities in the credit world based
on retail real estate. Right now, Hudson's Bay has all the plans to operate those stores. So there's nothing about in that
sense. I mean obviously for whatever reason they decided not to operate a store, we would have that opportunity.
But that's really not anywhere near on the agenda. We value this at a pretty attractive cap rate, 6.125%, in really good
mall. So we think it's an attractive accretive transaction for us from a value point of view, and it's really about creating
the entity to go do more stuff and seeding it with these stores, as opposed to we're going to go play – we have no
intention at all to go play any kind of havoc or anything in other people's malls. So that's not even on the agenda.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then just finally, your last presentation on Mace where you guys disclosed
your top center productivity and some of your mall stats. If there is any way if that could be obviously quarterly it
would be great, but annually I mean it was tremendous retail candy for us and obviously helps in the analysis of you
guys. So if there is a suggestion box, we'd love to see that on an annual basis at least?
<A - David E. Simon>: Speaking of suggestion boxes, and I better not say this because I might get criticized, but I'm a
member at a golf club that was built by Pete Dye, okay, Crooked Stick here in Indianapolis, and the members'
suggestion box is in the middle of the pond, okay. But that will not be – duly noted, and I'm not saying that, but duly
noted and look I think we put that together because we felt it was important if there were any confusion about stuff that
was said there, we wanted to clarify that . Frankly, Alex, we look at ourselves differently than a collection of assets, but
duly noted. Everybody expressed their views on that to Tom.
We have been I think as clear and as articulate in our financial presentations as anybody. We have never wavered from
FFO as an example. We delivered via the white paper occasionally like with WP spin, we separate that out because it's
important to note a transaction of that nature, but we give you WP first or we give you FFO first and then we show you
whatever is important to change. So I feel like we necessarily are a little different in that area, but duly noted. We won't
make it canoe to the pond to put in your suggestion box. We'll take it up with Tom and we'll see about it in the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Thanks. Good morning, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: Hey.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Couple of questions. I don't think you disclosed the percentage ownership in the Brickell
transaction. Is that something you could provide? And what role exactly is Simon playing in this development?
<A - David E. Simon>: We're going to have a 25% interest in the retail, and we are going to be the manager of the
retail portion of the project, and we are going to be leading the leasing effort along with Swire and Whitman Properties.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. So you'll be the – I guess the lead leasing agent on this?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay, got it. I guess David on Copley, I didn't hear any talk on that. Where do we stand on the
residential project?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we have an upcoming BRA meeting, which is the authority there in the next month.
We're hopeful to get approved. And there will be a couple other hurdles after that, but that puts us on the path to start
construction. So the next month or so we thought we were going to be able to do it this month. Things got a little –
couple of political things happened out of our control, but we've been assured that we can get back on the agenda here
in this upcoming month.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: So it sounds like maybe kind of June, July start?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. I mean, I think we feel comfortable by July we will have all of the permits and all the
approvals done. It's a fluid situation, but that's correct.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: And if that's the case, I guess when would the sales process – like just help us think through the
timing if you start construction, when does the sales office start? Just how far after that? Is it a year later?
<A - David E. Simon>: That's not going to start for a year after that only because the complexity of this build is
significant. So we have to go down the turnpike, support the foundation, then we've got to go into Neiman Marcus
store, relay that and then go up. So there is no real need to rush that. I'd say roughly a year from now that would be the
focus. A lots going on at the mall where we're going to start the renovation of the actual interior of it. We're going to do
the Southwest Corridor entrance. So we're finishing the office reno, so it is a property where a lot is going on, but I'd
say the sales office would be probably roughly a year from now.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. And then last question, I mean, you mentioned all of the major projects you've got going on
in the U.S. here. I'm just curious, how do you feel about sort of the international investment opportunities versus
domestic?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, with the outlet business, we've got – I mentioned in my call, we have three that we think
we're going to start this year. We have great outlet in Provence partnering with MGE, McArthurGlen. We've got a new
site with fantastic developer in Mexico, Sordo, which has built some of the best malls and is our partner in Mexico
City. We expect that to start this year. And then we've got with Genting Group. We're very close to finalizing the deal
to start our second outlet in Malaysia. And I mentioned to you, we just finished Yeoju and Shisui expansion. So that's a
lot of activity internationally.

We're also working on a couple of other opportunities in the outlet with some new joint ventures. And then we've got
another site – two sites in Canada. So, internationally on the development front, with the Premium Outlet product, we
are busy. And then again, with Klépierre, we helped do this huge deal that here domestically people don't think about,
but it was a €7.4 billion deal. They just closed March 31. They also bought a great asset in Spain shortly thereafter.
There is a tremendous amount going on with the integration and a portfolio review of the long-term assets. There is a
lot of development work going on as well within the total combined portfolio. So that to us is kind of – we view that is
our full price retail entity going forward in Continental Europe, and I expect that company to continue to grow. So
we're active internationally. I don't see us buying full price retail in Asia or other parts. I mean, I think right now, it's
kind of finding new markets for our Premium Outlet product.

Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: I guess, first question, just the factors behind your higher FFO guidance, curious if there
is any changes to your FX outlook in the new guidance. And if there's any level of perhaps share repurchase baked into
the full-year of revised outlook?
<A - David E. Simon>: The answer is no on the share buyback. And we've factored in the currency where it is today.
So we have a few cents – last quarter, quarter one of 2014 the euro was $1.37 average.
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: Right.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Yes.
<A - David E. Simon>: This year it was $1.13. So that's a pretty big gap. Now it's at $1.08, roughly.
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: That's down 21%, right.
<A - David E. Simon>: So we're pretty proud that we took a $0.03 hit in our Q1 2015 and still beat consensus pretty
good. It's in our numbers. It's clearly going to affect our total. We had $0.10 roughly year-over-year. It's in that range.
We have a little bit exposure if it drops further, but nothing that we can't deal with.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Okay. Fair enough. And follow-up on the Miami project with Swire, just want to clarify
first. The 25% ownership that's just of the retail or is that the entire project?
<A - David E. Simon>: Just the retail.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Okay. And then the strategic decision to get involved with the project now. Why now?
Did you approach them? Did they approach you? And then how should we think about the project in terms of
merchandising mix? It looks like GGP. They are nearby. Design District has a bit of a stranglehold on luxury. How
much of a challenge do you think that might present in your ability to attract a high tier tenant retailers?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, they approached us and, look, we have been involved in this for a while. We feel
unbelievably confident we're going to deliver – obviously, they designed it and they've done most of the work, but we
feel together we're going to deliver a great product that I think is going to wow the marketplace.

There's no question that this is going to be a unique terrific long-term mixed-use retail asset, I think it's going to blow
people's minds away. And then leasing we've made a lot of progress on leasing and we're very, very confident about
our ability to deliver a very, very compelling mix.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The only thing I would add is that this project in and of itself has a hotel, two condo
towers, and two office towers and surrounding it there's another eight or nine residential office and hotel projects going
on in the heart of Brickell. So it's a very dense, very sophisticated and very wealthy submarket inside of the Dade
County overall market. We're very excited about it.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Too early to talk about target yields?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. Look, we have partners in there. I mean it'll be put in our 8-K, but that kind of stuff is
probably not going to be singled out, out of respect for our partners, but we think it's an attractive investment. We
wouldn't make it otherwise, and as I said, this will be produced at a very high level. Swire and the Whitman family are
first-class operators. You couldn't pick better partners and we all know Bal Harbour for sure and we all know what
Swire has done in China and Hong Kong. They've built some of the most amazing stuff. So to be associated with those
kind of folks on a long-term basis, we couldn't be more pleased and we will make money in this investment, otherwise
we wouldn't do it.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Could there be more. Are you contemplating additional investments with Swire or is it
again too early to talk about that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we're not in Hong Kong and this is their big investment in the U.S., but we certainly
have a lot of respect for that organization.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Okay. But just to be clear, at this point, there is nothing talked about perhaps overseas
with them in Asia, Hong Kong or China?
<A - David E. Simon>: No.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Andrew L. Rosivach>: Sorry, guys, I tried to get out of the queue, It is running late. But really quick, you guys
have listed amazing metrics, especially on relative basis, especially when you take into account leverage. And
unfortunately, you can go through quarters where that actually doesn't influence your share price. And I'm just curious
just in terms of [ph] unfortunately when (53:31) my clients have tried to get [indiscernible] (53:33) discussions over the
last couple quarters. When you bid for another company that your shareholders don't own, you can actually harm the
relative performance of your supporters. And I'm just wondering like, is that part of the decision making process? Do
you kind of know it will hurt and you make the call that the long-term gain actually offsets the short-term pain or is it
not in the calculus?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we always want feedback from our shareholders and we always take that into account,
but hopefully they have confidence in us that we're making the right decisions that will add to the value of their
investment. And we're always confronted whether it's a M&A deal or a new development of a redevelopment to weigh
short-term pain for long-term gain. We thankfully, hopefully, will continue, but certainly historically we've made pretty
good decisions on that front. We certainly haven't batted a 1,000, but where we've made risky investments, we've done
it on a low key basis, a small basis compared to the enterprise, and I go back to two that jump out at me. One was in
China, the other was in, I call it my blue period when we were doing all the technology in the late – whenever it was, I
try to forget about it, the late 1990s, early 2000s. So I would say to you with this last situation, I mean, the shareholders

that we spoke to, at least what they told me, they were supportive of what we were trying to accomplish, and that's what
they told me.
And, again, I mean, we never got to the point where we're able to lay out all that we could do there, but we certainly
always factored that in. We do know that sometimes doing these things is not the easy road. The easy road is to just – I
don't know do what a lot of other folks do which is not a lot, okay, but this company is all about not doing what's easy,
and it's easy just, I don't know, redevelop a thing here, build something there, but that's not what we're about. We're
about trying to make this company unique and when you do that, sometimes you do create short-term confusion and/or
short-term underperformance. We hope, all we can do, we hope is that people look at the track record and look at
dividend growth. I mean, 15% dividend growth at a company our size...
<Q - Andrew L. Rosivach>: David, no pushback on that. No pushback that you are actually great at doing M&A. It's
just when it goes on for a quarter, most of my clients are based on one-year performance on a relative basis, after a
while it starts to hurt. And I even got the impression, when you wrote your March 20 final offer, I got a sense when you
were saying not to go through a multi-year proxy, but I think you were starting to notice the pain it was creating with
your share price.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, that's a whole different subject that's probably better off I'm happy to have with
you or anybody else, but it's probably better off to have that not necessarily in this kind of format, but we – look
short-term we're all about short-term gain if there is a long-term play there, but it's important to have support from our
shareholders. And I can say to you that they were the ones that I talked are relatively supportive of what we tried to
accomplish, but on the other hand going through a multi-year proxy fight, et cetera, if we had done that that's when we
might have lost support, that's a judgment call I have to make, and I made the judgment call that I did. I think the
support would have been there, had we on the deal whether the support would have been there on a long drawn out
battle, I don't know, but I decided not to ask for it.

Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to go back to the FX discussion a little bit, I appreciate
the comments on the earnings side of things. Just curious, last quarter we talked a little bit about the impact on some of
the tourism-driven markets. I was just wondering if you could give, I guess, an update on what you're seeing in those
markets? As it pertains to FX impacts?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. In the U.S. side, with the strong dollar.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Right.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. We are seeing a little bit – I would tell you that that it's just really
volatile right now on some of those tourist markets where there is a good month, a good week, and then there is a bad
month and a bad week. So it kind of balances out, but I would say, it's safe to say that the strong dollar is affecting to
some extent sales in some of the really highly international assets that we have, but nothing that's going to change our
financial profile or earnings or any of that, but it is a lot more volatile. You hear occasionally in South Florida a little
bit, we haven't seen anything in Woodbury, but I've heard a lot in New York City, but we have no exposure there, but
you hear and when I say hear, I'm hearing it from the retailers. So it's something to pay attention to.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Thanks. And then just more domestically, just given the drop in oil prices, it seems like
there was expectations that that would flow into the economy, but seems like it's being saved. Just curious if you are
seeing anything different from that in your own mall traffic and that kind of thing?

<A - David E. Simon>: I'd still say, generally, we're still dealing with a cautious consumer, it's safe to say, and it's
volatile. So, the comment I had about the tourism also applies to just the domestic consumer as well, where the patterns
of the consumer are tougher to predict right now. I still think there is a – confidence is getting better, but there is still a
lot of debt being reduced and it's still there is a good month, a good week, and then a bad month, a bad week, and the
pattern is sloping up, but it's certainly not gangbusters.
And look, we had 2% comp. Our total sales increased from quarter-over-quarter 2014 to 2015. That's the kind of world
we're in right now. We did get unbelievably so, we did not mention this, now I mentioning it, so I probably shouldn't
mention it, but we had another awful winter in Northeast. For those of you in Boston only, we have a lot of exposure in
Northeast. Believe it or not, our snow expense was higher this year than last year across the portfolio. So, we still had
to deal with a little bit of the weather, but we are dealing with a cautious consumer and the good news is, we're
delivering results in that environment. That's all we can do.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard, Lyons. Please proceed.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Good morning. Thinking about the premium outlet pipeline out there, how much room do
you think there is for a premium outlet of Simon's quality to be built in the U.S.? Can you quantify a number, are there
20 possible sites left in the U.S. or where do think that number would be?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think that would be a real challenge of our kind of quality to produce. Right now the
way we look at it, the 20 additional outlets, I still think it's a handful. We are going through – the industry is going
through a little bit of a growth spurt. But I would say, 20 would be a stretch. I'm going to – this is so hard to give you a
real number, but I would say, as we look at the stuff that we might see building, we've got three now that will start,
maybe another two or three next year. But from our standpoint, I would see under 10 over the next three years to five
years at domestic starts within our portfolio.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Okay.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Then one thing I would say to you Carol is, when you think about growth, please don't
forget about the expansion that David mentioned earlier. They are almost the equivalent in terms of productivity of a
new outlet. We're adding a lot of square-footage at Chicago, and at Woodbury, and at San Francisco, and all of that is
adding math and that's absorbing demand in the most productive way that could possibly happen. And I encourage all
of you to go out and see what we just opened at Desert Hills. And if you're out in Las Vegas, what we're opening at Las
Vegas North the week of the ICSC convention, these things are dramatic expansions with great retailers that are highly,
highly productive.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Okay. Thanks. And then there's questions for Rick. We've heard a lot about store closings, I
know you'd love to give your list of who wants space, do you have any new names for us?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I can't wait. Well, you have to relax and stretch. Well, I think one thing that I'd like to point
out to everybody is we talk about all this. The tenant that has the broadest footprint in our portfolio is the L Brands with
Victoria's Secret and they're doing great results, and they're growing, and they're expanding and they're adding things to
their Victoria's Secret stores. But we're doing with a lot of international retailers that people haven't. DAVIDsTEA has
come down. We're growing Uniqlo, we're growing H&M, we're growing Sephora, and we're growing Altar'd State
which is a great retailer that has got a significant growth platform. And frankly, as David said, the ones that left are low
productivity, oversized. So that gives us the opportunity to bring in higher productivity retailers that are just going to
increase the market share of our properties.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yeah. Hi. Just a quick one. It sounds like a lot could be going on at Syosset. So how much
of that project would you actually do yourselves?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, yeah, in terms of the mixed use, we haven't gotten to that point, Michael. We probably,
when it gets to the office, we'll probably sell the office, we might partner on the residential. But again, there is roughly
400,000 of retail, so that will do with our partner. The other hotel we may or may not do. So my guess at the end of the
day, we probably look to either sell or joint venture, we'll probably won't do the office. We might sell or joint venture
the other uses.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. Okay. That was pretty much it, thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. No worries.

Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Linda Y. Tsai>: Hi. When people talk about omni-channel, my sense is that they think of traditional mall-based
or full-priced stores. To what extent are you seeing omni-channel capabilities incorporated into the Premium Outlet
model? Do you think this is something that makes sense for you and the retailers?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think the retailers as they bring in the omni-channel world to their – their physical
stores will certainly apply it to the outlet world as well. And again, they're all at different degrees of that integration.
But I don't think Outlets would be ignored on that front at all. So I would expect that to be part of it.
<Q - Linda Y. Tsai>: Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question, we have a follow-up from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Hey, it's Michael Bilerman again. David, I'm just curious to get your thoughts a little
bit on Land and Buildings and Orange Capital's proxy campaign post them rebuffing your offer. And at least in Jon's
letter he references a conversation that he's had with you; and obviously I don't know if that conversation is done
verbatim. But it implied that what you had told him was based on where Simon's stock is currently, almost $200; that
that would imply $100 for Macerich. So I'm just curious how you think about that as well as their campaign.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I'm not – I'm not – put it this way, I'm not surprised by Land and Buildings and
Orange's, that they might pursue something like this or others. But as you can see from their proxy materials, we are
not participating or providing any financial support in their proxy. But I'm not surprised that someone like them would
take up this particular issue. But again, we're not – this is not us, this is them. And I said to you, you can see it from
their preliminary proxy stuff that we're not supporting or involved in that at all. And as a shareholder we'll wait and see
what happens.

<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Right. I guess as a shareholder, when they came out after rebuffing your offer for the
final time, when they put out their presentation of the plan forward, I guess as a shareholder would you have wanted to
know how they achieve a price equal to or greater than the offer that you had put on the table? And I guess did that
surprise you that that wasn't in there?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look that's up for Macerich to respond to. I mean I can only tell you what I told you
earlier, which is, I think we put a hell of a deal on the table, and I was looking to engage with Art. I consider Art a peer.
We've had a good relationship. People say hostile offer. I don't – let me give you my thinking on this, anytime
somebody offers a lot of money to somebody, I never consider that hostile. Okay. Now it may not be – it maybe
unsolicited, but it ain't hostile...
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: [indiscernible] (1:11:38)
<A - David E. Simon>: Okay. It ain't hostile. So I hope Art and the board realizes that I didn't view it as hostile, I view
it – sure, it was unsolicited, but it was a hell of an offer done in the spirit of trying to negotiate a deal at a big number.
And I'll leave it at that. It's yesterday's news, but I'll leave it at that. But it was not hostile; unsolicited, absolutely. But
again anytime – I think I'm a simpleton when it comes to this, but anytime you offer a big number to somebody, I don't
view that as hostile, I just view that as of the way of the world I guess.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Okay. Thanks, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: All right. No worries.
Operator
There are no further questions in queue. I'll now turn the call over to David for closing remarks.
David E. Simon
All right. Thank you, everyone, and take care and we'll talk to you soon.
