MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Medtronic fourth quarter earnings conference
call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and after the speakers' remarks there will be
a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Ryan Weispfenning. Please go ahead.
Ryan Weispfenning
Great. Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fourth quarter conference call and webcast.
During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill,
Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017
which ended on April 28, 2017. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our
performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered
forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking

statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our
periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking
statement.
In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website,
investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results, increasing or decreasing, are
in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis.
References to annual results, increasing or decreasing, are in comparison to fiscal year 2016 and rates and ranges are
given on a constant currency and constant week basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency
translation and the extra week that was in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.
Finally, other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported
as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the
reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning and thank you, Ryan. Thank you to everyone for joining us.
This morning we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.9 billion, representing growth of 5%. Non-GAAP diluted
earnings per share were $1.33, growing at 6%.
Before providing more detail on our quarterly performance, I'd like to recap fiscal 2017, a solid year for Medtronic. We
delivered record revenue of $29.7 billion, growing approximately 5%, in the mid-single digits for the fifth consecutive
year. We made progress in each of our growth strategies. In therapy innovation, we executed a steady cadence of
meaningful product launches as well as introducing some groundbreaking new technologies. In globalization, we
expanded access to our therapies in emerging markets, resulting in double-digit growth. And in economic value, we
continued to extend our industry leadership in developing value-based healthcare solutions.
The integration of Covidien progressed as planned. We have now realized over $600 million in synergy savings and
remain on track to deliver our goal of $850 million of total cost savings by the end of the next fiscal year. This
operational productivity coupled with our revenue growth were key contributors to delivering double-digit EPS growth
and generating over $5.5 billion of free cash flow.
We strategically deployed our capital in line with our stated priorities, balancing the return of cash to our shareholders
together with disciplined reinvestment in our businesses. We met our commitment of returning greater than 50% of our
free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and net share repurchases.
In addition, we invested approximately $1.5 billion in several strategic investments and five tuck-in acquisitions, and
we expect these acquisitions to further enhance our revenue growth and improve returns over time. Finally, late in the
fiscal year we announced the sale of a portion of our PMR [Patient Monitoring & Recovery] division to Cardinal
Health for $6.1 billion as part of our disciplined portfolio management strategy.
But most importantly, in fiscal year 2017, together with our physician partners, we served 70 million patients, more
patients in more places around the world than any year in our history. It is incredible that two patients around the world
are benefiting from Medtronic therapies and services every second. I am very proud of our more than 88,000 dedicated
employees for all that they accomplished in fiscal 2017 and all that we can accomplish going forward as we continue to
fulfill the Medtronic mission.
Moving now to fourth quarter performance, we had a strong finish to our fiscal year 2017, delivering over 5% revenue
growth. CVG, MITG, RTG, and Diabetes all grew in the mid-single digits. Geographically, we also demonstrated solid
balanced performance with mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. and non-U.S. developed markets, and double-digit
growth in emerging markets. Complementing our solid revenue growth, our operating margin and cash flow continued

to improve as expected.
Our performance continues to be fueled by our three growth strategies, therapy innovation, globalization, and economic
value. We're creating distinct competitive advantages and capitalizing on the long-term trends in healthcare; namely,
the desire to improve clinical outcomes, the growing demand for expanded access to care, and the optimization of cost
and efficiency within healthcare systems. These trends along with an aging population in most countries produce
secular growth tailwinds that we believe represent sustainable long-term opportunities from Medtronic.
Now let's discuss our fourth quarter performance against each of our growth strategies. In therapy innovation, we
continue to see strong adoption of our innovative products across all our groups. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group,
which grew 5%, we're leveraging the breadth of our products and services as well as our strong positions in important
rapidly expanding markets to drive sustainable growth. Combined, our TAVR, insertable diagnostics, AF ablation,
LVADs, and drug-coated balloons are now annualizing at nearly $3 billion and growing at over 20%. In our Cardiac
Rhythm implantables business, we recently received CMS approval for reimbursement coverage in the U.S. for Micra,
the world's smallest pacemaker. Also, as announced last week, we now have U.S. approval for the first MRI-Safe
quadripolar CRT [cardiac resynchronization therapy] pacing system.
In TAVR, we delivered mid-30% growth and increased our market share sequentially in both the U.S. and Europe on
the continued launch of our Evolut R 34-millimeter valve. In coronary, we just received FDA approval of the Resolute
Onyx drug-eluting stent at the start of the fiscal year. And looking ahead, we expect continued strong growth in TAVR,
driven by the Evolut PRO valve, an intermediate risk indication expansion. And in coronary, we expect the recent
approval of the Resolute Onyx will turn the mid-20% U.S. DES sales declines that we experienced in fiscal 2017 into
meaningful growth this coming fiscal year.
In our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which grew 6%, we had high single-digit growth in Surgical Solutions,
driven by new products in advanced energy and advanced stapling. In Advanced Energy, we continue to roll out three
new LigaSure instruments with a nano coating that helps reduce instrument cleaning, which improves surgical
procedure efficiency. And we continue to see strength in the ValleyLab FT10 energy platform. In Advanced Stapling,
results were driven by the sustained adoption of our endo stapling specialty reloads. We also launched Signia, a new
single-handed powered surgical stapler that provides surgeons with real-time feedback during surgery. These new
products continue to facilitate the move of open surgical procedures to minimally invasive, resulting in better patient
outcomes and lower healthcare costs.
In Patient Monitoring & Recovery, our above-market growth was driven by the strength in our PB 980 Ventilator, our
Capnostream 20 Bedside Capnography Monitor, capnography disposables, as well as our Nellcor Pulse Oximetry
products.
Our Restorative Therapies Group grew 5% this quarter, with strong contributions from our Spine, Brain, and Specialty
Therapies division. Our Spine division grew 3% and again gained market share. Core Spine grew in the low single
digits, continuing to benefit from our Speed-to-Scale initiative as we continue to launch a series of new products,
including the Solera Voyager and
Elevate expandable cage. In addition, Infuse sales were strong, growing in the double digits.
Our Brain Therapies division grew 9% driven by double-digit growth in Neurovascular and Neurosurgery. In
Neurosurgery, our StealthStation S8 surgical navigation system received strong surgeon enthusiasm at the American
Academy of Neurological Surgeons annual conference last month. While we launched it late in the fourth quarter, we
expect it to result in accelerating sales growth next fiscal year.
Turning to our Diabetes Group, the growth rate of 4% decelerated sequentially as we predicted, ahead of the full launch
of the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system. Despite this, we gained insulin pump share in both the U.S. and
international markets, driven by strong clinician and consumer demand for our 6-Series pumps. In the U.S., direct
pump shipments to consumers grew over 20%. In CGM, we grew in the low-20s and are seeing strong growth globally
as more patients transition to our sensor-augmented pumps.

Regarding the U.S. launch of the MiniMed 670G, we have approximately 750 people taking part in our customer
training phase. The feedback has been extremely positive with a continued increase in patient satisfaction levels. We're
preparing for a broader launch in June to the more than 20,000 pump users that are enrolled in our Priority Access
program. As stated before, we do not expect revenue growth to ramp substantially until after we have fulfilled the
Priority Access orders given the low revenue associated with the upgrade program. Our product pipeline remains robust
across all our groups with a number of important near-term growth catalysts. We remain confident that our new
therapies can drive sustainable growth next fiscal year and beyond.
Next, let's turn to globalization. Emerging markets grew 10% as we continue to expand the access to our products and
services around the world. In addition to ongoing traditional market development, we are executing on differentiated
strategies, namely structuring partnerships with both governments and the private sector as well as optimizing our
distribution channels. We believe that these initiatives will not only position us for long-term leadership in emerging
markets, but also will accelerate growth and lead to sustained market and performance.
In the Middle East, we continue to face challenges in the macroeconomic environment causing our revenue to decline
in the mid-single digits. However, in Saudi Arabia, our largest market in the region, we're encouraged by the relatively
stable sequential revenue we have delivered for the past two quarters albeit at a lower base given the large
year-over-year declines experienced earlier this fiscal year.
In other regions around the world, we delivered strong double-digit growth in China, Latin America, and Southeast
Asia and a high single-digit growth in Eastern Europe. In China, we grew in the low-teens with double-digit growth
across CVG, MITG, and RTG largely driven by strong growth in pacemakers, Advanced Stapling, and Neurovascular.
In addition, we're seeing success from our expansion into Chinese 2-tier cities and private hospitals. In Latin America,
we had high-teens growth led by strong results in RTG, Surgical Solutions, and Coronary & Structural Heart. Brazil,
Mexico, Chile, and Argentina all grew double digits. And in Southeast Asia which grew in the low-20s, we executed a
number of channel optimization initiatives including moving to direct distribution models in certain businesses in
Indonesia and the Philippines.
Overall, the consistency of our emerging market performance benefits greatly from geographic diversification,
reducing dependence in any single market. We continue to believe that the penetration of existing therapies into
emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in MedTech over the long-term.
Turning now to our third growth strategy, economic value, as we continue to see success in our hospital solutions
business which grew double digits as we're now managing cath labs and operating rooms for more than 130 customers
around the world. Also, we continue to execute our value-based healthcare signature programs. One of these is TYRX,
our anti-infection envelope for implantable devices, which is an example of where technology change directly results in
a clear and measurable value to the healthcare system without any dependence on other variables. Since launching our
value-based program, TYRX, earlier this calendar year we have outcome-based contracts in place at over 140 accounts,
helping drive over 20% revenue growth in TYRX in the fourth quarter. Infection control from implantable devices is a
large opportunity as in the U.S. alone over 6,000 patients are infected annually.
We're aggressively developing other unique value-based healthcare solutions across each of our groups. And while
we're still early in this journey, we remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value
and improve patient outcomes over volume. As always, we expect to do this in a way that benefits patients, healthcare
systems, as well as our shareholders.
Before turning the call over to Karen, I'd like to highlight the agreement that we reached in the fourth quarter to divest a
portion of our Patient Monitoring & Recovery division to Cardinal Health. We were pleased to receive clearance from
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission last week and continue to expect this transaction to close in our second quarter of
fiscal year 2018. This is a positive transaction for all involved, including our shareholders and employees who, we
believe, will thrive under this change in ownership. We're committed to disciplined portfolio management and we
reached a conclusion that these businesses, while truly meaningful to patients in need, are best suited under ownership
that can provide the investment and focus that these businesses require.

Upon closing, this transaction will have an immediate positive impact on our revenue growth rates and margins with
modest near-term earnings dilution. We intend to continue investing over the long-term and internal and external
opportunities that are more directly in line with our growth strategies and focus on strong financial returns.
With that, let me ask Karen to now take you through a more detailed look at the drivers for our fourth quarter financial
results. Karen?
Karen L. Parkhill
Thank you, Omar.
Our fourth quarter revenue of $7.916 billion increased 5% both as reported and on a constant currency basis. Foreign
currency had a negative $37 million impact on fourth quarter revenue, and acquisitions contributed approximately 110
basis points to revenue growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.84, non-GAAP was $1.33. After adjusting for
the $0.02 negative impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 6%. Our operating margin for the
quarter was 30.7% on a constant currency basis, representing a year-over-year improvement of 40 basis points. With
the impact of currency included, our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin also improved, increasing 10 basis
points year over year.
We continue to cover the earnings dilution from our recent acquisition which means we maintained earnings
expectations while realizing incremental acquisition revenue. Taking into account currency and the acquisitions that we
have done in the past year, our operating margin improvement on an organic basis was approximately 70 basis points in
the quarter. The operating margin improvement was driven in part by efficiencies as we continue to deliver on our
Covidien synergies. This was partially offset by purposeful investments we made in sales and marketing ahead of
important upcoming product launches.
Net other expense was $48 million compared to income of $21 million in the prior year due in large part to lower net
gains from our foreign exchange hedging program. Our full year operating margin improved 140 basis points on an
organic basis which takes into account the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions we have done within the past year,
and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. This solid operating margin improvement was within our expected
range for the year.
Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $196 million, a sequential increase driven in part by our debt
issuance in March. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $33.4 billion in debt and $13.7 billion in cash and
investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 17%,
in line with our expectations. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.381 billion
shares.
Turning to shareholder payout, in fiscal 2017 we paid $2.4 billion in dividends and repurchased a net $3.1 billion of our
ordinary shares. This represented a total payout ratio of 86% on non-GAAP net income and 136% on GAAP net
income. Keep in mind, our payout ratio is elevated as we have been continuing to not only return 50% of our annual
free cash flow to shareholders but also execute the $5 billion incremental share repurchase commitment we made
through fiscal year 2018.
Before moving to our income statement guidance, I want to reinforce our commitment to strong free cash flow
generation which we recognize is an important driver of long-term shareholder value. In fiscal year 2017, our free cash
flow was $5.6 billion, in line with our guidance and representing very strong year-over-year growth of 35%. This
growth was well above our long-term expectation to grow free cash flow in the high-single-digit range, roughly in line
with earnings, and it's primarily due to the timing of litigation and tax items that affected our income statement in fiscal
2017 but won't impact cash flow until fiscal 2018.
As you know, cash flow is subject to large claims in discreet items and, as we have demonstrated this year, can also be
affected by timing. Going forward, we will talk about cash flow growth against a longer multi-year view, and as such
we would expect our free cash flow to grow in the high-single digits compounded annually from fiscal year 2016 to

fiscal year 2018.
Now, looking at the picture ahead. To avoid confusion, our guidance for this next fiscal year does not yet take into
account the impact of the planned divestitures. We intend to update our guidance upon close of the transaction. For
fiscal year 2018, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 5% on both an organic basis
and after taking into account the year-over-year benefit from the acquisitions we completed early last fiscal year.
By business group, we expect CVG to grow in the range of 5% to 6%, MITG to grow in the range of 3% to 4%, RTG
to grow approximately 4%, and Diabetes to grow in the 10% to 12% range, increasing from the first half to the second
as we fully launch 670G beyond our Priority Access program.
Looking at the fourth quarter, we would expect total Medtronic revenue growth to be similar to the annual range. But
keep in mind that in the first quarter we will be fulfilling the 670G Priority Access program, so we would expect
Diabetes growth to be similar to the past quarter and ramp throughout the year.
We expect solid operating margin improvement in fiscal year 2018, with greater strength in the back half of the fiscal
year. We expect our gross margin on a constant currency basis to be flat to slightly improved throughout the fiscal year,
with modest pricing pressure offset by operating improvement. Given historical and current foreign exchange rates, we
expect currency to negatively affect the gross margin in the first half of the year, with a greater impact in the first
quarter than the second.
SG&A as a percent of revenue is expected to improve next fiscal year, particularly in the back half as we continue to
realize additional Covidien synergies in our enabling functions and transition to Centers of Excellence. However, in the
first half of the fiscal year we expect SG&A as a percent of revenue to remain relatively flat from the first quarter to the
second as we invest in sales and marketing from important new indications and product launches, including TAVR,
immediate risk, Resolute Onyx, and the 670G.
Given our recent debt issuance and the purposeful liquidation of some of our investments, we expect net interest
expense to moderately increase over the level just reported in the fourth quarter. And while difficult to predict given a
dependency on our stock price movement, we expect a slight tax benefit from the accounting change for excess benefit
on stock options we will implement in fiscal year 2018.
With respect to earnings, we expect fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow in the range of 9%
to 10% on a constant currency basis, with higher growth in the back half of the year as we fully launch important new
products and realize additional savings in SG&A as mentioned. In addition to these items, given the tax benefit we had
in the first half of fiscal 2017 that are not expected to repeat we would expect first quarter EPS to be in the upper end of
the high-single-digit range, with the second quarter in the mid-single-digit range both on a constant currency basis.
While the impact from currency is fluid, and therefore not something we forecast, if recent exchange rates which
include $1.12/euro and ¥111 remain stable for the fiscal year, our full year revenue would be positively affected by
approximately $75 million to $175 million. Given historical and current rates, the impact from foreign currency would
be a headwind in the first half of the fiscal year, including approximately $10 million to $60 million negative impact to
revenue in the first quarter and shift to a tailwind with us comparing against the stronger dollar in the second half.
Full-year EPS would be negatively affected by approximately $0.05 to $0.10, including a negative impact of
approximately $0.03 to $0.05 in the first quarter.
As Omar mentioned, we expect the divestiture of a portion of our Patient Monitoring & Recovery division to Cardinal
Health to close in our second fiscal quarter. As stated upon announcement, the transaction is expected to result in
modest net dilution to our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings per share, in a range of approximately $0.12 to $0.18, with
the exact amount primarily dependent on the closing date of the transaction. The transaction is expected to improve our
comparable constant currency revenue growth rate and non-GAAP comparable constant currency operating margins by
approximately 50 basis points each. As previously stated, we intend to allocate $1 billion of the after-tax proceeds to an
incremental share repurchase in fiscal 2018, with the balance used to reduce debt.
Now, I will return the call back to Omar.

Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Karen.
To conclude, Q4 was a strong finish to the fiscal year, with balanced, diversified growth across our groups and regions.
Along with the mid-single-digit revenue growth, our organization delivered meaningful operating margin improvement
and double-digit EPS growth as well as growth in free cash flow in fiscal 2017.
Looking ahead, I want to reiterate our longer-term commitment to drive not only mid-single-digit constant currency
revenue growth and double-digit constant currency EPS growth, but also our focus on long-term value creation through
strong free cash flow and strategic capital allocation, balancing return of cash to our shareholders with disciplined
reinvestment to fuel future growth.
We will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of CVG; Bryan
Hanson, President of MITG; Geoff Martha, President of RTG; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group,
to join us. We want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question
and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have any additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor
Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Good morning, two strategic questions to start off and I'll jump back in queue. The first is
on cap deployment and the second one on margins. And maybe, Omar or Karen, on capital deployment, if we think
about the last access to cash you've had between Puerto Rico and in the Cardinal assets, it's about $8 billion. $7 billion
of that is going to go into debt repayment. So can you just talk about the messaging for shareholders here about
repaying that debt? It's a big commitment to debt holders. What does it tell us about your interest in growth-minded
M&A or, frankly, larger what some would call more transformational M&A? And then I have a quick question on
margins. Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: First of all, we've stated our capital allocation policies, and we're following that. Second, we've
got a big transaction with this divestiture that's coming up, and we're really focused on that. Third, our strategy for
acquisitions we've said all along, which is a disciplined strategy of looking at companies which fit our strategic goals
that give us returns above our cost of capital over the long term, and that either doesn't have any or minimizes any
dilution to present income. And those are the strategies we look at, and the size is secondary in all of that. It's really the
strategic goals of the company and whether it fits or not is what we look for. But right now our focus really is on this
divestiture. Karen, do you want to add?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: I would just add that in the nearer term, we are focused on fulfilling our commitment to
reduce our leverage post the Covidien acquisition, and that's exactly what we're doing. Over the longer term, we are
focused on reinvestment to drive stronger growth and better margins in the longer term.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay, that's very clear. And then, Karen, I just want to come on fiscal 2018 guidance. By
our math, it implies about 80 or 90 basis points of margin expansion, and that's the lower hand of the placeholder you
set down or the company has set down last year, 70 to 140 basis points. So is this merely a refinement as we get closer
to the year, some conservatism, and what does it tell us about your commitment to delivering those longer-term targets
of 500 to 600 basis points or better? Thank you.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Thanks for the question, David. We are very focused on driving operating margin
improvement and leverage. We cannot get to our double-digit bottom line on our mid-single-digit top line without
driving that operating leverage improvement. So we are focused on driving solid plans going forward and executing

recognizing we need to get the leverage in between, but not focus as much on the exact basis points of leverage in
between because that can vary in any period.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Karen, a couple financial items first.
First one, the IRS appeal of the decision on Puerto Rico and that apparent delay to the resolution of that. How does that
impact the debt paydown plan and basically the assumption on cash flows and your use of cash flows in FY 2018?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Thank you for the question. So the IRS did recently request to appeal the Tax Court's
decision. We do expect this to delay the ultimate outcome and the movement of cash. Until the IRS files their opening
brief, which we expect in the first quarter, we won't have a better estimate on the length of the delay. We do still
believe our initially filed returns were correct, and we continue to defend that position.
In terms of the movement of cash and the debt paydown, we do anticipate to use, obviously, the proceeds from the
divestiture to pay down debt. And our leverage target of getting to around 3 times at the end of this fiscal year and
continuing to be focused on maintaining an A credit rating do not include the expected proceeds of the Puerto Rico
settlement.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay, perfect. You made a comment about the impact on tax of ASU 2016-09 adoption.
What is the EPS impact? Do you have an estimate? Is it about $0.05?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: It is included in our guidance of 9% to 10% EPS growth. And so we're not giving an exact
amount on that mainly because it is dependent on our stock price movement on the exercise of our options, which are
inherently very difficult to predict. We do expect that change to give us a slight tax benefit in the next year.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. Then last item, just on 670G launch, so I want to make sure we're all thinking about
just the timing of this ramp, not only in terms of what it means for revenues but in terms of share gains. Is it fair to
assume that you really go on the offensive, going at what I would characterize as non-Medtronic patients more in the
second half of FY 2018 versus the first half because right now you're obviously done with the initial customer feedback
side of your launch. Then in June you're going to the existing Medtronic patients. Will it be more second half of the
year before you're really in a position to go out and take market share?
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: Hey, Mike. This is Hooman. I'll answer the question. First, maybe a little bit of
perspective on the fourth quarter because we were going through Priority Access there. And as was indicated in the
commentary, even with Priority Access we actually saw a strong performance relative to the market and our peers. So
with the 630 and Priority Access, we gained over 4 points of durable pump market share in the fourth quarter. The
other thing I'd point out that I think is worthy of note is that globally our CGM sales grew in the low-20s because of the
sensor attachment to all of these pumps. So even though we're going through Priority Access fulfillment right now in
Q1 and we expect, as Karen mentioned, a ramp from Q1 to Q4, I think we're going to really put ourselves in a position
to continue to take market share. And as we think about the full year, we feel really good that we're going to be able to
end the year not only with market share gains but also double-digit growth.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Okay. Thanks, Mike. Crystal, can we go to the next question please?

Yes, sir. It comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Great, thank you and good morning.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: First of all, congrats on a strong finish to the year. I guess for my first question, I just wanted
to clarify the fiscal 2018 guidance because there wasn't actually an EPS given. So I think I've got this straight but you're
saying off of a $4.60 number for fiscal 2017, underlying earnings growth of 9% to 10% less the $0.05 to $0.10 from FX
and then there's, obviously, the $0.12 to $0.18 we need to think about for Cardinal. So question number one is, is that
right? Do I have all the moving pieces correct? And then this is nitpicking a little bit but I'm just curious on fiscal 2018,
why that 9% to 10% is just a little bit below the double-digit goal that you talk about long-term.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: No, thanks for the question, Bob. You have the right end analysis and we did say that we
will update the guidance post the close of the divestiture just to avoid confusion. But the dilutive impact on the EPS is
right. That $0.12 to $0.18 is dependent on when we close the acquisition. We still expect close in the second quarter but
we don't know if it'll be the beginning of the second quarter or the end of the second quarter. So that's why we have the
range. In terms of the $0.09 to $0.10 EPS growth...
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: 9% or 10%.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: ...9% to 10% EPS growth, we obviously are fully committed to our mid-single digit top line
and double-digit bottom line growth over the longer-term. In this fiscal year, our top end of that range is clearly double
digits. Impacting the lower end of that range is the fact that we have a temporary increase in our interest expense this
fiscal year given the slight increase in our debt as we focus on repaying it down with the proceeds, so it's a temporary
impact. And then we also do have a purposeful investment in SG&A in the first half of the year as we get ready to
launch very important new products.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Great, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then, Omar, one bigger picture question for you. I'd
love to get your views on something that we've been trying to ask a lot of MedTech management teams lately given
how well the medical device space is doing. If you look at the earnings reports from the hospital companies, their
volumes aren't really doing much. But the medical device space, it seems like surgical procedure volumes are growing
at a very nice clip. So what are you seeing out there as you exited your fiscal year in terms of surgical procedure
volumes and kind of what's your outlook for the rest of this year? And, again, I ask the question because it just seems
like MedTech is different than hospital volumes right now.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think your observation is correct. And as you said, our surgical volumes are hanging in there.
They're stable. I wouldn't say that they're growing in an upward trend or anything but they're certainly stable, and I see
that to continue. I would like to point out, though, that the MedTech markets do swing a little more based on new
product introductions especially in the U.S. which is what I think you're looking at. We've had some pretty important
launches in the last six months or so and also important ones going forward as we've mentioned. So I think you should
probably take that into account, that technology introductions do give a swing to the MedTech space that probably
hospitals in general wouldn't see. I think that's the best I can do.
<Q - Robert Hopkins>: Terrific. Thank you very much.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, Bob. Crystal, can we go to the next question please?

You're maybe on mute. Your line is open, Vijay.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Hey, guys. Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes, yes. We can.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Excellent. So congratulations on a well-rounded quarter here. Just maybe on the guidance,
Karen. That 4% to 5% constant currency growth for fiscal 2018, it looks like maybe M&A is less than 50 bps. So I just
want to make sure the organic for fiscal 2018 is still about 4%. I think that's what the guidance is implying.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Yes, that's correct, Vijay. Our guidance for revenue would be on an organic basis and
including the impact from acquisitions that will benefit us more in the first part of the year given that we acquired these
assets at the beginning of last fiscal year.
<Q - Vijay Kumar>: Got you. And then maybe, Omar, one for you. Obviously, margin expansion has been a huge
focus for the company. Gross margin performance in the quarter was really impressive. For us we thought CVG which
– that's your highest margin segment – it came in line. MITG, RTG came in well above despite that gross margins came
in well above. Maybe can you just talk about what's going on within the margins and how confident do you feel about
margin expansion over the medium-term? Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: As we've mentioned before, as we transition out of getting margin improvement from the
Covidien synergies to the future, a gross margin improvement through operations consolidation is going to be one of
our biggest growth drivers in that area or productivity drivers in that area. And as we do that, as you point out, you will
see benefit across all groups because operations consolidations take advantage of common facilities, and that drives this
proportional increase in some of the areas. So I would say that that is one of our key strategic drivers. It's one that we're
focused on. It's the first big transformational element of productivity that we're focused on as we come out of the
Covidien synergy period which will really be finished by the end of this coming fiscal year. So that's what we expect to
see and we expect to see continued improvement in gross margin and, as Karen pointed out in the guidance, we expect
some improvement in the coming year.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Great. Thanks, Vijay. Crystal, next question please.

It comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: I wanted to start with a big picture question on 2018 guidance. Can you just speak a little bit to your
underlying assumptions for the CapEx and utilization backdrop in the U.S.? There's clearly a lot of policy uncertainty
out there so I appreciate just sort of your baseline assumption there.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Well the CapEx, our business is, overall, less dependent on CapEx but at the same time you've
to remember that the CapEx that we have is very linked to procedures. These are not necessarily diagnostic procedures,
these are actual therapy procedures and, therefore, it is often funded by growth in those procedures. So I think it's better
to see our business more in line with the volumes of procedures rather than CapEx investments in general. So I think
that's probably a better way to look at our business rather than specifically CapEx investments.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: In terms of CapEx hitting our cash flow, we would anticipate approximately $1 billion over
the next two to three years, in line with what we've had over the last couple of years. Our spending on IT investment
should come down over the next one to two years but that will be offset by investments in our manufacturing
consolidation strategy.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Thanks for that. Maybe just to clarify. My question, Omar, was really not so – I appreciate your
business sense. I wasn't talking so much about capital equipment purchasing but just the general preponderance for

hospitals to spend on new technology and then at the same time utilization in terms of overall healthcare volume.
Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah. No, I think, look, the new technology, we've seen that when meaningful new technology
comes out in our space it comes out with good clinical evidence that says that if you deploy these they have meaningful
benefit for patients. And in general, we've seen if reimbursement is there, which we usually make sure it is, then there's
pretty good adoption when new technology comes in and we see the market and, basically, share go up with the
introduction of those new products. So I think that's really the biggest driver of any market swings in the MedTech
space in the U.S.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So two financial questions from me. So,
Omar, you grew about 5% in fiscal 2017 on a constant currency week-adjusted basis and you're guiding to 4% to 5% in
fiscal 2018 despite the fact you have a lot of new product launches and important new indications. So the question is
kind of why didn't you feel comfortable kind of guiding to 4% to 6%? It's a little bit like Bob's earlier question on the
9% to 10%. It's a little bit nitpicky. And so what areas might slow in fiscal 2018 relative to fiscal 2017?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Look, we just wanted to provide a slightly tighter range than a generic mid-single-digit range
which we could have, but we just wanted to give a slightly tighter range, and I think that's where that came from. I
think that what we've seen in this past fiscal year is we're seeing some movement in the quarter. There's some level of
uncertainty in marketplaces always. So we just wanted to make sure that we can hit the guidance that we put out there. I
think the trend that we have right now with our new products would suggest that we should be able to deliver within
that range.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: All right. Fair enough. Karen, I'm sorry. Were you going to say something?
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: No. The only thing that I would add is that we're focused on delivering consistent reliable
growth.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Fair enough. And then, Karen, one for you. You had FX swing from I think it was negative
$100 million to negative $300 million to positive $75 million to $175 million or a swing of about $325 million at the
midpoint from negative to positive, but the EPS impact remained kind of negative, $0.05 to $0.15. And I know
everybody realizes you hedge but do we ever, at some point, see the benefit from the change in currency on the top
line? Do we ever see that benefit on the bottom line? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Yeah. No, thank you for the question. We do expect, if current rates remain stable to where
they are today, a positive impact to revenue for the year, as you mentioned of $75 million to $175 million and a
negative EPS impact of $0.05 to $0.10. That mismatch is really driven by the fact that the FX impact on revenue is
based on rates versus a year ago put simply, but the impact on gross margin is based on the time the inventory has been
on our balance sheet. So that can mean you can have differences between the top and bottom line impact. But I think
it's important to note for this fiscal year at least in any case that that $0.05 to $0.10 negative impact on the bottom line
is only a small headwind compared to previous years.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Thanks for taking the questions, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask a more detailed question
maybe about the CVG guidance because you are forecasting 5% to 6% and outlined a couple of product launches that
you're going to be spending behind. So I thought it would be worth talking about those, more specifically with Onyx
coming to market here and then intermediate risk and then Micra is new, too. So could you give us some color or
commentary on those things and what's really driving the CVG growth?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I'll let Mike answer that question. So go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Yeah. Well we're heading into a particularly, I think, a productive phase for new product
introductions. Obviously, the 34-millimeter valve is now available in the U.S. and in Europe, and impacted the fourth
quarter. We got the approval for Evolut PRO which is our next-generation transcatheter valve in the U.S. That really
didn't have an impact on Q4 but will in Q1, and that will follow on with European approval in the first half of next
year. And then as you mentioned, Onyx in the U.S is now approved. It didn't really impact Q4 but will for the rest of
the fiscal 2018. Micra and our CRT-P quad, the MRI – I think – compatible CRT-P quad will also have meaningful
impact on the quarter. And then as we move through the summer, we expect expansion of intermediate risk for
CoreValve as well as Onyx approval in Japan. And in the second half, we'll be looking at destination therapy for the
HeartWare technology as well as drug-coated balloon approval in Japan. So those will be the big drivers of our growth
in FY 2018.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Great, and maybe just a bigger picture question for Omar and Karen. I'm just wondering, your
emerging market growth is about 10%, and you've talked for a long time about aspirational goals that are higher than
that. Obviously, you highlighted a lot of the moving parts with different geographies this quarter. But I guess what do
you need to do to be able to push that rate up over time, or is it just more of a function of how the macro environment
is?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think, look, we intend to move that up. That is our goal. I think the move will be gradual
rather than sudden, so expect that from us. I think there's enough macroeconomic uncertainty that what we've had is the
odd region really getting hurt by that. I want to point out that these are macroeconomic, but like the Saudi situation was
not a reduction in implant rates, so the procedures actually are pretty stable. But as these countries going to sort out
their own management of inventory and their own ability to deliver these products, they're going through these moves
which drive some constraints in the sale of these products. So I'm not sure that they're all necessarily bad as these
markets stabilize over time, and we're encouraged by the fact that the implant rates actually, at the customer level,
continue to grow. That's one thing.
So the closer we get to these customers and the more direct we become, I think you'll start to see these rates start to go
up in a systematic fashion. If I were to point to one thing, it is our ability to go direct. I think the more we do that, the
higher our growth rates will become, not only from the immediate transition but ongoing growth as we get closer to
these customers.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: That makes sense. Thanks for the color.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, Matt. Next question, Crystal?

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Two questions, first for Mike Coyle. Mike, it looks like you
had a real solid U.S. ICD number in the quarter, and by our math it looks like you took share. And it looks like you're
taking share first because you're still the only player with MRI-Safe. And then second, St. Jude is still dealing with their

recalls. So how should we think about the ability to continue to capture share in the U.S. through this year and how
should we think about share capture as we go into calendar 2018 when St. Jude and Boston get MRI-Safe in the U.S.?
So that's for Mike.
And then for Bryan, can you quickly give us an update on the robot? I think in stages, we're talking about a launch
outside the U.S. for your surgical robot in fiscal 2018. Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So, Glenn, on ICDs, we actually did have some meaningful share capture in the U.S. from
really two sources. One was initial implant growth which was approaching mid-single digit, which is pretty good given
that the overall market was probably slightly down in terms of initial implants.
And as you pointed out, it's a combination of things, not just the MRI labeling that we have, but also some very
significant feature differentiation in each of the product categories, our Visia AF, the only single-chamber device that
can actually detect atrial fibrillation and report it out, so essentially giving you a free link with each single-chamber
device. And then the differentiated algorithms that we have within our CRT system, the AdaptivCRT, and in fact CRTs
have been shown to reduce hospitalizations for recurrent heart failure. So those are things that we think will continue to
maintain differential advantage for us even after competitors match up on the MRI side, which was not the case in
Brady, where it was more of an equalization when they came out with the technology.
But the other thing that was occurring during the quarter and we expect to continue to occur is that we've actually had a
nice improvement in share on the replacement market. And that is principally driven by that, as you point out, a major
competitive recall, but even more important by this TYRX program that was mentioned in the context of the
commentary.
Infections are particularly a problem in replacement procedures, especially with ITBs and CRT systems, and we
instituted this risk-sharing performance guarantee program where an account can actually get, if you will, insurance on
a patient coming back with an infection. We will make a major payment, 10x what the TYRX patch is worth to them to
help offset the cost of that reinfection which they will lose money on given current reimbursement rates and what they
have to do to treat those patients. That's only available if they're actually using the envelope on a Medtronic device.
And so that has actually resulted in a pretty big spike, a 50% increase in the number of devices that are going in on
competitive leads, and so that is really helping us to drive growth.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay, great. And then, Bryan, on the robot?
<A - Bryan Hanson>: Glenn, thanks for the question. Finally, in the fiscal year we were planning on launching the
robotic system, and I got to tell you we're pretty excited about it. It's at the end of year unfortunately. I wish it was in
the beginning, but it's at the end of the year.
I will remind everyone that we don't expect material revenue in 2018. We do expect material revenue in 2019, as we've
been saying. But I want to make sure that we refocus everybody on our intent here. Though we did a robotic system,
our goal isn't necessarily just to compete in robotics. This is a part of a much broader strategy for us. The fact is we've
got a lot of open procedures today that we truly believe should be done minimally invasively, and I'm perfectly fine
with them being done minimally invasively in a traditional sense or robotics. But either way, if we can do that we can,
number one, fulfill the mission of the organization because these patients will be treated in a much better way from an
outcomes perspective, and all other stakeholders win when we make this move from open to MIS.
The other byproduct to this though which we're really focused on is we don't have to add an additional patient to the
surgical funnel. But if we can make this shift from open to any form of minimally invasive surgery, we can add a $10
billion marketplace. So that's a $10 billion prize without a single new patient just changing the way the patient is
treated. And we do feel that there will be some period of time that we will be the only medical device company in the
world that will be able to offer a full complement of products in open, traditional MIS, and robotics, and on top of that
bring these optimization services to the operating room. So we're pretty excited, obviously, and looking forward to the
launch.

Your next question comes from the line of Joane Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Joanne Karen Wuensch>: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Actually, I have two. The first
one was to go back to the view towards operating synergies. As you near the end, I'll get there, of the Covidien synergy
opportunity, where else are you going to be able to pull levers to get that leverage?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Like I mentioned a little earlier and like we've stated all along, the first area that we're already
beginning to see some benefit from is in operations consolidation, in reducing our manufacturing footprint,
consolidating many of the operations that we've had around the world that we've instituted over time. So we expect
some gross margin improvement as a result of that, and that's our first focus.
Beyond that, through the Covidien integration, we've had the opportunity to put in place a new IT system in SAP, and I
think the benefits of that will play itself out over a longer period in the next few years as we reduce our back office
footprint in different centers around the world. I think those are the two big ones. I think following that, we're also
looking at creating a more efficient shared services in some functions which, again, the availability of an IT system
facilitates that as well. So those are the approaches that we're going after and we're building a pretty solid strategic road
map to execute that.
<Q - Joanne Karen Wuensch>: That's helpful. And as my second question, we're a little bit over a year on the
implementation of the CMS bundled payment program in the U.S. What observationally have you learned and how
have you incorporated that into your business practices? Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah. We're over a year into the first one, the auto program, and the uptake from different
hospitals has been relatively slow. I think we're picking up on it and I think that's progressing. We've got our own
offering that you'll start to hear about more this year. But in addition, what's equally significant is that CMS has
introduced some cardiac bundles, and we're also in the process of coming up with offerings in those areas where,
actually, we have a lot more experience and clear data that we already have of benefits that we can get by looking at the
therapy over an extended period.
So we still are supportive, very supportive of CMS's move towards these value-based bundled payments. I think these
programs have clear outcome measures. They kind of identify the patient cohorts that get these treatments. And these
are areas where we can make contributions both in the care pathway itself, working with our physician customers and
partners as well as in technologies. So we're very supportive of these and we're seeing hospitals beginning to start to
implement these procedures.
<Q - Joanne Karen Wuensch>: Thank you very much.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, Joanne. Next question please, Crystal?

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So I've got one. I wanted to dive a little deeper into the
transcatheter valve business and also, maybe, just to touch deeper into Spine. So on TAVR, put up a very strong
worldwide number, better than we were expecting and highlighted the impact of a larger-sized valve. Mike, I was
wondering if you could provide any color or tone on maybe the market by geography, for example, referrals in the U.S.
or other factors and the Lotus recall and other dynamics potentially impacting Europe. And then I had one follow-up on
Spine for Geoff.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Certainly, U.S. growth has been robust, high-30s for the U.S. market. I think it's being driven
by two things. One is penetration into the intermediate risk which, of course, we have not had the opportunity yet to
participate in beyond our clinical trial enrollment given that we don't have approval in that segment but we do expect to
get it here by the end of the summer. And then secondly, we have been taking share in the extreme and high-risk patient
population principally driven by the presence of the 34-millimeter valve. That was a segment that we've described as
being 30% of our mix, and that's proving to be true as we now normalize the market. But the other thing it does when
you obviously have that full range of products is it lets you participate more broadly in the accounts. And so we've been
expanding account penetration as well as expanding share in that segment. And obviously now, the opportunity to bring
Evolut PRO to the market given its improvement in terms of both rate of PVL as well as reductions in pacemaker rates
we think really position us well to continue to kind of grow and take share there.
Europe was much more of a share capture story as 34-millimeter came in later there. So it's seeing the same dynamic in
the U.S. but we also obviously have the benefit of some market dynamics there, with the Lotus recall opening an
opportunity for us to take some additional share as well. So we had meaningful sequential share capture taking place
there. There are obviously other dynamics there with some of the short loading of shelves in Germany that was done by
one of our competitors, that even when we strip that out we see very significant share capture. And obviously
continuing momentum in the OUS markets, probably low-20s overall growth for TAVR. So I think that pretty much
summarizes where the market is.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: And just to clarify, one of your colleagues in the U.S. market had talked about – peers, I should
say, maybe not colleagues – had talked about smaller centers kind of surprising to the upside in terms of productivity.
Any color on that dynamic, that kind of core centers versus some of the newer TAVR centers?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: There's certainly a lot of attention in terms of improving the productivity of patient flow
through those centers, and we're seeing that. So I think that is opening up capacity, but we're also seeing more centers
actually now being able to qualify to be TAVR centers. And so that number is well over 500 now and we continue to
participate, and probably 450 of those are going to expand and move into the intermediate risks. So I think all centers
realize how important it is to be able to participate here given the patient demand and just the clinical benefits for
patients to get TAVR technology. So we continue to see the ability for capacity to grow within the existing centers and
then for new centers to come on stream.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Thank you, Mike. And then, Geoff, the numbers for Spine were also better than expected in a
market that, frankly, in the first quarter was maybe a little slower than we expected when we look across the group in
general. And I wanted to just get a sense in the U.S. in particular if we maybe just focus on not so much the
double-digit, low-double-digit BMP growth but the core implants and rest of the business. The robots, any other
initiatives? You mentioned a couple of products. What you'd call out in the U.S. that's helping sort of maybe
reinvigorate that business a little bit?
<A - Geoffrey Straub Martha>: Sure. I'd say excluding Biologics and Infuse to answer your question, I'd say there's
three things. One, it's a steady launch of these new products in core Spines, whether it be interbody cages or fixation; a
steady launch of those and doing that, like we've talked about before, at scale. So we have a big sales force and a lot of
physician partners, so we're launching these things in a steady cadence, a purposeful cadence, that's tied to procedures
and when we launch them, we launch them in scale. All the sets, all the training, all of that is happening in a tight
window, a much tighter window than we used to. We used to do this over nine quarters; we're now doing it over at two
and that is having an impact in of itself. So the number of products in a steady cadence and then the way we're

launching it, the speed, the scale we've been talking about.
The second is the surgical synergy strategy. So our view on – a lot of people like to call it robotics and I think that's
kind of a shallow thinking quite frankly. As we look at this, it's way beyond the robotic arm. It's a bunch of
inner-enabling technologies like navigation or operating imaging, the robotic arm, surgical planning. All of this
technology come together to go after these procedures and lower the cost or improve the clinical outcome. We're now
placing a lot of that technology in exchange for incremental implant volume, and so that is having another impact. So
that's the second big impact because as we place that equipment in exchange for incremental screw volume.
And then the third is our sales force is reinvigorated. They're seeing all of these coming and what the future holds, and
so they're very excited. And a lot of the competitive reps that are coming are also helping as well.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: That's very helpful color. Thanks, Geoff.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Great. Thanks, Matt. We'll take one more question please, Crystal.
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust Robinson.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Good morning. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. A couple quick questions for Mike and
then one for Omar. So, Mike, at EuroPCR and I was really struck by the net clinical benefit of left atrial appendage
closure, given the limitations of oral anticoagulant therapy is Medtronic in play and how big do you think that market
could get? Secondly, from the podium at the Mitral Conclave, it was kind of hinted at that the U.S. pivotal for
transcatheter mitral valve replacement might start this year 2017. How big is that trial? How long might it take?
And then for Omar, I met with a TAVR company from China yesterday, and the price point's $25,000 but
reimbursement is only to the tune of 30% or so. So the question is should we forever think of some of these emerging
markets as low technology or basic technology plays or might that situation for high-tech stuff change over time?
Thanks so much.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Bruce, thanks for the question. So just starting on LAA. That's a segment we don't currently
participate in. That's a segment that our business development team keeps a pretty close sort of eyewatch on. We think
there are puts and takes with the existing technology. We think there may be some better ways to go about this. We
haven't seen anything yet that has caused us to want to jump in, but it's like anything else. We continue to look at it, and
we're looking at the progress of both the market and the technology that is available.
And then on your question around TMVR, it'd be premature to talk about this specific study design. We're still in
discussion with the FDA on what that might look like. We're now at essentially 50 implants with our existing Intrepid
system. We are increasingly enthused that we have the right design to go into clinical trials and we're working on the
study design with FDA. And we'll probably have more to say about that over the next quarter or two.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think on the China question, that's actually a very good question in terms of emerging
markets in general. As these markets go to universal coverage, there will be a tendency to kind of homogenize the
products. I think that's sort of encouraged us to take our value-based healthcare analysis and business models to these
emerging markets much more rapidly and in a much more accelerated fashion than we were thinking because the key to
getting the differentiated pricing, if you like, is to demonstrate differentiated outcomes which we think we can. And so
that's how this is going to go in play there as well.
We will demonstrate additional value with these differentiated products. If there is no value, we shouldn't be getting
more price. And so I think that's the way we have to approach it and it's really a slight sort of reprioritization of our
own strategies in the sense that the value-based healthcare effort is now getting increasing traction in some of these
emerging markets. We previously thought that that was an access-only situation, but we think now access coupled with
value-based healthcare, in fact, to making sure that we get differentiated products with fair pricing in all of these
markets as universal coverage kicks in.

<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks so much.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thank you, Bruce.
<A - Karen L. Parkhill>: Before we end Q&A, I want to correct a statement that I made on the guidance around the
quarterly gating. We do expect revenue growth for the full year, as I said, to be in the 4% to 5% range. And looking at
the first quarter, I had said the fourth quarter but I meant to say the first quarter. Looking at the first quarter, we would
expect total Medtronic revenue growth to be similar to that annual range.
Omar S. Ishrak
Okay. Thank you, Karen, and thanks to all of you for your questions. On behalf of the entire management team, I'd like
to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our
progress in our Q1 call which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, August 22. Thank you all very much.
