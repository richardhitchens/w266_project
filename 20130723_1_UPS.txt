Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt
Kuehn, our CFO; along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney; International President, Jim Barber; President of
U.S. Operations Myron Gray; and UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.
Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are
forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the
company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2012 Form
10-K and first quarter 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
In our remarks today, all full-year comments and comparisons will refer to adjusted results. In addition, we will discuss
UPS's free cash flow which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted results
along with the webcast of today's call are available on the UPS Investor Relations website.
Finally as a reminder our goal is to allow as many as possible to participate on today's call, so please ask only one
question, and then get back in the queue. Again, no multi-part questions, as we will select which part to answer. Thanks
for your cooperation.
Now, let me turn it over to Scott.
D. Scott Davis
Good morning. UPS second quarter results reflect the impact of customer behavior and market trends. International
freight forward operating profits and margins continue to be influenced by moderating demand and changes in shipper
preference. Customers around the world continue to put greater emphasis on cost rather than time in transit trading
down in the UPS product portfolio. We believe this trend is primarily cyclical. Over the last few quarters, there's been a
trough in the innovation cycle. Demand for new high-tech products traditionally drives express small package and air
freight out of Asia.
On the other hand, some of the trade down is likely permanent. More international trade is being conducted regionally
and Supply Chains are becoming more efficient so the need for the fast express options may not grow quite as strong in
the future.
Here in the U.S. volume growth was a little less than we expected. Some opportunities were missed due to labor
negotiations. Regarding labor, on June 25, we announced that the Teamsters National Master Contract received
majority approval. We believe this agreement provides a fair and competitive wage and benefit package that rewards
our employees, while also enabling UPS to remain competitive for the long run. UPS and the Teamsters have
committed to address unresolved local supplements and UPS Freight. The supplements cover specific geographic areas
and include topics such as bidding and local area work rules. Until then, the current agreements remain in place
including UPS Freight. The company and the Teamsters have agreed to contract extensions while we continue to
discuss the remaining issues.
Looking forward at the macro picture. Though global economic expansion for the second half of 2013 is still expected,
forecasts have been lowered in 10 of the 12 largest economies, including here in the U.S. One area the U.S. continues
to struggle with is exports, especially to Europe. So UPS strongly supports the Transatlantic Trade Investment
Partnership. This is a great opportunity for the U.S. and the E.U. to set the standard for trade pacts.
Business cycles are creating short-term challenges similar to those we have faced many times before. UPS still sees
great growth prospects in B2C throughout the world, emerging markets and healthcare solutions. In healthcare, for
example, during the quarter we announced the opening of two new distribution facilities in Hangzhou, China and
Louisville bringing our total healthcare space to more than six million square feet worldwide. At UPS, the key to
expanding operating profit is to adapt our integrated network and expand our portfolio to capitalize on changing market

conditions.
In a moment, David will provide details of several operational cost initiatives and growth opportunities. But first, Kurt
will take you through the financial results and updated guidance. Kurt?
Kurt P. Kuehn
Good morning, everyone. As Scott noted, we faced several trends during the quarter that continue to impact revenue
and operating profit growth. Total company revenue was $13.5 billion on volume gains of 2.3%. A couple of weeks
ago, UPS announced our second quarter results of $1.13 per share, slightly below our expectations. The profit of our
Forwarding business unit dropped significantly and our International results were reduced as customers continue to
choose lower yielding products. In addition, we lowered guidance for full-year earnings per share to a range of $4.65 to
$4.85, reflecting a 4% to 13% improvement for the back half of the year, as economists around the world reduced their
outlook.
Now let's review the segment results. U.S. Domestic total revenue was up 2.3% on average daily volume growth of
1.9%. Operating profit was flat with last year, and margin declined 40 basis points to 13.7%, as productivity
improvements did not fully offset higher driver wage and benefit costs. Daily ground volume increased 2.3% and
deferred was up 1.4%. Our Next Day Air volume declined for the first drop in five quarters. Next Day Package volume
gained slightly. However, letter volume was down more than 5%.
During negotiations, our ability to win new business was hampered. Even though we received the handshake early, we
missed some opportunities and did experience some minor volume diversions. Our average revenue per package was
relatively flat, and though we see consistent base rate improvements lower fuel surcharges and changes in mix and
package characteristics weighed on reported yields.
Now for our International results. Total International revenue was up 1.6%, while operating margin contracted 40 basis
points to 14.7%. Operating profit was down slightly to $451 million. It was lowered by shifting customer preference for
deferred products, especially out of Asia. Network and in-country cost reductions partially offset this revenue shortfall,
and fuel and currency were also a drag of about $15 million more than we expected. Daily export shipments increased
5% driven by gains from Asia and Europe, which were somewhat offset by lower U.S. exports. Local day comparisons
aided the growth rate by about 1.5%.
Domestic products were up 5.1%, also aided by local day comparisons. The emerging market of Turkey led the way
with double-digit growth, while Canada and Italy also had solid improvement. Currency neutral yields declined 2.8%
as our non-premium products like Worldwide Expedited and Transborder Standard jumped by more than 10%, while
our Premium Express products were flat compared to last year.
Moving on to the Supply Chain & Freight segment where operating profit declined from the record levels achieved in
the second quarter of 2012. Total revenue dropped 3.2%, and operating profit was down more than 20%. Operating
margin though still exceeded 7%. The decline in revenue and operating profit was primarily due to the Forwarding
business unit. UPS experienced double-digit reductions in Forwarding revenue driven by lower demand for air freight
forwarding from Asia. Revenue was heavily concentrated from large high-tech shippers whose business is down
significantly from last year. In addition, we did see large declines in the military sector. Reduced operating costs could
not offset these headwinds. UPS is focused on diversifying our revenue base, and David will tell you more about that in
a moment.
In our Distribution business, revenue was up about 4%. Operating profit declined from last year as a result of continued
investment in healthcare infrastructure. The unit did generate a margin of approximately 8%.
UPS Freight revenue was $731 million driven by LTL tonnage improvements in truckload revenue gains. Operating
profit growth was relatively flat as margin was negatively impacted by higher pension and healthcare benefit costs.

Now let's review our financial strength. For the six months ended June 30, UPS generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow
after capital expenditures of $990 million. So far this year UPS has paid $1.1 billion in dividends, an increase of almost
9% per share. In addition, we've repurchased 21.8 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. Note that our Q2 tax
rate increased slightly to 35% due to a higher mix of profits from the U.S., and we do expect that rate to be between
35% and 36% for the rest of the year.
Speaking of guidance, earlier in July we provided new full-year expectations for earnings per share of $4.65 to $4.85.
This is based on the anticipation that the market trends experienced during the second quarter will persist through the
remainder of 2013.
Our new range also reflects the latest forecast for economic expansion and as Scott indicated, 10 of the 12 largest
economies are now expected to grow a little slower than originally thought.
While we did bring down our numbers, it's important to note that UPS still expects improvement. In fact, the mid-point
of our range calls for about 8% earnings per share growth over the second half of 2012.
Looking at the remainder of 2013 for the segments, in our U.S. Domestic segment, we expect daily volume will
increase between 2% and 3%. Growth should get stronger as the year progresses as we convert missed opportunities
from earlier in the year. Revenue growth should be slightly higher than volume. Package characteristics and lower fuel
surcharges will continue to mask the base rate improvement somewhat, and profitability will be up at a mid-single digit
pace.
For our International segment in the back half of the year, we expect revenue and daily volume growth of
approximately 4% to 5%. Yield improvement will be hampered by continued mixed changes as well as commodity
fluctuations. We expect currency to negatively impact profit comparisons by approximately $100 million. However we
anticipate operating profit improvement in line with our revenue growth of 4% to 5%.
Third quarter operating profit expansion will be relatively flat due to comparisons with last year.
Looking at Supply Chain and Freight for the remainder of the year, we expect revenue growth to be flat with an
operating margin of approximately 8%, driving mid-single-digit profit improvement.
Before I turn things over to David, let me assure you, UPS is focused on both our long-term strategies and on making
the necessary adjustments to adapt to current market conditions.
Now David will take you through some of our key initiatives. David?
David P. Abney
Thanks, Kurt. I want to spend a few minutes discussing how UPS is adapting to the conditions that Scott and Kurt just
identified in their opening comments. Economic cycles and consumer behaviors change, creating challenges and
opportunities. The key to long-term success is adapting our model to capitalize on these changes. This is something
we've been doing for more than 100 years. It goes without saying that we have already identified overhead and
discretionary cost-reduction opportunities. I can assure you that I have an internal checklist of these items but that's not
all I want to discuss.
Today I am going to provide insight into how UPS is making strategic changes to our network and portfolio to meet the
evolving needs of the market. In our U.S. Domestic operations, UPS is ramping up technology implementations like
ORION which takes route optimization to a new level. To give you an idea of the scale of this project, we have
assigned almost 500 people to this multi-year development.
At the same time we're delaying some projects that don't deliver immediate results. Additionally we have identified
opportunities to move more premium volume over the road taking advantage of Worldport capabilities and the UPS
integrated network. To meet customer demand, we are leveraging our relationships with retail shippers to develop more
sophisticated distribution models that better utilize their store inventory. The implementation of Omni-channel

fulfillment is still in the early stages and we're seeing great results including B2B shipment growth.
In our International business, margins do benefit from the adjustments we make to our global air network, maximizing
aircraft utilization has always been important. We have already cut our Asia capacity by about 20%, and we will
continue to reduce truck routes and scheduled frequencies making adjustments from Asia to the U.S. and Europe, being
mindful that we must remain nimble enough to react to surges in demand.
We're making changes to address the risk and opportunities of a changing marketplace, expanding our presence in
emerging markets with an array of solutions for customers. Notably, we expanded our Worldwide Expedited service to
145 new destinations and 60 new origins earlier this year. We now provide shippers in these emerging markets with an
economical alternative to express shipping.
To increase more premium revenue into our aircraft, we introduced UPS Worldwide Express Freight. The service
offers shippers in key markets guaranteed day-definite, door-to-door Freight options. In the Supply Chain and Freight
segment, our primary focus is on the forwarding business unit. To better manage our purchase transportation, we're
implanting a system that optimizes buy rates to match real-time market conditions.
Additionally, we are diversifying our revenue base to take advantage of the trade down trends in the air freight
forwarding market. UPS expanded our Ocean Freight capabilities, a business we've been in for over a decade. For
example, we extended the reach of our ocean less-than-container load service to hundreds of new lanes around the
world. UPS Preferred LCL service accelerates ocean shipments and has been expanded to several key markets in
Europe. When customers seek less expensive freight options, UPS offers a complete portfolio of solutions.
Also across the entire Supply Chain and Freight segment, we expect to reduce overhead and operating costs, utilizing
UPS technology. Given our long history of adapting to changing conditions and the actions I just reviewed, we are
confident that we will deliver a solid second half in 2013 and beyond.
Now back to Kurt.
Kurt P. Kuehn
Great. Thanks, David, and hopefully you can see that we do have a wide array of both opportunities and initiatives in
motion to address current conditions. And operator, I'll turn it over to you now, and we'll take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Brandon Oglenski, Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I want to talk about your
Domestic growth. Last year you had pretty good traction with the new Next Day Saver Packages, we could see that in
the numbers. But I'm wondering if, at this point in time, have you reached a saturated point in the market where that
new premium offering has met a level where you can't drive much more share with that? And what are the type of
innovative products that you can leverage the integrated network with relative to your competitor?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. Brandon, the major driver of the reduction in our Next Day Air business for the quarter
was a reduction in Letters. The actual Package business, which is more related to the B2C, and certainly the
omni-channel continued to grow moderately, but we did see a big decline in Letters and that – we do see some cycle
there with refinancing dropping a bit, and also it certainly was impacted by some of the uncertainty in the second
quarter.

Our next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Arthur W. Hatfield>: Hey. Good morning. Just a real quick. Despite some of the slowing demand trends or
some of the markets where there may be a little bit of excess capacity, are you seeing any irrationality in pricing in any
of your markets?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: In general, I think the small package market remains rational. Clearly, there's a desire for
customers to trade down. Probably the one area that has the most volatility is in the freight-forwarding arena in most
notably Asia. And I'll have maybe Jim Barber comment a little bit on the trends there.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: I think that's right, Kurt. Obviously, you look at the International segment, we feel very
strong about the Europe piece of the business, and very solid foundations are good, pricing is rational. As the market
capacity moves, largely out of Asia, you get a lot of pressure through the network in pricing and capacity with the
freighters coming out of the market, and then belly space coming in. So we've got to manage to that. But in general, the
pricing position within UPS we feel very good about.
<Q - Arthur W. Hatfield>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey. Good morning. You guys have been very successful in offsetting some of the
International small package sort of yield headwind from trade downs by managing up the Air network utilization. I was
trying to get a sense for what the level of utilization is right now in the trans-Pacific and how much more you might be
able to offset ongoing yield headwinds if these trends continue?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well certainly, as David mentioned, we're doing a lot of work on the network changes. So
David, maybe we'll just start with you?
<A - David P. Abney>: Yeah. I think that it's an area we've done a great job over the years in managing that balance,
matching capacity to volume trends. In fact, since 2011, we have reduced our Asia capacity by 20%, and even this last
quarter from an International standpoint with export volume up 5%, block hours were down 1.2%. That being said
though it's an ever-changing environment and we have to watch it very closely. And for this next quarter, we plan to
reduce from 8 to 7.5 truck routes out of Asia. We also are reducing one weekly frequency from Asia to Europe, but we
also have the ability to plan in advance and when we see days that are going to have less volume, we will shut down
lanes for particular days of the week, which we're having a lot of success with. So it's something that we're actively
managing.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: I think – this is Jim Barber. To add on to what David said, obviously internationally, I
think if you look at the results over the years in our operating margin, the network has a big play into it. But the other –
the other factor that we believe we do very well in International is to manage our in-country operations. You can see
that come through in the margins. We feel like we've done it very well over the last couple of years, as the economies
have moved across the world. So it's a balance of the network as well as our UPS leadership across the world, to
manage the in-country operations, and the results of that, I think as you can see, is our International margin. So we're
pretty comfortable with that.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Thanks.

<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to ask you little bit more on the trade down. What do
you think is timing? And I don't know if you have product launches in mind, that's one of the thing with weakness with
tech shippers, you mentioned on trade down. But what do you think is potential timing where you would have some
more evidence to say either, we're right because this trade down is cyclical, or you say maybe it's a bigger issue and it's
more persistent. Is that a couple of quarters out or is it just – how would you look at the kind of visibility and timing for
potential trade – change in that trade-down dynamic. Thank you.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Tom, this is Scott. I think I'd start with the fact that clearly there's less need for speed in a soft
global environment. I think we're seeing that and we've been in that environment fortunately for a couple of years now.
But I do think that – that what gets it going again, it's Express going again, is obviously innovative and high-valued
goods. And as I said earlier on in the comments, we've been in a trough. We'll come out of that trough at some point
time in the future. For me to say, it's going to be two quarters, three quarters, I'm not sure but we know there're new
product launches coming up, new innovation coming up. We're not done innovating new products. And when that
happens, again you'll see the Express product grow. I'm not sure you'll see Express products grow as fast as you did 10
years ago, unless you get a strong economy, global economy and good growth in global trade. But I do think that the
fact is; we talked five years ago about the Next Day Air market in the U.S. being a market that was going nowhere.
Last two years, we grew that market faster than the ground. So again I think we sometimes overreact on these things,
and I do expect we'll get back.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, I think as David mentioned we're doing a lot of product innovation and expansion both to
increase the yield on our aircraft and add some new product capabilities in the lower arenas. Maybe Alan you can talk a
little bit about the portfolio and how we're adding products.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah. I guess first, Scott alluded to high-tech launches and we're certainly looking forward
to some of the launches that should take place in late third, fourth quarter this year. We've got a great portfolio there to
help high-tech companies with those launches. David talked about Worldwide Express Freight it's surpassing our
expectations. Again, this is a new piece of the Express market that we've entered, so we're excited because there's a
tremendous amount of upside for UPS there, and we're also able to bundle that to win other Express package. And then
on the yield-management side, again David talked about the expedited expansion. Again, a couple of keys there is that
utilizing our lower cost-integrated network, we're able to utilize ground, transporter standard ground network in Europe
as well as our 2nd Day Air and Ground network in the United States to lower the cost and keep the packages off the
planes and one interesting note there is that 75% of the new volume we're getting on those lanes are coming from
shippers that never shipped on those lanes before, so it's new business and it's not down trading from Express.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Great. Thank you. I appreciate it.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Hey. Great. Good morning. How is the – domestic margins took a bit of a downturn here
year-over-year. What was the growth of SurePost? And how is the shift to SurePost in e-commerce impacting margins
and how is that dealt with in the negotiation? Thanks.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, Kurt, I'll take the, at least the pure growth part of that and then Myron can talk a little bit
about our productivity and other issues. But we've wrapped a lot of the ramp up of SurePost, it's continuing to grow,
clearly B2C continues to outperform the B2B in our portfolio and we're doing fine with that. The biggest issue clearly
in the second quarter for domestic was the slowdown of volume growth below what we'd expected and Myron clearly
you guys are adapting to that.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Yeah, on the heels of slower growth and what we expected, when you look at the ramp up of
the basic product in the SurePost, we were able to improve our operating margins by deploying SurePost redirect.
During the second quarter on average we saw 17.5% of the packages that would have been delivered by the Post

Office, we were able to redirect through our package delivery drivers with matching them up with other stops that were
going to residences which drove density. So we'll see continued expansion of our productivity and moving into the
third quarter, we'll try to hone those productivity improvements.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Sterling of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Good morning.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Can I dive a little bit more into your freight forwarding comments, the weakness that you're
seeing. Is it mainly a mix issue? Buy rates, follow the buy rates, volume. Really what's driving that deterioration in
forwarding?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Okay. Yeah, Jim if you would like to take that.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Sure. I think it's – you mentioned, Kevin, all three of those points. It's all of those
together, quite frankly, and some of the comments we started with. We know that in our network right now, we're
really concentrated in a couple of ways. We're having- the Asia lane is driving a lot of the growth historically. It
concentrates in high-tech and Scott talked about some of the innovation trough. You've heard some comments about
military and defense. We've had some of those movements going on across the world but. So some of those pressures
combine to where we are right now in the current quarter. But looking forward, as David said, we're pretty confident.
We've been investing in freights, the UPS freight forwarding over the last couple of years. You mentioned David, kind
of a go-forward, new piece of go-to-the-market on how we're going to go to the procurement side of freight. So we're
comfortable that we can take that and continue the growth and we also have to take a look at emerging markets and
quite frankly, we feel like the emerging market announcements we've had recently, as the trade patterns in the world
move, it's going to provide us great opportunity to match our network with that emerging market investment, and to
continue to grow all of those together. And at the end, even in these tough times, the margins weren't the worst you've
ever seen, so we're kind of holding those year-over-year comps aren't the best. But by the end of the day, we still have
some pretty strong margins in freight and we continue to keep going down that path and we'll manage them together.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Okay. Great. Thank you for your time this morning.

Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks. Maybe a question just on the second half guidance. When you think about the 8%
midpoint, can you give us a little bit of some of the inputs and the expectations of volume progression as you move
throughout the year that kind of gets you to that point? I guess maybe what I'm asking is, how much is it reliant on
maybe a somewhat more normalized peak or some product launches that go on later on in the second half of the year?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: No. We're not basing our guidance on any significant kind of ramp-up economically, as I think
I mentioned. We're looking for basically a steady-state economy, unexciting, a little under-performing, clearly, from
where we thought it would be at the beginning of year, but not radically down. We do expect the U.S. business to
ramp-up a bit as we ramp-up some of the customers perhaps that got deferred or delayed during the negotiation period.
So, we'd like to see volume growth strengthen with Q4 clearly being stronger than Q3. On the International side, kind
of steady as she goes on that. Clearly there's volatility in the air freight, but we feel pretty good that the core business is
very strong. Europe continues strong. So no real unique shape to the rest of the year as far as economic conditions.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow up on Forwarding a bit. You talk
about air freight over-capacity. I wonder if you could talk to some of the moving parts. Are you seeing that in lower
purchase transportation costs? Or maybe you have to then pass that through more quickly from a pricing standpoint. If
you could help us think about how that's working on the air freight side. And then maybe a little color on Ocean as well
please?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. I think the major over-capacity in the Forwarding is that it's not so much on the dedicated
cargo carriers, but the passenger airlines clearly have added capacity. And our real strategy, as Jim said, is to adapt, so,
we're as flexible as we can be to reflect buy rates and then importantly also, to develop the portfolio, to help customers
move up and down much as we do in our package environment. So the Forwarding market is volatile and cycles
happen quite a bit. We think we're reacting accordingly and building a good base.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Any color maybe on the ocean side?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Ocean remains solid and that's part of the reason we're building and expanding forward as we're
profitable in Ocean and looking forward to growing it.

Our next question will come from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Morning.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: In David's remarks, you guys talked about you went from 8 to 7.5 truck routes. I think you
were talking about the Asian market. I think it's the first time you've given color around that, and I was kind of curious,
as I frame-up the International Small Package business, can you give us a sense of how much of that business stays on
the ground, as opposed to actually flying in your owned or chartered aircraft? That would be helpful, I think, in terms
of getting an idea of the profitability of the business.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Okay. Well to just clarify, last quarter we were at 8 truck routes and this quarter we're moving to
7.5. And what that means is there would be some days that are – every week that are eight and then there are other days
that are seven. But these truck routes, of course, are the routes that are very important in connecting Asia to the U.S.
and Asia to Europe.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Just to put color, the issue – it's more of a challenge for us coming out of Asia, where
you fly the goods. When you hit the cross border in Europe, you can obviously move between air and ground and have
flexibility. But the challenge for us, obviously, is when business slows down from out of Asia, you fly it.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Got it. And so just in framing up the back half of that question, in terms of the overall
percentage of the International Small Package business that stays on the ground, any color on that?
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: So, this is Jim. The – most of that question really pertains to our European operations
because of the way we've been at it since we went over there in 1976. We built – the network we built, that is both
trans-border Air and Ground allows us to essentially keep about 85% of what we pickup in Europe to stay in Europe.
And the customer's choice, they can fly it or they can put it on the ground, and then the power of that network allows
them to do both. So that kind of gives you a feel for, I guess, the materiality of the European operations.

Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Morning.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Maybe just an update on the Teamsters negotiations and the contract status there. With the
tentative deal on the Package side, are you starting to see any of the domestic volumes come back more than you
thought in the second quarter? And then on the LTL side, are you seeing any of the volume start to go away given that
you seem further away on the deal there?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, Scott, I'll start with that. And I'd say, yeah, first of all you're right. We got the National
Master Agreement done and the National Master covers the important things on the Package side. It covers the wages,
the pensions, and the health and welfare. We do have some supplements open that we got to work our way through.
We're working with the Teamsters and our employees right now, on those issues. They generally involve work rules. I
would say that, as we've said before, we're really not seeing additional diversion or any diversion at this point in time.
We missed some opportunities and as we negotiated, it took us a while to put these new wins on board, to convert
them. And I think we'll see that, we'll see more in the third quarter and we'll see more in the fourth quarter. So I don't
see any more losses from that perspective.
On the LTL side, still we've got to finish that agreement. We do have an extension, which gives our customers a little
bit of a calm feeling, as we have the extension. And I'd say, currently, we're really not seeing a lot of lost volume on the
LTL side. We think we feel pretty good about it. We are just like need to get that agreement done.

<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah. Hi, there. Good morning.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Morning.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Scott or Kurt, I'm wondering if you could comment on something that we get asked a lot, which
is when we look at sort of what appears to us as a duopoly in the U.S. market it seems somewhat surprising that we
don't see more, I guess, stronger sort of pricing power overall. And I realize there's always puts and takes and mix shifts
and whatnot, but I'm wondering if you can comment at all about how you think about the progression of this market?
DHL has been gone for quite some time. So maybe talk a little bit about how you think about pricing?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, Bill. This is Kurt. First thing I have to do, I guess, is take issue with your framing of the
market as a duopoly. Clearly, this is a competitive market. The Post Office is a very large player in the Ground business
especially and there's a number of regional players. In general the pricing is rational in this industry and that's one of
the great elements. But I think some of the trends we've talked about do create some challenges and mask that, that

goods are getting smaller and lighter, the average weights are down 2% to 3% typically year-over-year and that there's
been a transition of goods, to some extent, from business-to-business, to business-to-consumer. So pricing remains
rational, it is somewhat masked, it's sometimes hard for you guys to see all the moving parts, but if you factor out
average weight and some of the other product changes, we're still looking at core base rates of over 2%.

Our next question will come from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Hey. Good morning, guys. I'm wondering if I can get some perspective on My
Choice and where you think that technology relates to capturing B2C benefit both in terms of volume and utilization in
the network. Maybe just kind of framing where that product technology is and whether we're on the frontend or
backend of realizing the benefits?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Right. I'm sure Alan would be happy to talk about that.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Well first I'd say we're on the frontend to that. We have over 3.3 million consumers signed
up right now and certainly by the end of this quarter we should approach or exceed 4 million enrollments. We've had
54 million deliveries that have taken place and about 14% of those deliveries, the consumer actually takes action on
them. So, there's some real value being created there. Certainly on the cost side for us, we're reducing our send-again or
making sure that more packages are being delivered on the first attempt. Just recently we introduced the ability to
upgrade your SurePost packages to UPS Ground and that's also resonating well with our customers and exceeding our
expectations and we're the only provider out there in the marketplace now that enables all residential services to have
consumer day before visibility and the ability to reroute or reschedule.
The other exciting thing is we just launched the UPS My Choice Facebook app and that enables a Facebook login and
also My Choice capability on Facebook. It's just out just a couple of weeks and we have 120,000 new users that have
linked their UPS My Choice or their myUPS.com to Facebook, so we're excited about that. We're also listed as one of
the top 10 Facebook apps right now. Just some other interesting stats, we have 3.6 million downloads now on our, you
know iPad, iPhone and Android apps. So a lot of traction with My Choice also really resonating with retailers.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Right. So if you don't get it, we're moving well on My Choice and if you guys haven't signed up
yet, you're missing a great service.

<Q - Nate Brochmann>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Morning, Nate.
<Q - Nate Brochmann>: I wanted to talk just – actually that's a great transition here to my question which is; you guys
continue to get more B2C business and you're able to leverage more off of your drivers even by rerouting from
SurePost into the regular ground network. What's that doing for your margins kind of in that B2C business? And how
much higher can that go as you continue to get more density and more business through those channels?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah I think, Myron clearly will fill you in on the redirect and also ORION. In general B2C is a
bit more challenging but through the innovation we've done, we're finding ways to grow very profitably with B2C. So

<A - Myron A. Gray>: In David's opening comments, he addressed ORION but before we go there, let me remind you
that just last year we finished completion of deploying telematics in the U.S. So in the quarter we were able to drive 1.6
million less miles on top of 1.9% volume growth. Now couple on top of that, you talk about the 500 people that we've
deployed with ORION which is a on road integrated optimization system that will allow us to reduce additional miles;
keeping in mind that for every average mile reduced there's a $50 million savings to UPS. So we feel very confident
that as we grow B2C volume, we'll deploy technology that will allow us to balance the cost. But as we get additional
B2C, we'll also increase density which obviously will help us improve margins.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Right and I guess just to reinforce, the ORION is a major deployment that is going to take us
three years to four years to get fully rolled out, but it does create a very dynamic environment that allows us to do
real-time adjustments.

Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go head.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks. Good morning. Scott or Kurt, could you speak to the back half guidance, what
would be the two or three or four biggest swing factors to put you at the high-end or the low-end as you approach it?
Thanks.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well certainly the economic factors will be a big driver. I think in the domestic side, making
sure that this nascent recovery continues our success clearly on bringing in customers to accelerate the volume growth
and then normal execution. Internationally, the product launches I think in late Q3, Q4 have a big impact on demand
conditions. Although in Europe, we're plugging along pretty strong; we had growth upper-single digits in Europe, and
continue to see that work as our integrated network differentiates. So the biggest factors really would be the economic
environment.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: This is Scott, it's our job to adapt to whatever we face in the second half of the year. The team
here will adapt to conditions. Kurt said in earlier comments that we're assuming the same trends that we saw coming
out of the second quarter. Hopefully it will get a little bit better, but we'll adapt to whatever we get.

Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Allison Landry>: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how much you expect to improve the
profitability at the Forwarding division once you're able to implement some of the initiatives that you were speaking
about earlier?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: We have given guidance that the overall Supply Chain & Freight will have 8% margins for the
rest of the year. So clearly that represents a very solid margin, and we're comfortable that the actions we're taking will
get us to that point.
<Q - Allison Landry>: And is there a longer-term expectation?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: We've not laid out exact numbers for that sub-segment, but clearly if that sector is in the 8% to
10% margin over the long-term, we're generating economic profit and feel good. And then it's just a matter of
continuing to grow that sector.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And we think figure international air freight is at a trough, and it's hard to imagine it getting
much worse going forward.

Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much. Not to beat the Forwarding question over the head here, I'm just
trying to segregate what's more of a short-term issue versus a long-term issue. You mentioned weakness in the tech out
of Asia, and you mentioned weakness in the military. How much of that do you believe is shorter-term in nature or
timing in nature versus how much do you think is more of a secular issue?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. Okay. I'll let Jim talk a little more about Forwarding, since that seems to be the topic du
jour.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: But Jeff, don't feel bad we talk a lot about it here too.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: [indiscernible] (46:22)
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: I appreciate that opportunity. So, I think you know Scott talked about the innovation
trough in the beginning, so that's obviously a piece of the drag on the high-tech sector. The military and the defense
side, you can see what happens across the world and what's going on with that, and I think our real opportunity is to
reverse the concentration in what we've got. We've been investing, for instance, in healthcare over the last couple of
years, and we expand that footprint. We're going to go down the path here into emerging markets, which quite frankly
are in their early years of development as trade continues to grow, that's really a freight need that they have to connect
to the world as opposed to an express product. So, all of those provide great opportunities for UPS in the years to come.
So we're very comfortable. We're glad we're in Forwarding right now. It is a bit of a trough. We hold the margins tight.
We continue to invest and we'll continue to grow as UPS should.

Our next question will come from the line of David Ross of Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Ross>: Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. UPS Freight showed an increase in density with shipment
volume up nicely in the quarter. Yields were up just a little bit, but margins, it's said in the press release, declined
slightly due to increases in compensation and benefit expense. Could you explain if that's anything out of the normal
annual increase in wages and benefits? And then also, why the increased density wouldn't have driven margin
improvement?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. There was a bit of a tough comp to the previous year that gave us a little bit of a
headwind. But Myron, maybe you could talk about some of the deployment of UPS technology into Freight that should
help us drive margins.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Yeah. As Kurt noted in the quarter while we did see continued growth in revenue, we did see
also continued abilities to attract additional market share, which boded well for us. However, with the increase in health
and benefit costs, we were not able to improve margin expansion. We will continue to deploy customer facing as well
as operational technology. Customer facing technology like pickup notification that utilizes UPS's WorldShip that gives
our customers an hour timeframe of when they'll get the pickup and we'll continue to deploy small package technology
and Freight to get additional operational improvements.

Our next question will come from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Thanks very much operator. Thanks for squeezing my question in. I just have a question,
Scott on – or Kurt on capital allocation and capital deployment. I know you guys are very committed to the dividend
and the share repurchase program and yet your share count is going down, your revenue growth is flat and your
earnings are going down. So could you just talk about your thoughts with respect to capital allocation within the
context of slowing revenue growth environment?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: I'll start, Helane, and clearly you know we're committed to our distributions, we're committed to
our dividends, we're committed to the share repurchase numbers we talked about in the, past but we're also committed
to reinvesting in the business. And we have a lot of opportunities out there right now for us to reinvest particularly in
areas, emerging markets we talked about little bit earlier, there's all kinds of opportunities in healthcare that we're just
tapping right now and the B2C we talked about throughout the call. Around the globe, there is a lot of opportunities for
us to enable our customers growth in B2C. So we see plenty of ideas and plenty of opportunities to reinvest in the
business.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah and I think Helane, I can't let you get off the phone here without taking issue with you.
We're looking for profit growth in the next quarter and revenue growth and 8% midpoint for profit growth. So we did
have a bit of a hiccup in the second quarter but we feel very confident in both short-term and the long-term outlook for
the company.

Our next question will come from the line of Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Sure.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: I just did go back to your comments earlier about air freight capacity, as an operator of your own
assets, I'd be curious to hear sort of your thoughts on the long-term outlook for air freight capacity especially given the
influx of passenger belly space we've seen here over the last several years. We'd just like to kind of hear your broader
thoughts on the capacity situation both over the next 12 months and next three to five year.
<A - David P. Abney>: I think the first thing, you certainly hit it right, what's increased the capacity has been a belly
space in all the passenger airlines at their aircraft that has been added. What you are seeing us do and other people in
our marketplace is to watch very closely the trade lanes and to make sure that we deploy those assets to match the
volume in those trade lanes. So when we need to pick up the lift in certain areas, we quickly deploy that aircraft and
then on the other hand when we need to pull back, we've shown we can effectively do that. One of the things that's
unique I think to our company right now, is we have not ordered any aircraft after the 767 that we're receiving this year.
So that gives us a little time to just hold firm and see what's going to go on in the marketplace in the next couple of
years.

<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. You've mentioned the double digit revenue declines in Forwarding and Scott I've
heard you say in the past all Freight on Board. I'd like to ask you to comment on volume shifts, mainly do you see
customers who shipped through air in the past diverting all the way down to Ocean. Are you seeing shippers simply
shipping pure shipments? And as a corollary, are you margin-neutral on these modes or does slower Ocean demand
fewer UPS resources?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Let's Alan answer that. I think clearly we're probably seeing all of the above but Alan take a
shot.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah. We're seeing some of our customers look for solutions that move the air freight to
Ocean. Certainly there are certain products and as Scott talked about earlier in terms of innovation and high value that
just don't fit that mode. We recently introduced, and David talked about our preferred ocean, LCL, which is really a
combination of our Ocean move and then using our integrated network to expedite those moves once they hit the
destination, say here in the United States here and we've got some nice margins on that. That's obviously higher than
regular Ocean and it speeds up the time in transit to faster than Ocean, but still somewhat slower than Air Freight and
that's been boding well for us.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. About the margins, is Ocean more or less attractive to you compared to Air?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well in the short-term, if we've got premium volume sitting in an aircraft, there's a higher
incremental impact. It's harder to adjust, especially flights out of Asia, than it is other integrated areas. Over the
long-term, we are very profitable in Ocean. In fact, we have major investments to help supply our management and to
help accelerate Ocean. So we're building the portfolio, classic UPS approach, and we'll make sure that the margins are
appropriately compensatory for the investment.

missed it, how much Forwarding Air Freight tonnage was down in the second quarter.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: It was down. Yeah. It was down a little over 10% in the quarter and, as we've said before, the
military was a big piece of that. And that was a, certainly, a very volatile group as movements happen and then the core
underlying weakness also in high-tech drove that there

And our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey. Kurt, I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a sense for what the right
level of maintenance CapEx should be on the airline side once you lap the new aircraft deliveries in the coming year?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, we've got the youngest fleet in the industry. So at least the day-to-day maintenance is
pretty minimal. But we think, in general, depreciation is a reasonable representation of maintenance CapEx. As David
said we're not real long on aircraft right now. We're bringing in a couple of more 767s this year and then the fleet's in
great shape. And we'll be flexible and decide what happens from there. But we feel real good about our capital position.
Very few capital commitments and great cash flow for the company going forward, and the depreciation we think
really represents a pretty good shot at what maintenance CapEx is.

<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And we have a question from the line of Mr. Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. So just following up on those comments about free cash should
be really good the next couple of years. What prevents you from being even more aggressive with the buyback or the
dividend? Because of the stock up so far this year, you're below a 3% yield. I know you've got $6 billion of cash. You
used to run the business with close to $1 billion of cash. Why not be more aggressive?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, we have a policy that we manage to fairly steadily, Scott as you know, of disturbing
approximately 100% of net income in the form of either dividends or share repurchases. This year, we are more
aggressive with a stated target of $4 billion in share repurchase, partially to catch up for last year where we held back
as we accumulated cash. But we think a steady, programmatic approach is the best way to do it. We do buy it back and
retire the shares that we commit, and so I think investors can count on a programmatic approach that is understandable
and foreseeable, and at least for now that makes a lot of sense. Clearly, if markets get crazy, we've got the cash if we
want to become more aggressive in share repurchase, but right now we're very comfortable with our current approach.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Yeah. Scott, as I said earlier, I think that even though it's a slow growth global economy,
we see a lot of opportunities to reinvest in ideas that we have out there.
Operator
Due to time constraints our last question for the day will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Hi. Thanks for sneaking me in. I just wanted to change gears and see if you could talk a
little bit about the B2B side of things? What you're seeing from, perhaps, maybe a stabilization? Or when you think that
maybe you'll see growth re-accelerate I think the omni-channel might fit into that. So maybe any color you could give
on B2B would be helpful.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah. We did reference in our – earlier a little bit of a slowing in the industrial base. So we saw
some drag there. But Alan maybe you could talk about what's happening in the retail sector?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah. Certainly, Kelly, your comment about omni-channel that certainly does create B2B
shipments. We're really excited about helping brick-and-mortar retailers provide an omni-channel experience for their
consumers that obviously merges the online with the brick-and-mortar. We're finding that there's a lot of customers out
there, consumers that want to ship – order online and ship to store. We're also enabling our retailers with our
technology to be able to drop orders to their stores and ship to other stores or ship directly to consumers which is a win,
win, win for UPS, the retailer and the consumers because the consumers are getting faster fulfillment of their orders,
the retailer is getting it at cost-effective rates and obviously we're getting new business.
We've got probably about 25 retailers that are engaged with us today on that, and it's resonating well with them. The
other thing I would just add is the one driver really resonates well with the retailer because obviously the store
personnel needs to stay focused on the in-store consumers and using our technology and one driver to pick up all the air
and ground and deliver all the air and ground keeps those employees on track.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: And do you think that this omni-channel driving that can lead to a stabilization in the B2B
volumes anytime soon?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah. I think certainly it's going to help grow B2B. Obviously you wouldn't have thought
in the past that the B2C or online would generate B2B but you're finding more and more that the folks are getting
packages delivered to their work, delivered to stores. We certainly have our Kiala UPS access point model in Europe

with 8,000 access points where consumers – many consumers are preferring to pick up those packages at businesses
versus at home. So we're excited about the prospects of a more balanced B2C market or online e-commerce market that
generates more B2B than it has in the past.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Kelly, in the second quarter if you watched economic stats, the inventories got
liquidated so inventories are pretty low level right now and U.S. exports are really weak. So those two areas could
really help B2B going forward to get back to normal.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Great. Thanks very much, guys.
Operator
That does conclude our Q&A session for the day. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Andy Dolny
for closing remarks.
Andy Dolny
I'm going to turn it over to Scott for some final thoughts.
D. Scott Davis
Thank you for joining us today. First let me say that I'm quite confident UPS will achieve the goals that we discussed
today and that's despite a slower global economic growth forecast and the trade down we're experiencing. I want to
reiterate the comments I made on Helane's question. I really can't remember a time in my 28 years at UPS when we had
more opportunities in front of us, opportunities like the omni-channel in U.S. retail that we just got done been talking
about, market share expansion in the fast-growing emerging markets, healthcare solutions to assist an aging population
and UPS enabling global B2C business growth around the globe. Lots of opportunities ahead of us. Thanks for joining
us today.
