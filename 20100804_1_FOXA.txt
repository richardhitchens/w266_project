This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy,
actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2010 identifies risks and opportunities that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by
the cautionary statements contained in such filings.
Additionally, this call will contain certain non-GAAP financial measurements; the definition of and reconciliation of
such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-K filings.
Finally, not that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income, adjusted EPS and
adjusted net income are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of segment operating
income is included in our earnings release and the EPS and net income reconciliation is posted on our website at the
News Corp. investor relations earnings release page.
And with that I'll turn it over to Dave.
David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Reed, thank you and good afternoon, everybody. As you have seen in today's earnings release, News Corporation
closed out fiscal 2010 with very solid results in terms of segment operating income, net earnings and cash flow from
operations.
Let me start with some highlights of our full-year results. Excluding the $500 million pre-tax litigation charge taken in
this year's second quarter, segment operating income was $4.5 billion as compared to 3.6 billion reported a year ago.
Factoring out last year's $121 million contribution from NDS which is no longer consolidated, segment operating
income increased 30%. This growth is slightly better than the expectations we provided you three months ago.
This strong financial performance was driven by 8% overall revenue growth, led by sizable operating profit growth at
our Cable, and Film segments, offset in part by lower results in SKY Italia and MySpace.
Bottom line the company reported net income of $2.5 billion for this fiscal year and earnings per share of $0.97. This
compares to a net loss of 3.4 billion, or $1.29 per share reported a year ago, which included significant impairment
charges. For the year we also generated strong free cash flow, $2.9 billion, this is 150% more than we reported last
year.
Turning to the quarter, for the quarter operating segment income $932 million, which was down slightly from the
fourth quarter a year ago, as double-digit growth in our cable, newspaper and television segments was mostly offset by
declines in other segments, particularly Film, and SKY Italia. Bottom line, the company reported net income for the
quarter of $875 million, as compared to a loss of 203 million reported for the fourth quarter a year ago, which primarily
relates to impairment charges.
This year's fourth quarter result includes pre-tax gains of $212 million in other, primarily from the sale of our Bulgarian
TV stations, impairment and restructuring charges of $217 million, and $125 million in our share of a favorable
litigation settlement at BSkyB. The fourth quarter a year ago included $680 million in pre-tax impairment and other
charges.
Excluding the net income effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.30 this quarter, as compared to a
similarly adjusted $0.19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
In addition this quarter's net income includes approximately $312 million of non-cash tax benefits related to the
recognition of certain prior-years' tax credits which contributed $0.12 to our earnings per share in the quarter.
Now I would like to provide some comments on a few of our businesses. I would like to start with the Cable Networks.

Growth in our Cable Network segment continues to drive overall company results with fourth quarter operating income
contributions up 31% on 15% higher revenues, reflecting the strength of FOX News, the RSNs, and our international
cable businesses. The primary drivers behind the year-over-year increases in the quarter were from the FOX News
channel and the RSNs where their strong market positions led to ad revenue increasing by over 20% versus the fourth
quarter a year ago and affiliate fees continued their strong growth.
Keep in mind that at this point, we have renegotiated all of the original FOX News carriage deals with major cable and
satellite distributors, scheduled renewals will begin again at the end of this calendar year.
The FOX International Channels also reported strong growth, 28% on strong advertising and affiliate growth
particularly in Latin America and in Asia, and our STAR businesses, particularly in India, continued to show renewed
strength with 42% advertising increases in the quarter led by our national and regional Indian channels.
Our Cable Networks delivered $2.3 billion in operating income for the year. They now represent over half of the total
company's segment-operating income. We expect this business to continue to lead our overall growth for the
foreseeable future.
The Filmed Entertainment segment reported fourth quarter operating income of $137 million, down as expected from
203 million reported a year ago, and as we mentioned on the last quarter earnings call, this anticipated decline reflects
very strong home entertainment sales of the Avatar DVD this year, being more than offset by comparatively lower
revenues related to the timing of pay and free TV availabilities and lower theatrical revenues from the mix of films as
compared to a year ago.
At our television segment, the generated operating income in the quarter of $113 million, 13% higher than the fourth
quarter a year ago. This improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our television station, partially offset by
increased losses at the broadcast network from higher programming costs.
Station revenues were up 29% in the quarter as compared to a year ago. This reflects improved local advertising trends
particularly in the automotive, retail and telecommunications categories. Additionally, we benefited from higher
political spending related to primary races in Los Angeles, Florida, and Philadelphia. This revenue growth at the
stations fully converted to increased earnings.
Turning to our pay television platform, SKY Italia, SKY generated segment operating income of $97 million, as
compared to 155 million in the fourth quarter a year ago, and this primarily reflects the rights costs related to the full
coverage of the World Cup.
While we experienced a challenging business and economic environment in Italy during fiscal 2010. Early indications
in fiscal 2011 are encouraging. Total revenues increased 4% in local currency terms as compared to the prior-year's
quarter, driven by upgrade tickets sold for the World Cup broadcast where more than half of the matches were
exclusive to SKY Italia.
New subscribers and lower churn netted SKY 45,000 additional subscribers in the quarter and this compares to no net
new additions in the fourth a year ago. SKY closed out the fiscal year with 4.7 million subscribers. The fourth quarter
overall churn rate was well below that of a year ago, which helped to produce an annual churn rate of approximately
13%, and this is considerably better than the trend we witnessed a few quarters ago.
Overall costs were higher in the quarter, reflecting World Cup rights, scheduled increases in series A rights and costs
related to the rollout of set top boxes with advanced HD and PVR capabilities.
On July 1, SKY Italia's consumer offering was reorganized, more than doubling the number of programming package
alternatives, including a €29 per month price point for the soccer package. We believe this increased choice for the
Italian consumer will stimulate subscriber growth, the early response to this new package has been quite encouraging.
At our newspaper and information service segment, we reported a solid quarter with segment operating income of $115
million, and this is up over 20% from the fourth quarter a year ago. This increase largely reflects strong advertising
improvements at all major titles, led by a 22% increase at The Sun, 14% growth at the Wall Street Journal, and 10%

growth at our Australian newspapers. And partially offsetting this growth is the absence of contributions from the Dow
Jones index business that was disposed of in March of this year.
And in our Other segment, we reported a fourth quarter segment operating loss of $174 million compared to a loss of
136 million a year ago, this higher loss primarily reflects lower search and advertising revenues at MySpace.
And finally, before I turn the call over to Chase, I would like to address our guidance for fiscal 2011. As we measure
our guidance, we are starting with the fiscal 2010 segment operating income of $4 billion we just reported, exclude
from this the 500 million litigation charge, resulting in a base for 2010 of 4.46 billion for comparative purposes.
As we look at fiscal 2011, we are anticipating a stable economic outlook with modest growth in the major economies in
which we operate, and we expect that advertising markets will remain healthy. As a result, we expect many of our
businesses will generate strong year-over-year earnings growth, and these include continued robust growth at our Cable
Networks, led by further expansion of our international channels, as well as sustained revenue increases at FOX News,
the RSNs and STAR. As I mentioned earlier, cable is now our largest segment, it accounts for over 50% of our
operating income, and is also our fastest-growing segment. Higher television segment earnings from continuation of
strong local and national advertising markets, additional political spending at the local level related to the mid-term
elections, and lower entertainment and program costs at the broadcast network will allow this segment to continue to
grow. We also expect continued improvement at our newspaper segment as we expect advertising trends to continue to
improve.
But we are also facing difficult comparisons from certain items that positively impacted fiscal 2010, that we are not
expecting to repeat in 2011. These items include an extraordinary successful year in Film that presents difficult film
comps. While we are excited about our upcoming release slate, and about the strength of our film business overall, we
are not however forecasting films to perform at the success level that Avatar achieved this past year. As a result we
expect our Film earnings in 2011 to be below 2010 in the mid-$300 million range.
Although current foreign exchange rates approximate the average we experienced for fiscal 2010, we are anticipating
less favorable foreign exchange rates in fiscal 2011, and as a result, the lower exchange rates will reduce our 2011
operating income by about 2 percentage points. Taking all of these items into account, and based on all of the
assumptions inherent in our projections, we anticipate our segment operating income growth rate for fiscal 2011 to be
in the low double-digit range above the 4.46 billion fiscal 2010 segment operating income base level.
Obviously the decline in the film result I just referred to will affect comparisons in various quarters with the most
challenging comparisons in the first and third quarters, owing to the timing comparisons of Avatar, and Ice Age 3.
And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chase for his comments.
Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer
Thanks, Dave and good afternoon. Dave just took you through the numbers for the year and I'd like to add that with
30% profit growth we feel not only proud of our performance but of the significant stride we made to position us
stronger today than we were a year ago.
Yes, the economy was not as dire as we feared as we benefited from a recovering advertising market, an advertising
market that continues to be very strong across the board today and we look to continue to take more than our fair share
of that advertising. Our local stations currently look to be pacing at close to a 30% growth rate for this quarter, and the
network scatter market continues to generate double-digit premiums to upfront pricing. Our cable network scatter is
even higher than that.
This strength is across the board with almost every major ad category showing growth. However, what really drove our
results this past year was the quality of our execution and our leadership position across the vast majority of our
businesses. I'm not going to speak about each of our businesses, but do want to spend a couple of minutes on a few key
areas.

Our success starts with our core content and distribution businesses. At our film division, our record-breaking results
were driven by Avatar, which ushered in a whole new era in 3-D production. Our television studio matched it step by
step with the two biggest hits of the season, Glee and Modern Family, which have both been sold into syndication in
their first year.
These content businesses are highlighted by long-term management teams that have proven track records that are
second to none. Clearly success in this business is driven by creative executives making tough decisions, however, we
have been equally adept at navigating the emerging digital technology and improving ourselves to be ahead of the
curve and carving out leadership positions on issues like low-priced DVD rentals, and subscription streaming. We also
continue to add exciting new extensions to these businesses like our overseas film units that released the number one
film in India, My Name is Khan, or our television units that have produced original cable hits like Burn Notice and
White Collar, a uniquely – on uniquely attractive economic terms.
The year-on-year comparison for this segment for 2011 may be tough due to the success of Avatar, as Dave said, but
we feel great about our position as leaders in this business and our ability to take advantage of consolidating industry,
and emerging exciting new distribution opportunities like mobile platforms.
While our content business is frequently the headline-maker for us, no business is more important to us than our cable
group, which has really become the foundation for News Corp.'s profit and cash flow. As Dave noted, it currently
represents over half our profits, and that percent will continue to increase among our existing businesses. This is a big,
broad group, with channels covering most genres and geographies. It is a group that has nearly tripled its profits over
the last five years, yet we believe the most exciting growth is ahead of us.
The majority of our core channels are still in a significant growth phase, and we continue to add key new channels that
leverage existing franchises like the National Geographic Wild channel, the Big Ten channel or multiple channels
around the world. We expect profits from our international channels to more than double over the next five years.
FOX News is a true juggernaut, and we're heading into carriage renewal discussions. FX, which has led the industry in
successful original programs, can grow by multiples before it reaches USA's profitability.
Likewise, the National Geographic group is still only a small fraction of Discovery. This group not only has exciting
growth potential, but great stability due to the long-range nature of our contracts. It is a fabulous business, and I do not
believe that its strength, value and importance are properly understood in evaluating News Corp.
In many ways our broadcast business has been as successful as our content and cable businesses. I actually think it
should be thought of as part of our channels group; arguably, the driving force of our channels business. The FOX
Network finished its sixth year as number one, and many of our stations had record market share. The problem is it
simply has a lousy business model. Broadcast needs the dual revenue stream of its cable channel brethren. We have
begun this fight and we will prevail. We have right on our side. We have the most valuable programming, and deserve
to be fairly compensated.
The third business that goes hand in hand with our content and channels is our satellite platforms. This business is at a
much earlier growth stage than the others. In Italy, the last year has been a challenging one, with a combination of
regulatory, competitive and economic headwinds. However, this is a market that is still in the early stages of its growth.
We will look to HD and DVR as key forces to drive our businesses and put in place some exciting new packages and
offers to complement our content leadership. While the summer is a difficult time to judge, we're optimistic about
renewed momentum in coming quarters.
SKY Deutschland is at an even earlier stage than Italy, and clearly a work in progress. Nonetheless, the size and wealth
of this market makes the potential rewards clear. We know from the experiences of building platforms in the U.K., Italy
and the U.S., that these are tough jobs that rarely follow a straight line.
Our announced move to stand behind a €340 million capital call designed to give the business the flexibility to invest to
build its offering. Our actions clearly speak to our belief in this business. The new management team has done a great
job putting together a plan to focus on making SKY a leader in unique quality content, married to a position of HD

leadership, while being able to invest in the operations to both maximize efficiencies and deliver a great customer
experience.
Our one platform that is not at in an early stage is BSkyB, which many consider the world's premier distribution
platform. As you know, we have recently announced a proposal to acquire the rest of this business for cash. This is a
business we know well and have a strong belief in its long-term potential. The transaction will be earnings accretive,
while at the same time, achieving our strategic objectives of further increasing our profits generated from more stable
subscription businesses and improving geographic diversification.
In addition, fully consolidated, BSkyB allows us to streamline our corporate structure, which would enhance our
valuation by the investment community. We presented a full and fair offer that values SKY at a significant premium.
We will continue to take a disciplined approach to this transaction. We've been willing to sit with our current
investments for many years, and have other options for our cash.
While we expect our content, channel and platform businesses to drive the profitability and value of our company, we
equally believe that our print businesses have exciting opportunities to grow as historical competitors struggle, and
digital technologies open new arenas for expansion.
We've led the industry in focusing on dual-revenue stream business models, and believe mobile platforms will
transform the print business. We've clearly established ourselves as leaders in every market where we compete, and are
determined to pursue ways to maximize the profitability of these businesses while intelligently navigating risk.
Our goal with these businesses I just discussed, and more importantly with News Corp. as a whole, is to build
long-term value for our shareholders. We believe we're in a growth business, and that there are unique opportunities out
there to expand our franchises and add value, be it in international markets that are still growing, or digital arenas that
are just emerging.
We prefer to build not buy, in taking advantage of these opportunities. We will take risks, but they will be intelligent
risks, and we're prepared to walk away if the risks get too high. Equally, we're not just focused on growth. We have
made it a priority to reduce costs and maximize efficiencies in businesses from our TV stations to our newspapers to
content production. We've also divested businesses like our Bulgarian TV unit and the Dow Jones indexes when we've
determined they were not strategic to us.
We recognize that the cash accumulated on our balance sheet created a highly inefficient capital structure, but we did it
for a reason, and we're now addressing it. We're proud of what we built, and we are committed to continuing to build
not only an even greater business, but one that rewards our shareholders as well.
Thank you, and with that I'll turn it back to Reed.

<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: And for Rupert of course. So Chase, there's something in the press, I think today that said
you were going to take a salary cut. I was wondering if you could comment, is that true? And if it is true, what led to
that decision?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: What I'm actually doing is
reducing my salary, but it is essentially changing it into longer-term performance-based compensation. I think that's the
preferred thing for senior management in the company. I think it aligns senior management, it aligns my interest more
with the shareholders and I think – and I believe in the business. I believe in our future, and I think it's the right thing to
do.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: All right. And then I'll just put my next two questions before I get cut off. So, Dave, in your
guidance, can you address what your advertising assumptions are in that?
And Rupert, I was just hoping you could give us general comments of your view of the world economy at this point.
On the last call, you were really concerned about Europe before the world focused on Greece, and I was wondering if
you could update us on how pessimistic or optimistic you are today?
<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Jessica, we're not going to give
you all of the advertisement, but if you look at the two in the United States, whether it's our – take our cable, or our
television stations, they would be for the year-around the mid-teens level.
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: Yes, if you want me to talk about the world economy, I'd just say that I can't help but believe
it stays very fragile, certainly the Western world. On the other hand, we have almost inexplicably good advertising and
great confidence there, so we'll just have to see how it turns out. But certainly, I'm very, very confident of the next six
months. But I think there is sufficient fragility for us not to be overconfident about the long term, or the medium-term.
<A - Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you, the next question in queue will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Chase one for you and maybe one more after the follow-up.
But I wanted to go back to the FOX News re-pricing. I know you can't talk about specific deals, but I think you started
re-pricing – renegotiating that network back in late '07 and I think you just finished with the last distributor earlier this
year. I think that's roughly right. So it looks like it was sort of a two year, two and a half year process. Is that roughly
similar to how the next round is going to go just from a timing perspective or do they pace out further out in the future?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I think it is probably a little longer
than that in timeframe, and it's a multi-year process that – I'm not sure quite a specific year timeframe it to.
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: It'd be more like 3.5 than 2.5.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: It's more than two, certainly less
than five.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay. And if I could just ask about the two sort of earlier-stage European distribution
businesses: SKY Italia and SKY Deutschland, you clearly are believers in both. What is the consideration around
potentially consolidating SKY Deutschland at some point? Is that even in your thought process as you think about
helping them finance and build that business in Germany?
And then in Italy, Rupert, we've seen that market become sort of more and more difficult from a competitive
environment, the regulatory environment, a lot of the political overtones that has impacted SKY Italia. As you look at it
over the next two years, do you think that gets better from here or is it going to remain a big challenge for that
business?

<A - Rupert Murdoch>: I think there are a lot of indications that it's going to get better.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay.
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: And we are already expecting some pretty favorable rulings from the E.U.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Any comment on SKY Deutschland?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: On SKY Deutschland, our focus
really is on building the business. We recognize today it is obviously is in a loss position, and we're obviously driving it
forward to, you know, maximize the opportunity there.
We believe – we believe it really can be a great platform for us. You look at the size and the scale of that German
market, there are some unique aspects to it we have to figure out. Customers there do have more choice going in, so we
have to ensure our quality really stands out – our content stands out, our quality and drive, the quality in terms of HD
and DVR to make sure we focus on the right content to drive the experience. But that is really our focus, is maximizing
the business. While we know it is in a loss position in the short-term, I think our focus will remain on maximizing the
performance of the business.
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: I would just add that Germany is far the biggest and richest market in Europe. It's certainly
difficult for pay television, as Chase said, but we now have a management team that we have great confidence in, and
we're going to see it through.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore Partners, please go ahead.
<Q - Alan Gould>: Thank you. Two questions: Chase, first, can you just give us some sense of the timing of how this
BSkyB process is going to work, both with the regulatory body as well as with the independent board, and what you
meant by you've got other options for our cash?
And second for Dave, could you just repeat what was the normalized EPS in the quarter? Did it include $0.12 of
interest?
<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I'll let you go first. -
<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It included – there was a tax
benefit in the quarter which improved our earnings per share by about $0.12.
<Q - Alan Gould>: So was it 30 or was it $0.18?
<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: The adjusted EPS is $0.30,
which compares to a year ago of $0.19, and included within the $0.30 is a tax benefit of about $0.12.
<Q - Alan Gould>: Okay.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I guess on SKY front, I'm not sure
I can provide a lot of clarity beyond what we've said before. We're still in the early stages of the regulatory process we
have a regulatory review. I think as we've said, it could take sort of six months, but it could take longer, and we have to
see how that process goes along. At this point it seems to be going largely as we expected. Past that regulatory review, I
think we have got a commitment for a couple of months, three months to not pursue a proposal without a board
recommendation, and I think those are the parameters, so it'll...

<Q - Alan Gould>: So you are speaking with the independent board at the same time?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: No, I think right now it's the
regulatory review. That's really what I think we recognize from both sides it benefited us to get to a place where we had
the regulatory review behind us, and so that is really – the focus today is to get regulatory approval for the transaction.
<Q - Alan Gould>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: I guess I will just add, there are only two stages in Europe. We'll be filing very shortly in
Brussels, and that takes about a month to go through the first stage. They can call and normally do, but not always, for
a second stage, which could take two or three months. It would then come back to the British regulators, so that's why
Chase said it could be six months or 12 months, but certainly not more than 12.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: That's correct. Yeah...

<Q - Thomas Eagan>: Super, thank you very much. Just a question on SKY. They reached 9.8 million subscribers,
very close to their goal of 10 million and have taken major share in broadband and telephone. Was wondering what do
you think is the next strategic goal for them? Or it is more about harvesting what they've already done? Thanks a lot.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I don't think we're going to get too
far into sort of projecting where they're going, we obviously – being a shareholder, know the business well. We'll let
them speak to their plans. We obviously, with our interest, have been part of formulating those plans, but it's not like it
is a company that we have not been engaged with, so I think you can assume largely what they have been doing, we've
been a part of – a part of for – in many ways, you know, sort of at the center of building this business. But I think I'll let
them speak for what their plans and strategies are.

Thank you, the next question in queue then will come from the line of James Dix with Wedbush and your line is open.
<Q - James Dix>: Good afternoon, just wondered if you could comment to the extent you care to on potential M&A
opportunities and some which may have come up in the press recently, I believe one relating to acquisition of a sports
team, baseball, but also just generally what you might consider doing with some of the businesses in the Other segment,
such as Jamba and MySpace and what your timing is on any decisions you might make there?
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: I'm sorry. I would just begin by saying, we will not be buying any sporting teams. We are in
the business of buying sports rights for our sporting channels, not buying teams.
And as for other M&A possibilities, I don't think it'd be appropriate for us to discuss at this stage, but the – as far as
MySpace goes, it is getting – we have got a new management team. We've got great confidence in them. They are
doing a major overhaul that will look very, very different in a few months to what it's looked for the last few years, and
we're going to see it out for some time yet.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Yeah, I think...
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: I mean, obviously we're keeping it under very close review.

<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I mean, on Jamba we are –
announced the intention, we are pursuing a process to potentially sell that, but our general focus, as I said in the
opening comments, we prefer to build businesses than buy them. Maybe buying a – sort of a raw start, but we think that
has been the foundation on which we have built this business, and it's certainly what we plan to pursue.

Thank you, that will come from the line of Jolanta Masojada with Credit Suisse, and your line is open.
<Q - Jolanta Masojada>: Thanks very much. I just wondered if you could talk about the [inaudible] strategy being
pursued at the U.K. newspaper business and the potential to roll it out more broadly, and as part of that discussion, how
meaningful could iPad revenue become for the newspaper businesses globally?
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: Yeah, well I think it's very, very early days with our payroll around the Times, we have had a
very encouraging number of people subscribing at a good price. We're not going to release those numbers, all the
numbers for the [inaudible] or break them out at this stage, but it's – we think we're on the right strategy there, and we
think it's going well.
As for the iPad, of course there will be other imitators. There will be other people in the market very soon, but I believe
that that is a game changer altogether. We'll have young people reading newspapers. We'll have different-looking news
– types of newspapers. We have already got a number of new sites from independent people at the moment. It's a real
game changer in the presentation of news.

Operator
Thank you. The next question in queue will come from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. Chase, I wanted to ask you about executing at the TV division. Obviously
there was a lot of commentary on retrans and it was necessary and now of course you're getting it. On the past call – or
the prior call, I think there was a view that TV can get back to the $1 billion EBIT run rate that it had been averaging
pre-recession. So, you're at 220 million now, I know you get clinical this year, but how do you get from 220 million of
EBIT back to a billion, or is that not the goal anymore? Thanks.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Obviously retransmission, we're in
the very early stages of, you know, that process. We have done a couple, we have got a couple more coming up this
fall. As we said, it takes a few years, the affiliate side of it, we're just moving into, so, you know, realistically we're just
at the very beginning of that dynamic. And our stations realistically are still – you know, still sort of recovering or
growing, I mean, you look at this quarter, the year on year comps are not – they're going to get a lot tougher the second
half of the year, but you look at the year on year comps for the first half of this year, the station has, you know, great
comps, and, you know, even on the network we had Glee last year, but we probably got to a place where we were a
little too reliant on older expensive programming. We had 24, and I think we did a good job reenergizing with Glee.
I think we have an opportunity to really sort of reinvent American Idol this fall. Obviously there'll be some cost savings
in that, but I think more importantly, it's really an opportunity to really reenergize and get of a – you know, a fresh – an
existing franchise refreshment. Marry it to X-Factor in fall of 2011, that I think really gives us the potential for a great
double header in that business, and continue to really, you know, create programming that stands out. You look at

already – not that editorials or I guess reviews are always the best barometer of success, but I think the shows we have
got going on in the network this fall, people feel good about, I think we've got a great mix of a couple of hours and a
couple of half-hours that have great potential and I think that's the point, make sure we have got – you know, fresh,
new, exciting programming coming. And the network I think has growth in it.
I think the stations are still in a place of recovering. We are actually not through the cost cutting at the stations. We
have taken a fair amount of overhead and head count out, but through this calendar year, we're continuing to take some
of that out, and the – you know, I think there – you know, there are an array of initiatives from the retrans so the
stations can enter potential and the network, you know, finding, you know, continue to reenergize, you know, with
fresh programming like it's got coming this fall or Glee last year.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: That's helpful, and if I could ask a follow-up...
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: I'd just point out that we – we're the number one network this year by a bigger margin, I
think, than certainly we have ever been in the five years we have been in that position. And I am extremely confident
that – on what we're doing with Idol, but it's the year after when we're going to have Idol and X-Factor, and other
programs which should really make us stand right out as the number one. You get mass audiences, you get plenty of
advertising whatever the economic conditions.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Within our growth for the year,
projected growth for next year, we are projecting pretty significant growth for the television segment.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: I was just trying to get a sense of how much of it was revenue, and retrans versus advertisers
versus costs, but I think...?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: It is some of all. I would not say
costs are the driving force, but they're certainly a contributor to it, you know? But, you know, it is – both program costs
and efficiencies, but certainly they are all significant, they are not – retrans is probably the singular long term -but, look
if USA is going to make $1 billion, we have ratings that are multiples – and I'm not picking on them, but we have
ratings that are multiples of theirs for the type of event programming we have – you know, we'd better be making –
driving to make this business so that it makes more than they do.
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: So retransmit is full contribution which would be very great, that will take two or three years
by the time we get through all of our contracts for all the different MSOs, it's probably like what has happened with
FOX News, but it will be there and it will be very important.
Just on the stations, whereas, you know, for the company generally, we are moving more and more to subscription
models, and dependent on the regular subscription revenues and rising ones, but the stations which depend on
advertising, they will be getting part of the retrans, but they get bookings are extraordinary at the moment in every
category, I think, except maybe beverages.
In July alone, we were up 44% in automotive, and our pacing for the next two months, which may be a little deceptive,
because people are now making their bookings earlier, but we're talking an 80 to 90% increase in automotive. So it's
really very, very strong, and we are increasing our share of market in those local stations.

Mr. Greenfield, if you have a question, please go ahead at this time.
<A - Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Maybe we should move on.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Hello.
<A - Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Hello? Rich?
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Hello? Hello?
<A - Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Rich?
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Can you hear me now? Oh, sorry. So a question on SKY Deutschland, just when you look at
the differences between what you have seen in Italy, and Italy has obviously become, even though it is struggling at the
moment versus last year, it has been an overwhelming success. When you look at the challenges facing Germany as it
starts off in your investments there, what are the big differences that you see between Italy and Germany? What have
you learned so far? You changed management. Maybe give us a sense of why the change in management, what is being
done differently now that gives you confidence in where it's going over the next couple of years?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Sure. I guess I think probably the
first difference you look to between the two is – I touched on it a minute ago, in Germany, the consumers do have a fair
amount of choice – the majority have a fair amount of choice, where they start off with a – you know, with a fairly
decent channel package they get through cable or satellite, which wasn't the case, you know, in Italy. What that really
means is – what you focus on is sort of quality.
So in Germany it's more a quality experience. You have got to create – whether it's content – whether that quality is in
content or in technology, be it HD, DVRs, user interfaces or the like. So you want to create content that stands out.
Again, the other difference, I guess I'd say is you have a cable business there in Germany that probably covers half of
the market that you largely distribute through, so that – you know, I mean you don't really have a cable, you know,
industry in Italy. It means that the competition is different. I mean in Germany you have got the telco and the cable and
they're much more focused on broadband and telephony, and so we're there with the video offering, and I think the key
is really to offer a quality video offering. We've got a pretty wide open place to do it. They are making some noise, but
I do think their focus is elsewhere, and create a quality video offering, quality technology, and marry it to quality
service. And in Italy, toe to toe, someday become the media sat platform.
It is competing on price. I think we've got quality and I think we have found our footing and our mojo back in Italy, and
I feel like we're on a good track there, but you know – different competitive dynamics. You have got some real
economic benefits because of it. Germany is a bigger market, yet we pay significantly less for key sports rights in
Germany. Because of the infrastructure that exists in Germany sat is a fraction of what it would be in many markets,
because you can take advantage of the fact that people have – a lot of people have dishes on their home, a good
percentage get satellite, have dishes and in a lot of place they have set-top boxes. They have wiring into the homes. So
there's some real efficiencies you can take advantage of.
In Germany you've got to make sure you're smart about programming, you're betting on stuff that makes a difference,
be efficient with what you run, drive the places you can make a difference like HD and DVRs. Create a great
experience for customers, take advantage of the efficiencies and the opportunities that exist in terms of cost savings and
the like, make sure you're buying programming that makes a difference, you're not just buying bulk. And take
advantage perhaps of the competitive environment where the competitors are really focused value first and foremost on
other products. And I think those are a lot of dynamics that are different if you look at Italy.

Thank you. The next question in queue then will come from the line of Adam Alexander with Goldman Sachs. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Adam Alexander>: Good afternoon, guys. I was just looking at the international channels. They're becoming a
material driver of growth within cable networks. I wonder if you can break out the operating income for FY '10, and
then talk about their growth expectations on a three-year view, and what countries or regions are really driving that
growth?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Well, we're in probably most of
the world. There probably is some regions – Latin America has been a very successful region for us, Europe is a great
successful region for us, but we really – it is a, you know, big wide broad growth and some of these markets follows –
one of the great things about international is – you know, a lot of the markets are still just developing, and obviously we
need a developed distribution market to create channels for it and so we have – you know, we are, you know, riding on
the back of that but it is, you know, it is most continents, most regions. Again, those would be the couple that are
bigger. And I think the neighborhood this year is sort of around 400 million and again as I said, it's looking within five
years the business we expect to be a $1 billion business.

from the financial community.

Thank you, sir; that last question will come from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Spencer Wang>: Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first question is for Rupert; you are clearly trying to
get paid for your print content online, so I was wondering if you could update us on your current thoughts about how
you plan on monetizing your TV programs and networks online in the context of the TV Everywhere initiative as well
as your ownership in Hulu, and then just very quick for Dave, should we expect any material changes in CapEx in
fiscal '11, versus the 914 million you reported in fiscal 2010? Thank you.
<A - David DeVoe, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'll do the CapEx. It will be a bit
higher in fiscal 2011, probably going to be in the 1.1 billion, 1.2 billion range.
<Q - Spencer Wang>: Great.
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: I would say on the – we'll be pushing very hard on VOD. If you talk about Hulu, and Netflix,
and various things, these new businesses are under constant review. Some are a challenge to us, and I wouldn't say any
more than that at the moment, other than that Chase and I and the whole of the film company are giving a great deal of
thought to future moves in this area.
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: And I think the general theme as
you get into these digital arenas that are – you know, that you want – I think you – you want to move towards, you
know, dual revenue stream businesses – it doesn't mean there aren't some places you have free, but I think probably
subscription is the most, but I think we need to look at an array of sort of dual revenue stream businesses and I think we
need to manage windows, and I think the Times business has gotten they sort of acted first and thought second, and I
think we need to, you know, make sure we have great product we need product and manage the pricing and the
windows and the like, and we need to be part of this digital world, and I think there are great opportunities. I do think
mobility – and I agree with Rupert's observations on the iPad, and I don't believe there are a lot of iPads, not just there
are a lot of tablets, and a lot of devices. I think really that's an opportunity to create a whole new platform that we can
develop and develop in a constructive way. And do things like authentication. It has the promise of really developing,
you know, the business, you know, business models that are healthy for us that open up, you know, new avenues, find
new exciting opportunities for our customers but find them, you know, in ways that enable us to you know – to, you

<Q - Peter Ryan>: Yes, I'm Peter Ryan from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Sydney. I wanted to get your
thoughts on the Australian election campaign. What are you seeing as the big issues for the economy, and who would
you prefer to see as Prime Minister of Australia: Julia Gillard or Tony Abbott?
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: I think I have no comment at all. Just read our newspapers and see what our editors think.
They have the freedom to decide that. You know, we're obviously watching it closely, and there haven't been any really
great issues emerge yet.

search contract? With that deal with Google expiring at the end of this month, what is the status of talks there? And
how much do you expect that new contract to be worth?
<A - Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer>: We're actively talking to parties –
probably not going to say a whole lot. We'll negotiate deals first and announce them second, and we have interest in it,
but, you know, we're not expecting a deal like we had before, we're expecting this would be a performance-based deal,
and to the degree we can add dimensions to it, we will, but you are right, it is imminent, and we are actively engaged.

opportunities around, you know, mobile. For a number of years we talked about, you know, the value of content, you
know, in our mobile platforms, and I think you may get, I don't know, maybe a 20 year old to watch a smartphone, but I
think this device really – and as others have those devices out there, you know, really gives you both a much richer
experience, really is obviously very conducive to video, but even if you take the Wall Street Journal on an iPad is a
very different experience than it is on a PC.
And I think you can use it for some of these things and using it tells you how it is different and I think it is also a device
that for the first time, you know, really starts to deliver on the promise of multimedia, where you can see how you
could jump between – you can sort of go between what traditionally would be video content, printed content,
advertising that really is interactive, and if you could penetrate through and, you know, and engage with, so I think a lot
of the buzz words that have existed you know for a few years, people talk about interactive TV and mobile platforms
and all of that stuff, you know, for a few years I think all of a sudden it becomes something you can envision and a real
that's happened. I think for us it's incumbent enough to try to figure out what are the opportunities again, intelligently,
you know, recognizing our product has tremendous value and how do we exploit it?
You know, how do we develop the right consumer experiences, you know, on those devices, and what are the types of
digital opportunities that we can develop? We're actively engaged in trying to develop an array of ways to display – and
I think – you know, this is emerging platform, which we think will be an enormous platform, and we think it's a real
opportunity for us.
<Q - Shira Ovide>: Okay.
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: I'd just add – I'd just say – I'll add this. I mentioned the word 'game changer' before, I believe
that. I think we're going to see around the world hundreds and hundreds and millions of these devices and there will be
all sorts of things we can do with them and – as they develop technologically, we have got to develop our methods of
presentation of news.
<Q - Shira Ovide>: And that means also kind of seeding – as people have written about, seeding separate news
organizations to be devoted exclusively to news on tablets?

of things here, you know, and I think we think there's, you know, some exciting opportunities.

Operator
Thank you and the next question in queue will come from the line of George Szalai with The Hollywood [Reporter].
Please go ahead.
<Q - George Szalai>: Hi gentlemen. I was wondering whether you care at all who controlled CKX, the company
behind American Idol, and what your take is on who the judges for that show should be?
[Laughter].
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: I think we're very close to announcing who the judges will be. They are in very active
negotiations with a number of people, and all I can assure you is that the next year's Idol will be different. It will be
better. The music will certainly be better, and we'll – we've got great expectations for it. As for CKX, no, we don't
really have any say on who the owner is, or will be.
<A - Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Next question, please?

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Jordan Chong with the Australian Associated Press, please go
ahead.
<Q - Jordan Chong>: Good morning. Mr. Murdoch, I was just wondering if you could – if whether the rights or the
anti-siphoning list here in Australia sort of could create some uncertainty in terms of bidding for sport rights that your
pay TV operations here in Australia might be interested in? If you could talk a bit about that, please?
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: You mean the position of FOXTEL versus the free-to-air?
<Q - Jordan Chong>: Yeah, just in terms of bidding for sports rights that are coming up between the lack of a new
updated anti-siphoning list from the government whether that creates some uncertainty about – about, you know, the
prospect of your pay TV operations here bidding for some of those rights?
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: Well, we only have 25% of FOXTEL, and I think personally that the anti-siphoning, I
understand how it happened, which I won't go into, but, you know, it does hurt the sports associations, in that there's no
open bidding between pay and free-to-air, and also it hurts the viewers in that a lot of sports, which are not top sports,
were on the anti-siphoning list and get put on by the free-to-air at 2:00 in the morning or something. So, you know, will
it be impacted by the election? I really don't know.
<A - Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Thank you sir. That final question will come from Brian Stelter with the New York Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Stelter>: Thanks for taking the call. It's been one year since the liberal groups started to boycott Beck's
show on FOX and they still seem to be...
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: Excuse me, boycott what?
<Q - Brian Stelter>: ...any effect on FOX News?
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: I didn't get that. They're boycotting what?
<Q - Brian Stelter>: It's been one year since all of these liberal groups started to boycott Glenn Beck's show on FOX
News. As that boycott continues...
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: Well, they're not boycotting watching it – they're not boycotting watching it, because it's
getting incredible numbers. We haven't lost any business at all. Some might have moved to other programs, but no.
<Q - Brian Stelter>: Okay.
<A - Rupert Murdoch>: It certainly has not affected the total revenues or the profits
<Q - Brian Stelter>: Thank you.
<A - Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thank you, everybody for joining our call today. If
you have any further questions. Please feel free to call us and have a great day.
