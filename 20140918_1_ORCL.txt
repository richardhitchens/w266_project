MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay
purposes.
I'd like to now turn the call over to Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Kenneth Bond
Thank you, Victoria. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings
conference call.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision of these
forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I would like to turn the call over
Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2 and then turn the
call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.
Those of you who have followed us for a while know that Q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter which can mean more
volatility in our results, and that's what we saw this quarter. Currency was a 1% tailwind to total revenues. Today, my
comments generally reflect constant dollar growth rates.
Cloud revenue totaled $477 million, growing 29%. In that Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS were $339 million, up 31% from last
year and up 4% sequentially. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service [IaaS] was $138 million, up 25%. Q1 results in the
Cloud were better-than-expected, and with us now three times bigger than Workday, now that's not enough for us as
our goal is to be bigger than Salesforce and faster-growing than Workday while growing cash flow and improving our
already high levels of profitability.
New software license was $1.4 billion, down 2% from last year, and software updates and product support was a record
$4.7 billion, up 6%. Software and cloud revenue totaled $6.6 billion in Q1, growing 6%.
Customers have started to move from on-premise systems to the cloud, but with so many on-premise customers and
only 30% of our support base in applications, we haven't seen a reduction in software updates and product support
renewal rates, which continue at their usual high levels. However, as the movement to the cloud grows, we expect this
transition will affect our revenue to the positive. These customers will essentially replace their software support
payments with a cloud subscription, which will mean substantially more revenue to Oracle.
That is because not only will we be providing the most up-to-date software, but we'll also be providing the hardware,
the application management, and complete operation. Of course, we expect that as the customer pays more to Oracle,
this increase will be more than offset by a reduction in their costs of implementing and running their own systems. And
because we control nearly all of our own supply chain and benefit from enormous economies of scale, we expect most
customers converting their premise-based software support payments to cloud subscriptions will be immediately
accretive to operating income as well.
In the case of new or existing customers taking cloud subscriptions in lieu of buying new or additional software
licenses, there will be a short-term delay in revenue. But over the medium- and long-term, we also expect more revenue
and operating income as well as increased cash flow.
As for the details in this quarter, GAAP software and cloud results in the Americas grew 6%, helped by a very strong
performance from our North America application team and our global business unit. Thanks to the fantastic EMEA
management team, considering the geopolitical situations in Europe and the Middle East, EMEA was up an astounding
7%. Asia Pac grew 2%.
Engineered Systems continue to grow and were over a third of hardware product revenue over the last 12 months.
However, hardware revenue in total was down 8% as other servers and storage revenues, especially tape, declined.
Hardware system product revenue was down 14%, while hardware systems support was down 2%. Consulting services,
which I don't usually comment on, because they are not as strategic to our business, also suffered from some execution
issues in North America.

Total revenue for the quarter was $8.6 billion, up 2% from last year. The quarter was not dependent on any one large
deal. Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion. It was 1% higher than last year, and operating margin was
44.4%, down just 22 basis points from last year because the sales shortfall in hardware – in some hardware, and
consulting happened late in the quarter and did not allow us time to adjust our expense base in the quarter. Free cash
flow increased to a record $14.7 billion over the last four quarters to an all-time high of $6.5 billion for the quarter, up
6% from Q1 last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%. EPS for the quarter grew 4% in U.S. dollars to $0.62 on a
non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate was 19.7% due to some one-time events and the mix of earnings. On a GAAP
basis, EPS for the quarter was $0.48 in U.S. dollars, up 2%.
At quarter end, deferred revenue was at a record $8.9 billion, up 5% from last year, and we had nearly $52 billion in
cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position was $19 billion, so both of these balances are roughly $5
billion lower now that we've closed the MICROS transaction.
This quarter we repurchased nearly 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months we've
repurchased more than 5% of the shares outstanding a year ago and paid out more than $2.1 billion in dividends, and
nearly 75% of our cash flow was returned to shareholders. We recently increased our share buyback authorization by
an additional $13 billion, and we now have a total authorization of more than $15 billion available. The Board of
Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share.
As I move to guidance, I need to make some comments first regarding MICROS, which we closed a few days ago.
First, we will not own it for the whole quarter. Secondly and much more importantly, because our revenue recognition
policies and our operating procedures are strict, the contributions for MICROS will not be consistent with their
historical run rate. For example, I am only expecting about $14 million in on-premise new license revenue for the
quarter for MICROS.
Also, given recent currency movements, we expect to see a currency headwind of 1% for cloud revenues, 2% for
software and cloud revenue combined, and 2% for both hardware and total revenue, and that could very much change.
So taking all that into account, SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow between 40% to 45% in
constant currency, 39% to 44% in U.S. dollars. On a GAAP basis, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 39% to
44% in constant currency and 38% to 43% in U.S. dollars. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to
grow 40% to 44% in constant currency and 39% to 43% in U.S. dollars. Software and cloud revenue on a GAAP and
non-GAAP basis, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, news software license, and software support is expected to grow 5% to
8% in constant currency, 3% to 6% in U.S. dollars. Hardware systems revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis,
which includes hardware system products and hardware systems support, is expected to be negative 8% to positive 2%
in constant currency, negative 10% to 0% in U.S. dollars.
Total revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 2% to 6% in constant currency, 0%
to 4% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 and $0.72 in constant currency,
$0.66 and $0.70 in U.S. dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.53 and $0.57 in constant
currency and $0.51 and $0.55 in U.S. dollars. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 22.5% and a non-GAAP tax
rate of 23%. Of course, it may end up being different.
As you have seen in the last few minutes, we announced that Larry was elected Executive Chairman and appointed
Chief Technology Officer. Mark and I have been appointed CEO. Other than Mark and I reporting to the Board of
Directors, of which Larry will be Executive Chairman, instead of into Larry directly, no other reporting relationships
will change at the company. In addition, though I will no longer go by the CFO title, I will be the principal financial
officer for all regulatory purposes. We will not be hiring a CFO and my teams will continue to report to me.
With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments.

Thank you, Safra.
Next week at Oracle OpenWorld, we will be rolling out our new Database Cloud Service with our new multi-tenant
database-as-a-service offering. Our customers and ISVs can move any of their existing applications and databases to
the Oracle cloud with the push of a button. With the push of a button, your data is automatically compressed ten-to-one
and encrypted for secure and efficient transfer to the cloud. With the push of a button, your existing application
automatically becomes a multi-tenant application and is moved to the Oracle Cloud. No reprogramming is required.
Every single Oracle feature even our latest high-speed in-memory processing is included in the Oracle Cloud Database
Service. Hundreds of thousands of customers and ISVs have been waiting for exactly this. Database is our largest
software business and database will be our largest cloud service business.
Mark, over to you.
Mark V. Hurd
Listen, before we take questions, I thought I'd just give you seven or eight facts about our cloud business in the quarter.
First, bookings grew 54% – 3x last year's growth rate. Fusion bookings, ERP, HCM and SFA all grew triple digits.
Two, revenue grew 32% USD, 2x last year's growth rate. Three, we got 500 new cloud customers in the quarter. Four,
170 of them were HCM customers. Based on what I heard Workday report they got something like 25. We got 60
Fusion HCM new customers in the quarter.
Four, in CX we had 290 new customers, 90 including – 90 fusion SFA and almost 200 marketing new customers in the
quarter. Five, ERP – we added 90 new customers in Fusion ERP and a like number in our EPM cloud. And all I'm
talking about now here is ERP Cloud and EPM Cloud.
Fusion overall had triple digit bookings growth, triple digit revenue growth. We added nearly 200 net new Fusion
customers and had many tens of go lives. And while the transition to the Cloud is in the early stages we're already at a
run rate of nearly $2 billion.
A couple of comments on hardware, we declined in SPARC this quarter while we grew Engineered Systems double
digits. As Safra mentioned Engineered Systems now makes up a third of our hardware. While we're growing double
digits our competitors are declining double digits. We shipped our 10,000th engineered system in Q1. Lifetime
bookings in hardware alone for Engineered Systems now exceed $3 billion.
Hardware support margins are now approaching 70% as a testimony to the change in our overall hardware mix and the
stickiness of this business.
And with that, I'll turn it over to you all for questions.
Kenneth Bond
Victoria, we'll go to the Q&A portion of the call, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Thank you. This question is for Larry. Larry, I wonder if you could address the issue of why
the change in your role in the company and if you could clarify what the change might really be in terms of the working
relationship and your responsibilities and daily activities in the business.

<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Again, Mark and Safra have done a spectacular job and I think they deserve the
recognition of their new titles. I'm going to continue to work with Thomas Kurian in Software Engineering and John
Fowler in Hardware Engineering and Ed Screven and Mark and Safra as I have exactly in the past.
So I'm going to continue doing what I've been doing over the last several years. They're going to continue what they've
been doing over the last several years. So they deserve the recognition, they deserve the CEO title, and I'm happy that
our management team continues forward as a team.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey, thank you; Mark and Safra, congratulations on the new role. Question for me is, if you
look about into the quarter, I mean, obviously there were expectations out and you were slightly weaker. On the one
hand side, I see the transformation. I see a very strong deferred number and a very strong cash number. But then I see
the hardware results. How do you think about the quarter, and how in Q4, you thought it was better than we thought
about it? How do you think about Q1 now? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Again, I like Safra's quote. We're focused on two things, becoming number one in the
cloud. That means growing our cloud business rapidly. So you're seeing an acceleration in our growth rate. We are
forecasting that we grow our cloud, our SaaS and PaaS cloud business this coming quarter between 40% and 45%. So
not only are we getting bigger in the cloud, we're, our growth rate is going up.
That's usually the opposite of what happens. So we're focused on becoming number one in the cloud, being bigger than
Salesforce in the cloud. And to do that, we've got to increase our growth rate, and that's exactly what we're doing.
Now while we're doing that, we have one other key focus: to continue to deliver record levels of cash flow, and that's
exactly what we're doing. So we're getting bigger in the cloud. Our growth rate is increasing the cloud. Our cash flow is
getting better. We think it was a great Q1, and it's going to get even better in terms of our growth rates in the cloud.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I thought you might mention in your question that the Chairman last quarter referenced a 50%
bookings growth rate, and we delivered 54%. And I'll make a bold prediction: we'll do it again.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: And that's exactly what we need. Again, when we say we want to be number one in the
cloud, we have to deliver growth rates in that 50% range. And that's what we're shooting at and that's what we think we
can achieve. By the way, that isn't even including our new database service that we roll out this fall. So that's going to
add a multiplier to our growth rate in the cloud.
So we're getting triple-digit growth rates in our Fusion applications, our internally developed, organically developed
Fusion applications. And now with the database in the cloud, we think that's going to continue to amplify that growth
rate and increase the size of our business and make us number one. So if we can do that, if we can become number one
in the cloud, execute this transition and we'll become the leader in the cloud, and deliver record-level cash flow, we
think we're doing a pretty good job.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Hi, congrats, guys, on the growth that you're seeing in the cloud, both in terms of just the
revenue and obviously, the upside in deferred. Along those lines, I wonder if you could comment or just provide us

more details on what you're seeing in the cloud versus on-premise on the application side. Mark, you noted some pretty
nice wins in terms of Fusion HCM. I'm just wondering if you could provide us more detail and compare and contrast
the on-premise and the cloud.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Phil, first, my prediction there of 50%, to Larry's point, was a SaaS prediction as opposed to an
overall cloud prediction, which frankly, could be higher. On apps in the quarter, we grew apps in the quarter
on-premise. We had double-digit growth in North America on apps. So we had good growth on apps, license, plus what
we did in SaaS. So it was a really strong overall apps ecosystem quarter.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: But let me add that – I believe this number is correct. We added more ERP customers in
the cloud this past quarter than Workday has had in the life of their company.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Correct.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: So how about that?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yes.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: So we are feeling really good about our ability to become the leader in ERP. We are the
leader in mid-market and high-end ERP in the cloud; increase our leadership in marketing, and defeat Workday in their
core HCM business.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: So I think that context is what you're looking for. We had a strong ERP license quarter in North
America. We had a really strong SaaS ERP number in North America. And to Larry's point, if everything we've heard
Workday talk about with their customers, we got more in the quarter than they have in the lifetime of their company.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: That's what I like to hear. Congrats, guys.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with BMO Capital.
<Q - Joel P. Fishbein>: Hi, guys. I would like to get some color some the 12c database cycle, specifically the drivers
and when we should expect it to impact numbers.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Again, there are two key portions of the 12c database. One is the fact that it takes your
existing applications and makes them multi-tenant by vulture of running on the 12c version of the database. And the
second is it takes your existing applications and stores the data in-memory in compressed columnar format, therefore
sometimes increasing your analytic performance by a factor of 100.
So those are the two big drivers on our 12c database. But as you know, it takes people a while to adopt these features.
But I think you're going to see the Database business, Option business accelerate through the remainder of this fiscal
year and it will continue on to through the next fiscal year. So I think we're going to get strong results for the rest of
this fiscal year. And again, it will continue well on for at least another 12 months after that.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Database Options actually was in double digits, and it's exactly as Larry said. It is accelerating,
it has accelerated. It has actually doubled, more than doubled. So it's doing very, very well, and in-memory is one of
those options.
<Q - Joel P. Fishbein>: Is it where you would expect it to be at this point in the cycle?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I'd say it's slightly ahead of where we would normally expect it to be. Now we were
optimistic about these two features. So we thought these Options rates would be faster than historically we've
experience with new versions of the database. And that's exactly what's happening. But again, it's a geometric
progression. It's happening sooner but the big numbers are still one, two quarters away.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Hey, good afternoon, guys. First, congratulations on the changes in the roles, but I do have
to say, Larry, we're going to miss you on these calls, and it's been quite a run.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: You should be so lucky. I'm staying on the calls.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: All right.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: So you're going to have to wait a little while longer before you get me off the calls. I
apologize to everyone for that.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Good news then. Good. We can still bother you then with our questions. With that, I really
had two questions. One, maybe Mark you can tackle, and then maybe Safra. But on – Mark on the hardware side, can
you give us a little more color on, let's say, some of the shortfall that you saw. Maybe break it down by geo or break it
down by product line and just some color there?
And then Safra, just on your deferred revenue growth, again, maybe talk a little about the composition of the upside
you saw in deferred revenue and whether that was maintenance, multiyear contracts on the SaaS booking side. Just in
general, what was driving that for the business? Thanks.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Sure. Let me take deferred revenue, because I always get that question when it goes down.
And so I want to take it when it goes up also.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: It's the same answer. I know that's really dull, but the reality is that deferred revenue is almost
entirely, but not entirely, but almost entirely impacted by support which, as I mentioned, remains extremely strong. Q1
has always been extremely seasonal. It's everything I've ever told you in every one of the calls. It's very, very strong.
Yes, some of it is SaaS, but really the bulk of it and the growth is the business remains very, very strong. Renewals
remain very, very strong, and as a result deferred revenue remains strong and growing. So it's dominated because of the
sizes of the businesses by the growth of increased support.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: On hardware, by the way, to Safra's point, applications support revenue grows. I just thought I
would add that in.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Oh, yes.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Just so you make sure everybody is clear who has an opinion on that. In hardware, we had tape
declined. We had SAN decline. We have a new SAN release that will come out shortly – OpenWorld. We grew in what
you would think of as ZFS, so our NAS storage grew. Engineered Systems I mentioned grew double digits. Now while
I say SPARC declined within Engineered Systems the SPARC SuperCluster actually had very strong growth. So we
had strong growth in Engineered – or we had double-digit growth in Engineered Systems, strong growth within that
with SPARC SuperCluster, ZFS, NAS storage growth, tape decline, SPARC decline. That's hardware.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?

<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just wanted to drill into the tech side
of the business. It looks like we've been waiting for the 12C product cycle. Can you talk about if the weakness in tech
licenses in the quarter was due to transition effect as you get into 12C, training or if there was any execution pockets
that you ran into? And also I think you were pretty optimistic and continue to be optimistic about the demand for
multi-tenant and in-memory. Can you compare that to how strong the rack cycle was? Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I'll take the first part but I'd say on tech overall I think tech overall was fine with the exception
of one region, which was North America. So if you looked at all the numbers Safra gave you, I think good clarity on
the options business, which was strong even in North America but core tech North America was weak. Virtually around
the rest of the world it was fine. So we had good performance, roughly what we expected in the quarter in what I would
call core tech.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: As far as the adoption rate we're seeing in-memory and multi-tenant is actually being
adopted at a faster rate than rack. And I think rack is a good comparison because rack was absolutely a strategic feature
for transaction processing where in-memory is a strategic feature for a query processing. And it's just that rack actually
takes is a little more difficult to implement so I'd say the adoption was therefore somewhat impacted from customers
trying it out, getting used to it, getting people trained and then they would – it would fan out beyond a few
mission-critical applications.
In-memory, it doesn't require a lot of training. It literally is push a button and it runs a lot faster. Therefore, we're seeing
somewhat of a faster adoption rate and I think you'll see that over the next several quarters. So it should be at least as
big as rack and grow slightly – and have a slightly faster adoption rate.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: By the way, Kash, I should've taken the time to done a shout out to our European team. Safra
did that but I'd do it as well. In core tech in Europe we grew double digits. So just to give you a context of the kind of
performance we saw in Europe it's truly, truly outstanding.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Let me add my voice to that. As our Russia business headed toward zero and they had all
these other problems that you read about in the newspaper or on the web and they still managed – Loïc still managed to
do a brilliant job over there and his team continues to execute very, very well in what we would call difficult
circumstances. So we're thrilled about the work he's doing for us.
<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Thank you, everybody.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?

Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Yeah, hi. Thanks. My question is back to the leadership changes and in particular I'd love to
learn a little bit more about how these changes might trickle down into the rest of the Oracle organization? Safra, you
touched a little bit on the CFO role and how I think you left a message that really no significant change. I wanted to
ask, Mark, as you transition to your new role whether that would result in any change on the sales leadership and sales
structure side as well?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: No.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Karl, I just want to make sure we are very, very clear. There will actually be no changes, not
no significant changes. I just want to clarify, no changes whatsoever.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Karl, I don't want to be short but it's just not a – in my view, we're pretty flat in terms of the
way we run the place, and we want to keep it that way. So I want to stay closer to the action, not get farther away from

<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Got it, okay. That's very clear, thank you.

Your final question comes from line of Brent Thill with UBS.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Good afternoon. Maybe for each of you just to touch on the business model transition to
subscription, how long do you expect this to take to roll through the model? Larry, I know even on the database side,
there are some interesting opportunities as database-as-a-service could impact the old-school model. I'm just curious
how you look at this.
And then for all of us on the line, obviously, you get to see the backlog number and you can look at the growth, but we
can't actually see the physical backlog. And at some point, would you look to something like Salesforce where they
give you a backlog number every quarter as a reporting metric going forward?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Again, the way I look at it is we're going to be doing more for our customers. It's exactly
what Safra said earlier. We're going to be doing more for our customers than we did before. So before we used to sell
them software and they would have to provide their own data centers and their own machines and their own labor and
their own network to run to all of that. And now we're going to put a lot of that in our data center. We're going to buy
the machines. We're going provide the skilled labor. Whether you're buying infrastructure-as-a-service, we'll be
maintaining the operating system and the virtual machine for you along with the hardware and storage – processing and
storage.
If you buy platform, we'll also be maintaining the Oracle database and Java, the world's most popular programming
language and the world's most popular database. That's our platform. We're going to be doing more for you. And as we
do more for you, you're going to pay us more, but the customer is going to spend less. So it's a win-win. We get
economies of scale. We get specialization of labor. We're very good at running Oracle databases. We're very good at
managing Java virtual machines. We're pretty good at running data centers, and we're great at running all these
applications. That's the third level if you buy our ERP, and our planning applications.
And again, we're doing – we're your data center. We're your hardware company. We're your networking company.
We're your storage company. We're all of those things.
So the promise is for Oracle to be a much larger and much more profitable and much more critical supplier to our
customers, a much more strategic supplier to our customers, especially when you go to the next level of applications,
which are the vertical applications, which are financial services, for banks, for telephone companies, for retailers, for
hotels and restaurant chains, all of those things. It gives us an opportunity to give them a complete solution which is
strategic to their business and has much higher value than selling technology components, which is what the industry
has been doing historically.
So we see this as a huge opportunity for Oracle Corporation to grow and expand our relevance into the next generation
of computing, grow our business, be more profitable, and we think we have all the assets to do that. It's very interesting
that in ERP, we overnight, over one quarter sold more ERP systems in the cloud than Workday has done in the life of
their company. We have a lot of assets. One of the things we lead with, with ERP is budgeting and planning, EPM in
the cloud. Workday's answer to that is we don't have one of those. None of our competitors have one of those in the
cloud. SAP, as far as I know, isn't moving anything to the cloud other than Ariba and SuccessFactors, by the way,
which I'm going to point out, run on Oracle. Both of them run on Oracle, not Hana, run on Oracle. So Oracle is already
the most popular database in the cloud.
So every generation of computing, computing gets bigger. And this is our chance to get bigger, to become more
important. If we execute well, and when Mark says he wants to stay close to the action, and when Safra says you've got
a laser-like focus on two things, being number one in the cloud and delivering record levels of cash flow. We are all
