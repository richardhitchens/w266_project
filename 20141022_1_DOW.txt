Andrew N. Liveris
Thank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. This is another strong quarter for Dow
on our results on the top and bottom line, and they reflect deliberate actions we have taken and continue to take to focus
on execution, control what we can control and drive a full array of productivity measures – what we have called our
self-help measures. These actions demonstrate the advantage of our integrated and diversified business model and how
we are successfully leveraging our scale, geographic reach, technology expertise and physical integration to achieve
targeted growth in our priority market sectors, especially in times of great volatility.
It's with great pleasure that I introduce not one but two CFOs and two Investor Relations VPs in the room with me
today. With the luxury of having both Howard and Bill present, I'll be handing over a substantial portion of the
commentary over to the two of them to address this quarter's outstanding results.
But first, Bill, I know I speak on behalf of our colleagues when I extend my sincere appreciation for your service to
Dow, notably your leadership in the company's Chief Financial Officer role. We have achieved many financial
milestones during your tenure in this seat. Thank you for your leadership and for your values.
Howard, welcome. You have demonstrated significant leadership as a member of my core leadership team over these
past many years. I have strong confidence with you in this critical role for Dow.
Bill, you're first.
William H. Weideman
Thank you, Andrew. Turning to slides 4 and 5, where I will review the financial highlights for the quarter. Earnings per
share rose to $0.72 on an adjusted basis, up 44% versus the same quarter last year. This represents the eighth
consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in earnings per share.
We delivered broad-based revenue gains, particularly in Performance Plastics, Performance Materials, and Electronic
and Functional Materials, demonstrating the value of our integrated value chains.
In a volatile global environment that we faced again this quarter, our global footprint shined as sales rose in all
geographic areas. Most notable was our strength in the Americas, where we are further investing in our
industry-leading feedstock advantage and deep integration in downstream value-added products.
The benefits of our sharp productivity focus drove EBITDA up 24% to $2.3 billion. Also, adjusted EBITDA margins
expanded again this quarter, up more than 240 basis points. In fact, both Performance Plastics and Electronic and
Functional Materials achieved record third quarter EBITDA, while continued productivity actions and improving
market fundamentals across Performance Materials resulted in a year-over-year EBITDA increase of 61% in this
segment, demonstrating the continued positive impact of the company's self-help actions.

These factors more than offset the impact of a decline in equity earnings due to higher Sadara spending and the
negative impact associated with our ethylene production facility outage in Fort Saskatchewan, as we previously
announced.
Our advantaged positions, our drive for productivity and our geographic diversification all helped drive our operating
rate to 88% this quarter, a level not seen since 2007. All of this enabled us to return value to you, our shareholders,
evidenced by the $4.4 billion in declared dividends and share repurchases we have completed year-to-date.
In short, we are focused on maintaining our momentum of further enhancing ROC, increasing profitability, generating
cash and maximizing shareholder value.
Before I turn the call over to Howard, I'd like to pause for a moment. As you know and as Andrew already mentioned,
I've announced my plans to retire from Dow after 38 years of wonderful experience at the company.
Howard and I will continue the transition process through the end of the year, but today represents my final earnings
call as CFO.
I'm very pleased to transition the CFO responsibilities to Howard. Howard's strong business leadership experience and
passion for finance will be a great asset.
It has truly been my pleasure to work for such a great company and to work with Andrew and with the other leadership
members – Jim, Joe and Howard – and all my Dow colleagues. I have been extremely fortunate and I have built
life-long relationships at Dow that I will cherish forever.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Howard.
Howard I. Ungerleider
Thank you very much, Bill, and thank you for your leadership as our CFO, but also thank you for the many significant
contributions that you've added so much value over the decades to Dow. I gladly but humbly accept the baton. It's been
a real pleasure getting the opportunity to work with you over the many years, and please know that we'll all miss you a
great deal.
Good morning, everyone. Now, let's walk through some of the insights and what we expect to see in the fourth quarter.
We're not planning for any improvement in the macroeconomic environment. That said, we're positive on the
fundamentals in Performance Plastics even with the headwinds of lower oil. In Performance Materials, we expect our
ongoing focus on self-help actions to enable continued steady improvements for the segment versus the same quarter
last year.
On a sequential basis, we expect typical downward seasonality within both Electronic and Functional Materials and
Coatings and Infrastructure. While seasonality in Ag Sciences picks up, we expect full year growth in Ag despite weak
seed prices.
Turnarounds are expected to be higher by approximately $50 million versus the prior quarter and approximately $75
million versus the year-ago period. Sequentially, equity earnings are expected to be lower, associated with turnarounds
at EQUATE and Prentiss. And in addition, we're expecting higher spending in Sadara as the joint venture ramps toward
first product in the second half of next year.
We continue to carefully monitor the current hydrocarbon pricing environment and will leverage our feedstock
flexibility to mitigate pricing volatility. Over the long term, our view on oil remains constructive, and we'll talk about
that in a few minutes. In the near term, however, the situation is volatile and we are well prepared to adapt as needed.
On 2015, we'll be providing our modeling assumptions at our upcoming Investor Forum in November in Houston, so
yet one more reason to join us in Texas next month.

As you can see in our results, Dow delivered another solid performance, another proof point of our ongoing execution,
and the outcome of focused actions we continue to take on the top and the bottom line to drive higher profitability,
leveraging our integrated value chains.
The targeted actions we continue to drive across our portfolio are firmly rooted in this value chain focus. By applying a
combination of best owner mindset, capturing opportunities for organic growth, taking advantage of the differentiation
enabled by our integration and our geographic reach, and, importantly, driving higher returns on capital.
We're leveraging Dow's capability segment by segment and business by business to deliver higher returns. We're
consistently seeing the results of this focus, as you can see on slide 7, even in a quarter where macroeconomic volatility
was amplified.
This is most notable in Performance Materials, a segment where we have committed to improve and where our actions
over the last many quarters continue to gain traction, particularly in Polyurethanes and Epoxy. Here, we've
implemented a broader productivity focus, running a leaner, more efficient model and reducing costs. During the
quarter, these actions led to higher volume and increased utilization, enabling stronger results.
In areas of our portfolio where fundamentals remain strong, our productivity mindset is providing an additional source
of upside on top of end market growth. For example, in Electronic and Functional Materials and in Performance
Plastics, the company achieved record quarterly EBITDA as higher revenues in key businesses were bolstered by
aggressive actions we took to capture growing demand.
In Ag Sciences, we achieved a major milestone in the quarter with back-to-back approvals for our ENLIST Weed
Control System. Results reflect softening market conditions in a seasonally weak quarter. However, our technology
investments and our commercialization of new molecules position us well for future growth in this attractive sector.
Collectively, we continue to pull strategic, operational and financial levers to navigate market uncertainty and to deliver
increasing year-over-year results, all while reinforcing our foundation to strengthen returns over the long term.
So, what are we seeing in our segments? Beginning with Electronic Materials on slide 8, while demand for Dow
solutions in this sector remained strong, revenues declined slightly versus the year-ago period. This was driven
primarily by lower sales in films and filters and OLED materials. We do see continued upside on the strength in
semiconductor materials, particularly associated with our CMP pads and slurries.
Looking forward, we expect market fundamentals in our Electronic Materials business to remain strong as consumer
demand for continuous connectivity and brighter displays in widespread applications ranging from automobiles to
homes drive ongoing innovation and growth into 2015.
In Functional Materials, our businesses are delivering customized solutions built on close customer relationships. Dow
Microbial Control and Dow Pharma and Food Solutions both delivered double-digit growth with innovative products
targeted at key sectors, including water, energy and pharmaceuticals. Moving forward, we expect increased global
demand for high-value solutions that require science-driven expertise.
Turning to Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions. In Dow Coating Materials, broad-based sales gains reflected the
outcome of a combination of operational and strategic actions. This quarter also represented the seventh consecutive
quarter of sales gains for this business. In epoxy coatings, for example, ongoing self-help enabled improved results.
And while overall, Coatings market growth has slowed marginally in the third quarter, we do expect positive
momentum for the full year compared with 2013. This, of course, will be tempered slightly by the typical seasonal
reduction in demand in the fourth quarter.
In Dow Water and Process Solutions, we continue to see strong demand for reverse osmosis and ion exchange
technologies. Our outlook for this business remains positive as we expect our leading technology position in this sector
to enable top and bottom line growth for 2014 and into next year.
Turning to Dow Building and Construction, self-help remains a key area of focus and an important driver looking
ahead, particularly in Europe, for example, where we have delivered multiple quarters of cost improvement despite

lower demand.
Shifting now to Ag Sciences on slide 10. Our growth fundamentals remain solid. And although sales in the quarter
were flat, the segment reported record year-to-date sales. EBITDA performance was down versus the same quarter last
year due to lower commodity pricing, resulting in fewer Ag Chem applications.
Our advances in innovation are helping to mitigate these current challenging market conditions. For example,
year-to-date our sales of new Crop Protection products were up 18%, led by Isoclast insecticide.
Seeds achieved record sales for the third quarter, led by soybeans and sunflower growth in North America and Latin
America. Looking forward, North America acres are expected to shift to soybeans while record acres and inventories
are anticipated in this sector.
Shifting to Performance Materials, where our productivity mindset and our ongoing focus on key end markets such as
transportation and oil and gas continue to strengthen this portfolio. For example, Polyurethanes achieved double-digit
sales growth driven by demand in key sectors such as consumer comfort, appliance and industrial applications.
In the Specialty area of this portfolio, Dow Oil, Gas and Mining delivered record sales due to double-digit growth on
strong shale dynamics in North America, as well as project-related demand. And sales gains in Dow Automotive were
driven by the adoption of innovative adhesive products such as our breakthrough BETAMATE technology.
Turning to Performance Materials (sic) [Plastics] (15:38), where we continue to deliver growth across the value chain.
In this segment, our low-cost advantage, coupled with higher demand in key sectors, enabled strong sales. Upstream,
supply tightened on the U.S. Gulf Coast due primarily to scheduled turnarounds and strong derivative demand.
Downstream, market demand in packaging, transportation and in hot-melt adhesives drove increased sales, all of which
contributed to record profitability in this segment.
Turning now to our six areas of strategic focus, they have served as our compass, none more important than
maximizing value for you, our shareholders. We have demonstrated over the last many quarters our firm commitment
to these plans. In fact, during the previous three months we have updated you on each one of these priorities.
A critical part of this drive to return value includes our ongoing focus on productivity. By taking action to reduce our
structural costs and streamline our operations, we have reduced fixed costs by 3% per year since 2012 compared to the
impact of inflation.
Additionally, this productivity drive has enabled us to increase operating rates to a level not seen since 2007, as Bill
noted earlier.
Our focus moving forward leverages our scale and our low-cost production, resulting in increasing sales to the market,
driven by higher productivity on our assets. We'll have much more to say on this at our upcoming Investor Forum.
Looking ahead into 2015, you can think about these priorities moving into the next phase, expanding our view toward
longer-term accelerators of value while delivering our results in the short term.
To build upon the operating discussion, I'd like to pause for a moment and step through the Performance Plastics'
dynamics, the foundation of which serves as a key source of momentum for our company and addresses several of the
priorities on this list.
So turning to slide 15, we have best-in-class flexibility and advantaged low-cost positions in the Americas and in
Europe. Despite the recent market correction to declining oil prices, lower oil on the whole should help the world
economy, particularly in the U.S., the UK, Japan and China, and we would expect this positive impact to become more
apparent as we move through 2015.
Lower oil prices will, certainly to some degree, trigger margin compression for the world's ethane-based crackers.
However, modeling indicates that even at $80 oil, ethane-based crackers in the Americas will maintain their advantaged
cost status as well as their first and second quartile low-cost positions.

Lower oil is also a positive for our highly flexible crackers at integrated complexes in Europe, where our best-in-class
flexibility supports a regional advantaged, low-cost position.
From a global growth perspective, global GDP is forecast to be 3.4% or perhaps higher in 2015, up from 2.8% this
year. Based on this, ethylene operating rates reached pricing power levels in the 2015 and 2016 timeframe.
Reflecting this global growth, operating rates are improving, rising from just over 88% at the beginning of this year and
heading toward 90% in 2015. Operating rates have been growing about 1% per year. Barring a global slowdown and
with industry balances where they are, we would expect this trend to continue, taking operating rates above 91% as we
move into 2016, continuing the march toward increasing pricing power for producers.
The bottom line is this: we've consistently said that feedstock flexibility remains an important aspect of our capabilities,
and with high volatility in the oil market, our investments on the U.S. Gulf Coast and our capabilities in Europe have
historically, and I expect will again, prove to be a strong structured hedge, protecting our low-cost advantages.
The benefits of our strengths are evident in our Performance Plastics results, where tight supply-and-demand
fundamentals for our advantaged product portfolio in North America, Latin America and Europe are delivering
significant profitability.
Moving to slide 16, we continue to apply a best owner lens across our portfolio, driving progress, and are committed to
actions as a means to enable maximum value creation. Earlier this month, we announced that our ANGUS Chemical
company, Sodium Borohydride and AgroFresh businesses are being actively marketed for divestment. As indicated, we
expect to complete signing of these transactions by year-end 2014 and close early next year. Collectively, these
businesses are expected to yield proceeds of approximately $2 billion.
In addition, during the quarter we completed the sale of a substantial portion of our North America railcar fleet, an
action we committed to last quarter. This strategic step generated more than $400 million in cash proceeds. And
further, it firmly reinforces the company's commitment to deploy capital to areas where we can generate higher returns.
We also continue to make steady progress on the planned carve-out of our chlorine chain, which as we have indicated
is expected to generate EBITDA in the range of $500 million annually on a standalone basis. We've taken a number of
actions to streamline this value chain, and the businesses are demonstrating rising profitability as a result.
We have received strong interest and are engaging directly with buyers. In fact, the financials are now in the market.
The project team is working diligently to stand up the carve-out within a separate structure and remains firmly on-track
to have signed agreements in place by the second quarter of 2015.
In all cases, transaction options will be examined to ensure Dow generates maximum value for the businesses and our
shareholders. As we have indicated, we will not sacrifice long-term returns for short-term gains.
On top of all of these actions, we continue to assess our opportunities to enhance the value created through our major
joint ventures, either consolidating or deconsolidating to optimize the value these properties bring for our shareholders.
The first step in this drive included the announcement we made earlier this month on our definitive agreement with
ExxonMobil, which will result in Univation Technologies becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow.
A valuable high-margin business, Univation will enhance our industry-leading Performance Plastics franchise and
further strengthen our leadership position with the UNIPOL PE Process, which is a high-demand technology.
To-date, our completed divestiture actions totaled $1.3 billion and the expected proceeds of the entire program will
now be at the higher-end of our $4.5 billion to $6 billion range.
Turning to cash on slide 17. We continue generating returns that exceed the cost of capital. In fact, our return on capital
has increased by more than 150 basis points versus the same quarter last year. We're using this cash to fund our organic
growth investments and to reward shareholders.

Case in point, we rewarded shareholders with $1.3 billion in declared dividends already this year and $3.4 billion in
share repurchases in our current program to-date. We're on-track to complete this program by the end of this year.
Dow's balance sheet is solid and our capital investments are on-track. These investments, once completed, will serve as
a significant new source of cash, allowing us to fund more organic growth and further enhance our ability to reward
shareholders.
And on that note, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andrew.
Andrew N. Liveris
Thank you, Howard. And if you can look at slide 18, we obviously are going to be talking about our Investor Forum.
But before that, it's been a terrific quarter, with our self-help programs delivering in the face of extreme volatility.
The market actually is showing us what it's been showing us for several years: the geopolitical unpredictability,
speculation and that jobless recovery are here to stay; that companies need to be agile to respond, and they should
respond by doing the basic blocking-and-tackling and doing it faster than their competition; and that the world is
commoditizing, and to meet this head on, we need to be aggressive portfolio managers, reliable and efficient operators,
and focus on our strengths while delivering cash for future growth and shareholder remuneration.
Our superior, integrated, global, low-cost manufacturing position in chemicals and plastics, with advantaged products
in key markets – whether they'd be in plastics, packaging, agriculture or electronics – with presence in key geographies
is enviable because it delivers both short- and long-term value.
We are relentless in our focus on cost and productivity. We will sell out our assets and sell up their product value with
innovation. We have a strong balance sheet, getting stronger as our large projects start up next year.
So next month, on November 12 and November 13 at our Investor Forum in Freeport and Houston, we will unpack the
next phase of Dow's strategic execution. We will discuss and reveal increased transparency with our segments.
Our next phase of productivity. So further to Howard's comments, we have reduced underlying fixed cost, enabling us
to invest in growth to the tune of more than $1 billion while reducing overall cost by 3% per year versus inflation since
2012.
So today, we're announcing that we're committing to a further $1 billion productivity target over the next three years,
and we're going to provide granularity on what this program will look like at our Investor Forum.
We also will discuss and continue to address the joint ventures and their future; a sharpened and more targeted market
focus, especially in Advanced Materials, and with the result and decisions on R&D; granularity on our key divestments
as well as on our growth programs, including but not limited to our ENLIST launch; details on our view of the ethylene
cycle and how much cash we will generate in these next few years; and our next phase of shareholder remuneration.
We will show our aligned team, organized to execute. We will discuss our metrics and how we are and will continue to
be accountable to deliver short- and long-term value creation.
This is a company where, with eight straight quarters of execution behind us, there is no gap between what we say and
what we do. Come join us in Houston and Freeport, we will continue that drumbeat.
With that, Jack, let's turn to Q&A.
Jack Broodo
Thank you, Andrew. Now, we will move on to your questions. First, however, I would like to remind you that my
comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared
remarks and the following Q&A.

Lauren, would you please explain the Q&A procedure?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Cooley May with Macquarie.
<Q - Cooley May>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning, Cooley.
<Q - Cooley May>: Now despite an operating line result that beat expectations, equity earnings were down 30%
year-over-year and corporate costs were up 35% year-over-year, which combined they cut $170 million out of your
consolidated profit, if I'm looking at it correctly. Howard, how do you think each of these items will trend into 2015
and what do you view as a normal level for corporate costs?
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Yeah, hi, Cooley. You're not going to throw that to Bill? It's his last call.
No, I'm just kidding, Cooley. Good to talk to you. I would say that, look, on corporate, yeah, corporate was a little bit
higher than usual. There was really – the primary reason was some insurance operations which was a benefit a year ago
and it was a cost in the quarter. There was also some divestiture expenses and a couple of one-time litigation issues.
I would say for modeling purposes going forward on corporate, our guidance remains in the $250 million a quarter
range. And we'll have more to say about corporate at Investor Day.
In terms of equity earnings, I would say that equity earnings were down; a couple of drivers. Dow Corning actually
increased, on improved volumes across both polysilicon and silicon. But that was more than offset with higher
spending in Sadara as well as our Kuwait JV has decreased due to some lower EQUATE volumes and an impact to
MAG in Canada because of a mechanical failure that we had. So, those are the two big issues.
<Q - Cooley May>: Okay. Andrew, my second question is for you. Looking out two years, what part of Dow's
business do you think is currently being ignored and offers the most upside potential to your profit base relative to
investor expectations at this point?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, I think these last few weeks of oil price decline one more time showed – and just a
little footnote on oil price, Cooley, if you look at Brent, actually Brent was a steeper decline from June to September, as
it did in the last few weeks. But the fact that we got into the $80s is spooking people.
When people do look at us and they look to next year and the year following, they are not seeing the ethylene cycle
upside and it's not being reflected yet in our equity price. So I mean that to me is the biggest miss. And what people
seem to be confusing often is we're making record margins – we just had record margins in this quarter, but that's off a
low cost base. U.S. shale did not exist in the previous cycle.
And so, we're all making more money. It doesn't mean that the cycle isn't here to come based on demand, based on
supply/demand and, therefore, price uplift. And as slide 15 showed, we've been having price uplift now for some time,
based on outages. And outages tell you a lot about what's going to happen here as demand continues to improve.
Low oil price means more demand in the GDP. That actually will help the cycle, and they're missing that. Not only are
they missing that, they're not counting in the big start-ups next year of Sadara, okay, that will feed our ability to make
more money off a low cost base and with pricing power.
Of course, they also don't – and this is, of course, a problem with everyone. Innovation is a hard thing to factor in. And
what we're doing and what we'll do at Investor Forum is unpack some of our innovation, especially around Agri
Sciences and especially around ENLIST.

announcement I just made five minutes ago is our relentless drive on productivity will continue, and that should be a

Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning, Hassan.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: A nice bump-up in sort of company-wide operating rates, good 6% year-on-year. My
question is – and I know it's a bit of a broad question, but how much of that uplift was a result of sort of declining
non-ethane-based feedstock costs through the quarter? So, let me ask it slightly differently. So let's say that if oil prices
were at $90 a barrel or $100 a barrel in the next coming quarters, would you still have these elevated operating rates?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah – I mean, yes. I mean I think the Americas for us are firing on all cylinders. I mean I
think our low-cost base in the U.S., Canada and Argentina – we shouldn't ignore Argentina – is meaning that those
operating rates – I mean we're running a pretty much sought out engine based on low costs, and so the rest of the world
has had to catch up.
A low naphtha cost is actually going to help our European and our very small exposure in Asia. So now, the only
foreshadowing again then is it's going to help our competition as well. But back to my demand point I made on the
previous answer to Cooley, ultimately that will help.
Just something that people aren't really noticing is what's happening to propane and what that's going to mean to PDH,
for example. And propane is about to enter our crack slate based on pricing comparative. So much for export terminals,
Hassan. And for that matter, so much for ethane export terminals. It just takes two weeks of low oil price to get
everyone to reevaluate where low cost is. Our flexibility on the crack slate is everything, and that comes to play right
this moment. So advantage to those who have got flexible furnaces, which is us.
<Q - Hassan I. Ahmed>: Fair enough, fair enough. Now obviously, let's say that a currency moves, dollar
strengthening and the like, as you think about the net end target, call it $10 billion in EBITDA, how should we be
thinking about the FX side of things?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Why don't we give Bill a shot at ForEx and make sure Howard looks at you closely?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Really, really, from a currency impact, it doesn't have a significant impact on us. And
so, that's why we don't spend a lot of time talking about currency. Actually this quarter, there were some movements, as
you know. The dollar strengthened throughout this quarter. But actually, the currency impact on our sales line was
fairly small.
And don't forget that the currency move impacts both the top line but also your costs. And so, the net impact is not very
sizeable. It did have a little bit of an impact on our equity this quarter on the balance sheet, because of the translation
impact. But really from an income statement, not a lot of impact.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Just to add on to Bill's point, I would say that the headwind was about $0.04 a share
versus the prior quarter, so you could expect it to also be a headwind as we head into the fourth quarter here with the
move. But hopefully, I will continue in Bill's tradition and the longstanding CFO tradition that we don't really talk
about currency as a headwind or a tailwind.

Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Hi, John.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: I would agree that low oil prices should help stimulate demand in the intermediate term. But
the in the short term, do you think we have an inventory correction, especially around year-end that might depress
volume temporarily?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, John, that's a fair point. I mean – and I think Howard said in his remarks when we
were dwelling on slide 15. And again, who's perfect in the forecasting world here. But as far as we see the supply
chains and value chains, given that it's year-end, given that people look at December in a certain way, we always see
these L-shaped quarters. And inventories is a big factor in all of these conversations, people do in fact clear the books
in December. Factories do come down, inventory clearing does happen. But you remember, inventories are very low
across the value chains right now. And so, that's at the polymer end and at the monomer end, too.
So, look, I think your point's fair in the very short term. But again, you've got to look at 2015 and start feeling confident
about the cycle.
I want to keep reminding all of us as you ask these sorts of questions, we've been working on this for eight straight
quarters to have sustainable profits. This just didn't come this quarter. And the fact that there's some margin expansion
going on, that's actually a sustained margin expansion conversation, and we've always self-help as the tailwind that then
adds another tailwind called margin expansion based on the product cycle. And I think one quarter, this next quarter, I
think there will be some maybe slight depression or compression based on the fact that there may be slower demand
and the oil price effect, but it'll right itself next year.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: And at the Investor Day, do you think you'll know the structure of the chlorine transaction,
whether it's one or more deals and whether it involves JVs?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: As our slide said, the financials are in the market. We've always said, strong interests.
People are now receiving their books and it's too early for Investor Day to unpack it to that degree. But we'll unpack as
much as we can. We know everyone, like you, is hungry for more details on that. We're quite confident on our
upper-end of that target because of what we're seeing; very strong buyer interest.

Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Thank you very much. Andrew, you mentioned when you come down here to Houston
you're going to have – one of that discussion topics will be increased transparency within the segments. Can you give
us a better sense of what you mean and what you expect or hope to achieve from doing that?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. So, why don't I let Howard have a shot at it and then I'll add as required. Go ahead,
Howard.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Hey, Bob. I hope you get the weather good for us down there, because we're definitely
heading into the colder season here in Michigan.
It's really all about improving our transparency and improving our granularity and trying to really line it up based on
markets and based on value chains and based on integration. So that's how we're thinking about it, and we'll have a lot
more to say when we see the next month.

going forward, in terms of what our expectations are. So again, with this drum beat in terms of delivering what we say
we're going to deliver, so.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. And, look, Bob, I'm very conscious of the other side of your question, what you
didn't ask, which is companies like ours and competitive sets. We want to be as good as our competitors are and
slightly better at transparency, but not a whole lot better because we don't want to give away competitive information.
And we get a lot of investor feedback on this question, by the way. We've been out on the road a lot this year, asking
exactly the question you're asking.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: I guess, Andrew, maybe the heart of my question is the revelation of this additional
detail going to result in some inspiration for your shareholders. Will there be things they learn that put Dow in a better
light or that show more effective management of the business, or what do you expect to get from that granularity and
transparency?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, I'll tell you what we are not looking for. We're not looking to confuse you or anyone.
We're not looking to make it harder for you to follow us. So in the spirit of moving in the right direction, we want
transparency but not to a fault, so people understand how and where we make money and how and when we make
money over a cycle.
<A - William H. Weideman>: And add to that, Bob, so – and to really give you more information so you can better
understand the company. So we will plan to show you more level of detail in our Corporate segment, what's in there,
how do our costs and allocations work, how do we assign cost to businesses, how do we transfer our transfer pricing, et

Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi. When you sell your assets and hopefully next year you'll get your $6 billion, what do
you plan to do with it? And I guess there are two cases; if you can buy back your preferred or if you can't. So in the
case of being able to buy back the preferred, what do you do with the extra $2 billion? Do you contract the company by
buying shares or do you acquire? And if you can't buy back the preferred, what do you do with the $6 billion?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Go ahead, Howard.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: I would say is the first priority remains shareholder remuneration. You can think about
that both in dividend growth as well as continued stock buyback. I would also say organic growth, in finishing our
projects and getting those projects up to speed.
Obviously, the preferreds have been on Bill's mind. They will continue to be on my mind. And we're going to continue
try to find a path where we can take those out of the structure at the right moment for a fair value for all of our
shareholders. And then fundamentally, I think the last question where you were leading is, Andrew said repeatedly
there is going to be no major M&A in our near-term future.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Shareholder remuneration through share buyback – sorry to pile on – you saw the slide, I
forget the number now, the next to last slide, that had this last 12 months, last four quarters – slide number 17. You
should think about it that way. I mean we are very shareholder-remuneration-hearted. We're going to give money back
to the holders as a preferred, not to financial engineer, because fundamentally we believe that improvement in ROC,
improvement in EVA, improvement in ROE. And Howard and I are going to be working very hard on talking about
financial goals going forward.

This is a cash machine that's going to be rewarding its shareholders. And we've got plenty of growth. We are spending
quite a lot on investment for future earnings growth. The U.S. Gulf Coast investments and Sadara and ENLIST are case
in point. But shareholder-friendly, shareholder remuneration, that's the drum beat.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: I know that there's been so much controversy over whether the Ag business should be
monetized. But should the Ag business be grown by acquisition or do you think that that's not something – it doesn't
need that extra strength or scale?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: It's gotten scale by being a part of Dow Chemical Company. 40% of our R&D goes to Ag.
They've proven their worth. They doubled the business in the last five years. The pipeline is rich, very robust, soon to
generate much more EBITDA out of both Crop Protection and Seeds and Traits. And next year or two, very key.
So, I think we've got the time to answer your question. I think there's a lot of what I call internal -that's why I say what
Howard said; we don't need external M&A, we've got plenty of internal M&A, which is to acquire more revenue
streams by funding DAS and funding Electronics and funding Plastics Packaging. We are going deeper and more
vertical into markets and businesses we can grow. Ag has earned its right to play due to our scale and their innovation.

Our next question comes from Peter Butler with Glen Hill Investments.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Good morning, good morning. On the same topic, Andrew, you've been predicting for some
time at least one more major consolidation step in the Ag Chemical sector. Do you think Dow would be a player in this
and, if so, how much does the ENLIST approval enhance your negotiations?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Thanks, Peter. Yeah, ENLIST does enhance our leverage on any value creation, because it's
approval, which of course are the key approvals of the last few weeks, have been seminal to now what we consider to
launch. And the launch is next year, and this launch is a controlled launch leading to bigger year the following year in
2016 as we go into soybeans, et cetera.
This is a very big step for our future pipeline value, manifesting itself in the current EBITDA. We're not talking NPVs
at DAS. We're talking about EBITDA coming next year and the following year, not just from ENLIST but also all the
Crop Protection launches that they've got going on.
So, these things will transfer now from a pipeline to a actual EBITDA stream. The consequence of that means that the
value of DAS increases substantially, and that means – and we've always said this – two points. No sacred cows. If the
future value can be brought to current numbers, then we will look at all options. And if there's a round of consolidation,
we'd love to be a part of that for more value creation than owning it ourselves. So the best owner mindset applies,
period.
Having said that, we've got pipeline going to EBITDA. We'd like to get that value, period. Okay? And that's why we've
always said what we've said. If there is a round of consolidation out there, you can count on us being at the table.
<Q - Peter E. Butler>: Okay. In regard to – we're creeping closer and closer to the uptake on this ethylene cycle. And
when you look back at some of the previous cycles, starting with the one in 1973, a lot of the analysts that follow your
stock today weren't even born probably during that period – before that period. So, could you maybe summarize what
happens as operating rates edge towards the 90% zone and your customers start getting nervous and start adding to
pipeline inventory? Has this process started? Where are we and what do you see happening?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. The process – and there's always a lead indicator called the outages. When outages
start affecting pricing, as there have been now and Howard showed the slide 15, that's a harbinger of an upcoming
operating rate that hits the 90%s for the industry. And as already indicated, Dow is already there in the Americas. And
so, it's really the rest of the world getting up there.

Predicting the cycle based on outages is a fool's errand, because if it's just outages driving our prices temporarily, the
resiliency of those price increases really comes back to demand and lack of supply.
The lack of supply is well-documented. There is no fear factor based on supply/demand studies that we've done and
others have done, including our competitors, that the capacity coming on the U.S. will be enough and soon enough to
interrupt that cycle – the cycle that we all see, our 2015-2016 cycle, who knows what we will call this cycle, whether
it'd be as big as the one in the late 1980s or the one that happened a decade ago in 2005 which was shorter.
This one looks a little longer. The area under the curve looks quite big based on supply shortage, and that because of
outages we might get it earlier than maybe otherwise and it could start earlier. We're not particularly forecasting that. In
general, low oil, if it impacts positive demand, there may be some price margin compression in the very near term –
John Roberts' question – but that's just a head fake.
Oil price should go up from here based on healthy economic demand out there, whether it be China or Japan or the U.S.
or the UK needing – that's a tax break for them. So, that will help consumption. So we think this cycle is going to be
quite a good cycle, and we're very positioned to get price powers we have been getting based on the outages.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Peter, this is Howard. I would just say that two other things – one on the supply side,
one on the demand side – as we head into an ethylene up cycle uptick, the assets tend to run harder and then they tend
to break. Every year further, the grid becomes a year older. And so when you try to run assets really hard to maximize
production across the industry, you tend to see more outages as you head in.
And then on the demand side, the people in the industry – and I've spent a lot of time in plastics over the years – you
talk about 11-month years from a demand standpoint, you talk about 13-month years. And so in an up-cycle, where
people expect prices to be higher tomorrow, you tend to get 13-month years, and maybe one, or two, or three in a row,
depending on all the other variables that Andrew talked about.

Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes, good morning. Andrew, propane is down about $0.20 a gallon on the U.S. Gulf over
the last 20 days. Can you discuss how much of your feedstock mix you're able to shift into propane? Trying to get a
handle on how much you might be able to hammer down U.S. costs to preserve your margins if the high end of the
curve does indeed come down on the back of Brent crude oil.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Our propane flex in the U.S. in terms of substitutability of ethane slate. As you know, we've
always been heavy ethane and very low naphtha. We believe we can get up to 30%, 40% as a company; 60% in
Europe, which is a very big one.
And from memory – and I'm just looking over at Jack here – I think it's a little lower in the United States. It's probably
– it's about 60% as well, Jack tells me. That's the handiness of having the previous hydrocarbon guy as our guy. That's
a very helpful question, because that actually speaks to what can happen here on lower oil price.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: I would also say that I mean I think that's – you raised a key point, because a lot of
people in the industry talk about feedstock flexibility and what they really mean is they're switching from propane or
other feed to ethane only. We have very much been focused on feedstock flexibility for many, many years. I think we
have leading edge flexibility versus the industry on propane. And as we do our additional ethane crack projects, we are
not losing or giving up any other flexibility, propane or other.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Then as a follow-up, on the financial side we're about – I don't know – two-and-a-half
months away from the end of the year and presumably completion of your existing share repurchase authorization.
When you take into account your prospective divestiture proceeds and the progress you've made on the balance sheet,
how would you handicap a new authorization at this juncture?

<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: We'll have a lot more to say, Kevin, about that at Investor Day. As our earnings ramp,
we've historically talked about a 45% to 50% payout ratio. And I think as we get these divestiture proceeds, you should
think about shareholder remuneration being a key part of that. That is our top priority, and that you should think about
it both from an additional stock buyback as well as dividends.

Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, hi, good morning.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: God morning.
<A - Howard I. Ungerleider>: Good morning, P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Andrew, if oil stays here or even declines from here, do you think some of the announced of
ethylene projects in the outer years in 2018 and 2019, do you think there the risk of getting pushed out or even
canceled?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Look, I don't think so, P.J. I think, firstly, we've given you our view on oil as we see it. I do
think the journey for oil through $80 down into the $70 will find its way back to the $100s. I think this is why everyone
is looking at this from the point of view of supply-and-demand.
It's being well written. The breakeven price of Middle Eastern producers, the incremental costs of the marginal
producers to produce like tar sands and, for that matter, U.S. shale. You've got to look at this and say, look, U.S.
ethylene advantages is here to stay and is going to be here a decade or more based on supply.
It could affect LNG projects though. I think that will be the bigger effect and, for that matter, ethylene exports, I do
think that's the more likely affect, P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Okay. And then secondly in Ag, you're seeing some declines in Crop Protections sales. Can you
talk about the dynamic going to next year? Do you think, with low grain prices, that Crop Protection pricing could go
down? Thank you.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah, look, I think the crop commodity price is crop – there's corn harvests the fact that
we've had the weather issues. I mean the weather are almost impossible to predict. But, look, we're watching the prices
very, very closely. There is some corn acreage decrease, soy acreage increase, so there's a rotation going on. Lower
prices will result in fewer planted acres and loss of some marginal application volumes.
So, we're not overly concerned about it right now but we're watching it very closely. What we get helped by is all of
our new product launches, which are obviously on-patent and will give us margin expansion even if it is in the more,
what I would call, generic war on price compression.

And our final question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning, hey. Just to respond to Peter's comment, I was actually around in 1973 and I
don't remember the chemical cycle, but I do remember the Mets dropped Game 7 of the World Series and I was very
upset about that.
Hey, congrats to Bill on your pending retirement and, obviously, to the other gentlemen on their new positions.
Andrew, you said earlier that we're not paying enough attention to the self-help and some of the projects that you have
coming on. And I was wondering if you could give an update on the timing as well as the potential costs versus
expectations for the Freeport PDH project, the Ethane Flexibility project and of course Sadara.
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Yeah. So mid-2015 for PDH is on-track, on-schedule, on-budget, feel very, very good
about that project. It's very close now. LA-3, the Ethane Flexibility project, will be Q4. And Sadara is – the early
start-ups there will be – as you know, that will come in phases – will be mid-2015, probably the tail-end of that Q2, Q3
timeframe.
So very big start-ups for us, so very big impacts to the EBITDA lines given this dynamic that we've been describing.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right...
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: There was a follow-up?
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Yeah, let's keep it in the two-question mode. And, look, on the last call, I believe the topic of
MLPs came up and there was some discussion about railcar or pipeline infrastructure. Obviously, you did the sale
leaseback on the railcar. Where do you stand on the whole MLP discussion?
<A - Andrew N. Liveris>: Well, it's very interesting to see what's going on now with one of our competitors right now
on their MLP float price and where they are. So, look, as everything, tax efficient structures have pluses and minuses. It
does for companies like ours pretty limit you much to the new projects if you're going to look at them. We've looked at
the new projects quite a lot. And frankly, we're not a huge fan. I mean I think it's going to create complications and it's
going to make it very much more difficult, especially with all this volatility. So, Bill, did you want to, maybe as a final
hurrah here, say something?
<A - William H. Weideman>: Yeah. I mean we've looked at those, Frank, and Howard will continue to look at those.
There's obviously pros and cons, but you also need to understand also that the best ones are the fixed return ones but
then they have more volatility back in your base earnings.
Having said that, we're open-minded. We'll continue to look at those as we go forward. But as Andrew mentioned, it
would only make sense on some of our new assets that have a high tax basis.
Jack Broodo
Frank, thank you for that question, and sorry for cutting you off. That ends our question period. We're going to turn the
call over to Andrew for some closing comments.
Andrew N. Liveris
Yes. I think in close, a strong quarter for us, eight quarters in a row now. Strong cash flows in the quarter. More to
come. The cycle question is a great question in terms of the cash coming, and we're already starting to see it.
More productivity to come. The divestiture questions, we'll have a lot more granularity at Investor Day on all of that.
Portfolio moves of the get out of low ROIC business and bulk up in organic growth programs that some of the
questions were asking about.

Finding ways to continue to grow through internal M&A. No big M&A of the outside type, we don't have any need for
it. We have plenty of growth in this company.
Shareholder remuneration, we're going to be very shareholder-friendly, have been, will continue to be, and that's where
our cash is going to go. We're listening to our investors, and we'd love for you all to come to our Investor Forum to
hear more about how our cash story is going to benefit our investors for the short, medium and long term.
