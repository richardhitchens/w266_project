Stephen S. Crawford
Thanks, Jeff. I will begin tonight with slide three. Capital One earned $1.2 billion or $2.04 a share in the second quarter
and had a return on average tangible common equity of 17.5%.
We reduced our net share count by 11.1 million shares in the quarter, reflecting our share buyback actions. Included in
continuing operations results for this quarter were higher linked quarter revenues, flat linked quarter non-interest
expenses, a lower provision for loan losses, driven by lower charge-offs and a $100 million allowance release, a $37
million addition to our reserves regarding UK cross-sell, which is split almost evenly between non-interest expense and
non-interest income. In the UK, refunds to customers who bought payment protection insurance is an industry wide
issue and continues to be in the headlines.
Our reserve build reflects the fact that while the number of customer claims we receive is continuing to fall, it hasn't
fallen as quickly as forecasted. The reserve build does not reflect any change in how we calculate customer refunds. It
is possible that we may further add to reserves if we determine that we need to change the calculation of customer
refunds.
And finally, we had an $18 million benefit related to mortgage rep and warranty which includes the provision of $11
million before taxes in discontinued operations and a benefit of $29 million before taxes in continuing operations.
Turning to slide four, I'll touch briefly on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 7 basis points in the second
quarter to 6.55%, primarily driven by lower yields and average balances in our Domestic Card business, partially offset
by the second quarter having one more day worth of recognized income.
Average interest earning assets were up modestly quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by higher average loan
balances in our Auto Finance and Commercial Banking segments. We are updating our expectation for mortgage
run-off in 2014 to about $6 billion based on our current view of rates.
Moving to slide five, I'll briefly cover capital trends. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III
Standardized fully phased-in basis was 11.6% in the second quarter of 2014, compared to a Basel III Standardized fully
phased-in equivalent ratio of 11.7% in the first quarter of this year.
With the benefit of phased-in, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.7%, down 30 basis points on the Basel III
Standardized equivalent of 13% in the first quarter of this year. And while we have yet to enter parallel run for Basel III
Advanced Approaches, we continue to estimate we are above our target of 8%.
Last, we reduced our net share count by 11.1 million shares in the quarter, reflecting our share buyback actions. We
completed approximately $1 billion of our share buyback program in the second quarter and we expect to buy an
additional $1.5 billion over the next three quarters. We have demonstrated our commitment to return capital and
understand it remains an important part of the return equation for our shareholders.
I'll close tonight with a brief update of our 2014 expectations. We continue to expect pre-provision earnings to be about
$10 billion, within a reasonable margin of error and we continue to expect some modest, but principally offsetting
changes with higher revenues offsetting higher expenses, relative to our expectations earlier this year. While we had a
release of allowance in the quarter, going forward, as we return to growth and considering the charge-offs remain
below historical averages, we are less likely to see releases going forward.

With that, let me turn the call over to Rich.
Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on slide seven, which shows another strong quarter posted by our Domestic Card business,
highlighted by a return to year-over-year growth. The year-over-year trends in loans and purchase volume continue to
reflect our strategic choices, which focus on generating attractive, sustainable and resilient returns.
Ending loans were up about 4% from the first quarter and about 1% year-over-year. We had expected year-over-year
growth to resume some time in the second half of 2014. The early return to year-over-year loan growth resulted from
increasing traction in the segments we're emphasizing, including rewards customers and revolvers other than high
balance revolvers, as well as the success of credit line increase programs. The collective impact of these factors was
greater than the continuing impact of our choice to avoid high balance revolvers.
Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private label cards that don't produce interchange
revenue, grew about 16% year-over-year.
Revenue margin for the quarter increased 13 basis points to about 17.1%. The increase resulted from expected
seasonality and higher non-interest income, partially offset by a decline in loan yields. Revenue dollars were down
about 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio.
Non-interest expenses improved by $32 million from the prior quarter, driven by operating efficiencies, partially offset
by a modest increase in marketing. We expect an increase in marketing in the second half of 2014, driven by both the
expected seasonal ramp and because of the success and continuing opportunities we see in growing customer
relationships, purchase volumes and loans.
On a linked quarter basis, charge-offs and delinquencies were in line and continued strong underlying credit
performance and better than seasonal expectations. The charge-off rate improved 49 basis points to 3.52%, driven by
seasonality, as well as the diminishing impact of aligning HSBC branded card customer practices with Capital One
practices. The 30-plus delinquency rate improved 19 basis points to 2.83%.
Our card business remains well-positioned. We returned to year-over-year loan growth a bit earlier than expected
despite continuing run-off and our choice to avoid high balance revolvers. We're delivering strong, sustainable and
resilient returns and we continue to generate capital and solidify our customer franchise.
Moving to slide eight, the Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans grew
about $335 million from the first quarter and declined about $1.2 billion from the second quarter of last year. On a
year-over-year basis, continued growth in auto loans was more than offset by mortgage run-off. Auto originations
increased from the first quarter and remain on strong growth trajectory.
Subprime originations were relatively stable, while prime originations grew, as we continue to capture additional prime
share from our existing dealers. Ending deposit balances declined by about $2.4 billion in the quarter, consistent with
normal seasonal pattern. Year-over-year deposit balances declined about $640 million. We had an abundance of
deposits since the ING Direct acquisition, and we've been allowing the least attractive deposits to run-off.
Consumer Banking revenue increased about $18 million or 1% compared to the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenues
declined by about $66 million or 4%, driven by the impact of persistently low interest rate on the deposit business,
declining mortgage balances, and margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these negative revenue
impacts.
Non-interest expense increased $28 million or 3% from the prior year. The increase resulted from growth in auto loans,
as well as a change in the geography of where we recognize auto repossession expenses, which are now included in
operating expense rather than in net charge-offs.

Provision for credit losses increased modestly in the quarter and about $76 million from the prior year. The
year-over-year change resulted from a swing in the allowance from a release in the second quarter of 2013 to a modest
build this quarter related to auto loan growth.
Auto charge-off rate improved in the second quarter, driven by expected seasonal patterns and the higher proportion of
prime loans in the portfolio. Home loans credit trends remain favorable, and continue to perform well inside of the
assumptions we made when we acquired the mortgage portfolios. The overall Consumer Banking charge-off rate
remains below 1%.
Our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of continuing challenges. In auto,
second quarter growth and performance were very strong, but we expect that auto margins and returns will continue to
decline, as we move from exceptional levels to more cycle average performance. We expect that auto returns will
continue to be resilient, and well above hurdle.
And in our Retail Deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low rate environment will
continue to pressure returns, even if rates rise in 2014.
As you can see on slide nine, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Loan
balances increased about 5% in the quarter and 18% year-over-year, driven by growth in specialized industry verticals
in C&I lending and CRE. As competition continues to increase, it's likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth
will moderate over time.
Loan yields were stable in the quarter, but declined 34 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by lower market
pricing from increased competition and our choice to originate more variable rate loans.
Revenues increased 7% from the first quarter and about 10% from the prior year. The year-over-year increase was the
result of growth in loan and deposit balances across the franchise, partially offset by declining loan yields. The stronger
increase in non-interest income was driven by the Beech Street acquisition and growth of fee-generating businesses.
Non-interest expense was up 17% from the prior year, as a result of growth in loan balances and continuing
infrastructure investments to drive future growth. In the quarter, non-interest expense was up about 5%.
We continue to closely manage commercial credit risk. And commercial credit results remain very strong. Charge-offs,
non-performing loans and criticized loans remain at exceptionally low levels that are not sustainable through the cycle.
Commercial Banking competition continues to increase, but we expect our focused and specialized approach to deliver
strong results in the commercial bank.
I'll conclude my remarks this evening on slide 10. In the second quarter of 2014, we posted another quarter of solid
results for the company and across our businesses, and we continue to return capital to our shareholders, as we execute
our announced $2.5 billion share repurchase program.
We're delivering these results in an operating environment that has both encouraging trends and continuing challenges.
Credit remains relatively benign and our Domestic Card business is growing. On the other hand, the interest rate
environment remains challenging and competition is picking up particularly in Auto and Commercial.
Capital One is earning very attractive risk adjusted returns, and we continue to focus on multiple levers to sustain our
profitability. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities in Card, Auto and Commercial Banking, as growth remains
a high priority. We'll maintain our long-standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive
focus on resilience.
And we will continue to manage expenses tightly in the context of investing to drive future growth, be a leader in
digital banking, and continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements.
We're on track to deliver 2014 pre-provision earnings of about $10 billion. We expect that 2015 pre-provision earnings
will rise with growth in average loans driving increased revenues, partially offset by a higher non-interest expense, as
we continue to invest to sustain growth and returns. While the efficiency ratio will vary from quarter-to-quarter, we

Thank you.
Jeff Norris
Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask
a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after the
Q&A session, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Justin, please start the Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hi, good evening, guys. On the 2015 efficiency, the 53% to 54%, can you just give us some
help understanding what type of backdrop you're assuming, are there expectations for rising interest rates or any sort of
acceleration in growth, either in your loan portfolio or in the economy from the current levels?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. Ryan, I think we gave guidance on 2015 on efficiency ratio and only gave
guidance on that, because we largely want to avoid forecasting other items. I do think it is important for us to express
kind of what we think the potential is to drop additional revenues to the bottom line as we move into 2015.
But also to give you a real sense of what we think some of the investments are that we're making to ensure that we can
sustain the returns we have, which we think are very good and also grow going forward. So – and you can see what's
happening, in general, on loan growth around the industry, and I think we leave it up to you to try and figure out where
you think that's going to go over the next 18 months.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Do you have a follow-up, Ryan?
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Thanks, Jeff. You've obviously had some of the strongest growth that you've seen in quite some
time and I take your point that we're likely not to see much in terms of reserve releases going forward, but how should
we just think about provisioning for growth? Should we think about reserve – charge-offs matching provisions from
here or do you feel the reserve is at a good place and it could likely stay at the current levels?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. Well, I think most people, who have been in the card industry, have consistently
assumed that we're at the end of the period of improvement, and they've been consistently wrong for a long period of
time. We just felt like it was important to say with where charge-offs are, which is pretty historic levels that we would
bet against additional reserve releases going forward. I think a lot of people have continued to make that assumption
over the last couple of years and they've been wrong.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

Sure. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: Thank you. I guess, Rich, you mentioned that loan yields were a headwind to
other positives for the Card revenue margin. I was wondering if you could just help us think about loan yields on the
new loans that are coming on relative to those that might be running off and maybe those that you were originating
pre-recession or Card Act. Just want to try to get a sense of kind of how that's progressing.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, I think Ryan, first of all, I just do want to say just a contextual thing, and your
question may or may not have been stimulated by that. Average loan yield, it sort of has had some funny dynamics over
the past several quarters. And year-over-year, it's artificially heightened because of the Best Buy held for sale – in 2013
by the Best Buy held for sale accounting and so on.
But if you kind of just get beyond some of the noise in the current movement, and perhaps it's really better for me to
speak in terms of revenue margin, I think there is a striking stability in revenue margin that really goes back a number
of years.
When you think back to revenue margin, 2011 was around 17%, then 2012, we added HSBC and adjusted for purchase
accounting – purchase accounting margin was also around 17%. And then in 2013, if you really normalize for the Best
Buy impacts and deal-related items, revenue margin was kind of in the low 17% range. And we had some offsetting
things that were going on there, from the removal of Best Buy's low margin business roughly offset by a bunch of
moves we made on things like payment protection, stopping the origination of that and some other kind of franchise
enhancements.
And we've also said that – I think on a calibration across all the businesses that we operate in, I think the most stable
business in terms of the yields and the margins in the business overall is the Card business. And so, unlike, say on the
other end of the continuum, the Auto business where we say the new originations are definitely at a lot lower yield and
margin than what the back book has. I think the best way to think about it, Sanjay, is that this – I mean, Sanjay, the
front book has pretty strikingly similar kind of revenue dynamics to the back book and I think that's really in many
ways a reflection of the stability of our own business model and a reflection of kind of the relative stability of pricing in
the card market.
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: Do you think about subprime as a function of the total – I mean has that mix
moved up in subprime? Are there opportunities in subprime that might not have been there a while ago?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: In some ways the more things change, the more they stay the same, not to – it's pretty
similar to the revenue margin story. The subprime mix in our portfolio has stayed pretty similar; the FICO under 660
has been about a third of our outstandings in terms of like currently measured FICOs and that metric has been stable for
an extended period of time.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
And our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. Good evening, guys. Rich, last quarter, we saw relatively slower interchange
revenue growth relative to your purchase volume growth, but this quarter, we saw a very strong net interchange
revenue growth of 22% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Can you give us some color around the dynamic that's at
play here and talk about the sustainability of those trends?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. What we – in the same way I cautioned when it was very paltry last quarter and
then it surges this quarter, I really kind of give you the same caution. In any individual quarter, the net interchange
metric is – I wouldn't put too much reliance on trend reading based on that. The net interchange metric, first of all, it
includes a bunch of things. It's got partnership contractual payments in it, it's got international card in it, and we
periodically adjust our rewards liability based on what we're seeing in terms of customer trends, redemption rates and

things like that.
And over the last few quarters, as you say, net interchange growth has generally lagged general purpose credit card
interchange growth significantly. But overall, what we have said is that we expect the trend to have interchange growth
lag general purpose credit card growth. We'd expect this – a lag with some volatility quarter-to-quarter to continue.
And let me explain just a little bit what's behind that.
Our rewards programs have been and continue to be very successful. And we're also though, in addition to aggressively
marketing new rewards originations, we're also working to build our long-term franchise by upgrading rewards
products for our existing rewards customers, and extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't
have rewards and all of that means some near-term cannibalization. But overall, I think it really helps deepen the
customer franchise.
But those effects I think will last for an extended period of time. So again, we feel very bullish about the ability to grow
general purpose purchase volume; interchange should lag that with some quarterly volatility. But overall, the
economics of our rewards products, we feel very good about them. And what we're doing there is – over time, we're
building a – growing net interchange revenue. Additionally, what comes with the territory of this business is, the
spenders build balances over time and they build finance charge revenues gradually over time and then you get great
charge-offs, the low attrition and kind of the long-term franchise dynamics of the whole thing.
So I appreciate the call, because I think it's important to understand why the interchange does have a lag there relative
to the purchase volume, but it's all part of something we're investing in and feel very good about.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you for that detailed explanation of the dynamic. That's really helpful. If I could as a
follow up, do you believe that we're at a point in the recovery where perhaps the near prime revolver is finally starting
to feel the benefits of what today many would argue has been a rather lopsided recovery favoring the affluent?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I think that I'm always a little cautious about using the recovery word. I mean this thing
is – if we're talking about recovery with the small r, I think in general, certainly, I think the recovery has been more
manifest at the top of the market. But I think – yeah, I would support the notion that I think we see across our business
some modest signs of some strengthening across the broader spectrum of the mass market, but I think these are all in
the context of fairly modest effects at this point.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
And our next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up on the PPNR guidance and the OpEx
guidance, and just understand, does this suggest that there is going to be some degree of incremental operating leverage
heading out into next year or are revenues and expenses moving up more or less in lockstep?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I think – oh, go ahead, Steve.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. So I guess it depends upon what your frame of reference is. I think our GAAP
efficiency ratio in 2013 was a little over 55%. The first two quarters of this year we've been operating around 54%,
54.5%, and next year, we're talking about somewhere between 53% and 54%. So if you're defining operating leverage
solely with respect to efficiency ratio, that number is going down over time.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Right. Thanks for the clarity. And just a follow-up on the customer refunds issue, I think,
Steve, you said that it's playing out a little bit differently than you'd anticipated. I was just curious as to why you think
that is.

<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: It's just the submissions in terms of – they've been coming down. They just haven't been
coming down at the rate that we expected. There's a little bit different of a trend line, which is why we increased the
number by $37 million. And a big part of that could be there's been a fair amount of media about PPI recently, that
could be one of the things that kind of drove the increase.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
And the next question comes from Brad Ball with Evercore.
<Q - Brad G. Ball>: Rich, in talking about the growth that we saw this quarter, you mentioned three drivers. You said
rewards, non-high balance revolvers and credit line increases. Can you give us a sense as to which of those is driving
the most receivable growth? And are those the same drivers that you expect to drive U.S. Card balance growth in the
second half or will you be perhaps expanding the market to grow in the second half?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah, I mean all three are important factors. I think that the investment in originating
new account – all the efforts on originating new accounts be they on the top of the market side or in revolver other than
high balance revolver, that has been a very steady kind of growing thing that is increasingly picking up traction and we
feel good about that.
The credit line increase thing has been a little bit more volatile. As you recall really going back to the beginning of
2012, there is a bit of a brownout related to that, as we retooled our capabilities in the context of some regulatory
guidance that came down about the need for having that income before we did a credit line increase.
And the pattern of that is the problem solving to get solutions for that, we kind of got to a good place in the latter part
of last year, and then, so we started initiating credit line increases on a growing basis around that time. And so, part of
the sort of surge that you see this quarter reflects that effect. It is not entirely right – it's not a one quarter little blip,
there is actually continuity and continued momentum in that one as well, but that one is a little bit more of a surge than
the other two effects that are just very steady kind of growing effects.
<Q - Brad G. Ball>: Great. And then separately on Auto Finance, you mentioned that prime grew this quarter from
capturing share. I think you had said in prior quarters that you're seeing some increased pricing pressure on prime.
What's the dynamic there and what's your outlook for Auto Finance growth in the second half?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. So it's a little – you're a careful student of what we say, because we have said as
we have talked about the marketplace that the most competitive part of the credit spectrum is prime. And that's really,
in fact, in terms of margins at a near cycle low in many ways. Although the underwriting is generally healthy, but the
pricing is really tight, in the subprime space, things are compressing, but are still at a healthier place.
So then kind of the question is so why are we holding sub – why are we flat in subprime and growing prime? It is –
what we're doing is deepening our dealer relationships. In our dealers where we have a very strong position in
subprime, we have a lot of opportunity to grow in prime, and it's really – there's two things going on.
One is I think we feel good on a standalone basis about the economics of the prime business, although it's certainly on
the lower end of returns and by the way of losses of the various things that we do. But I think the biggest benefit is the
deepening of the dealer relationships and the benefits that come across the credit spectrum in terms of the quantity and
quality of the deal flow that we get.
So we feel – even as one-time, we got a cautious eye on the pricing side on prime, we feel good about this expansion,
but we just wanted to flag that most of the growth is coming or this incremental growth is coming on the prime side.

And the next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Rich, I know you've made some comments about card loan growth, but I just wanted to
follow-up. Is your sense that we'd be more likely to sort of peak out here in terms of industry card loan growth or do
you think that we're potentially in an earlier part of the stage here?
And then secondarily, are you seeing any differential in terms of the health of the consumer on the low or high end?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah, so it's always hard – it's probably definitionally hard for anybody in the middle of
these businesses to tease out the effects of industry growth versus one, the growth that we ourselves are generating
through our good innovation and marketing and so on.
I mean you can see we've had some pretty striking sort of step forward here in the sense that in going from, I can't
remember, something like a minus 3% year-over-year to a low-single – now a positive growth number in card despite
all the stuff that we're running off.
And as I look at it just from our kind of more narrow perspective, I just see across all the things that we're investing in,
we went out and spent a lot of time testing, and we're rolling out on things that we're testing in there. We've had a
growing amount of innovation and we're rolling that stuff out and it feels – it doesn't feel like we're just riding an
industry tied up. I think this really feels very much like what we expected from the test that we did and the rollouts are
performing very well and consistent with that and they're sort of expanding in that sense.
I am really pretty cautious to declare any kind of industry effect. I've seen for such a long period of time the virtually
zero and for a long time kind of negative growth in terms of revolving debt. And of course, I do want to say too is we
continue to just stay here. So at the astounding performance on the credit side, we should all remember that this effect
that has kind of exceeded the expectations of virtually anybody out there, I think, is certainly one of the important
factors there is the flipside of the consumer cautiousness that's holding back the growth.
So I don't think as an industry, we'll get a package of a bunch more growth and still just like record low credit. What I
do feel is I feel very good about our own growth programs that we've steadily invested in and I think we've got good
traction there and we hope to continue.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

Moving on, the next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Thank you. Good afternoon. The private label card business, I was wondering if you could just
provide some updated thoughts on that and what you're thinking about as far, Rich, about opportunities. Are you seeing
more opportunities? Obviously, Nordstrom, you're going to have a big file coming on to the market. You have a big
competitor that's coming public, the GE Capital spin-off, Synchrony, I guess – just some updated thoughts on your
opportunities, if you're seeing more or less and excitement about that business?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, gosh, we certainly like the business. Three to four -probably four years ago, we
didn't have any partnerships. So in some sense, we've come a long way since then with over 20 partners and $15 billion
of outstandings. Of course, the biggest single effect of that was the purchase of the HSBC business. But also before
that, we had pretty actively entered the market and going after top of the line players, Kohl's being the flagship kind of
partner there.
So our view of this business is it is a real natural for Capital One, because we're already a big player in the Card
business. And I think this business is also crying out for innovation, whatever digital innovation any of us are thinking
about in banking, if you want an industry that is in incredibly big need of digital innovation, it is the retailing business

and I think that an opportunity to leverage our own digital innovation in that space is very exciting to us.
And what we're trying to do in that space is, even though scale matters a lot and it definitely matters a lot and all you
have to do is look at the loss of scale that came from our walking away from Best Buy to see some of those marginal
economics, scale really matters. And so that's why we're very focused on growing.
But I think each of the different players has their different strategy. We're certainly trying to go more toward the
higher-end of the market in terms of the real quality retailers who are focused on building a franchise, deepening their
customer relationships through the card as kind of the flagship and central nervous system of that transformation. And
that's really our sweet spot, and I think where we can create a very unique positioning.
You may have noticed that, in an unusual move, Kohl's, with whom we already had a contract for many years still,
proactively went out and sought to extend that by another five years, because they were so – and again, you have to
look at their own words on this, but very happy with the relationship we're building, and said that in order to really
invest to build the long-term franchise with us, they wanted an even longer commitment, because they felt we were
soul mates about leveraging the card to really build a franchise. So that – we see great promise in that business.
In the near-term, we have the challenge of – that scale really matters and we're kind of subscale. Yes, there are a lot of
– well, there are several things that are sort of floating around in the market right now. And we'll have to see how that
thing turns out, but I really want to say that we still – I still go back to the core principles that while growth really
matters, what matters more than that is that we have quality partners who are motivated to do this for the right reason
and a contract that really works. And where we find that, I think we want to be in a pole position to get those deals, and
I think over time I like our chances.

And the next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. Rich, I thought I heard you say something about the deposit margins
coming down even if interest rates rise. Could you kind of go over that because I wasn't sure I caught that?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah, I'm not sure that that was in the comments. What I think he said, which is not
inconsistent with what I think the rest of our peers are saying, is that even if we have a near-term rise in interest rates,
that doesn't mean that you'll be showing better spreads in the Consumer Banking business.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got you. And would you say that the terms of the Kohl's contract are comparable to what
they've been, because in the past, I mean your disclosures showed that you've kind of remitted 90% of the revenues
over to them. It's not clear what – I mean maybe you could talk a little bit about what that partnership actually does for
Capital One?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Moshe, I don't know if we want to get into the details of the Kohl's contract. I think that
– I think both we and Kohl's have felt that, economically, this is a good program for both sides. In fact, I think an acid
test of a partnership is it really works economically for both sides. And some of the elements of this are kind of
structured a little differently from some of the other programs that are out there, but not in a way to have adverse
economics for us, it's just – if you compare that structure to some others, it's just – it's a different way that the revenues
flow and the payments work. But underlying, it's a good program that with attractive economic opportunity for us and
the renewal was while there were some changes in the terms, it was directionally along the similar lines.

And the next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Good evening. Question on the purchase volume, you had a nice increase there obviously
year-on-year up 11% and up significantly from last quarter. Just you talked to earlier about the drivers to the increase in
the loan balances. I was just wondering if you could kind of parse out the different drivers to the purchase volume
increase by the different products, that client types that you have?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. So the purchase volume, Betsy, is – and here I really speak about the general
purpose card. Obviously, there is purchase volume growth going on, on the private label side. But we've kind of more
called your attention to the general purchase side, since, of course, that's where interchange and the branded card
business is for us.
So we've talked about year-over-year growth of 16%, which is even up on what we've seen recently. The two effects
that are going on is continued growth in the spenders side of the business, both in consumer and in small business, as a
result of a lot of the marketing and customer experience work that we've been doing and then also though, Betsy,
another factor that has boosted this is, credit line increases and the – because of course what's happening is as people
are filling their new credit lines, they're doing it through purchases as well. So that certainly added to this significant
growth number.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And I know the credit line increases, I mean typically, with the barbell strategy, you've got
credit line increases primarily targeted towards the lower end of the customer, the near prime customer as opposed to
the prime customer. Is that the way the credit line increases have been going recently? I mean given the fact that you
had the brownout, I'm just wondering if credit line increases are across the board in terms of the quality sort of the
customer, or are they still more likely to be skewed towards the near prime than the super prime?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So I mean our credit line – so I'm going to go back to what led us to have a bit of a
brownout in line increases and that was this regulatory requirement that one needed a validation of income before one
did a line increase. So our line programs work across our entire portfolio. There was more impact on the lower end,
because we tend to start with lower lines and then the mechanism – and then there are more line increases to get to a
destination then, say, where you to get a venture card, you'd be starting with a pretty high line. So the differential
impact was more on the lower side of the market – of our portfolio, but it's – but really the effect and our rollout now of
full capabilities in line increases is targeted across our whole portfolio.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

Next will be Matt Howlett with UBS.
<Q - Matt P. Howlett>: Thanks for taking my question. Just on the expense guidance again, just going back to last
year, the original guidance was more sort of $500 million, $600 million decline or proven efficiency. I guess what's just
changed that? Is it just more opportunities you're seeing to take share or is there some other competitive dynamic that
would suggest otherwise?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Are you talking about – I thought I heard you say expense efficiency?
<Q - Matt P. Howlett>: The operating expense, the previous guidance [ph] forward to fall (49:45) last – this year.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: So if it's operating – we really haven't changed our guidance for 2014. What we did
tonight was add a bogie for 2015. With respect to our original guidance for 2014, all we've said is that we expect higher
revenues and higher expenses relative to our original estimate.
<Q - Matt P. Howlett>: Okay. And just in terms of the pre-provision guidance that you've said sort of higher – $10
billion, but higher revenue offset by higher expenses.

And that will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question, Rich, you mentioned
in terms of the commercial loans a little bit of slowing in the loan growth there and I saw specifically in commercial
real estate in the multifamily portfolio that was growing in annualized rate a little bit about half the rate of what you've
done year-over-year. Is that from you're being tighter on underwriting or is that just a drop in demand across your
markets?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: It's probably not technically either where we haven't tightened our underwriting nor have
we loosened it and I don't think demand is going down if anything, I think demand is going up a little bit. I think – but
maybe I'm parsing words here. I think what's happening in some of these markets is that the markets are heating up in
terms of competitive activity and some of the pricing in these spaces.
So what we have done, and multi-family is a good example of that, we are working hard to grow, but not by lowering
our underwriting standards. We work really hard within the context of our standards to get all the business that we can.
And one of the things that we've said, in parts of the Commercial business, probably even more so on the C&I side,
there is increasing evidence of some underwriting and pricing softening in the marketplace on the C&I side. Certainly, I
think the impact of – on the institutional investor side of covenant light loans, things like this. This is slowly kind of
spreading into different parts of the commercial marketplace and that is the biggest reason that we're saying over time
this very significant growth rate that we have. We expect it to moderate just because we're holding pretty firm on the
standards that we will accept for these loans.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay, Rich. And then, I just want to follow-up on a comment you made at a conference
recently about selectively placing branches across your platform, obviously, you have many – you have a number of
markets where you already have reasonable branch density. I guess, I'm just curious at this point given your comments
about thinking about branches, if you are more interested now than you might have been in the recent past about
making very targeted acquisitions of branches in and/or around where your branches currently sit?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I think we are in a – we are big believers frankly in being on the forefront of the digital
revolution in banking and it is clearly sweeping the banking industry and we're not just [ph] ideally (54:24) kind of
interested in it. You may have noticed that we bought ING Direct that had a very big investment in digital banking.
What we have often said though is my perspective from one who's started out over 20 years ago to build the company
that I thought would be a kind of direct-only company. Over time, I've really come to appreciate the benefits of
physical distribution and face-to-face contact. What we're trying to do is work backwards from where that market is
going as opposed to just try to go recreate what others have done in classic banking, and therefore I think, putting in

some light physical distribution in key metro areas is part of our future. But I think we're going to go about this trying

And our last question will come from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Good evening. I guess on back to the efficiency guide for 2015, I mean if I think back, over the
past few years, we've been on this kind of transitional period where there was the top bank initiative and scaling up to
be one of the top five banks and the instruction that goes along with that, there have been the merger charges,
increasing intangible amortization which is now running down.
And so, I guess as I think about 53% to 54% in 2015, recognizing that no environment is ever really normal or the end
game, but would you view 53% to 54% as a roughly normalized level of efficiency for the company or would you still
view it as a transitional year to some ultimately lower level?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. Look, I think if we're going to talk about something through the cycle, we
probably wouldn't pick efficiency ratio, because you can't pay dividends and return capital out of what your efficiency
ratio is. So I think it's reasonable and we think about what the right through the cycle level of profitability is. There
may be a point where that's a discussion we have, but if we do that, it certainly wouldn't be around efficiency guidance.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Fair enough. I guess as a follow-up and just a small thing, the jump in occupancy expense this
quarter, is that a new run rate or was that just something that happened that was – it is in credit for this quarter?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: No, that's probably closer to a new run rate.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Thank you.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Nothing we use in credit there.
