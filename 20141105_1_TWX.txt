MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Time Warner, Inc. 2014 third quarter earnings call. My name is Jeanette and I will be your operator for
today's call. [Operator Instructions]
Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice
President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.
Michael Kopelman
Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's third quarter earnings conference call. This morning
we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter and the other updating our 2014 full year
business outlook.
Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on
our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also
included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current
expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various
factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on
Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly

future events, or otherwise.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill,
Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler, and Kevin
Tsujihara, will join us for a Q&A session to answer any follow-up questions you may have from our investor event last
month.
With that, Jeff.
Jeffrey L. Bewkes
Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning.
We had another quarter of solid revenue growth and strong growth in adjusted EPS and that puts us on track for another
very good year of financial performance in 2014. But more important, we're executing on our longer range plans to go
after the large and growing global opportunity we see in video content.
That opportunity, and our plans to capitalize on it, were the focus of the investor event we held last month. I'd like to
thank all of you that took the time, either in person or by videocast, to attend. We were pleased to share our long-range
plan and financial targets with you. Those targets include adjusted EPS of close to $6 a share in 2016 and over $8 a
share in 2018, representing a more than doubling of our earnings in the next few years.
We also discussed with you the significant upside opportunities that we believe exist above and beyond those targets.
Those include the new global kids partnership between Turner and Warner Brothers and the even greater exploitation
of our IP at DC entertainment, and the potential for breakout hits at Turner, and a standalone broadband delivered HBO
product we intend to introduce domestically next year.
We've been positioning ourselves to go after that big opportunity in video I mentioned earlier by streamlining our
company, putting in a new generation of collaborative leaders, and executing a strategy that has not only served Time
Warner and its shareholders well over the past several years but is also evolving to incorporate new opportunities
outside the traditional ecosystem. And with our scale position and our leading portfolio of brands, we think we are the
best positioned media company to take advantage of that opportunity.
While evolving, our strategy remains focused on four key areas: content, technology, international, and efficiency. And
there's a reason that investing in content is at the top of the list, because great content is the lifeblood of our company.
We spent close to $14 billion on content and related marketing expenses last year. We'll invest even more this year and
in the years ahead because of our confidence in our unique ability to monetize those investments. For example, both
HBO and Turner had double-digit increases in subscription revenues during the quarter and that flows directly from
having the best storytelling.
You can see further evidence of our commitment to the best storytelling in the 19 Primetime Emmy awards HBO
received, the most of any network for the 13th consecutive year, with True Detective receiving five awards. And, as
I've mentioned before, True Detective was the most watched freshman series in HBO history. And it wasn't the only
successful new hit on a service that already boasts its strongest lineup of original shows ever. Newcomer, The
Leftovers, averaged over 7 million viewers per episode, received a lot of critical acclaim and has been renewed for a
second season.
Turner is also investing in great original content, and you're seeing the results of those investments. TNT ranked as
ad-supported cable's number one primetime network for the second consecutive quarter. TNT series Rizzoli & Isles,
Major Crimes and The Last Ship comprised three of the top five original series on ad-supported cable in the third
quarter. And TBS was the number two ad-supported cable network in primetime among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54.
But not to be outdone, Adult Swim was once again ad-supported cable's number one total day network among all its
key adult demos.

Turner's recent extension of its three decade relationship with the NBA through the 2024 to 2025 season is yet another
great example of investing in distinctive programming that will serve us well for years to come. The agreement will
further grow our partnership with additional games, continued management of NBA's digital assets, and new digital
rights for Bleacher Report.
Our investment in great storytelling is also paying off at Warners, which is the leading producer for broadcast TV for
the 11th time out of the past 12 seasons. This fall, The Big Bang Theory and The Voice are once again the number one
scripted and non-scripted shows, respectively, on all of television. And we're particularly pleased with two new shows:
Gotham, which ranks as broadcast's number two new show with adults 18 to 49, and The Flash, whose premiere drew
close to 7 million viewers, making it The CW's most watched telecast ever. Both those programs are based on IP from
our DC Entertainment Group, and they lead a roster of five DC-based shows that we have on broadcast this season.
As Warner announced at our investor event, DC is also a big part of our theatrical strategy, with 10 DC-based films
slated for release between 2016 and 2020. Warner also unveiled plans for films built around the LEGO franchise and
the world of Harry Potter conceived by J.K. Rowling. More imminently, we're going to see another terrific example of
our franchise prowess when the final installment in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, Battle of the Five Armies, storms
theaters in December.
As we're investing in great content, it's worth emphasizing our commitment to a strong multi-channel ecosystem. That
commitment is clear in the new NBA agreement I just mentioned, which represents an investment of more than $10
billion in the kind of must-have content that makes the TV bundle so valuable to consumers and it makes our networks
essential within these bundles. On top of our sports commitments, we intend to double our spending on original
programming over the next several years. So, in total, we expect to grow our annual programming investment at Turner
to over $5 billion within the next several years.
Our commitment is also clear in products like CNNgo, which we recently launched and is perhaps the most advanced
TV Everywhere product yet developed.
Similarly, Turner is leading the charge in providing in-season stacking rights to our distributors and consumers when
many of our peers have been reticent to do so.
At HBO, we're equally committed to working with our distribution partners to grow our mutual business. Where others
have cut back on their investments to drive margins, HBO has been investing aggressively in original programming and
it's extended its film output deal to maintain the very best selection of recent Hollywood hits. And HBO GO is the gold
standard TV Everywhere product for the industry. At the same time, we can't ignore the growing opportunity outside
the ecosystem. So we'll be investing there as well.
I already mentioned our plans to expand the reach of HBO to consumers who are not currently multi-channel
subscribers. And we'll be working very closely with our current distribution partners in that area. We think that's a big
opportunity. We're also thrilled with the performance of CNN.com, which in September surpassed Yahoo News to
become the most consumed news and information website in the United States, as measured by both page views and
video starts.
At Warners we recently created a new division, Blue Ribbon Content, to focus on short form digital content. Its initial
lineup consists of both original concepts and DC-based content, including an innovative virtual reality experience
produced for the Samsung Galaxy Gear VR and Oculus Rift that will take you inside the Bat Cave. That's exactly the
type of innovative storytelling that will allow Warner Bros. to remain at the forefront of the industry as consumer
viewing habits continue to evolve.
When we talk about pursuing opportunities outside the ecosystem, I think there's an important point to keep in mind. If
you look back over the past decade, we've seen the introduction of all kinds of new platforms and services for video,
including iTunes, YouTube, and SVOD offerings from Hulu, Netflix and Amazon. And what we've seen, both outside
the system and inside it, through services like our own VOD and our own TV Everywhere product is that the more
options you give audiences to access video content, the greater the consumption. Rather than merely shifting share
from one platform to another, we continue to see growth in the video universe. And that's why we're convinced we can

effectively pursue growth in both areas.
Now, before I turn it over to Howard, I want to say again how confident we are in Time Warner's position. We're proud
of our track record of industry-leading EPS growth and shareholder returns over the past five-plus years. We're really
just getting started. The best video content is growing in value and we occupy the perfect position in the value chain to
benefit from that. And so while there are risks, we're confident we can mitigate them.
We have an industry-leading collection of must-have networks, we have unmatched film and TV production capability,
we have leading global brands, and we're investing in the very best programming to capitalize on growth across all
distribution platforms, both within the traditional ecosystem and outside of it. All of that gives us great confidence in
the financial plan we presented last month, in the upside opportunities we discussed, and in our ability to continue
delivering industry-leading shareholder returns, and with that let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard M. Averill
Thanks, Jeff and good morning.
I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. We're really pleased
with our performance so far this year and the progress we're making toward the longer term targets we discussed with
you last month. While there were a number of moving pieces in the quarter, on the whole, our results were a little better
than we expected, and that included a further acceleration in subscription revenue growth at both Turner and HBO.
Before I go through our divisional results, I'd like to address the restructuring, severance, and programming charges,
and tax matter that we outlined at our investor meeting three weeks ago.
We will take over $400 million in restructuring and severance charges in the second half of this year. About $300
million of that was recognized in the third quarter. The charges reflect our company-wide focus on efficiency and stem
from global reviews of our businesses by the new CEOs at each of our divisions.
We've previously discussed with you the importance of constraining non-programming costs and this is a reflection of
our commitment to that goal. We expect to generate annual savings from our restructuring actions of around $450
million over time, with much of it coming in 2015. That will allow us to invest even more in great content and help
position us for future growth across the company.
Additionally, Turner decided to stop airing certain programming that no longer fit the brand promise of its networks.
As a result, Turner incurred a significant programming charge this quarter. Since some of the programming was
licensed from Warner Bros., the net impact to the company, after accounting for intracompany eliminations, was $343
million. More than offsetting these items on an after-tax basis was a $639 million net benefit resulting from tax matters,
primarily as a result of a federal tax settlement. Given their nature and size, my comments throughout the presentation
will largely focus on results excluding these three items.
So excluding them, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.97. And that benefited from our ongoing share repurchase
program. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion in shares and year-to-date we've bought back close to $4.9
billion of our stock. Combined with paying close to $850 million in dividends, that means we have returned over $5.7
billion in capital to shareholders so far this year. And that's after investing more than $10 billion in programming,
production and related marketing. So we're continuing to invest aggressively in our businesses while providing
significant direct returns to shareholders.
This morning, we increased our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance to high teens growth, which includes an estimated net
benefit of around $0.15 from the reversal of tax reserves and the programming, restructuring and severance charges in
the third and fourth quarters. So we're firmly on track for our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted
EPS. And I'll touch on that in more detail later in the presentation.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where we continue to see strong subscription revenue
growth. Subscription revenues increased 10% in the quarter, an acceleration from the second quarter, and that included

a pickup in growth at both our domestic and international businesses. International subscription revenue increased in
the low double digits, primarily due to positive trends in Latin America. Domestic subscription revenue growth remains
very healthy and was, again, in the high single digits as Turner continues to benefit from the rate increases associated
with its domestic affiliate renewals. And as we look out over the next several years, we expect subscription revenue to
remain a key driver of growth at Turner.
Moving on, advertising revenues declined just under 2%, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter.
Domestic advertising was essentially flat, and that included a low single-digit decline in domestic entertainment,
including young adults, which was offset by solid growth at News. While our original programming at TNT performed
well over the summer, ratings at our domestic networks have remained a headwind and scatter demand in the quarter
remained moderate.
International advertising was down in the quarter, partly due to adjustments impacting year-over-year comparability
and FX. Excluding those factors, international advertising declined in the mid-single digits and that was largely a result
of somewhat lower demand in Latin America following the World Cup.
In the fourth quarter, scatter pricing has been pacing up high single to low double digits over the upfront, while volume
has remained relatively modest. With that backdrop, we anticipate total advertising revenues to be about flat in the
quarter, and that includes a drag of about 500 basis points as a result of fewer Major League Baseball playoff games,
the strengthening US dollar and DISH pulling down certain of our networks. Without those, we would have anticipated
a return to growth in the quarter.
Excluding the programming and restructuring charges in each period, adjusted operating income would have grown
modestly. That reflects healthy revenue growth and our continued focus on limiting non-programming expenses.
Excluding those charges, programming costs increased in the low double digits due to the new MLB deal and the airing
of additional original episodes.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect very healthy underlying trends in subscription revenues and have easier
comparisons on the programming cost side due to impairments in the year ago period. And depending on its length,
those will be offset either modestly or to a more significant degree by our DISH dispute.
Looking beyond 2014, we anticipate the restructuring efforts this year to result in over $200 million in annual savings
at Turner, with the majority of those savings starting in 2015. Those savings will help fund aggressive investments in
programming while allowing for sustainable margin expansion. And combined with what we expect to be accelerating
subscription revenue growth in 2016 and beyond, we plan to deliver very strong growth in adjusted operating income
for the next several years.
Turning now to HBO, where we continue to have very good operating momentum, subscription revenues increased
10% in the quarter, with the consolidation of HBO Asia contributing about 400 basis points to that growth. As we
discussed with you at our Investor Day, domestic sub trends remain very healthy, with HBO on track for its best year in
almost two decades. And combined with some improvement in the subscriber mix, that resulted in a modest
acceleration in domestic subscription revenue growth in the quarter.
As a reminder, we have now fully lapped the consolidation of both HBO Nordic and HBO Asia, so subscription
revenue growth should return to a more normal level in the fourth quarter.
Content revenues grew 7%, and that was driven by increased international licensing revenues and strong home video
sales. Those factors more than offset lower domestic syndication sales. In the quarter, we recognized $48 million of
restructuring charges related to the company-wide efforts I discussed at the start of my presentation. Excluding
restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have grown modestly in the quarter.
Programming expense growth included 600 basis points from the consolidation of HBO Asia. Looking through that,
programming expenses increased 10%, driven by mid-teens growth in original programming as a result of spending on
new series including The Leftovers and The Knick. HBO's international operations posted another quarter of solid
growth, with total revenue including unconsolidated JVs increasing double digits. And that included growth in both

licensing and our networks businesses which continue to benefit from robust sub-growth, especially in Latin America.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate continued solid growth in subscription revenues. At the same time,
programming expenses should grow in the mid-teens, primarily due to the timing of theatrical expenses. But given the
strong year-to-date results and very healthy underlying trends, HBO remains on track for another year of solid growth
in adjusted OI and we think HBO is well-positioned to grow at even more attractive rates for the next several years.
Moving on to Warner Bros., where we're benefiting from increased global demand for our content and are on track for
another very good year despite difficult theatrical comparisons in the third and fourth quarters. Looking specifically at
the third quarter, and excluding restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have fallen 6%
and that included both the benefit from a patent license and settlement agreement as well as a drag from a one-time
VAT catch-up.
Theatrically, our lineup was not as strong as a year ago, when we released The Conjuring and We're the Millers and the
carryover revenue from Man of Steel, but the fourth quarter got off to a great star with Annabelle and we're excited
about our upcoming releases, which include the international opening of Interstellar this week, as well as the final
installment of The Hobbit and American Sniper next month. And, longer term, we think we have the strongest slate in
the history of the company. So overall we feel really good about the outlook for our theatrical business.
On the TV side, demand for our product remains robust, with revenues growing high single digits in the quarter, that
included growth in SVOD revenue and increased TV production, including the consolidation of Eyeworks. Across
Theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue was stable in the quarter, and digital trends remain very positive with
electronic sell-through growing over 50%.
Looking at the fourth quarter, Warner Bros. will incur additional restructuring charges of around $100 million. In
addition, we face difficult home video and theatrical comparisons. Recall that last year's fourth quarter set a record for
Warner Bros. as it benefited from the home video releases of Man of Steel, Pacific Rim, and The Hangover Part III, as
well as the theatrical release of Gravity. Were it not for the restructuring charges I just noted, Warners would be on
track for a record year. And, with global demand increasing for the high-quality content that Warner Bros. specializes
in, we're confident we can grow the business at very attractive levels for the foreseeable future.
Turning to free cash flow, which also remains healthy, we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow year-to-date, similar
to year ago levels. And that's despite a material increase in cash taxes, due principally to the expiration of certain
favorable tax legislation. As you can see on the slide we've broken out the programming, restructuring and severance
charges incurred in the third quarter, which had a significant impact on adjusted operating income. It's worth noting
that the majority of severance payments related to the restructurings will come in 2015. Cutting through the noise,
we're on track for another year of healthy free cash flow generation in 2014, and we expect to continue converting a
very high percentage of our earnings into free cash flow in the years to come.
Now on to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $19.3 billion of net debt. That's up over $1 billion versus the
end of 2013, and that's primarily due to our commitment to direct shareholder returns. During the first nine months, we
returned $5.3 billion to shareholders, including almost $4.5 billion in share repurchases. And we continue to think our
stock is very attractive at these levels.
On the M&A front, we've invested about $880 million year-to-date. The majority of this came in the second quarter as
we closed our acquisition of Eyeworks' international television operations and completed financing arrangements with
CME. Due to the programming, restructuring and severance charges in the third quarter, our net leverage ratio was 2.9
times as of September 30th. However, excluding those charges, our net leverage ratio would have been 2.6 times. On
that basis, we're on track to reach our target net leverage ratio of 2.75 times by the end of the year, and as we said last
month, we remain committed to maintaining our solid investment-grade credit rating.
Now on to the final slide, which shows our 2014 outlook, this morning, we raised our full-year 2014 outlook to high
teens adjusted EPS growth. Our outlook includes a net benefit of approximately $0.15 from the tax matters and
programming, restructuring and severance charges I noted earlier.

One item that could impact our results is our current carriage dispute with DISH. And as I noted before, DISH has
unilaterally dropped a number of our networks. Furthermore, our contracts for TNT and TBS expire soon. We're
working hard to reach a new agreement in the near future, but if we're not able to, our adjusted EPS would likely come
in toward the lower end of the range I just provided. Excluding the $0.15 net benefit I just mentioned and any potential
impact from DISH, we would still be tracking ahead of the outlook we have provided in August. And that's despite the
significant 4Q programming investments at HBO and difficult 4Q comparisons at Warner Bros.
So we're pleased with our performance this year, and the investments we're making in high-quality video content put us
in a great position to deliver the double-digit CAGR and adjusted OI and over $8 in adjusted EPS by 2018 that we
discussed with you last month. With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.
Michael Kopelman
Thanks, Howard. Jeanette, if we can go ahead and open up the line. And as a reminder to analysts, if you could please
limit yourself to one or two questions so we can get through more people.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Couple questions on programming at Turner. First, with
respect to the size of the content write-off, it was pretty substantial relative to, let's say, the cost of an individual
episode of programming. Can you provide more color on what was included in the write-off and how it affects your
investment in programming going forward?
And then second of all, you recently announced the hiring of Kevin Reilly as the head of TBS and TNT. Can you talk a
bit about why he's the right person and how that affects the investment there? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Oh, think fast. Hey, Mike. I think as you may all remember, when we started this, we've got
all the CEOs here. So, John's here. And I think it's probably better for you to start, John.
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. Listen, and I think Howard said this in
his proactive remarks, the charge that we took was a portfolio of programming that no longer fits the brand direction
that we want to take each of TNT and TBS in, but the biggest components included The Mentalist and a number of
shows that we had, historically, with the relationship with Tyler Perry, including House of Payne. And that is going to
allow us to better program the network with series that better fit the evolving brands.
You know, in terms of the impact that it's going to have on overall investment levels going forward, as I said at the
recent analyst meeting, our intention and expectation is to contain overall programming costs at Turner to be no more
than high single digits over several years on an annual basis. And we have every confidence that we can do it.
But I want to make sure, I want to pause for a second because I don't want people to believe that acquired programming
no longer has a place on our networks. I think the only change in our view of acquired is that we need to be more
selective, which is similar to our strategy with originals, by the way, as we'll look to get – to become more distinctive in
our programming and over time targeting a younger audience, particularly on TNT. But acquireds can still play an
important role for the foreseeable future, and all you need to look at are the big, big hits like The Big Bang Theory,
which is going to have a place in primetime for the foreseeable future. So that answers that question.
And thank you for mentioning the hiring of Kevin, which we announced yesterday. And speaking on behalf of David
Levy, who is the direct hiring manager, and myself, we couldn't be more thrilled that Kevin's going to be coming over
to join us here at Turner. I mean, he is absolutely one of the most respected, innovative, and influential executives in

this industry. And he's always been a champion of quality television, who does not shy away from taking bold
programming risks. And we've carved out and created a new role for him, because of his unique tastes, experience, and
his creative relationships, he'll have the title of Chief Creative Officer, which will allow him to work with and lead the
Turner creative executives in finding new ways to reach viewers with programming that plays to the strength of our
various brands and platforms. So really, really thrilled.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: Yeah, John, Michael, it's Richard, I'd just punctuate that, I mean, Kevin enjoys a truly
stellar reputation in Hollywood. And my e-mails yesterday were plentiful from people from the community just saying
bravo to our cousins at Turner for making that hire. I think it's a very smart creative choice and he's going to do great
things there.
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: Warner Brothers has a – This is Kevin. Warner Brothers has a fantastic relationship with
Kevin that goes back a long way. And, as Richard said, the creative community response has been tremendous
regarding this hire. So we're really excited about it.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Mike, this is Howard, I just wanted to come back and reiterate the fact that on a net basis,
the programming impairment is $343 million, which is consistent with what I outlined at the Investor Day. You know,
the decision, as John pointed out, was really about removing programming so that we could move faster. We don't
expect to have any significant savings over the term of the long-range plan on that.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Thank you, guys.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks. Jeanette, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen of Bank of America, please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Oh, thanks. It's great that you have the division guys on. So, I'll take advantage of
that. I have one for John and one for Richard. So, on the DISH dispute, which you guys have brought up a few times,
I'm just wondering, you said it might affect Q4, Howard said it might affect Q4 earnings. But, John, how should we
think about this over the longer term, given the guidance you've given for affiliate fee growth of low double digits?
And for Richard, I just wanted to ask about the broadband opportunity, which Jeff just highlighted. Do you – and you
obviously discussed it at the analyst day, but do you see the standalone broadband opportunity as a bigger potential
opportunity for HBO than simply driving performance from the poorer performing pay TV operators to the mid or
upper level? Like, which one is the bigger opportunity?
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, Jessica. It's John. I'll start. Listen, I mean, ordinarily we wouldn't be in the practice of
commenting publicly as it relates to what's a private business dispute. But given Charlie Ergen's comments on the
earnings call yesterday, I just want to provide a little bit of context from our perspective. And I think it's fair to say that
we disagreed with virtually everything he said as it related to the importance of our product, as it related to his
platform.
We were both disappointed in the very antagonistic and aggressive nature of his comments yesterday, and we're
disappointed particularly, given the fact that DISH had previously agreed to our network's rates and our carriage
proposals weeks ago. And we were working hard to get a deal done. We were supportive, in fact, unclear now, of the
DISH OTT [Over the Top] efforts and we had found common ground on virtually all of the major issues there.
So, while there clearly were more deal points to get done, they are not of the type of nature that would result in
networks going dark. And I think all of us sitting around the table have been in this industry a long time, so we have a
pretty good sense of what those are. So, to us, it's unclear exactly what the dispute with DISH is. And we were told by
them that we were taken down because we wouldn't move an expiration date later into the year. What's kind of
interesting about that is, it was an expiration date for networks that aren't even up yet.

And it's important to note that other top five U.S. distributors have signed up for the deal that DISH has now walked
away from. And, look, we're confident in our brands. The value of the Turner news, entertainment, kids and young
adult brands, and the content that we have are reflected in the leadership positions that we have across the media
landscape. And we have two of the top five, three of the top 10, and five of the top 30 cable networks. We're the only
programming group that has that. And CNN is number two in ratings, number one in reach and it has the most
innovative TV Everywhere product available on the market.
So we honestly have no idea what DISH was talking about yesterday. Having said all of that, Turner's had a long-term
relationship with DISH that has been to a mutual benefit, and that's one of the reasons that we agreed to multiple
calendar extensions during this lengthy negotiation process and we've worked diligently and in good faith to try to
address what those issues are. In fact, we even stayed at the table after DISH removed our networks from their service.
And, look, we believe in our brands and we're willing to work constructively to get a deal done in the near term.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: So Jessica, just to get to your point about the impact on guidance, we still expect we'll
reach a deal, so we don't expect this is going to impact our long-term guidance.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: I was just going to -- Jessica, going to answer your broadband-only question. So look, first
of all, as I think I said on Investor Day, this is not binary, it is not one or the other, it's multilateral. We're going to go
first after the enormous opportunity that I spoke about in the 70 million homes that do not get HBO in the MVPD
[Multichannel Video Programming Distributor] universe. We think, as I told you, there's ten to fifteen million
persuadable homes. We want to work with our partners to attack that market aggressively. And the broadband-only
universe, we think there's 4 to 5 million also working with our partners.
So, to us, this is just net upside everywhere, margin upside everywhere. I've talked to all of our distributors about it. We
want to lean in with them early in the New Year and begin working on the plans for this for 2015. And I see nothing
but upside for us, nothing but upside for the consumer, and nothing but upside for our distributors.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Jessica. Jeanette, can we have the next question, please.
Operator
And our next question comes from John Janedis from Jefferies. Please, go ahead.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thanks. John, you mentioned syndication earlier. As content has become available on more
platforms, there's a view in the market that it's weighing on syndication broadly. So, can you tell us what you're seeing
globally in syndication and to what extent you're seeing either inflation or deflation in license fees?
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: This is Kevin from Warner Bros. I think that what we're continuing to see is, on a global
basis, demand for our product and the pricing for our product continues to go up. And as John said, the hit
programming that continues to kind of dominate the airwaves today is the programming that you're seeing the most
pricing power on. And so – but international markets are very strong right now, and we expect to continue to see that in
the foreseeable future.
<Q - John Janedis>: Okay, thank you. And maybe just going back, John, to the DISH question maybe. Just going
forward, it seems like distributors are increasingly focusing on ratings when negotiating fees. And so, how relevant are
ratings in your view and is this argument missing viewers on platforms that aren't but will be measured some day?
<A - John K. Martin>: Yeah, I mean, look, and I know this from my experience on this side, being a programmer. I
also know from my experience having worked at Time Warner Cable for a number of years. You know, ratings are one
measurement, but there is not a particularly strong correlation between ratings and affiliate fees, because what's more
important than ratings is the brand affinity and the passion engagement that subscribers have with a particular brand
and environments and networks. And so, you can have a network that has lower ratings, but has a subset of fans, like
Turner classic movies, for example, that are incredibly passionate about a particular network. Those networks can

command a premium in affiliate fees because the distributors value that relationship with the consumer.
And so, I don't want to say that ratings are unimportant, because obviously higher rated networks mean that viewers are
spending more and more time with them. But it's only one of a number of a variety of factors that determines what
clears the affiliate fee price in the marketplace.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: I just want to add, the classic example of that is sports.
<A - John K. Martin>: Yep.

Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thanks. You guys talked about sort of moving into new areas and at the same time
supporting the ecosystem and you highlighted the NBA, Jeff. There's a lot out there about the NBA looking to go over
the top, Adam Silver did an interview talking about an urgency to do that soon. And I think ESPN has at least hinted at
the idea of doing something as well. How does NBA, ESPN, over-the-top fit into your world view and how does
Turner participate or not participate in that opportunity?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: You know, I'm going to give it to John...
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Or John.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: ...since you asked about Turner.
<A - John K. Martin>: Yeah, thanks.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: In a larger sense, as you add more opportunities for consumers to see things on demand,
that's probably a good thing to strengthen their attachment and engagement with the brands. And most of their – most
of the consumers' increasing excitement with, engagement, time spent every day, goes across a number of channels that
they watch on demand on their television. And then, if they want to leave the house, they can watch it on a mobile
device. And so, I think what you're seeing here is really an increase in the value of having these networks and having a
lot of them on an on-demand basis.
But, John, you can talk about the specifics of the...
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, Jeff. I mean, further what Jeff just said, listen, we're supportive of the relationship
between the NBA and ESPN, as it relates to this OTT package, but I do think it's very important to understand what it
is and what it is not.
The OTT package is very targeted, it's a mobile product with select out-of-market games. It won't include any of the
games that air on our networks. Those are exclusive to us, and include our own digital rights with respect to those, and
it won't include any playoff games. So it doesn't impact the package that we have with the NBA at all. We still have the
same package of exclusive Thursday night games. In fact, we've got 12 additional games and, as I mentioned, we
maintain all the streaming rights there. You know, we already partner with the NBA on an OTT offering, it's called the
NBA League Pass, and we're continuing to manage the NBA's digital properties and we partner on NBA TV.
And lastly, I would mention, we also got increased digital rights with Bleacher Report, which is the number two sports
destination now in the U.S. So there were plenty of digital rights that were spread around and we think it's good for the
NBA. We think they were very smart the way that we're approaching – that they've approached it and I think it's going
to work out well for all three parties: us, ESPN and the NBA.

<A - John K. Martin>: Go ahead. Yup.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: I was going to ask Kevin a follow-up along the same lines around the ecosystem with
Gotham. Kevin can you talk about that deal? Why that was the right deal for Warner with Netflix. You mentioned full
season stacking and Fox doesn't have stacking rights for that show. So went in a different direction. Why was that the
right path for Warner and Time Warner on that property?
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: It was the right deal for that particular show at that moment in time. I think that as we look
more broadly at stacking, we believe that stacking rights are very much important to be part of the overall TV
Everywhere experience. And that you can make an argument that by allowing cable networks and broadcast networks
to stack our programs, that it actually increases the value of the long-term value of the content. It increases the amount
of sampling of a show.
If you look at something like Gotham, I mean, if you add all the viewing, and I think Fox just reported this, of – if you
take out live plus same-day, you add the seven-day DVR, you add the days four-plus, you're now looking at a P2-plus
number of 22 million viewers. That kind of viewing when cum'ed like that, that would put it at top 10 show ten years
ago.
So, I think we need to look at these kinds of things differently. We need to obviously figure out ways to monetize that
audience more effectively. But it does kind of show the value of product and the fact that viewing is happening in many
different ways today and we just have catch up in the way we measure it and we monetize it.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - John K. Martin>: It's John. We couldn't agree more. I mean, the same thing on Last Ship where half of the
viewing was non-live. Falling Skies, same thing. Legend, significant increase, all of these shows. Well, Last Ship and
Falling Skies were stacked and we saw significant catch-up viewing deep into the season. So, we think the industry
who is not granting stacking is looking at this the wrong way. This is about creating hits and the ability for consumers
to find shows and to make it convenient for them increases their discovery and their willingness to view shows.
So, at Turner, we have a deal with Warners and really, really couldn't be more pleased with Kevin's support and the
team's support at Warners, we're going to be looking to stack all of our originals.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Richard, talk about – I mean, HBO basically stacks our originals, so tell them about it.
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: I've said this before, if you just take Thrones or True Detective as an example, on Sunday
night itself we're doing probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% or 30% of viewing and then on-demand is
doing, you know, oh, another 60%, and then you have HBO GO. So even a show as popular as Thrones or True
Detective is doing 75-80% of its viewing on non-premier night. And for us, obviously, making the show available
when the consumer wants it and how they want it is how we cum up the numbers as high as 19.5 million for Thrones
and 13 million for True Detective. You know, John Oliver even – or Bill Maher cuming over 4 million, same viewing
patterns.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: This is more evidence that the TV Everywhere, basically putting all networks on-demand
and having it available on your television is what the ecosystem should do, it's what cable and telcos should offer, it's
what networks should grant for their current-year seasons. You can see it, it's as clear as a five-lane highway. So let's
get everybody out there and get it done.

<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you. Can you provide a bit more color on the upside in HBO's subscriber growth
domestically in the quarter? Was it driven by more favorable terms with some of your distributors or more aggressive
marketing? I guess any color behind that, and if we should expect it to continue into the fourth quarter?
<A - John K. Martin>: Yeah, I think, you know, we had better performing distributors in Time Warner Cable and
some of our others. And, as I made clear, you have a vast disparity in penetration, as low as 14% and as high as 42%,
so what we worked hard on this year is getting some of our lower penetrating distributors up. That's happened. We've
seen nothing but a real upside in that going forward.
And, again, as I talk about the data that makes it clear how many persuadable homes that are out there, we are now
taking all of that inside our distributors, breaking it down for them, and making it clear how much upside opportunity is
available to them. The response, as I said, on Investor Day, has been extremely enthusiastic. So we believe we're going
to see all of those distributors leaning into that possibility going forward.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: And, just to follow up, if I can, on Turner, can you talk about the difference that you're
seeing, particularly now with a bit more volatility in the ad market, between the demand and maybe pricing for sports
programming versus general entertainment?
<A - John K. Martin>: Sure. Right now we're doing really, really well with the NBA. And so, relative to general
entertainment, which is probably a better proxy for the broader market, I'd say sports is stronger. And just to repeat
what Howard said, we're doing fine in terms of pricing in the scatter market, there just isn't the type of volume that we
would like in an ideal world. But sports, for us, is working quite well.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Would you say...
<A - John K. Martin>: Oh, go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Would you say the volume deteriorated in October or was it about the same?
<A - John K. Martin>: I didn't hear the question.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Volume in October.
<A - John K. Martin>: No, there hasn't been a demonstrable trend line difference in volume.

<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for John and Jeff, one for Kevin. Whoever wants to take this, you
can. In answering the DISH question, you did bring up that personal streaming service and you were positive about it.
So can you walk us through the parameters of that deal and what gives you comfort that signing up with a personal
streaming service won't impact the 90 million homes that are paying for a bigger bundle?
<A - John K. Martin>: Yeah, I mean, I mentioned it. I mean, look, we don't have a deal with them so, you know, we
-- and I think we've been fairly consistent, Michael, in our view of OTT and – called virtual MVPDs. What's important
for us, and what would make us support a service like this would be to get the networks that are our leading networks
into those packages.
And I'll go back to what I said at the analyst day. We've got virtually all of our economics in our top four or five
networks. And we don't have that many networks that are niche, that are small, that don't have much in terms of ratings,
that aren't that important. So – and so we would anticipate, as over time, if bundles get smaller, we would be able to

protect and hopefully even expand, as these services will appeal to a greater level of audience, our overall appeal and
overall number of consumers that we can get in front of.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: John, are their conditions on the size of the number of networks in that shrinking
bundle that you have to work with?
<A - John K. Martin>: That's a question for DISH, not for us.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. And let me ask one for Kevin. Kevin, when answering the stacking rates
questions, John and Richard both said how important stacking rates are to their networks, and a lot of times they
mentioned their own original content that they've stacked. And, I wondered, going forward, given the Gotham example,
do you think your role as independent producer for broadcasters may change, because networks want to, maybe, control
more of their stacking rights and own more of those rights themselves. So, how do you see that riding at the broadcast
level?
<A - Kevin Tsujihara>: I think the trend will be increased rights granted to networks in stacking. And as John
mentioned, we reached an agreement between ourselves to grant those rights to Turner. And I think that, as a company,
we believe that there isn't an impact on long-term rights related to these kinds of stacking, and I think that, therefore,
you're going to see, on a go-forward basis, a more consistent grant of rights that is broader.
<A - John K. Martin>: And just one quick further thing, the other thing I just want to mention, too, is that our goal
and expectation at TNT and TBS is we're going to own more of our originals. And when I say "own more," that's
Turner and Warners, and Warners being our most important studio partner. So we are going to make whatever the right
decisions are to increase the probability of success for the shows that we air on our networks. Obviously, right now,
you can hear a unified approach that stacking is going to help the shows.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay, thanks, guys.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Michael. Jeanette, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, and our next question comes from David Bank of RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Hey, thanks. Just a quick follow-up, I guess, for Kevin and Jeff on the stacking rights question.
When you look at the value chain, then, between, you know, what you're doing with Turner in selling full stacking
rights for those originals and then looking at the monetization outside of, you know, the Turner platform, how –
frankly, like how much do the Turner nets have to pay for those rights and do they make them less valuable in the
actual deals you're doing now with, you know, SVOD distributors? Is the money more or is it less or is it the same?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Look – I'm going to start, and let's go global here. You're talking about an evolution of the
rights and windows for shows. And so I think the way to think about it is if the norm becomes that all television
networks, when you go to whatever network you want to see your show on, and you know that you can watch any
episode of the current season on-demand and you can do it on your television stream, you can do it on a
broadband-delivered VOD service, what we're talking about here is taking television and making it VOD universally.
Therefore, it would not have an effect on, really, the discrete change in the price of a show. And as Kevin said earlier,
the – when you do that and you make the show easier to get attached and engaged and follow, you have actually a more
valuable show in subsequent seasons and on later windows.
So, that's basically what's going to happen in the industry. If you focus too much on any particular deal in the transition
period of going from rolling-five to a full season, I think you would be missing where this is going. The net effect of
the whole thing is to have TV networks become more valuable and more powerful, to have the value of any hit show
become more valuable and to then create, basically, an evolution of the windows where anything in a current season,
you know it's on-demand, doesn't matter what network you're watching. That's how we see the change in the definition
of a television network.

You can watch one today that works exactly like that, it's called Home Box Office. So just watch HBO. It's been doing
that for years. Showtime now does it, too. You can see exactly how powerful that is. It makes all the networks more
valuable and it makes all the shows more valuable.
<A - John K. Martin>: Yeah, I think the only thing I would add is the key thing is the consistency. That you don't
have to guess whether all those shows are going to be stacked on HBO or not. And I think we've got to get to a place
where there's more consistency on the rights granted.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, David. Jeanette, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
And our last question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Hi, thanks. A question for Richard, and then maybe a follow-up for Howard. On the
Comcast NBC Universal call, Steve Burke said about the HBO OTT product, he said, I think it's going to be
challenging for HBO to go and try and attract new customers into this ecosystem without cannibalizing existing
customers. I think you've been clear, Richard, that you don't think that will happen. You know, presumably, you will be
working with your traditional MVPD partners. I guess the question is, if you have enough success with your partners
on Internet-plus type offerings, as you've described, would you revisit your decision to roll out a standalone OTT
product after that sequencing?
<A - Richard L. Plepler>: The answer to the last question is no. Let me go to the first, which is Steve. Steve called me
personally to give some context to the comment, number one. And I think it was somewhat, you know, over-reported, if
you will. Neil [Neil Smit] called, subsequently, and I spoke to him, and I think the real point is the one that Neil made
in the Wall Street Journal, namely that HBO and Comcast have been terrific partners. He expects us to be terrific
partners going forward. I couldn't echo that more enthusiastically.
So we're going to work very closely with them on our current business. We're going to work very closely with them
growing it, not only in their current video business, but also on the broadband-only and Internet-plus side. And if you
have any doubt that we're each helping each other to grow each other's business, just look at the performance and look
at 2015 – 2014, and I think 2015 portends even greater growth.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Okay, thanks, Richard. And then, one quick one for Howard. You mentioned you
continue to track a little bit ahead of the full-year earnings guidance that you had provided earlier in the year. If I flow
through the third quarter beat and then the tax benefit, it does seem like the fourth quarter comes down a little bit. You
called out, Howard, a few of those factors: programming, investments at HBO, comps at Warner, the DISH dispute,
and then the advertising expectation at Turner. I guess, how am I doing on those factors, and maybe there is a way you
can sort of rank those in terms of their impact on the 4Q? Thank you.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Well, you know, your underlying assumption about us not looking as good if you take
those things out is actually not correct. You know, what I indicated is, if you exclude the restructuring and the tax and
the program impairment, we're tracking a little bit better than our prior guidance that we gave in August.
And what was the question in terms of the ranking of...?
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Well, maybe another way to ask it would be specifically on Turner advertising. So I
think you talked about flat. Was that where you had expected the fourth quarter Turner ad growth, for example, going
into this part of the year? Or had you expected a growth for the fourth quarter of Turner advertising?
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Anthony, there's a lot of puts and takes. I'm not going into the details of all the individual
components of that.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.
