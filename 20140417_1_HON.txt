Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. I'm sure you have seen by now, Honeywell delivered another good quarter to
kick off 2014. EPS of $1.28 increased 10% year-over-year when normalizing for tax, so another quarter of double-digit
EPS growth with earnings coming in above the high-end of our guidance range. This was driven in large part by our
strong execution and higher sales conversion, all while maintaining our seed planting investments for the future. Our
enablers and key process initiatives are driving meaningful results throughout the portfolio.
An important driver of our productivity continues to be the savings we're seeing from previously-funded restructuring
actions. And with that in mind, we've been able to proactively fund restructuring and other actions by fully deploying
the approximate $0.10 gain from the sale of B/E Aerospace shares in the first quarter, just like we did in the fourth
quarter of last year. I'd also point out that the company funded an incremental $10 million of restructuring actions in the
quarter from operations, so in total, $0.11 of restructuring and other actions.
The projects funded in the first quarter alone are estimated to yield full run rate savings of about $70 million over the
next couple of years. That's annual. We're being proactive about keeping that restructuring pipeline full and we think
these actions position us well for further market expansion over the next five years. Margin, EPS, and cash flow were
all strong in the quarter in spite of slightly slower top line growth, primarily related to timing in PMT and lower
Defense & Space sales. Sales in the quarter of $9.7 billion were up 4% reported and 1% organic. However, if you
exclude D&S, where the headwinds are well-known, organic sales for the total company were up about 3%.
We talk a lot about great positions in good industries and our diversity of opportunity, which once again benefited us in
the quarter. We saw good momentum exiting the quarter in our short-cycle businesses while our long-cycle businesses
maintain healthy backlog. We're also seeing pockets of recovery in below-peak end markets. Transportation Systems,
for example, continues its healthy pace of recovery. And while weather may have been a factor in some areas, these
challenges were mostly offset by weather-related areas of opportunity. For example, ECC enjoyed strong double-digit
sales growth in combustion and heating controls. The order momentum we're seeing out of our long-cycle businesses
and short-cycle also positions us well for our expected acceleration of organic growth in the second quarter and second
half of the year.
Geography is also a part of our diversity of opportunity. In the U.S., we continue to see good growth, excluding the
D&S headwinds as I mentioned. We're encouraged by continued stabilization in Europe and even more excited about
the growth we saw in China, India, and the Middle East. It's worth noting that each of our SBGs grew double-digits
organically in China in the quarter. So both our short- and long-cycle businesses are delivering on our high-growth
region strategies.
Innovation and investments in new products and technologies are also driving value across the portfolio. We unveiled
the Honeywell User Experience, or HUE, back in March and we couldn't be more excited about what this means for
Honeywell. We recently opened a HUE design studio in Shanghai, with other design studios set to open globally. We're
focused on how we can drive significant change and improve the experience for the user, installer, and maintainer.
With all of that being said, we remain cautiously optimistic on the macro economy, and with the strength of the first
quarter, we are confident in our revised full-year outlook for pro forma EPS, raising the low-end by $0.05, making our
new range $5.40 to $5.55, up 9% to 12% versus prior year. Our outlook on free cash flow has also improved, based on
the strong performance we saw in the first quarter.
As Tom will detail in a moment, we are now reporting free cash flow without adjustments for cash, pension, NARCO
payments, and one-time items. So the guidance range remains the same, but it's reflective of the first quarter
performance, and importantly, without adjustments. In summary, we've got a lot of momentum across the portfolio,
which we highlighted in our March Investor Day, with roadmaps for future growth and profitability as part of our new
five-year targets going out to 2018.
Innovation and execution, our seed planting for the future, great positions in good industries and the power of One
Honeywell will continue to differentiate us, allowing us to deliver on these targets and continuing to outperform.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.

Thomas A. Szlosek
Thanks, Dave and good morning. On slide 4, let me walk you through the financial results for the first quarter. Sales of
$9.7 billion were up approximately 4% on a reported basis, and up 1% on an organic basis. The total sales were right in
the middle of the range we communicated in early March of $9.6 billion to $9.8 billion and the organic growth rate was
slightly lower than our expectations, due to timing in Aerospace and PMT.
As Dave mentioned, excluding Defense & Space which is expected to stabilize this year, our organic sales were up 3%.
Regionally, organic sales were up 1% in the U.S. and EMEA, with Europe showing continued resilience despite some
large customer project ramp-downs. China grew 14% on an organic basis, with double-digit organic growth in each of
the businesses.
As we will detail later, we're anticipating organic sales growth to accelerate as the year progresses. Segment profit
increased 6% in the quarter, with margins expanding 30 basis points to 16.5%, or up 50 basis points excluding the
dilutive impact of M&A. We had guided to 30 basis points to 50 basis points improvement in the margin rate,
excluding M&A, so the 50 basis points is on the high-end of our expectation. We saw margin expansion in three out of
the four businesses. Productivity continues to be a key driver across the portfolio, offsetting inflation and continued
investments for growth.
In PMT, we did experience some temporary margin contraction because of the expected headwinds around unfavorable
petrochemical catalyst shipment mix and pricing headwinds in our [indiscernible] (8:28) Resins & Chemicals. Still,
PMT at close to 21% segment margins was our highest margin business in the quarter and we continue to have a lot of
confidence in our ability to expand margins going forward.
Below segment profit, I wanted to comment on two items. The first is the gains we experienced on the additional B/E
Aero shares, and second, the tax rate. On B/E Aero, which I'll further detail in a minute, the gain was more than offset
by restructuring and other charges, resulting in a $0.01 unfavorable impact on EPS. The B/E Aero gain is not included
in our operating margin, but the restructuring and other charges are, so operating margins expanded 10 basis points in
the quarter, compared to the segment margin expansion of 30 basis points. The tax rate of 26.6% was in line with
expectations and represented a $0.06 headwind compared to 2013.
Earnings per share of $1.28 was a penny higher than where we guided, even after we funded an incremental $0.01 of
additional restructuring actions. There are a couple of things to mention on the free cash flow. First, it was really
strong, up 2.5 times 2013 amount. The improvement came equally from better working capital performance and lower
cash contributions to foreign pension plans. Second, we're simplifying how we define free cash flow, as Dave
mentioned. It's just free cash flow from operations – I'm sorry, it's just cash flow from operations, less capital
expenditures, no more adjusting for pension, or NARCO. We did this the same way for both 2013 and 2014, so the
numbers are comparable and the growth is real.
Slide 5 provides a more detailed view of the gain deployment actions in the quarter. As you can see, the $0.10 per share
gain from the 1.5 million B/E Aero shares sold in the first quarter was exceeded by funding of restructuring actions and
other proactive environmental remedies. So in total, an $0.11 headwind to earnings from restructuring activities offset
by the B/E Aero gain of $0.10, so a net $0.01 headwind to earnings. Repositioning or restructuring represented the
majority of the gain deployment, just as you heard in January. These actions are intended to proactively realign our
businesses for growth and higher asset efficiency, and will provide us with meaningful margin and earnings tailwinds
in future periods. We're expecting these projects to yield approximately $70 million of run rate savings in future years
and each individual project has an excellent ROI. We will continue to maintain a steady pipeline of future projects to
fund, should the opportunity arise. This, as you know, continues to be a key element of the Honeywell playbook as
restructuring funds the exit cost requirements from our key process initiatives and integration activities.
A smaller portion of the gain was used to fund incremental environmental charges. This relates to certain remediation
projects where we believe seeking proactive remedies with the regulators will lead to lower expenses and more cost
stability over the long-term. Overall, these actions position the company well for future earnings growth. And, as a
reminder, following the sale of 2.6 million B/E Aero shares in the fourth quarter of last year and the 1.5 million in the

first quarter, we still have roughly 1.9 million shares remaining and continue to have a very favorable view of the
company.
Now, let's take a look at the four business segments. Starting on slide 6, Aerospace sales were down 2%, which is in
line with our guidance. However, excluding the impact of the expected Defense & Space decline, Aero sales were up a
solid 3%. Segment margin was up 30 basis points, which was actually a bit better than our expectations. From a sales
perspective, commercial OE sales were up 1%, reflecting strong air transport and business aircraft shipments. We had
particularly strong 737 and 787 OE growth and broad strength across the business aircraft portfolio. Regional jet sales
were lower, reflecting lower volume and free-of-charge shipments. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 4% in the
quarter, with double-digit spares growth in both ATR and BGA, partially offset by lower R&O revenues, a reflection of
fewer maintenance events and timing. The 14% spares growth was driven by the recovery in the U.S. and China, and
we highlighted this as a challenge in the first quarter of 2013 as well by the continued robust RMU sales in BGA. RMU
is repairs, modifications and upgrades.
Defense & Space sales were down 8%, which we expect to be the low point from a sales perspective for the year. Most
of the decline was planned with known program ramp-downs and anticipated lower government services and defense
aftermarket revenue. On segment profit, the Aero team was able to more than offset the impacts from the lower sales to
drive its segment margin up 30 basis points, through commercial excellence, productivity net of inflation, and favorable
aftermarket mix.
On page 7, we're looking at ACS prior to the shift of HPS to PMT. We expect to file an 8-K in the second quarter to
reflect this change and we will update our historical numbers. However, to be perfectly clear, when we share the
guidance for Q2 and the rest of the year, which I'll review in a few minutes, we'll do that on the new reporting structure.
So ACS organic sales were up 2% and reported sales up 8%, both in line with our expectations. The difference, of
course, reflects the growth from M&A, in particular Intermec and RAE Systems acquisitions. The segment margin was
up 40 basis points, almost twice our expectations. ESS sales, so the products businesses were up 2%, with ECC and
Life Safety showing particularly strong growth and more than offsetting the expected declines in Scanning & Mobility,
resulting from the ramp-down of certain programs. Without this Scanning & Mobility dilution, ESS sales would have
been up 5% with some favorable contribution from weather impacting ECC. We experienced higher U.S. residential
sales, including on the retail side, modest improvements in Asia and Europe, and continued HGR growth in China and
India. The Intermec acquisition continues to go well. We're exceeding what were challenging expectations on the pace
of integration and on performance. Also, the business continues to win a large number of orders that are expected to
result in further 2014 growth.
Process Solutions sales were up 3% on an organic basis in the quarter with continued good growth in high-margin areas
like services and advanced solutions, more than offsetting the impact of large project completions. Orders growth also
continues to be healthy and backlog is growing, which Darius and the PMT team will see the benefit of in the future.
Building Solutions sales were essentially flat on an organic basis. We are encouraged by our Building Solutions orders
and the project backlog growth, both showing mid-single-digit growth on an organic basis, and we're also experiencing
similar growth in the services backlog. Not a trend yet, but certainly encouraging development as we look to the rest of
the year.
ACS margins expanded 40 basis points to 14.2% in the quarter, and were up 70 basis points, excluding the dilution
from M&A. ACS continues to benefit from driving commercial excellence, volume leverage and productivity, while at
the same time investing for the future.
Moving to page 8, Performance Materials and Technologies. PMT sales were up 2%, in line with our expectations, and
driven by 9% growth in UOP, offset by 4% decline in Advanced Materials. Although PMT margins contracted 100
basis points, the result was better than our expectations. And at 20.8%, PMT was, again, our highest-margin business in
the quarter.
On sales, UOP experienced significant growth in catalyst volume and gas processing, offset by an unfavorable mix in
catalyst shipments and lower process technology licensing sales, resulting from timing and challenging comps.

As you know, we are in the midst of adding UOP capacity, particularly on the catalyst side which will help the business
to better serve its $2.4 billion backlog.
Advanced Materials sales were down 4%. We experienced volume increases in most of the Advanced Materials
portfolio, despite the tempering effect of the difficult weather. This volume growth was more than offset by
unfavorable pricing in Fluorine Products and Resins & Chemicals. We do expect the pricing challenges to moderate in
the second quarter and throughout the year as we lap prior year declines. The decline in segment margin was
principally driven by unfavorable catalyst mix in UOP, the price/raw challenges in Advanced Materials and some
temporary spikes in raw material costs due to weather, partially offset by productivity net of inflation.
On slide 9, you can see Transportation Systems had a very strong quarter with sales up 9%, that's 7% without the
benefit of foreign exchange and segment margin up 340 basis points. On the sales side, the increase was principally
volume-related. We experienced strong turbo volume growth in our three biggest regions, Europe, North America, and
China. The Europe growth was strong in both light and commercial vehicle segments. We continue to benefit from
improving global industry macros on vehicle production, also from regulations and gas penetration. We continue to
benefit from a strong win rate, with turbo unit sales from new product launches doubling from 2013 levels. As the year
progresses and we begin to lap stronger periods from 2013, we do expect some moderation in the growth rates.
The segment margin improvements to 15.5% reflects the strong productivity and volume leverage in turbo and the
benefits from restructuring and other operational improvements. We continue to work on the Friction Materials
divestiture and expect a closure sometime in the second half of 2014.
I'm now on page 10 with a preview of the second quarter. We're expecting sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion, which
would be up between 3% and 5% on a reported basis, or approximately 3% on an organic basis. We are using a euro
rate of roughly $1.35 for the second quarter. Segment margins are expected to be up in the rage of 50 basis points to 70
basis points excluding the dilutive impact of M&A. EPS of $1.32 to $1.36 will be up 8% to 11% at our normalized
26.5% effective tax rate. On the segments, Aero sales growth is expected to be in-between minus 1% and plus 1% in
the quarter with low-single-digit commercial growth offset by moderating Defense & Space declines. On commercial
OE, we are still seeing healthy demand for air transport deliveries, which is helping offset the continued drag from
lower regional aircraft sales.
In commercial aftermarket, we're expecting ATR spares growth to be about in line with flight hours in the quarter, as
well as continued BGA, RMU strength. As for margins, we expect some headwinds, primarily due to higher
mechanical OE sales in both ATR and BGA, and a higher proportion of ATR revenue in the quarter resulting in flattish
overall margin growth.
For ACS, as I indicated earlier, we're providing guidance based upon the new reporting structure. Sales are expected to
be up between 8% and 10%, or approximately 3% on an organic basis. The reported sales growth is largely driven by
the Intermec acquisition and an acceleration of organic growth and ESS, particularly security and Scanning & Mobility,
and also BSD. Modest improvements in non-resi projects are expected to favorably impact ECC, Life Safety and
security, and high-growth region sales look to continue their positive trend. The two consecutive quarters of long-cycle
orders and backlog growth in Building Solutions is encouraging and should enable strong organic sales growth in the
second half. ACS margins are expected to be up again in the second quarter, approximately 50 basis points, or 100
basis points excluding the dilutive impact of M&A.
PMT, including Process Solutions in both years, is expecting sales to increase between 3% and 5% in the second
quarter, driven by double-digit increases in UOP and to low- to mid-single-digit growth in HPS and Advanced
Materials.
In UOP, we foresee another strong quarter of increased catalyst and gas processing sales growth, while in Advanced
Materials we anticipate broad sales growth across the portfolio, including improved production levels in Resins &
Chemicals and our normal seasonal ramp-up in Fluorine Products. The PMT leadership is encouraged by the
momentum in the orders and the backlog increases in HPS. PMT segment margins, however, are expected to be up
slightly versus the prior year, based on the mix of shipments within UOP, offset by moderating pricing pressures in

Advanced Materials.
In Transportation Systems, the strong performance is expected to continue, although tempered slightly from Q1 by the
more challenging comps. Sales look to grow between 5% and 7%, driven by new platform launches, continued turbo
gas penetration, and flat or slightly better EU light vehicle product rates year-over-year. Segment margins will be
similar to first quarter levels and up approximately 200 basis points, primarily driven by higher volumes in turbo and
continued productivity gains.
On page 11, we're profiling the organic sales growth for the year. We're expecting full-year growth of 3% on an organic
basis, so there's some modest acceleration from the Q1 growth rate of 1% and we want to explain the key drivers. The
page shows the first half versus second half organic growth rate for 2013, as well as what we expect for 2014. The first
thing to notice is that the first half growth for 2014 is stronger than 2013. We saw that in this first quarter, as the 1%
organic growth, although tepid, was greater than the first quarter of 2013, where we saw a decline of 1%.
Second, the slope of the line is similar in each year. In 2013, we went from 0% in the first half to 3% in the second half,
and in 2014, we go from 2% in the first half to an expected 4% in the second half. Thirdly, the notations on the top of
the 2014 bar show the expected organic growth rates excluding Defense & Space, which will be roughly 3% in the first
half of 2014, accelerating to approximately 4% in the second half of the year.
That happens because of the factors mentioned on the right side of the page. In Aero, Defense & Space declines
significantly moderate. Also, commercial OE is expected to improve slightly, largely driven by the absence the prior
year's large fourth quarter BGA OE payments. In ACS, we anticipate Scanning & Mobility returning to growth, after
lapping the program wind-downs I discussed earlier and also layering on new business wins. The macro environment is
also expected to modestly improve with continued residential strength and improving non-residential markets
benefiting ESS. And, as highlighted earlier, the last couple of quarters have seen a nice lift in Building Solutions
backlog, which is expected to result in stronger sales growth rates in the second half.
In PMT, the pickup in the second half is driven primarily by better Process Solutions and Advanced Materials growth,
partially offset by tougher comps in UOP. UOP organic sales grew 17% in the fourth quarter of 2013.
The Process Solutions backlog of projects and services continues to grow nicely, which like Building Solutions, is
expected to result in better second half sales growth. And, as mentioned earlier, Advanced Materials pricing headwinds
are expected to moderate in the second quarter and back half of the year and we're also expecting a boost from higher
volumes and higher [ph] sulfa (25:08) sales in Fluorine Products.
Finally, in Transportation, while the outlook remains very strong, the comps become gradually more challenging as we
progress through the year, so while we're expecting growth in the second half in TS, it's expected to be at a slower pace
than the first.
I'm now on slide 12 where we provide an outlook at segment performance for the year. Again, this guidance reflects the
realignment of our Process Solutions business into PMT from ACS. So let me explain the setup here. The left-hand side
of the slide represents the guidance we provided in March and is based on the old reporting structure. The right-half
reflects our current guidance. On a total of Honeywell basis, if you look at the bottom line, the segment guidance for
the year has not changed. However, there are some minor changes to the segment that you should be aware of.
Aerospace sales remain roughly in line with the guidance, but reflecting the slower R&O growth in the first quarter and
slightly lower margins impacted by volume leverage on that lower sales growth. ACS and PMT now reflect a shift of
Process Solutions for the full-year. Organic sales are expected to improve in the second half of the year for both
businesses. We have also provided updated margin profiles which show continued expansion in both ACS and PMT.
The Transportation Systems guidance reflects the first quarter top line strength and strong margin expansion. We are
now expecting TS margins to approximate 15% or more in 2014. So small puts and takes, but as I said, no change in
the total Honeywell sales or margin outlook.
Moving to slide 13, we have an update on our full-year guidance, which is very similar to what we shared at the March
Investor Day, except for two things. One, we're raising our full-year pro forma EPS guidance at the low-end by $0.05,
resulting in a new range of $5.40 to $5.55, which is up 9% to 12% versus 2013. This reflects our first quarter

performance, and the confidence we have in our outlook.
Second, we are raising our free cash flow guidance by approximately $300 million, to reflect the strength we saw in
working capital in the first quarter, and lower foreign cash pension contributions. To be clear, the $3.8 billion to $4
billion range looks the same as what we showed you previously in March, but that range was based on the prior
definition of free cash flow, which excluded several non-operating items.
So with those changes, we continue to expect sales in the range of $40.3 billion to $40.7 billion, which is up 3% to 4%
on a reported basis, and 3% on an organic basis. Our sales range reflects euro at $1.30 for the second half of the year,
so a little bit of a headwind there. We also continue to expect segment margins between 16.6% and 16.9%, which
would be up 30 basis points to 60 basis points from 2013, or 50 basis points to 80 basis points, excluding the M&A
impact. So, as Dave said earlier, still a very balanced outlook for the year, but taking into account the good start we saw
in the first quarter.
On page 14, I have a brief wrap up. In markets that continue to be somewhat challenged, we're off to another good start
to the year. We exceeded our expectations on most fronts, including margins, earnings, and free cash flow, while at the
same time, continuing to invest for future growth and productivity. We raised our earnings and cash guidance to reflect
the strong first quarter, as well as our expectations for growth acceleration in the second half. We intend to continue our
outperformance by leveraging our balanced portfolio, which as you know is strategically aligned with the favorable
macro trends. These include energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, and urbanization combined
with a growing middle-class and customer productivity, all of which remain intact.
So with that, Elena, let's go to Q&A.

Operator
Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from
Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey. Could we drill in a little bit more on kind of the building related trends in ACS? Tom,
you gave us some color there, but just on BSD, I'm curious if there's some geographic color you can shed on what's
going on and the firming there and if there's some color you can shed on kind of energy retrofit versus new
construction?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes, I'd say the growth in orders in HPS was high-single-digits for the quarter on an
organic basis. And that came across very strong in the Americas. Europe was also very good, and Asia, which is a little
bit smaller for us, was a little bit down. But in the Americas, we're seeing really good wins in energy, Smart Grid
Solutions, as well, and services. Our service bank continues to grow. So across the board, pretty good result there on an
orders perspective and, again, as we said, this is the second quarter where we are seeing that momentum. So hopefully
it bodes well for the second half.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then when you look at ESS and what's going on there, in particular in environmental
controls, can you elaborate a little bit more how the quarter played out? It sounds like it was a pretty strong heating
driven quarter. Does that then fall off as we get into the second quarter?

<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No, I think, the trend, I mean it was very strong – yes, ECC was very strong, Jeff, in the
quarter, mid- to high-single-digits on a growth perspective. Americas was very strong in combustion as well. So both
homes and combustion, but the trends will probably be mid-single-digits growth over the course of the year, if the
conditions kind of stay where they are. So we are encouraged by it.
<A - David M. Cote>: We also have the new products, Jeff, that we've been introducing, and that's helping.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right. Can you elaborate a little bit on kind of the call you are making on the euro? So you are
just kind of expecting a dollar, euro fade here as we get into the back half of the year? And if that doesn't happen, what
kind of hedge that is to your second half earnings outlook?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, I mean, as we said, we're using $1.35 for the second quarter, and $1.30 for the
second half. I mean, we are closer in obviously to the second quarter and we kind of feel more confident with that. We
are not trying to be economists or forecasters here; I think it's just more the conservatism that we're including. The
impact on the second half would not be very significant.
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah, the average in the second half of last year on the euro, Jeff, I think was $1.33, roughly
$1.34, in that range in the second half. So a little bit of a headwind but, remember, that's at the midpoint of our revenue
outlook for the second half.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: But roughly speaking, the euro spent is an EPS spent on a full-year basis? Is that about right?
<A - Elena Doom>: Roughly, yeah. A little less than that but close. And that's assuming the euro is isolated.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right, right. Okay, thank you very much.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks, Jeff.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hi, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I don't think you mentioned – particularly, Dave, I don't think you mentioned anything about the
management changes, and pretty substantial, really. Maybe the question really is, because I don't think we have a half
hour to talk here, but the question is, what do you expect to get better? What is the – what's the messaging, I guess, in
the sheer volume of changes you've made and there are changes in mandates and, I mean, I'll just open it up to that.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, I don't think you're going to get a lot more from me than what we already talked about,
because we tried to explain it the first time through. I'd say the reason I didn't bring it up is I kind of viewed it as that's
history and we already went through that. But, at the end of the day, the whole point is just we've got really good
people coming up. And we need to make sure that we provide opportunities for them to grow, and at the same time,
we've got the five-year plan that we have committed to that has some pretty big themes that we want to make sure that
we drive. So M&A, high-growth regions, the software focus, HUE and HOS Gold, and as I look at those, I want to
make sure that we develop them as a company. This gives us an opportunity with the vice chairs to really make sure
that happens and that we deliver on that five-year plan. So it's really pretty much what I said, Scott, in the
announcement we sent out.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, fair enough. And not to nitpick, but Defense down 8%, I think it was a little bit worse
than what we had expected. I mean, can you give us a sense of how that transitions through the year, particularly when
it flattens out and becomes a net neutral? I mean assuming by 1Q of 2015 it is going to be an easy comp, but how do
you thinking about the next three quarters of headwind?

<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, the declines, Scott, we start to see them in the second quarter. And we'll actually
probably be flattish in the second half. So for the year we're expecting to be in line with kind of a low-single-digit
decline for the year.
<A - Elena Doom>: And you'll recall, Scott, we have a – sorry, we have an easier comp, right, in the third quarter of
this year. So likely to see an actual increase in the D&S revenue in the third quarter, given the 11% decline in 3Q of
2013.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, perfect. And then a just quick one on HPS. Can you give us a sense of the order book in
that business, how the forward outlook looks?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, I'd say if you looked at it from a book-to-bill ratio, pretty strong. And from the pure
growth percentage, we were also mid-single-digits for the quarter.
<A - Elena Doom>: The long-cycle projects, the bigger projects up a little bit more than that, more in the
high-single-digits, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, that's perfect. Thank you, guys, I'll pass it on.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Winoker with Sanford C. Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is
open.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning, all. First question, Tom, particularly, what kind of visibility
do you have beyond the next B/EA sales, of that 1.9 million shares, I guess, to additional one-time gains in the pipeline
that can fund restructuring on a continued or repositioning on a continued basis? In other words, you've got a lot of
ambitious goals in that five-year plan that is going to require a lot of ongoing repositioning over that five years and we
are seeing it now. Do you have a lot of confidence and visibility into the offsets there?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Obviously, the BEA for the last couple of years, and some of the other transactions in the
last couple of years have been nice catalysts for restructuring, but even without those, we've, through operations, been
able to generate sufficient capacity and that's funded a lot of what we've done as well. So that's what I look to, and in
terms of how we set our plans, we do try to incorporate capacity for that on an ongoing basis. It's not going to hundreds
of millions of dollars every quarter, but we are very mindful of it.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: And in the same way that you've moved on cash now to reporting on a cleaner basis
without the adjustments, is there some thoughts of doing the same thing on restructuring or any of these another items
or not really?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Well, I'm not exactly clear what's not clean about the restructuring.
<A - Elena Doom>: It's reported in our GAAP earnings, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Right. No, I just meant some of your peers choose to just to treat the operating earnings
all-in. That's all.
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, that's a point I'd like you to make much more strongly, Steve, in all of your comments. I
have always felt for 10, 12 years we've always included everything and talked about it that way. And you allow greater
license with some others when it comes to what's in and what's out. We don't do that.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. I'm sure you are talking about the collective you. And then finally, on the
book-to-bill, you talked about it just now and I guess in HPS, on the entirety of the kind of long-cycle businesses across
Honeywell, could you give us that number?

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Can you just give us, I guess – can you give us a prior guidance or at least PMT new guidance
on the prior basis? Is there any change to that up 4%, up 10 bps – up 4% in revenues and up 10% in margin – up 10
basis points in margin?
<A - Elena Doom>: For the full year, you're saying?
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Yeah.
<A - Elena Doom>: Or the second quarter?
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: For the full-year.
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah, I think in terms of the PMT full-year sales outlook, they would have been roughly $50
million less in terms of revenue, and margins would have been about 50 basis points less than what we are showing on
the current outlook.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So the fact that I guess you are kind of tweaking that down, but then moving – so I guess
HPS in there – I mean HPS margins then must be going up a lot.
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: There's been an ongoing improvement in HPS.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: But I mean I'm getting – I guess I'm getting – I'm getting something, it's like more than 100 basis
points, I mean for – to have that margin go down like that for PMT but to have the combined segment go up 50 basis
points. I mean that's a huge increase in HPS. So I think limited, I mean there's not that much volume growth there,
right?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: It's low- to mid-single-digits, so – but, yeah, you are right, it's...
<A - Elena Doom>: It's certainly better in the second half.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Is that a mix dynamic? Is that more software coming through, or something, or just blocking and
tackling?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I mean over the last couple of years as you know in HPS, Darius has been focused on
driving operational improvements in the business. I mean, the business is up 200 basis points in the last two years
through the end of December. And, you're still seeing continued restructuring actions that are directed at that business.
They've also done a nice job of driving growth in the services and software side, so advanced solutions. So the mix of
their revenues has been pretty good as well. So it's a combination of both operational improvements and the portfolio
and what they have been emphasizing.

<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then I guess just on...
<A - David M. Cote>: At the end of the day, Steve, your premise is right. If you take a look at overall PMT, that first
quarter of struggle continues on a bit during the course of the year. So we expect it's not going to be as good as what we
had said initially. And one of the offsets to that is going to be Process Solutions performance and what Darius has been
able to achieve there. And it's across the board. It's better growth, better cost performance, better organization. I'm
really intrigued with what I see going on in that business and where we can take it.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Can you take it more into instrumentation?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say, you are going to see us continuing to drive our software capability because that's a
big part of where we differentiate ourselves is just doing a great job on the software side and adding value there.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then, Dave, any change in the way you view the Advanced Materials business? I
mean, you've combined HPS and UOP now, clearly like a very attractive play on this whole global petrochem theme
that's out there. We kind of continue to talk about fluorine pricing as a headwind, things that probably most
multi-industry companies don't talk about. Is there any kind of change on the portfolio view, especially in the context of
the liquidity and high valuations out there and, quite frankly, a multiple for you guys that remains at a discount. Any
thought around how core that business is over the long-term?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say the thought is the same and that it is still core. One the things that getting back to
this diversity of opportunity is, I like having a lot of bets out there, so that while never – there's never one thing that
really kills me, but there's also never any one thing that really makes the whole thing take off. I think it just creates
more sustainability, which means that to have all the moving pieces moving in the same positive direction at the same
time, or negative directions, is unlikely. So, what we're seeing right now in particularly resins and chemicals and
fluorine, there is a couple of unique aspects that are causing them to not perform as well as we might like. But at the
same time, I know those things are going to be changing. So if I take resins and chemicals, when I take a look at the
competitive positioning, it is still the lowest cost producer in the world. And that includes being able to land product in
China cheaper than the Chinese can manufacture it domestically. So, we've got an advantage there, and I think what
you'll probably see is capacity elsewhere in the industry coming out over time and moving our pricing dynamic up.
If I take a look at fluorine, it's largely driven by patents, and when you have stuff that comes off-patent, well, pricing
tends to get hit and that's what you're seeing now. However, we have new patents coming in for the HFO stuff, and
that's gearing up now. As a result of that, we're going to see some really nice performance out of the fluorines business
over the next few years. So, I would kind of like it more to – we've got this unusual dynamic going on in both of these
businesses. It's going to be turning over the next year or so, and we'll benefit from it. So there's still good businesses,
it's just you can't have every business performing at the same time, it just doesn't work.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Right. Okay, fair point. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Oh, thanks, good morning. So, I just wanted to dig into the ACS, PMT, potential synergies there.
We've been talking about the go-to-market potential there for a while, now we have the resegmentation. So I'm
wondering, Dave, should we expect there to be more integration between these two businesses going forward? Or is it
basically the same as before, it's just they now happen to be in the same segments?
<A - David M. Cote>: Probably somewhere in between. Got to wait for Darius to finish his work there on what he
thinks, but at the end of the day, there is stuff that is common. And you say, 60% of the customers that HPS has and the
same UOP has, if you take a look at who they deal with, should be about the same. The technology, there should be
even greater overlap than there is, because UOP is developing processes and HPS is developing the controls that
manage the process. And while we've done some of that already, there should be more opportunity there. On the other

side, you have UOP, which is more obviously of a chemical business and some on the mechanical side when it comes
to how to run those chemicals.
And you've got HPS, which is largely a software business, and that's not going to change. I have a tough time seeing
the chemical guys running the software engineering or vice versa. So that's why I think it's going to be somewhere in
between and I'm waiting for Darius to finish his review on what he thinks makes the most sense here.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. No, that makes sense. And then switching to TS, 15.5% OM, I think is the best you've ever
done in the quarter, given that there have been some changes in the portfolio over that timeframe, but 15.5%
[indiscernible] (47:55) to me. And within that number, is friction still losing money or is it back to break-even?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: It's nearing break-even. It was probably a third of the overall margin improvement for the
quarter for Transportation Systems.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, so one-third. And then some other quick one. The free cash flow guidance, just to clarify, that
includes the cash taxes on the B/E sale.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you. I have one ACS question and then one on another item. First, on ACS, I mean
we have been seeing...
<A - David M. Cote>: By the way, Howard, hi.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Hello, Dave. And in fact, you know this new management structure eliminates confusion
between you and the CFO now. So now I can – so I appreciate that.
<A - David M. Cote>: ...but I'm sure there's more to that story.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: In any event, Dave, good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thank you, Howard. Good morning to you, too.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: With respect to U.S. housing, it's been a little sloppy on the starts and I know that's small
relative to your business. Have you seen anything there that is an indication of pent-up demand or some change in the
overall market?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, I don't think – when you look at our revenues in ACS, Howard,...
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Yes.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: ...we don't have a precise way of determining where every product ends up, whether it's in
a commercial setting or a residential setting. But with that said, there are very strong verticals within ACS in the last
couple of quarters. I'd point to the retail sales, in particular for ECC, that have been a strong indication that consumers
are, in fact, very interested in energy-related products, thermostats and other things that go into their homes.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then to follow up on another subject. You've used a lot of the discretionary gains to go
after environmental so that you're reducing the long-term obligations there. Could you just address for a moment, Dave,
what you've done so that the entire process of the enterprise has gone after eliminating legacy liabilities so that the
result is that you don't have to find – well, use gains to fund prior liabilities but, in fact, can use them to, I'll call it,
advance the enterprise?

<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I look at both as advancing the enterprise. But to your point, one of them is eliminating a
negative as opposed to accentuating the positive. And as you know, I started this effort 12 years ago now, and thinking
that the way – my approach to it was given that, if you take a look at all of our products and all the stuff we do around
the world, we're basically on the side of the angels with everything we do, whether it's energy efficiency, clean energy
generation, safety, security, all of those macro trends are good things for the world. Yet we had this legacy liability that
was just uncomfortable and very inconsistent with our message. I also felt that all this stuff cost you more over time,
and that our previous strategy of just waiting until we lost in court was not a good one, and we prefer to do this
proactively.
Well, we're at a point now where we can actually see the end of the road on this, to the extent we can accelerate
meeting that end of the road, well, I'm all in favor of it. And I'd say we're not too far away now, Howard, from being at
that point where we've been able to accelerate a lot of these issues, make it less expensive to get done, because either
our remediation is quicker, more effective, or we're able to resolve it faster. And I can see that within our five-year plan
horizon which is a nice place to be.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I mean, is there any way to quantify it? I mean it could be $50 million, $100 million a year
in potential cost avoidance down the road.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, my view is it's more on the [indiscernible] (52:38) I'll try not to be too bullish yet until I
actually know, but I'd say that's the right kind of range to think about it, Howard.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes, good morning, Dave. I'll make sure I get that in. Good morning, Tom. My question is
really on the comparing kind of your first half guidance in Aerospace versus the second half. I'm surprised the second
half isn't showing up stronger, given just kind of the overlay with 2% growth you're showing. You've got OE growth,
aftermarket, I think it's flight hours growth, so that's at least mid-single-digits. So I'm just wondering given the Defense
is probably go to be closer to flat in the second half, at least that's what it seems like given your 8% down this quarter.
What am I missing, I guess? Is it just conservatism at this point, given Defense, or is there something else?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No, I don't think you're missing anything. On the Defense side, as Elena said, we'll get a
nice bump in the third quarter because of the comps that we had last year. Overall, the second half will be what you see
there, but for the year, we're still going to be down in Defense.
In terms of first half to second half, the R&O timing that we saw in the first quarter, we're going to start seeing that
subsiding. So that's going to help us quite a bit in the second half. I mentioned the BGAs. So I think the 2% that we're
showing for the full-year is a full reflection of all the puts and takes that we've got.
<A - Elena Doom>: Peter, I do want to add, we also have some launch contributions factored into the second half
outlook for BGA OE. It's not significant, but obviously that does impact the – it's certainly scheduled for the third
quarter, which would be obviously a drag on revenues.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just quickly on the aftermarket trends in general, are you
seeing any differences from a geography standpoint. I mean it seems China was up 14%, but that seems to be a very
volatile number. I can remember two years ago it was up 40% in one quarter. So...
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: ...what are you seeing in general there?

<A - Elena Doom>: In terms of the aftermarket?
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah, just from a geography standpoint, any differences that you can call out?
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah. You'll recall in the fourth quarter, the U.S. saw in the high-double-digit spares growth. We
continued to see that in the first quarter of this year in terms of the ATR spares. Europe, call it relatively muted growth,
and China, obviously, a big pop, but versus an easier comp in the first quarter of last year.
<A - David M. Cote>: And I think, Peter, I've [audio gap] (55:39) you in the past showing flight hours versus how
spares orders go.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: I'm sorry, Dave, can you just repeat that?
<A - David M. Cote>: I think I've drawn my little chart for you in the past showing how flight hours grow at a
relatively stable rate but spares ordering around those flight hours varies significantly.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes, you have. Yeah, correct.
<A - David M. Cote>: I'd say if I take a look at China, that's more of what you're seeing. The 40% a few years ago was
a pre-buy, given the tightening. What you saw after that was the tightening. Now what you are seeing is a catch-up. So
at some point it reconnects.

talking about the second half OE acceleration?
<A - Elena Doom>: So, Shannon, on the ATR OE component of it, and this is consistent with what we talked about in
the December outlook call and again in the fourth quarter earnings release, but you are seeing very strong growth on
the air transport side, offset by declines in regional jet sales and also we have some free-of-charge shipments that,
again, we're expensing or recognizing as we're incurring them, and those continue – that's the outlook really for the
duration of the year. Those fundamentals don't change or inflect, and so that's slower growth than I guess you would
maybe likely expect if you were just plugging in the air transport component of it, but the regional piece is obviously
putting a drag on our overall sales.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: And I'd add on the BGA side, the first quarter growth that you saw will continue
throughout the course of the year, so a mid-single-digit growth on BGA OE for the year.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And when does the regional kind of pressure ease?
<A - Elena Doom>: Well, we're hoping that that certainly gets better in 2015, but largely dependent upon the overall
market.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Just on free cash flow; definitely applaud the changed definition, so thanks for
that. I was just wondering if you have the kind of updated numbers for this year of what you've built in for NARCO

pension and the cash taxes. In the appendix, you have them for sort of what they were in 2013. Do you have those
numbers of what you've baked in for 2014?
<A - Elena Doom>: In terms of the big buckets, Shannon, I'll just walk through a few of them, on cash pensions we're
now expecting zero in 2014 for cash pension and that's versus the previous estimate of about $100 million for foreign
contributions. On the NARCO component of it, we were previously excluding the establishment payments for
NARCO, which were roughly, call it, $200 million pre-tax, and we're still – that's still the expectation but we've just
now embedded that in for our free cash flow forecast.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And obviously you've got to wait I guess until the available – well, no, you would know
the cash taxes, right? So what about the available for sale piece? What's that?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: You're talking about on the B/E shares?
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, because you're baking that in now, too, right?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yeah, the first quarter impact was included in the Q1 free cash flow.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, right. So that's already baked in and there's no more.
<A - Elena Doom>: [ph] already in there, yeah. (59:22)
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. All right, thanks a lot.

All right, Tony, we will now conclude today's call. I want to turn it over to Dave Cote for any final remarks.
David M. Cote
All right, thanks, guys. We've had a nice start to the year and, as a result, we feel confident in raising total year
guidance for both earnings per share and cash flow. Outperforming in the short-term, while seed planting for the
long-term continues to be an important dynamic for us, we intend to not just outperform this year, but also over the
next five years. So thank you for listening and I hope all of you have a marvelous Easter weekend. See you.
