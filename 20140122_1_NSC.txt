Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2013
earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team including our President, Jim Squires;
our Chief Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and Marta Stewart, our Chief
Financial Officer.
I am pleased to announce that Norfolk Southern had an excellent fourth quarter. We achieved fourth quarter record
highs in revenues, income from operations, net income, and earnings per share. As you know, these fourth quarter
results capped an outstanding 2013 performance and led to record results for the full year, including all-time highest for
revenues, operating ratio, income from operations and earnings per share.
Looking at our top line, revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.9 billion, an increase of $197 million or 7%. Overall
volumes rose 4%, as a decline in coal volumes was more than offset by growth in merchandise and intermodal traffic.
For the full year, revenues were $11.2 billion, a 2% increase over 2012 despite a 12% decline in coal revenue. And as
usual, Don will provide you with all of the revenue details in a few minutes.
The combination of volume increases coupled with our continued focus on expense control resulted in net income for
the quarter of $513 million, up 24% year-over-year and diluted earnings per share of $1.64, up 26%. For the full year,
net income and earnings per share increased 9% and 12% respectively. Marta will provide you with all of the financial
details.
The railroad ran extremely well in the fourth quarter. This was a continuation of the superior service levels we
maintained for all of 2013, with sustained high metrics in network velocity and terminal dwell throughout the year.
These metrics were – in turn were a important driver in our ability to maintain a high average composite service index.
And as we have said many times before, an efficiently run network helps in our efforts to keep expenses under control.
Mark will give you all of the fourth quarter operating results.
In 2014, we will continue our focus on improving customer service and running our network efficiently. Part of that
plan is strong capital investment and Marta will provide you some details of our planned $2.2 billion capital program.
At this point, I'll turn the program over to Don and the rest of the team, and I'll return with some closing remarks before
we take questions. Don?
Donald W. Seale
Thank you, Wick, and good morning. Revenue during the fourth quarter was $2.9 billion, up $197 million or 7% versus
2012. We set new quarterly records in intermodal of $618 million, up 6%; and merchandise with $1.6 billion, up 12%.
These favorable results were partially offset by a 2% decline in coal revenue, due to lower volumes of utility and
domestic metallurgical coal.

With respect to the components of revenue growth, higher volumes across the business accounted for increased revenue
of $105 million, favorable price and mix accounted for $41 million of the overall gain, while higher fuel surcharge
revenue accounted for $51 million year-over-year. Total volume for the quarter increased by nearly 70,000 units or 4%,
with revenue per unit of $1,547, up $49 or 3%.
Turning to revenue per unit, on the next slide, coal RPU in the quarter was up 7%, driven primarily by favorable export
coal mix and a $15 million volume shortfall settlement with one of our utility customers. Merchandise RPU was up 4%
and intermodal RPU was down 1% as compared to last year. Total revenue per unit was up 3% based on improved
pricing, increased fuel surcharge revenue and the favorable mix and contract settlement that I just mentioned in our
utility coal market.
Turning to the next slide and volume. With respect to volume, as shown on slide four, total shipments for the quarter
were up 4%, with robust growth in intermodal and merchandise offsetting an 8% decline in coal volume. Strong
volume growth within merchandise during the quarter was driven by gains in all five commodity groups.
Drilling down into our major markets, starting with coal. Revenue for the quarter was $641 million, down $16 million
or 2% for the quarter. Weaker demand across nearly all markets resulted in an overall volume decline of 8%. Utility
coal, which was the largest driver of the decline, was down nearly 20,000 carloads or 9%. Volumes in the North were
up an estimated 1% versus last year, while Southern utility volumes were down 18%. That was driven by continuing
competition from natural gas and excess stockpiles at Southern utilities.
Export shipments were down 8%, largely due to declines in steam coal at the Port of Baltimore, partially offset by
higher fourth quarter volumes at Lambert's Point in Norfolk, which increased by 13%.
In the domestic metallurgical coal segment, volume was down 14% for the quarter as a result of reduced demand from
our steel customers. But on a positive note, industrial coal increased 11% due to business gains.
Turning to our intermodal business, revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high of $618 million, up $34 million or
6% over fourth quarter 2012, driven by 6% higher volumes. Revenue per unit declined by 1% due to positive pricing
being offset by decreases in the fuel surcharge.
Volume gains in intermodal came from both our domestic and international markets. Domestic volume was up 7% due
to continued highway conversions, while organic growth across our international accounts boosted international
volume by 6%. Much of this growth moved in our expanded and enhanced intermodal corridors, running an efficient
double-stack train service.
Our highest performing sector in the fourth quarter was our merchandise group, which set a new revenue record of $1.6
billion, up $179 million or 12% over last year, driven by an 8% increase in volume, combined with a 4% higher
revenue per unit.
Metals and construction, our largest market segment, experienced a 1% increase in volume due primarily to increased
shipments of iron, steel and higher shipments of frac sand and miscellaneous construction materials. These gains were
somewhat tempered by lower aggregates volumes.
Moving to the agricultural market, which was up 6% in volume, increased corn and soybean volumes offset declines in
our feed markets. Corn shipments were up 23%, driven by increases in short-haul movements to Midwestern processors
and longer-haul volume to ethanol producers. A favorable export market also drove increased shipments of soybeans
over Gulf and Atlantic ports.
Our chemicals volume was up 22% for the quarter, continuing to benefit from strong growth in crude oil. Increased
shipments of natural gas liquids, industrial intermediates and plastics also boosted growth in this group.
Turning to automotive, volume was up 10%, more than double the projected North American vehicle production
increase for the quarter as a result of new business and increased production at plants we serve. And finally, paper
volumes were up 2%, with a 16% increase in lumber and a 13% increase in pulp volumes offset by declines in waste
and scrap materials.

Now, concluding with our outlook of 2014, we see growth opportunities ahead in our intermodal and merchandise
markets, while the coal market continues to present challenges and headwinds. While demand for electricity was up 2%
in the fourth quarter, 2014 demand is still expected to be sluggish, particularly in the South. In the export market, we
continue to expect a challenging environment with strong competition in the Atlantic metallurgical coal market and soft
demand and oversupply of thermal coal.
On the upside, our outlook for intermodal remains bright as we continue to add attractive freight to our new corridors
and terminals. The South Carolina Inland Port opened in the fourth quarter and our new Charlotte terminal officially
opened December 9. Highway conversions and growth with our international shipping partners represent ongoing
opportunities and we will remain strongly focused on delivering superior intermodal service and efficiencies across our
double-stack network.
In our merchandise markets, we anticipate continued strength in crude by rail, as well as shale-related liquid petroleum
gases. Frac sand shipments into the shale production regions should continue to grow as hydraulic fracturing
technology evolves and requires higher volumes of sand.
Within our metals markets, U.S. steel production is projected to expand by 5% during 2014, due to increased steel
usage in the auto sector and the recovering construction market. Automotive production will continue to see solid
growth as North American light vehicle production is projected to increase 3% in 2014.
And we expect growth opportunities ahead in both agriculture and forest products, as the larger crop and housing
recovery spur increased shipping activity throughout the year.
In summary, our market base diversity, high quality service and ongoing network investments continue to support
steady growth despite headwinds in the coal market. With respect to the overall value of our service product, we'll
continue to employ market-based pricing that equals or exceeds rail inflation to support ongoing investment both in our
infrastructure and service delivery capabilities. We'll also continue to focus on developing new markets and providing
the safest and most cost efficient service possible to all of our customers.
Thank you for your attention and I'll turn it over to Mark.
Mark D. Manion
Thank you, Don. Starting with safety performance, our personal injury performance for the fourth quarter stands at 1.28
and for the full year, 1.15. 2013 marked an important shift in our approach to safety improvement at Norfolk Southern.
Our operations managers and workforce have all attended behavior-based leadership training. And we've implemented
a new approach in behavior-based safety. We like the fact that we're seeing a more engaged workforce and while we
haven't reduced the number of overall injuries, we've seen an 11% drop in serious injuries.
Looking at our train accidents, we've seen a slight uptick in incidents to 2.4 per million train miles. These have been
related primarily to switching and storm-related occurrences earlier in the year. Crossing accidents for 2013 was down
slightly from the prior year at 3.5 per million train miles.
Moving on to service performance, our composite service metric reflects a consistently high performance through the
year. For 2013, the service composite was a best-ever 83.3%. In the fourth quarter, our service composite was 82.4%,
and reflects typical seasonal patterns with operations around the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, as well as
strong intermodal and unit train volumes. We continue to see very solid performance in fluid operations through the
period.
Turning to the next slide, continued high service performance is also reflected in train speed, a primary component of
network velocity. Train speed over the last couple of years has remained consistently at historically high levels. In the
fourth quarter, train speed averaged 23.8 miles an hour and for the full year, 23.9 miles an hour.

Moving on to terminal dwell, the second major component of network velocity, there again, we've sustained very high
levels of performance over the last couple of years. Terminal dwell in 2013 averaged 21.6 hours. The fourth quarter
was 21.9 hours, reflecting the normal seasonal variation due to curtailment of operations around the Christmas holiday
period.
In the fourth quarter, we saw efficiency gains in many of the same areas where we saw improvement throughout the
year. With volume increases, we were still able to reduce crew starts by 1% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full
year.
In the fourth quarter, merchandise shipments increased 8%, while crew starts increased only 2%. In Intermodal,
shipments increased 7%, while crew starts increased only 1%. In coal, both shipments and crew starts declined 8%.
T&E overtime hours increased only 1%, against a volume increase of 4% in the fourth quarter, and for the full year
with a volume increase of 3%, we were able to reduce overtime hours by 10%.
We continue to reduce re-crews by 5% in the fourth quarter versus the same time period last year, and we saw a
reduction of 9% for the full year. Taking advantage of existing train capacity for new volume growth, carloads per
locomotive improved 4% in the fourth quarter, consistent with the patterns we've seen most of the year. Fuel efficiency
in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by a colder December, but the general trend has been improving as
reflected in the 1% improvement for the full year, that's a trend we expect to continue going forward.
With strong network performance combined with a number of ongoing productivity initiatives, we fully expect to see in
excess of $100 million in productivity and leverage gains in 2014.
Thank you. And now, Marta, I'll turn it over to you.
Marta R. Stewart
All right. Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our fourth quarter financial results, which as we've mentioned, rounds out a
year of record performance. I'll close with an overview of the full year financials and discuss our capital spending plan
for 2014.
Slide two summarizes our quarterly operating results. Don reviewed the 7% revenue increase in detail and recall that it
was largely driven by a 4% improvement in volume. On the 4% unit growth, expenses rose only $30 million or 2%.
That leverage translated into record fourth quarter income from operations of $881 million, up 23%. The resulting
69.4% operating ratio improved 400 basis points.
The next slide shows the major components of the $30 million net increase in expenses. Compensation and benefits
drove most of the increase and fuel costs were also higher. However, lower expenses for purchased services partly
offset the increases.
Now, let's take a closer look at each of these categories. Compensation cost rose by $35 million or 5%. The first couple
of items continue the trends seen in the prior three quarters of the year. Higher pay rates increased expenses by $14
million, while reduced employee activity levels lowered cost by $10 million. Much of this is directly related to the crew
start to volume relationship that Mark discussed with you.
The third item, higher incentive compensation, reflects the $22 million increase in bonus accrual driven by the strong
fourth quarter results. For 2014, we expect the wage rate and labor hour trends to continue. Additionally, we expect
lower accruals for pension and post-retirement medical liability. This is largely due to a combination of strong equity
returns which increased the plan assets and the higher discount rate which reduced the plan liability. This will result in
approximately $25 million of lower quarterly accruals in 2014 versus 2013.
Moving on to fuel expense, it rose by a net of $8 million or 2%. As Mark mentioned, the increase in consumption
exceeded our traffic volume increase and was largely due to the colder weather, offsetting the unfavorable consumption
with a lower price. The average price paid per gallon was $3.02 this fourth quarter versus $3.24 in the fourth quarter of
2012. Depreciation expense was flat for the quarter as lower equipment rates resulting from a depreciation study

completed in 2013 offset the effects of a higher capital base. `Going forward, we expect depreciation in 2014 to return
to a more normalized increase of about $10 million a quarter.
Slide seven addresses the $12 million or 3% decline in purchased services and rents. Most of the reduction was due to
last year's $15 million charge for an accident that occurred on Conrail in November of 2012. The remaining variances
in this category were small with increases in volume related costs, but decreases in roadway repair costs and legal and
consulting fees.
The materials and other categories showed on the next slide was basically flat. Higher mechanical materials expenses
and smaller miscellaneous expenses were more than offset by $22 million of favorable development in the accruals for
prior year injury claims. As you know, we have experienced a net favorable development in recent quarters in our
actuarially-determined casualty claims expenses.
While we may see additional favorable development in the coming quarters, we do not expect it to the extent seen in
the past several quarters. As a result, total expenses for casualties and other claims in 2014, will likely be closer to the
levels we saw in 2012.
Turning to our non-operating items. Increased returns from corporate and life insurance were largely offset by reduced
coal royalties, a result of lower coal production. Interest expense on debt was up $8 million, due to increased
borrowings.
Next, income taxes totaled $270 million and the effective tax rate was 34.5% compared to 33.5% in 2012. 2012
included a $6 million benefit related to the completion of an IRS examination. Additionally, both periods benefited
from state tax adjustments that we do not expect to recur. Therefore, looking forward, the effective rate in 2014 will
likely be close to the combined federal and state statutory rate of about 37.5%.
Wrapping up our quarterly overview, net income and EPS comparisons are displayed on slide 11. Both measures set
fourth quarter records. Net income was $513 million, an increase of $100 million or 24%. Diluted earnings per share
were $1.64, up $0.34 per share or 26%.
Focusing next on the full year results. Revenues were up 2% while operating expenses rose only 1%. This resulted in
income from railway operations up $3.3 billion, a 4% increase, which generated a 70 basis point improvement in the
operating ratio to an all-time annual record of 71.0%.
Net income for the year, shown on slide 13, was $1.91 billion. Excluding the large land sale in the first quarter, net
income would have been about $1.85 billion, up 6% and earnings per share would have been $5.85, an increase of 9%.
As shown on the next slide, cash from operations covered capital spending and produced $1.1 billion in free cash flow.
We distributed $637 million in dividends and applied $627 million towards the repurchase of 8.3 million shares. Cash
and short-term investments totaled $1.6 billion at year end.
We have concluded a record year, with a strong balance sheet and full confidence in our outlook, which is a great segue
into our 2014 capital spending highlights. Here we show historical and budgeted capital expenditures. The 2014 total of
$2.2 billion is a 12% increase over 2013 and about even with 2012 and 2011.
As reflected on the following slide and similar to previous years, the majority of our capital expenditures, roughly
two-thirds, will be invested in replacement and core projects. This includes improving the condition of the roadway,
rebuilding locomotives and replacing freight cars and other equipment.
A quarter of the budget, reflected here in green, supports traffic growth or productivity projects, including additional
locomotives, as well as yard and siding expansions. The remaining 10% of the budget will be spent on positive train
control.
A more detailed listing of the categories is shown on slide 17. Our capital plan was constructed to maintain the safety
and quality of the network, to improve service and operational efficiencies and to support business growth. Thank you
and I'll now turn the program back to Wick.

Charles Wick Moorman
Thanks, Marta. As you've heard, Norfolk Southern punctuated 2013 with an excellent fourth quarter, with strong
volume and revenue increases even in the face of continuing declines in our coal franchise. The real story of 2013, was
the ability of our team to run the railroad at a sustained high velocity, providing superior service for our customers and
at the same time delivering continued operating efficiencies.
While the extreme weather conditions we've seen in January have slowed the entire North American rail network, we
are confident in our ability to drive further productivity and service improvements in the months ahead.
Looking ahead, it certainly seems like the economy may be improving at a somewhat faster pace than we saw in 2013.
As Don told you, the outlook for most of our business segments is good, but coal still remains the wildcard.
Regardless of the near-term forecast for any of the markets we serve, we do remain very confident that the strength of
our franchise and our long-term strategy of providing excellent service at rates that enable us to reinvest in the business
and provide excellent returns for our shareholders. Marta described one part of that strategy in terms of our 2014 capital
budget, where we're investing to grow the business, as well as maintain all of our assets in top-class condition.
Another part of that strategy was illustrated yesterday with the announcement that we're raising our dividend by $0.02
per share. A strong indication of the confidence that we and our board have in our ability to execute our plans for
growth. That confidence springs from our belief in the strength of the Norfolk Southern team, who are the best in the
business. And we believe that our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results are just one more indication of why they are
the best.
Thanks and we'll open it up now for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes
from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi, there, good morning.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Don, can I ask you to sort of offer a little bit more clarity on your comments as you look forward
because we had a good – good fourth quarter trends and we've had some weather here starting out in the first quarter.
So when we look at the January trends, do you feel like the underlying improvements are consistent with the kind of
strength we saw on the fourth quarter? I'm just curious kind of how to think about some of these calendar effects and
weather and what the underlying outlook really is.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Bill. The first two weeks of January have been weaker because of the
weather. We've seen about a 22% jump in our volumes in the next week after those first two weeks, the third week. So
we think volumes are going to be fine. We will make up most of the business or all of the business that was deferred
because of the first two weeks of bad weather. So I feel pretty good about the ongoing volumes in the merchandise and
intermodal business. As I indicated, I'm not so robust or optimistic with respect to coal.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. And then on that point, as we start to renegotiate utility contracts, the rail industry,
generally, has been very disciplined on price there. Do we feel like these next round of negotiations, given where
natural gas prices are, given the concerns longer term on regulation or what not, do the utilities have a lot more
leverage here, such that we need to be thinking about there may have to be some give-backs, if you will, so to speak on
price, i.e., not as much upside left there?

<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, Bill, the market continues to evolve and certainly gas is competing with coal more
effectively. We'll take that into account as we address our contract renegotiations. We have only about 16% of our
utility book this year under renegotiation to complete by the end of the year. We're engaged with those discussions now
and as we always do, we take into account current market factors and market conditions as we re-price.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. Thank you so much for the time.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You bet. Thank you.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning. Thank you. Actually, I wanted to ask a question about crude by rail and the
concerns surrounding the composition of Bakken crude and its low flashpoint characteristics. And given that Norfolk is
a connecting carrier, what is really in your control in terms of taking some extra safety precautions in order to avoid an
accident? And are you in active discussions or working with the originating carriers to implement any additional
procedures?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, Allison, the entire industry, quite clearly, is focused on this. So we're in very
active discussions across the North American railroad industry as to how best to manage this growing business. And
we're also very clearly in discussions with the producers and with the regulators.
So there are really three, I think, central issues that we're talking about. The first is, of course, the safety of rail
operations. The railroads have a great safety story. Our numbers have consistently gotten better over the past 20 years
now. There's always more we can do and we're looking at different operating practices, possibly doing some things on
speed and routing and we'll continue to work hard on making it a safer operation, not only for Norfolk Southern, but for
all of the carriers.
The second thing that I think there's a lot of discussion about is what you mentioned and that is, excuse me, what
exactly are the characteristics of the crude that's coming out of the Bakken. It's certainly more volatile than we
originally thought, than any of us originally thought and I know that the regulators are very concerned with that and
taking a hard look at it.
And then the third issue is the tank car issue and what is the appropriate safety standard for the tank cars that will be
transporting not only the crude oil, but ethanol and other substances. In addition, there's a new standard the industry
voluntarily adopted in 2011 and the cars that have been built since that time are to this newer safer standard. But there's
clearly going to be an evolution there in terms of what's the ultimate tank car design for these kinds of materials. And
there is a lot of work under way on the part of not only the rails, but the car owners, our customers and the leasing
companies as well to come up with that new standard and to understand exactly what we'll do with the cars that are out
there now.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. That's a very comprehensive answer, thanks. Just as a – my follow-up question, how
much latent volume upside do you believe that Norfolk has related to the housing recovery and some expected
improvement in the non-resi construction market?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The housing market is a bright spot for 2014. We expect starts to be up in the range of 23%,
24%. There's a strong multiplier effect to that market as it expands. Obviously, I mentioned our lumber traffic was up
16% in the fourth quarter. But we also see plastics, polyvinyl fluoride on the chemicals side, PVC pipe going into
housing, roofing granules for roofing. There's a range of commodities that we transport that are favorably impacted by
that increase in housing starts.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. Any volume sort of magnitude that you could place on that?

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a question on the coal side if I could – your Eastern
competitor mentioned roughly a 20% decline in their outlook for export coal; and obviously, they're a little bit more
heavier in the thermal market. I just wanted to get a rough sense of how you think, Don, about the outlook for 2014,
specifically on the export side of coal?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning. We completed the year with about, right at 29 million tons of export coal, of
which 80% was metallurgical and 20%, roughly, was thermal coal. We all watch the API 2 Index with respect to export
thermal coal. We know it's not strong. We know U.S. producers face cost of production challenges participating in that
lower priced market. And also, we're seeing some challenges with respect to the met coal exports from the U.S. as well,
because of the low settled price that U.S. producers are facing. So, we don't expect our export market to be as strong in
2014, as it was in 2013.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. And order of magnitude, because that sound like that's – yeah, I guess it's a little bit
more weighted to the thermal side, so that would make sense. I guess maybe my follow-up question would just be on
understanding sort of the dynamic within coal yields specifically. So obviously, if you add back the liquidated damages
benefit that you got in the quarter, it seems like yields were roughly flat from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Is
that the right way to think about it? It doesn't sound like you have a lot of exposure on the utility side in 2014 and I
guess exports are going to be what they are, just was curious kind of how we should be thinking about that.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: In the quarter itself, the $15 million liquidated damage accrual, if we deducted that, instead of
a 7% increase in revenue per unit, we would have had a 4% increase in revenue per unit and that was driven off
favorable longer-haul export volumes to the Port of Norfolk that I mentioned.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. And going forward, I guess we'll have to see how the mix persists, but I guess the way
utility contracts are working, there's nothing that should change materially on that as we roll into 2014 at least?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: That's true.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.

<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, a question for Wick. At the end of the prepared remarks, you talked about the
economy gaining steam. I just wanted to potentially get a little bit more color from you on what that was predicated on.
Obviously, we've seen strong numbers from the ISM, housing starts are supposed to be up this year, but I think we all
know that just because the economic data looks good, doesn't necessarily mean it will be good.
So curious if you're getting this from customer conversations, that you're expecting CapEx across the board to be up or
if this is more based on just kind of the same dashboard stuff that we're all looking at? So any color would be really
helpful.

<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I think it's a couple of things, Justin. I think one is we all do look at the same
dashboards and there we certainly see – Don mentioned all of these things, some continued strength in auto. I think the
steel manufacturers feel a little better about next year. Certainly, housing is going to get better. The pace is still to be
determined. So all of those factors weigh into it. And I think the other thing that just kind of makes us feel a little better
about the direction of the economy is as we look at our second half volumes and really, to some extent, our fourth
quarter volumes as compared to the first half 2013.
I would tell you in the first half 2013, we were less sure about the economy and as the year went on, we felt better
about a lot of our business segments and we don't see anything on the horizon right now, particularly because it does
seem to be, knock on wood, a little quieter in Washington, that might provide a serious drag for that.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: All right. That's fair. One question, just as a follow-up on the intermodal markets, you really
haven't talked about that much. RPU was actually down year-over-year for you guys. Curious, it looks like your
competitor is starting to see a little bit of resurgence in their domestic business, with on-highway conversions being
better.
Curious how you guys think about Eastern intermodal market share and how you'd rate the fourth quarter performance
from your standpoint. And when you think about the competitive dynamic in 2014, do you think it's getting tougher or
are you guys still confident that with all the investments you've made, you'll still have the premier domestic network?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Hi, good morning. It's the latter. We remain confident with the investments, the network that
we have developed, the new terminals, the services and products that we've launched and also the capability of
providing a high quality product, service product that's truly competitive with the highway.
Our growth is going to come from the highway, it's coming from the highway. That will continue. And with respect to
the revenue per unit, as I mentioned in the quarter, the fuel surcharge actually was the largest driver of the 1% decline,
revenue was up 6%. We still believe that the trucking industry will face some capacity constraints in the face of hours
of service regulations, as well as as the economy ramps up and demand increases, that capacity won't be as available as
it is today. So the outlook for intermodal, in our view, in terms of coordinated conversion from the highway into a
highly efficient network that we've invested in remains very bright.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: So you think that, I mean, obviously, I don't want you to speak for them, but do you think
that their surge in traffic was probably more driven by more loads getting converted to the rail or did you guys feel like
you had any high profile losses around the margin in the quarter from a customer standpoint?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: In every quarter, you have to look at the comps from the previous year and the Sandy effect,
it all impacted volumes and increases throughout the Eastern network in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Fair enough. Thanks for the time, guys. I appreciate it.

<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: So, wanted to just follow-up briefly on part of Justin's last question. Your Crescent
Corridor, maybe if you could just tell me how much Crescent Corridor volumes grew in fourth quarter.
And then, I guess in terms of the pace that we had seen in the last couple of quarters, it maybe hadn't been quite as
strong a contributor to overall intermodal volume growth as we had anticipated given the capacity investment. Is that
something when you look to 2014 that you would say Crescent Corridor is going to be a bigger driver of your overall

intermodal volume growth?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Tom. This is Don. With respect to your first part of your question, in the
quarter, Crescent was up 6%, for the year, it was up 8%. Heartland was up 9% in the fourth quarter, for the year it was
up 16%. So you can see, that gives you a flavor of the percentage increases.
And as we have pointed out, as we've invested in high efficiency service, competitive with the highway, we're being
very focused with respect to the business we're bringing on in these corridors to ensure that this business pays for itself
and generates the type of return that we're seeking with the investments that we've made.
So, we're not looking to load up the network in one to two or three quarters. What we are looking for is good, high
quality freight that we will continue to handle over time. Does that make sense?
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yes, sure. That's great. That's very helpful. And I guess that my follow-up would also
probably be for you Don. Your yield performance, revenue per car can often be affected by mix. I think of the 2013
yields, there was probably some mix effect in coal, in short-haul growth and things like that and maybe some other mix
effects and also export. How would you – how would you want us to think about the mix effect and also the impact
from export coal pricing as we forecast yields in 2014?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Tom, as I pointed out earlier, we expect lower export volumes in 2014. With respect to
overall export, we think the thermal component will be weaker. We also think the met coal component will be weaker
as well. And the market, the market hopefully is at a bottom with respect to world prices in that $135 to $140 range,
actually a little lower than that right now on met coal. The API 2 is $85 or less. It's bouncing around $85 a ton. So, with
those dynamics, we think export will – we are where we are on pricing. I will tell you that, we're not planning to make
any adjustments this quarter in export pricing. But with respect to overall demand, we see a softer outlook there.
Hopefully, with the weather that we are seeing, stockpiles in the South on our utility network, we'll normalize. And we
think that's under way, not there yet, but it's under way. That is longer-haul, higher RPU traffic. So if we get some
replenishment of stockpiles in the South, that would be a favorable mix impact as export is softer.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. So mix and export would be or I guess export impact on yield would be negative,
maybe on utility it's positive and then I guess overall mix effect, do you want to comment on that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The overall mix effect, we think in merchandise, will continue to be comparable to what
we're seeing right now, no significant changes. We will continue to see our non-coal energy component of our business
increase and that includes everything from crude oil to natural gas liquids, to ethanol, to frac sand, things that we're
putting into that bucket, which I will tell you, Tom, in the fourth quarter and for the year is close to 10% of our
merchandise business, our volume now.

<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations. I wanted to go back to crude by rail, maybe
if you could speak to what you see as your capacity to expand that, could you double the business for example based on
current resources? And then I have a follow up question on your potential regional railroad partners for crude by rail?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well. In terms of capacity, the vast majority of this crude moves across our Northern
region, which is for the most part, double or triple-track, it's a very high capacity railroad. So we certainly have the
infrastructure to expand. We can accommodate it with the crew base that we have. So we have a lot of room to grow.

The ultimate limitation on crude by rail for – in the East really is, just purely the number of refineries. And there are, as
you know, a number of refineries from Delaware, up the coast, all the way to Nova Scotia, I guess. And a lot of them
are already taking crude by rail, there are others that are preparing too, in terms of infrastructure. But that's the
limitation and that will be the cap on the total crude by rail that moves in across Norfolk Southern, or for that matter,
moves across the Eastern part of the U.S.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Certainly. And then as a follow-up, do you do any business with regional railroads and I'm
thinking about it in the context of some of these regulatory changes, that may ultimately change the liability aspect of
that. Until you expand so many smaller regional railroads, you might not be able to handle it because of that. Is there
any interaction with regional railroads, where we should worry about maybe there are liability risk if the regulatory
environment does change?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: All right. And you're talking about interaction in terms of the crude business?
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Exactly.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: The answer is not really. The crude by rail that we handle as far as I'm aware, I'm
looking at Mark, we don't hand it off to – really don't hand it off to anyone. It's – it moves Norfolk Southern direct or
moves into the shared assets area.

The next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Yeah, thanks very much. Congratulations, everyone. Just quick question, just follow-up on
intermodal. It looks like, I know you pointed toward an improving economy, you pointed toward the trucking capacity
constraints. All of that has suggested that things should – the environment should get better in 2014, particularly from a
competitive environment with truck. But am I right in assuming that you haven't seen that yet, the impact of that tighter
capacity on truck in that better economy playing itself out in contract re-pricing that you're doing in intermodal today?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Walter. On spot pricing, yes. On our contract pricing that tends to run
year-to-year, no. We are in that period in the first 90 days of this year. So we will see some of that playing out in our
current negotiations. As you know, on spot, we see that fairly immediately. But with a lot of our intermodal business
being under commitments for at least one year, this is an active time for re-pricing of that intermodal business in the
first quarter.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: But is it safe to say that the spot trend is a good leading indicator to how your contracts are
going to develop?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Certainly the spot trend is positive. I cannot tell you that it's going to translate into contracts,
because we're facing motor carrier competition. And before we convert it, they attempt to hold on to it.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Yeah. Makes sense. Okay. And the second question here, I don't know if it's mainly for Mark
or Marta, Mark the employee count, I'm looking back on my notes, what you were kind of indicating toward the end of
the year when we spoke at third quarter, it looks like it came in a little bit better than what you had kind of indicated.
As we go into 2014, how do you see the seasonality and the – accounting for all the seasonality and all that? How do
you see the employee count kind of evolving as we go through 2014?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, we have had a pretty good reduction during 2013 and as we go forward, I think we'll
stay relatively flat. The – we got a couple of areas where we will, just because of the various efficiencies and
productivity initiatives that are going on, we'll continue to see some reduction, but of course, particularly with respect
to our T&E forces, all that is very dependent on what the volumes are. So relatively flat.

<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. And on the wage inflation side, Marta, you'd indicated that we should still see the
same level of trends, although perhaps not as much on the kind of incentive compensation and so forth. In other words,
are we looking at just base wage inflation now as we project into 2014 or are there other factors which we should
consider?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Yes, the wage inflation should be about the same. There will be a union wage increase in the
middle of the year as there was this year. And the portion I spoke to was the reduction in pension and post-retirement
medical costs, we think those will be down as a result of our plans being in a better-funded position this year.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. But offsetting some of these stock-based compensation lift that we might not see the
same kind of growth next year?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, we really think the incentive compensation in the quarter was heavy, but
year-over-year annualized should be about the same.

<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Yeah. Good morning, guys. I want to go back to your commentary on your crew starts. It looks
like they were down 1%, I think you said in 4Q, but 3% for the year. So, should we expect that 1% level to continue or
is that going to be challenging as we see volumes grow?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We certainly have got more of a challenge just because we've got a real winter this year. So,
that will have an effect in the short term. Beyond that, I don't know that we'll see some of the steep rate of reduction
that we saw in 2013. But again, with some of the various improvements we've got going on into 2014, I think we'll still
continue to see a positive trend.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. And following up on some of the intermodal questions, you mentioned that you're seeing,
Don, some improvement, I think on the spot. I don't think I caught it. Could you remind us what percent you guys have
that's more spot or transactional in nature and how quickly do you think you could react to sort of a tightening
truckload market to bring your existing spot rates up?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Jason. Most of our business is committed. I would say the spot is in the range
of 15% of the book.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. And you can change that spot pretty quickly?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, not really. That percentage continues in a fairly stable way. It's not changeable, because
we have commitments [indiscernible] (54:41).
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: No, what I'm saying is, the spot price that you have is very fluid in terms of the current
marketplace.

Your next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks and good morning. Mark, first question for you, I was wondering if you could provide an
update on where things stand on the implementation of both LEADER and Movement Planner? And also, as you think
about your $100 million plus productivity target for 2014, how much of that amount is coming from those two items?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, as far as both LEADER and Movement Planner, Movement Planner is scheduled to be
completed by the end of 2014. So we'll see a pretty rapid roll out of essentially the last half of our system this year, that
will be very good. LEADER, we will get most of the system, the core part of the system covered with LEADER in
2014. And then once we get it covered, we will continue to see and it's going to take us well beyond 2014,w e will
continue to see benefits from LEADER as we get better and better at turning on the benefits from that technology.
As far as the amount of benefit we're getting out of that, we've got so many things at play and I would be taking – I
would really be taking a wild guess at that, which I would rather not do. But substantial benefits from both of those.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Great. That's fair. And as a follow-up, I was just wondering if you strip out the lower level
of rail inflation that it sounds like we're seeing, have you seen any changes in the overall core pricing environment in
the past three to six months? And could you just talk about your expectations for pricing headed into 2014?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: This is Don. No changes in the pricing environment. I will say that if the economy continues
to gain traction. We believe that that environment will become more favorable. And obviously, we'll participate in the
market and price to the market as we always do.

Your next question is from the line Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Good morning. Thanks. This question is for Marta. Your cash balance has been steadily
increasing, obviously, you announced an increased dividend yesterday. But it would certainly seem you have potential
to do a lot more on the capital front. And would just appreciate your thoughts about how you're thinking about free
cash flow allocation during the year? Thanks.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, we really haven't changed our overall approach to free cash flow allocation. We
always – we invest in the business, we talk about our capital program and after that we return to shareholders in a form
of dividends and share repurchases. And so really, part of the reason for our increase in cash balance after the end of
the year is we did an opportunistic debt issuance in November. We wanted to go ahead and take advantage of the low
rates. So that's partly why you see a little bit higher than we've run in the past.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: That's fair. But the net debt level is actually still decreasing and I guess another way of me to sort
of inquire is just the minimum cash – do you have a minimum cash level that you would like to maintain or a minimum
debt ratio that you're sort of targeting?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Yes, we target to stay within our credit ratings band and that's one of the reasons why we
went ahead and issued the debt. And so we just try to modulate, make sure we've got plenty of cash to invest in the
business and still stay within there. And you're right that net, if you take our debt minus our cash right now, we're
running a little bit lower. It's not intentional deleveraging, it's just the offshoot of the fact that we have very strong free
cash flow during the year.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Okay. Thanks. And, Don, can I just ask you about the comment on new business gains within the

<Q - Thomas Kim>: Sorry. Let me ask it more clearly. Earlier, you'd mentioned that you had won some new business
within the coal segment and related to industrial. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that. Was it share shift
or were there – was there something else going on, new development, new plant or what not?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No. This is coal increases with some of our industrial accounts like the paper industry, like
the cement industry where they are using more coal and coal is more competitive now with natural gas. And also
they're seeing increased production and usage of coal.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: So they're not new customers coming on, it's just organic growth with existing customers?

The next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First question was to ask Don
perhaps to dig a little deeper into the Southeastern utility coal situation. First of all, do you have any timetable as to
when those stockpiles might be normalized? Is that a 2014 event or do you see that happening more in the 2015 or
beyond time period? And then once they are normalized, will the replenishment come from Central App mines or more
likely from the Illinois Basin mines? And if from the Illinois Basin mines, what type of a favorable mix impact would
that have on RPU?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, John. First part of your question with respect to Southern utility stockpiles,
our best estimate is that that normalization of stockpiles will take most of the first half into the third quarter, depending
upon, obviously, continued weather patterns that we're getting, which are favorable. The second thing, with respect to
the basins, that's a good question. We see more coal flowing to the south from Illinois Basin sourcing and some
Northern App sourcing flowing to the south as well. Central App will continue to be pressured in our view, with respect
to sourcing into the South, just from a cost of production perspective and being competitive.
Now I will say that with gas still being in the range of $4 to $4.50 right now, even though we're having a real winter, as
Mark pointed out, gas continues to be competitive in the Southern utilities and in the North as well, but our volumes
down 18% in the fourth quarter tells you that gas is still very, very much a factor in the Southern network.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: But with the shift from, say, Central App more towards Illinois Basin or Northern App,
presumably when things do ramp up to replenish those ultimately reduced stockpiles, that should have a positive impact
on your yield in the coal business?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: John, that's correct. It will be longer-haul, most likely higher revenue per unit coal, flowing
from those new origination points. It all depends on how much coal they actually take from those new sources.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thank you. And then as a follow-on, we normally on these calls don't talk about what's
happening down at the STB, except with respect to maybe the reciprocal switching proposal. But there are a couple of
rate cases there, currently, that involve Norfolk Southern. One is the DuPont case and there's a smaller one, the Sunbelt
case. How long do you think it will be before those cases are resolved and how do you characterize the risk associated
with those cases?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: This is Wick. We don't normally comment a lot on anything that's up at the STB. We
clearly feel that we have a strong position for the rates that we charge. I think the timetable is such that those cases both
should be resolved in 2014. So we'll just see how that comes out.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Hey. Good morning, guys. A quick question on the E&P fleet, wondering if you can
give us a size of the fleet to end 2013 and provide any context to what the expansion plans would be for 2014,
specifically the number of container net adds in 2014. Thanks.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning. The approximate size of the fleet, we're around 29,000 containers in the
combined fleet. And we expect that to expand by about 2,500 boxes.

Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys. So first one for Don, just on coal. So the rise in gas prices we've
seen and obviously the cold start to weather, do you think that's having more of an impact on Northern or Southern
utilities as we think about mix there going forward?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Certainly, the temperatures in the North have been pretty intense. But they have in the South
as well and they are, as we speak this morning. But I would have to say that the stockpile impacting the North is greater
at this point than the South. If we continue to see this weather pattern for the balance of the winter and have a favorable
shoulder period through April going into May, I would say that the South will have their turn in it as well.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Right. But it sounds like we should think about Northern coal – coal going to the Northern
utilities better, at least for now, at least the next couple of quarters than going to the South?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: That's a correct statement. The Northern utilities that we serve, the stockpiles are at normal.
They're normalized now. So they're facing this increased generation demand. So they will have to replenish fuel
supplies. In the South, we still have the excess stockpile overhang. So even with some increased demand, the overall
fuel supply in inventory is better.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just one for I guess either Mark or Marta, so the PTC budget for
2014 is pretty similar with 2013. Once we get through 2014, how much is left and are you on track to have your stuff
finished by 2015?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We're going to have, as far as the hardware that's installed, we're going to have everything
pretty well in place by 2018 and then we'll have continuing training efforts and those type things that I expect will take
us out to 2020. And then I think it's fair to say for everybody it remains to be seen what the reliability of these really
complex systems are going out beyond 2020.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So you are expecting the mandate to get pushed out by three years?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, it's hard to know just what's going to happen in Washington, but I can tell you that
from the standpoint of what is possible, we're not going to be ready in 2015. I think that's pretty clear to everybody.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: The laws of physics prevail in things like this. So – and even the FRA has
acknowledged that there's going to have to be a several-year extension.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: And you think that, sorry to follow up, but you think that's still likely to get a full three years
even given some of the safety issues we've seen over the summer and winter?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, as I said, there is just the simple fact that we and not only we, the North
American rail industry is not going to complete this project by the end of 2015 and it will take several years after that to

conclude it. There are still substantial parts of this technology that are not tested. We will have a lot of issues to deal
with, even after we get the software completed, which it's not and the hardware all installed, which obviously it's not.
We're also dealing, as you know, with an issue right now within the government, where we can't get the FCC to give us
permission to put the antennas up that we require and there are tens of thousands of those. So it's just a situation where
the facts are the facts and it's going to take some substantial amount of time beyond 2015 to get this system up. And
more importantly, as Mark said, to get it working at a level of reliability where the industry could continue to function.

The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Hi, good morning. Congratulations on the – as John said, thank you for taking my question.
A quick question for Marta and then a follow-up on coal. Marta, is cash flow, free cash flow probably going to be about
neutral this year versus next year when I take into account any earnings gains, higher depreciation and lower pension
offset by the higher CapEx or is there something on the non-cash side I should be thinking of?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: We never know about some of the non-operating items. But with regard to free cash flow, I
think the most significant difference is the one we described today is that we think we're going to have about $200
million higher of CapEx and that's – other than that, with normal operations.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Right. But your earnings should grow, your depreciation, which is non-cash – or non-cash
expense is higher and your pension should be lower or the contribution is not going to track with the lower expense you
talked about.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: The pension is – we don't have a – and we haven't had – require contribution and so the
pension is a non-cash item also.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay, very good.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: That doesn't flow through.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. Quick question on, a follow-up on the coal. Just given where the heating degree days
are in your North and Midwest regions, I understand your trepidation on the export side, but I am a little surprised
you're not a little more optimistic on domestic coal. Can you differentiate, and I know we focused a lot on the Southern
region where the utilities are still an issue and there's more gas competition, but could you talk a little bit more about
your expectations for domestic thermal volumes next year versus maybe pricing or customer discussions, because it
would seem to me, given what I'm seeing, that the domestic coal story would be a little bit better than you seem to be
implying?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: It's a good question. Let me put a little bit more color around thermal coal. If you look
sequentially in our tonnage from the third or to the fourth quarter, we're down about 2 million tons in utility coal. And
year-over-year for the entire year, our utility business was almost 5 million tons, a little more than 4 million tons. So
we're at 97 million tons of utility coal.
We do not see a dynamic out far enough in 2014 to indicate that, that will stabilize or that is going to be equal to that 97
million tons at this point. Even with the weather we're having right now, we're only seeing this as a snapshot in the first
three weeks of the year. There are a lot of question marks obviously about what we will see for the balance of the year,
but the dynamics – the competitive dynamics between coal and natural gas are such that we're not comfortable
providing any outlook that says that utility book at 97 million tons will stay at 97 million tons. We just don't think it
will.

Your next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Marta, congrats on the new role. Mark, just a question on the plan
that you talked about. You talked about rolling out the last few quarters, they've renewed – is this a renewed attack on
safety and service that you're addressing with new programs? And just as an aside, you saw dwell climb a touch, but
crew starts and re-crew and cars per unit all improving, is that a mix issue in terms of seeing the dwell decline a bit?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: It's Mark. Ken, good morning. As far as our safety process goes, we are about really three
years into this, two in a big way, where we've had the workforce engaged, and like I said, we've had a lot of work that
went on in 2013, just as far as education in the process, both on the management side and our 24,000 workforce
population. And it is really, the core of it is all about engagement of our people, our people understanding how
important they are to the business, creating an environment where they want to come forward with their ideas,
participate in problem solving, improving the business, finding ways to be safer. So, it is definitely geared towards our
safety process, but it really touches on all aspects of the business.
So, we're kind of in the beginning throes of this, but it is a, this will be ongoing forever, and we hope to see just a lot of
good things not only from a safety standpoint, but for the business in general, as our people get more and more
engaged.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: And thoughts on the dwell time, is that a mix – related to that?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: As far as terminal dwell, we saw a good improvement during 2013 and we have got a pretty
large project relative to improvement in our terminals. And so far, we've only been through a pretty small number of
those terminals with this project, of course, we're starting with our biggest terminals. But we've been through maybe
20% of our terminals so far, and as we continue to see overall improvement in efficiencies in the terminals, we think
that it will have an effect on lowering the dwell time. And again, this is hooked up with our behavioral leadership
project and engagement of people, it all works together. So we think we'll see improvement in that area, hard to know
how much though, Ken.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Thanks. And then, Don, for a follow-up on the ag business. Just given the bumper crop, do
you look for volumes to accelerate into 2014 or are inventory levels being replenished and this is a good run rate for the
fourth quarter?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You know in the ag market, there are puts and takes in it. There was a strong crop, obviously,
of corn and soybeans, but that's the good news. The not so good news is it was a strong crop in close proximity to the
Southeastern feed mills and a lot of that corn and soybean product will be trucked to those local mills, displacing
longer-haul corn and soybeans that would have moved from the Midwest had the Southeastern crop not been as strong.
So we'll have to work through that supply and we will as the year progress and then we'll see Midwestern grains start
moving at a higher volume. So, if you put it all together, it should be a much better market than it was last year, but it
won't be as robust as one would think, just based on the overall production numbers.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great insight. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.

Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. Good morning. Marta, concerning use of cash, I see a budget of about 10% of
total 2014 investment for PTC and about the same for facilities in terminals. I won't ask what part of PTC investment
you're most excited about, but could you highlight a couple of the major facilities investments you think will bear the
most fruit?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, and Mark can maybe talk about this a little bit more than me, but we're having major
expansion under way at our Bellevue Yard, which is really going to help with the flow of operations in the Northeast
and that's one of the portions of that, that I'm most excited about. Mark?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: No, that's absolutely right. And we're going to pretty much conclude that project by the end
of this year. Ever since we were fortunate enough to get the Conrail portion of our network integrated with the rest of
the old Norfolk Southern, that is just an area where our business wants to go. It wants to go into that Upper Ohio area.
And so this will allow for a lot of efficiencies, just being able to handle that business in that area in a more productive
way.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: And the second question. Now that your quarterly 10% growth in auto-related volume
was substantially better than market growth, in fact it's about double light vehicle product growth, could you add some
details to the sources of that growth?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning. Number one, we had production at the plants that we serve growing ahead of
the market. And obviously, Ford Motor Company would be one of those customers. Toyota is another one of those
customers, Honda being another one of those customers, et cetera. So, that's number one. And number two, we've had
some market share gains as well, as we compete with Holloway in terms of over the road movement of vehicles in that
network as well.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Alliance Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hi, good morning, guys. Don, the 97 million tons of coal that you guys are – utility coal
that you guys have done for 2013. What percentage of that would be utility North versus South?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning. It's a fairly balanced portfolio with about half of the business in the North on
a tonnage basis, and about half maybe in the South. Although, I will tell you that our percentage declines in the South
are eroding that balance, to where the North now is a little bit heavier than the South. I can't give you the actual
percentages off the top of my head, but traditionally, it has been about an equal portfolio. But with the type of – with
Northern utility, for example, being flat essentially for the fourth quarter in a year, and the South being down in the
fourth quarter as much as 18%, that balance has changed.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right. So the mix is now more heavily Northern then, right?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Slightly.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. And then and, Marta, perhaps, could you help us out with some guidance for
what should be it good, like the tax rate for 2014 and also a cash tax rate for 2014?

<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Yes, we think we'll have about a 37.5% effective rate for 2014. And on cash taxes, we don't
have bonus depreciation coming up and so we think the cash taxes will be higher in 2014.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Any dollar value or percentage number higher that you could help us out with?

The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah, good morning, everyone and thanks for getting my question in here. I'm just
going to ask one and it's probably for Wick or Marta, but you've had two quarters now of pretty solid year-on-year
operating ratio improvement. And when you talk about $100 million of productivity gains targeted this year; plus,
Marta, I think if I heard you right, you said $25 million less pension expense per quarter. So that's another $100 million
of pension reduction? Is the OR improvement sustainable in 2014, what are some of the offsets that investors should be
thinking about?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: I'll let Wick handle the general question, but I did want to point out, we do have that $25
million reduction and that's pension and post-retirement together. And then we have $10 million of depreciation per
quarter that we think is going to be higher. I did want to mention that. And I also mentioned on the casualties and other
expenses that we think run rate year-over-year, those will be higher. So about $10 million a quarter. So the three of
those that I mentioned, somewhat wash and I'll let Wick handle the overall question about our OR.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, clearly, as we've always been, we're focused on trying to take the OR down
further. We think that – we're optimistic that with a better business climate in 2014 and even with what we do expect,
as Don has said, to be some continued pressure on our coal volumes even over 2013, that we'll be able to produce better
business results. We're very happy with the productivity improvements that Mark and his team have outlined. And so,
our goal every year is to drive the operating ratio down further and that's certainly our goal for 2014 and we'll just have
to see where we end up. But we think that there are a lot of positives looking at the year that we'll be able to take
advantage of.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: And those positives are more robust in 2014 than we've seen in the last couple of
years when you've had effectively flat OR outcomes, right?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I'd certainly, would point first at the fact that we do believe, as does everyone
else, that economic growth in this country is picking up. We're starting to see housing rebound as we talked about,
which is a critical part of GDP. And Norfolk Southern, a lot of our business is driven directly by the U.S. economy and
as the U.S. economy improves, our results should improve with it.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: All right. Thank you.
