Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward
looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, expected
performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking
statements reflect our opinion only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or
publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future
events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on the call such as operating income and operating margin are
expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and
restructuring. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which
we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in
our earnings press release.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Larry.
Lawrence E. Page
Thank you. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Google had another strong quarter with $14.9 billion in revenue
and great product progress. We are closing on our goal of a beautiful, simple and intuitive experience regardless of
your device.
Research has shown that people tend to overestimate the impact of technology in the short-term, yet underestimate the
scale of change longer-term. For years, everyone talked about the multi-screen world. Now it's arrived, but in a scale
few imagined. People increasingly have more than one device, and screens are proliferating in the home, as well as
wearable screens like watches and Google Glass.
When Android was still a skunkworks project, I used to feel kind of guilty visiting the team. We were a search
company and building a new operating system wasn't an obvious move to most people. It turns out that was a lot of
misplaced guilt. Over one billion Android devices have now been activated worldwide and 1.5 million devices are lit
up every day.
I am also tremendously excited about Chromebooks, which are growing fast and defying the more general decline in
laptops. Just like the Chrome browser, updates are seamless and frequent improving security and usability. This is a
great example of technology doing the hard work, so you can get on with the stuff that matters.
Two weeks ago, we launched the new HP Chromebook 11. It's beautifully designed and lightweight at just over two
pounds and, at $279, highly affordable. Best of all, it has a high power micro USB charger that can also charge your
Android phone. Recharging is still way too much of a sweat and there's tremendous potential to innovate, so it's great to
see progress here.
This quarter we also launched the Moto X, the first phone Motorola has developed and produced since Google acquired
the company. Super-fast and clean, and the voice features are great. While it's still early days, Dennis and the team
have already transformed Motorola's product quality and now they are working to build out marketing and distribution.
As screens multiply, the ability to navigate across them seamlessly becomes more and more important, and that's why I
love Chromecast, which we launched in July and it immediately became a best seller. Pull out your phone, tablet or
laptop and start playing some music from YouTube or a show from Google Play or Netflix. In one click, the content is
there on the biggest screen in your home, your TV, all for just $35. And unlike some other streaming devices, you can
continue to e-mail, search and share as the Chromecast handles the hard work without draining your device battery;
genuine multitasking in a multi-screen world.
We've also been making great progress across devices with YouTube. Almost 40% of YouTube's traffic now comes
from mobile, up from 6% two years ago. And in August, we updated our YouTube apps for Android and iOS. You can

now leave a video playing at the bottom of your screen while you explore other content.
Our execution in velocity and search and maps is getting better and better, and from a very high base. The new maps
app for iOS and Android shipped in July, but it's specifically built for tablets to make the most of these larger screens.
And in September, [indiscernible] (6:27) rebuilt our entire mobile search experience with a simple card interface that is
easy to read and a design that is optimized for touch.
Our momentum on Voice Search is tremendous. We added four new languages this quarter, making it available in over
78 languages and accents. We've also expanded the quick answers we can provide just for you. So ask Google for your
flight details and they'll appear instantly in your search results, no digging around in your e-mail required, and the
search across Google+ photos is extraordinary. Search for sunsets and all the pictures you've ever taken of sunsets
appear instantly. If you haven't tried it, prepare to be amazed.
About two years ago, when I became CEO again, my goal was to ensure that Google maintains the passion and soul of
a startup as we grow. That's why I've worked so hard to increase the velocity and execution, so we create products
people love to use and iterate fast to ensure they get better and better, because great is just never good enough.
When you look across the company, it's amazing how the teams are executing. For example we rolled out enhanced
campaigns in AdWords across all devices for all our advertisers in less than a year. Of course none of this would
happen without great people and we are so lucky that we have them.
I'd like to thank all Googlers and Motorolans who make everything possible. Keep up that velocity and execution.
Before I hand over to Patrick, I wanted to let you know that going forward I won't be joining every earnings call.
Patrick and Nikesh do a great job covering our business each quarter and they will continue to do that great work. I
know you would all love to have me on but you're also depending on me to ruthlessly prioritize my time for the benefit
of the business.
I'm very confident you're in good hands with Patrick and Nikesh. So now over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us again. Without further ado why don't we just
dive into the details of Google's financial performance in Q3. So here we go.
Our gross consolidated revenue was just shy of $15 billion at $14.9 billion. The overall business was up 6%
quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year.
Our Google segment gross revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year to $13.8 billion and was up 5%
quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations Google's segment revenue would've actually grown 21%
year-over-year and the currency impact on sequential growth was actually material in our case this quarter.
Google sites revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $9.4 billion and was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the
strength in our core search advertising business. The advertising policy decisions that we implemented earlier this year
to ensure good user experience continue to negatively impact Google's network revenue in the short-term and therefore
our network revenue was in fact flat year-over-year to $3.1 billion and was down 1% quarter-over-quarter.
Despite the short-term pressures, we continue to believe that this is clearly the right answer for our users and
shareholders in the long-term.
Finally, to finish Google's segment on a positive note, Google's other revenue grew 85% year-over-year to $1.2 billion
and was up 18% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play store drove year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter growth in this line.
Turning to Motorola segment, our gross revenue there was $1.2 billion. As Larry mentioned, while it's still the early
days, Dennis and the team have already transformed Motorola's product quality and they're working now at building

marketing and distribution.
By the way, some of you may have noticed that our total consolidated revenue does not exactly equal the sum of our
segment revenue this quarter. This is driven by new transactions in our Motorola segment resulting in intersegment and
certain deferred revenues that are eliminated in our consolidated results.
Coming back to our Google segment, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 26%
year-over-year, 8% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 8% year-over-year and down 4%
quarter-over-quarter. And we should note that the currency fluctuations had a real minimal impact on Q3 cost-per-click.
Once again I wish to remind everyone that our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a whole set of factors
discussed on previous calls; they include geographic mix, channel mix, property mix, as well as product and policy
changes.
Turning to geographic performance of our Google segment, we continue to see steady performance in the U.S. and the
U.K. and strong performance in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor
Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of
FX and the benefits from our hedgings program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculation.
The U.S. revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $6.1 billion and it's worth noting that network revenue that I
mentioned a bit earlier, which continues to be impacted by ongoing policy decisions, skews towards the U.S.
The U.K. was up 14% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, which includes a small $17 million benefit from our hedging
program. In fixed FX, the U.K. grew 15% year-over-year. And our non-U.S. revenue, excluding the U.K., accounted
for 46% of total revenue or $6.3 billion. This was up 28% year-over-year, which includes a $5 million benefit from our
hedgings program and in fixed FX terms, our rest of world actually grew 32% year-over-year.
Coming back to an aggregate level for a total consolidated business, our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $3.3
billion in Q3, excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.3 billion,
again, excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring, for a non-GAAP operating profit was $4.3 billion in Q3 resulting in
non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 29%.
For Google segment, our traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of
revenue was $2.3 billion, excluding $133 million of SBC. Google segment operating expenses were $3.9 billion, also
excluding SBC of $723 million. Depreciation and amortization expense on our property, plant and equipment for the
Google segment was $630 million this quarter. And our Google segment operating profit, as a result, was a strong $4.6
billion in Q3 resulting in Google segment operating margin of 34%.
At Motorola, our total segment operating expenses, including cost of revenue, were $1.4 billion. That excludes $30
million of stock-based compensation and $12 million of Motorola restructuring charges. Please keep in mind that
intangible amortization expense attributed to Google segment and Motorola are in fact included in these segment
measures.
Of the $281 million in consolidated intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the
acquisition of Motorola of which $116 million was allocated to Google segment and $37 million allocated to the
Motorola segment. And as a result, the operating loss at Motorola segment was $248 million in Q3 and operating
margins for that segment were negative 21%.
Headcount for the consolidated business was roughly 1,600 people up in Q3. The Google segment added just about
2,000 people during the quarter and, in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter with approximately 46,000
full-time employees. Our effective tax rate was 15% in Q3. Our tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continued mix
shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
Let me now turn to cash management. Our other income and expense was $24 million for this quarter. The impact of
FAS 133 expense from our hedging program and realized losses mostly offset interest income in this quarter. And as
you know, we often get questions on quarter-to-quarter volatility of our hedging costs. So to help everyone understand

this better, we put together a video tutorial on the topic. You can find the new video on our Investor Relations website.
I hope you find it helpful, and let us know what you think. For more detail on OI&E, please again refer to the slides
that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.1 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.3 billion.
This quarter, the majority of our CapEx was spent on production equipment, data center construction and real estate
purchases. As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest for the long-term and our
infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area of investment for us.
In consequence, our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, very strong again. So there you have it, strong results and an
optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth fully in the opportunities areas including mobile
business, Android, Chrome, YouTube, enterprise, just to name a few.
With that, I will hand it off to Nikesh who will cover more details of our business performance in the quarter. And after
these remarks, we will open up the phone lines for questions. Here you go, Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick.
As Patrick mentioned, our business had a strong quarter with $13.8 billion Google segment gross revenue. Overall,
performance was strong in the retail sector. We had good growth in Japan, South Korea and Australia.
There are three key areas I want to talk about today that are big growth drivers for us and our partners; first, our
continued efforts to make advertising seamless, effective and measurable across multiple screens; second, our progress
in bringing brand advertisers online with special emphasis on our efforts around YouTube; and third, our early
investments in commerce and shopping to help users, retailers and merchants. And lastly a few words about new areas
like digital content, hardware and enterprise.
On seamless advertising, it's been a few months since our advertisers moved over to enhanced campaigns in AdWords.
Clients are telling us they like the new system. Many are still adjusting their campaign in keywords and developing
their multi-screen bidding strategies. For example, we're seeing advertisers bidding more frequently in mobile
keywords because enhanced campaigns makes it so much easier to do so. They're discovering how they can use the
native capabilities of mobile in their ads like location and click-to-call. An example is Discover, who has just increased
their mobile spend and used it to promote their It Card.
Talking about mobile, we've also launched cross device measurement tools and analytics. We have three observations
here. First, mobile is driving higher online conversions. American Apparel found that mobile ads were actually driving
16% more conversions than they initially thought and as a result they're now investing more to drive more sales.
Second, mobile drives more phone calls. On average, there are more than 40 million calls driven by Google ads every
month. This is twice as much as it was a year ago. Third, mobile drives in-store traffic.
Moving over to brand in YouTube, we've seen that our CPG and entertainment clients have moved online at greater
speed with our efforts around brand. Spend by our CPG clients on Display in YouTube has grown over 75% over the
past two years. For example, the global YouTube campaign for Dove's Camera Shy ran in more than 20 countries and
delivered over 62 million views for Unilever.
We're also partnering very closely with agencies. We really like integrating our technology in sites and media with their
creativity and client relationships. For agencies, marketers and Googlers, it's a huge win, win, win. All of the top 10
global agencies now use our DoubleClick product.
On the other side, YouTube continues to do well. Video ads, which include TrueView, now form a significant part of
our YouTube and brand advertising and they're growing north of 75% year-over-year. We've found that YouTube is
our brand torchbearer. It offers brands valuable, engaged audiences, perfect reach and compelling content. Smart
brands are really loving their engagement with YouTube.

Moving on to commerce and shopping. As Google Search moves to provide people with answers and entities, not just
links, we're making good progress helping people take commercial actions too, like buying products. We've seen great
traction on product listing ads both in desktop and mobile. As part of this move to a seamless purchase experience, we
are also helping retailers offer better payment solutions to their customers, particularly on mobile where it's
traditionally been difficult. Google Wallet Instant Buy helps merchants here. After implementing Instant Buy, Ooh La
La saw that from May to August users of Google Wallet on their Android app had a purchase conversion rate that was
four times higher than other shoppers.
Finally, I want to talk about an area which we are being – putting more emphasis on, which is our investment in
emerging none ads businesses. As we mentioned last quarter we continue to see acceleration in new businesses such as
hardware, digital content and enterprise. As Larry mentioned, Chromecast and Chromebooks are enjoying great
success. Chromebooks are now available in over 8,000 locations around the world and are being used in more than
20% of school districts in the United States. We're also rolling out unified Google experience in more than 750 Best
Buy stores to showcase Chromebooks, Chromecast and the newest Nexus device under our one Google branded design.
On digital apps and content, we continue to work hard to rollout Google Play in more markets around the world and
add content to it. For instance, this quarter to help students go back to school, we added a comprehensive catalog of
textbooks to Google Play Books for rent or purchase. We brought on content partners like HBO and DC Entertainment.
This quarter we brought Play Music to eight more countries and Play Books to 18 new countries. For example, now
users in Russia can enjoy Music and users in Indonesia can enjoy Books. There's tremendous momentum here and we
look forward to making progress in this area.
Another strong area of recurring and growing revenue is our enterprise software business, making available the best of
Google for work. Some great new clients this quarter include Whirlpool, which is now using Google Apps to help
30,000 employees collaborate and innovate more quickly. In education, apps for education is being used by 30 million
students, faculty and staff worldwide. Beyond apps, Amtrak uses Google Maps to let people see all the trains in the
U.S. in real-time, and we're continuing to invest in the Google Cloud platform, which has over 300,000 customers,
including Sanmina, a Fortune 500 company, using cloud platforms to build internal applications that improves their
efficiency across their offices globally.
Lastly, let me call out the efforts of our marketing team that continues to roll out the Google welcome mat to the world.
They put on our third annual Google science fair, honoring 15 global finalists from the ages of 13 to 18 from around
the world. They've hosted 400 partners and customers who were at our annual sitecast event.
More interestingly, to introduce the newest version of Android called KitKat, we've built a partnership with Nestlé to
get more than 50 million special Android KitKat chocolate bars on store shelves around the world. And I have to give a
shout out to the wonderful ad for our Nexus devices featuring the great sport of cricket that our marketing team is
running in Australia. That's a bit of a personal favorite sport.
With that, let me hand it over to Patrick. Thank you, again, to all of the Googlers for all of their hard work in getting us
here.

<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Great. Two questions, please. Could you talk about how long you think it will take for
advertisers to move over to fully embrace the multi-screen advertising world, which enhanced campaigns should enable
or facilitate?
And then secondly, a skunkworks question, voice recognition technology at the company, I think is something you've
been working on for years. I think it's what enables wearable devices in the future. Can you talk about how far along
you are in developing the technology to be where you want it to be? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, thanks, Mark, for the questions. I think the first part of your question, I'll send in
Nikesh in a minute and I'll take the voice recognition question. I think we've made tremendous progress on voice
recognition. Even in a period of months, probably the last couple of months or six months, the accuracy has gone up
quite a bit. If you haven't tried it, I really recommend you try it out. It's super-fast. On the Moto X, you can say okay
Google Now. Even if your phone is turned off, it will turn on and answer your question. So I think we're super excited
about that, and I think we've made tremendous strides and will continue to improve accuracy of it to make the products
better. But I think they're already super usable, and we have a lot of usage coming from Voice. So Nikesh, the
enhanced campaigns?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Hey, Mark. As you know, on the topic of enhanced campaigns, the challenge we had as we
moved into a multi-screen world was everybody was producing solutions where we had to basically run campaigns on
different devices in a different way because that's just how evolution had happened from desktop to mobile to video
apps, et cetera. And effectively what our team working with Susan and Sridhar's team have been able to do is to
provide one single interface and one single mechanism to be able to manage your campaigns across multiple devices.
Now that's a good thing because it improves process, lets them see the ROI across various devices with the analytics
tools that we've come up with. But also, there's a lot of work that needs to happen on the advertiser side because they
have to develop beautiful experiences for their customers on mobile devices, as well as on their screen.
So I think it's a process where we're all going through this together. Advertisers love this new mechanism, adjusting
their key words and their bidding models based on all this new effort, and we're seeing great progress in terms of
people are already advertising with us. But not only that, we are also working with all of our advertisers to make sure
they have great experiences on their other screens and other devices so that they can truly leverage. So I think this is
definitely the – sort of the first set of steps we've taken towards the future of multi-screen devices and multi-screen
advertising, but we think this is the way things are going to keep evolving.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks for making things clear.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Jamie, why don't we go to our next caller?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Larry, can you discuss Google's overall e-commerce strategy? How the knowledge grasp
structure data plays into it and, generally, how Google can improve the users' e-commerce experience?
And then Nikesh, you touched briefly on the brand efforts and I was looking at some data recently that showed that
over the past 15 years virtually all of the gains for online advertising has come at the expense of print and radio, and
none of it's come from television budgets. What specifically is happening now that makes you think it's more likely for
those television dollars to finally begin to come online and to Google, in particular?
And then just a quick housekeeping one for Patrick. Can you just give us a bit more detail on how the accounting works
for the intersegment transactions and how it impacts the consolidated model? Thanks.

<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Wow. That's like a three-way question. I'll work hard on that. So I think on the e-commerce
side, I think Google's been using e-commerce for forever and we're real excited about doing a better job of that. I think
we want to remove friction when people are buying online or in the real world. We know people often click on an ad in
a mobile device and they may make their purchase on the laptop, or they might in fact buy it in the store and we need to
really get the conversion data there to the advertiser. So I think we've done work across all those things across
multi-screens, multi-devices from online, offline. You know, we recently launched cross device measurement in
AdWords and we're also just trying to make it easier for people to buy things in general. We've also rolled out some
same-day shipping and local inventory in search and like I said, we're just looking to reduce friction and we're very
excited about that.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, hey, Ben. If you look at the last 15 years of history like you talk about, a lot of the gains of
online advertising have actually come at the expense of what we would call performance advertising. Anytime you
wanted to interact with users, get people to come into your store, get people to buy your product, get people to click on
your website, now all those gains have happened in performance which has been great. But what's beginning to happen
is as the watch time on various online video sites continues to grow, as more and more online video begins to be
available in a non-linear fashion in television screens, our recent, as Larry talked about Chromecast, that stuff, a bunch
of the gaming devices, a bunch of other TV solutions, they're beginning to see a lot more watch time being expanded
either on your desktop or on your multi-screen devices or even on your television.
As that begins to happen, that advertising is more addressable, more directly attributable and provides more
measurement capability. So we believe that's definitely a more superior opportunity for advertisers to be able to interact
their brand customers and actually know who's at the other end. So we think that trend is definitely in the right
direction and we're gearing up for it.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Why don't I take the last question, which was the housekeeping item; actually this is pretty
straightforward change, Ben. So in Q3, our Motorola and Google segments purchased and sold services to each other
and these transactions are reflected in our Google and Motorola segment revenues. The main thing analysts need to
realize as they update their models this time is that the total consolidated revenue will no longer necessarily, like in the
quarters where there is transaction between the two, equal the sum of the Google and Motorola segment revenues. So
analysts who currently sum up our segment revenues and profits to derive consolidated estimates just need to model an
elimination line for the intersegment revenue and profit in order to get their consolidated estimates. So that's as simple
as that. Thanks for the questions. So, Jamie, why don't we go – thanks, Ben – to our next caller?

And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Thank you. Larry, I hope that when you come up with voice recognition it can deal with funny
accents. Anyway, the perception by people outside the company is that Google spends a material amount in long-term
R&D that will not generate revenue in the next two years or so. Larry, can you help us understand how you think about
funding these projects and how much do they correspond versus your total R&D budget?
And secondly, Patrick, you said in the past that CapEx is lumpy and we should expect fluctuations but now we have
had three quarters of what looks like high CapEx versus recent past. Are the last three quarters the new normal? Thank
you.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, thanks, Carlos. I think we definitely are working on accents so I appreciate that. I
think that on the long-term R&D question, I think we don't break all this out in detail so I would say that my struggle in
general is to get people to spend money on long-term R&D. In most companies I think, even companies that have
significant R&D budgets, if you look at that, maybe 99% of it ends up being really incremental which is relatively
small improvements to kind of your existing businesses and maybe 1% of that ends up being kind of true long-term
things like Android was when it got started.

So I think, I mean, I kind of view my job as the opposite thing is to get people to spend on the long-term R&D. I do
think people have a perception that that's material. I don't think that – that's not been my experience and so it's very
hard to actually spend money on long-term things in any kind of meaningful way. And even the investments we've
announced, things like Calico, while they're in absolute dollar numbers, probably significant amounts, they're not
significant for Google. And I think you should actually be asking me to make more significant investments, I wish I
knew how to do that. But I think it's actually very difficult to spend kind of meaningful amounts of money, relative to
Google's scale, on things that are speculative.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Larry. Carlos, on the issue of CapEx, just to reiterate the fact that the majority of
the CapEx this quarter was spent on production equipment, so [ph] I think (33:28) machines; data center construction,
looking ahead; and building the capacity ahead of our needs to get the flexibility and real estate purchases. So we had a
number of kind of really good opportunistic purchases in the portfolio where we were targeting and they kind of came
online this quarter, so pretty pleased with that.
I think that, overall, investors should see this as a very positive sign and a positive signal. As I mentioned last quarter
during my remarks, we continue to invest really for the long-term and it's just a conversation we were having with
Larry on the topic of R&D, and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area for investment for us. It's really
important that when we see signals of or opportunities that – where we need capacity, the worst thing for us would be
to actually not have it in terms of machines and data center capacity. So the strategic value of having it for flexibility
for our long-term positions are really important. That's what you see reflected in our investments right now. So thank
you for your question, Carlos.

<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks. Larry, just to follow up on Ben's question earlier, it seems like you guys have all the
pieces in place with Android, with Maps, with Google Now, Wallet, credit card information in the Play store to kind of
vertically integrate the experience from research/search to purchase in the local and transactional areas, kind of the
closing of the loop, if you will. So can you just elaborate on the overall strategy and how does the recent cross screen
conversion estimates in enhanced play into that? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Well, thanks, Ross. We have positions available if you want to help us out. So, I think we
certainly agree with that. I think it's a pretty good description. I mean we are working on many different pieces of your
commercial experiences. I think in general, right now that experience for users is not that seamless. There's lots of
different pieces of technology and processes in order to make commerce happen and so on. So I think, yeah, that's
something we absolutely are looking at improving by closing the loop and so on. I think your question, actually, is a
pretty good summary. I don't know that I can add much more.

And we'll go next to Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Dan Salmon>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. My question was for Larry. Since you've come back into the CEO's
role, one of the things we've noticed with Google is that your own advertising spending has moved up and once upon a
time Google was a company that didn't need to advertise, and obviously you're in a lot more businesses these days from
where you started. But maybe just philosophically, how you view that for Google long-term as you do launch into more

And then just one quick follow-up. With the Canadian government announcing this week that they'll look to pursue
unbundling of TV subscriptions, would you ever consider taking Google Fiber to a market outside of the U.S.?
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yes. Dan, thanks for the good – for the questions. I think we sell a lot of advertising and we
do a modest amount of advertising. I think we find that pretty useful and we've gotten better at doing it, and I think it's
good for our business and it's good for us to understand kind of the advertising perspective from the advertisers'
point-of-view given that's a big business for us. I might let Nikesh elaborate a little bit on that. In Fiber, I think it's
really just early days. We are just getting going on that.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, Dan, to follow-up on the marketing question, I think we still encourage our product teams
to go out there and get their products to be used by users on the merits of the products because we believe that's a form
of marketing that they can have. But as our products get more and more popular there are many parts of the world we
want to make sure there's awareness for those products and people understand what the capabilities and features are.
That's the only time we bring in marketing to kick in.
And the other area we do a lot of marketing in is in trying to make sure our advertisers understand the advertising
opportunities so they can actually spend money with us. So that's certainly how we think about marketing but the
primary focus is definitely on making sure we create great products that users use and the better products stand and get
popular on their own merits.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: That's very correct. Let's go to the next question.
Operator
And we'll go next – we'll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Hey. Good afternoon. A question for Larry in terms of you talked about R&D spending and
just the amount that you're going to be gauging that. Can you talk specifically about self-driving cars? I realize it's way
down the road but how real is this as a business?
And then separately, in terms of CPCs, how should we see enhanced campaigns impacting CPCs over the next few
quarters? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Okay. Great questions from Gene. Thank you. So I think, I guess on the self-driving cars
specifically, I think for any big innovation I'd say you overestimate short-term and underestimate long-term and that's
probably a good summary for self-driving cars. We've made tremendous progress. We've driven large amounts of
miles. We've changed the business from being something that wasn't going to happen at all to something that now is
somewhat inevitable on people's feelings about it which I think is tremendous progress.
That said, it's still pretty early days for the product. I don't know exactly what we've been saying but it's still a ways
from being a commercial product. You know, probably overestimate that in the short-term, like I said, and
underestimate that in the long-term. What was the second part of the question?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Why don't I jump in for a second on the CPCs. Listen, we don't – because you asked the
question about what do we expect quarter – over the coming quarters. We don't really manage for quarterly CPC trends.
We actually focus on the user, and the advertiser ROI so in general we attribute CPC trends to a combination of those
five factors I talked about, FX, the three mix effect of mobile versus desktop, emerging markets versus developed
markets, channel mix between our sites in our network, then a number of product and policy changes. That's really the
big driver.
I think that we're really pleased, as Nikesh mentioned, you know, enhanced campaigns is a great platform that enables
us more future and as long as we actually have the format that delivers a great ROI then enhanced campaigns will just
accelerate this in the future and that's what we're working on. So it's really the complex puzzle and it's important that

not only we think about CPCs in the context of all the factors I talked about but what's even more important is the
dynamic of those CPCs and paid clicks together. That's really the magic that actually talks about our growth.

And we'll go next to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.
<Q - Tim O'shea>: Yeah, hi. It's Tim O'shea for Brian Pitz. I know it's still early but can you give us a broad sense for
how you're feeling about the holiday shopping season? And do you have any sense of the updated Google shopping or
PLA program has mad you better positioned to capitalize this holiday?
And then just quickly, can you give us a sense for what kind of traction you're seeing from the recent implementation
of localized PLAs during the quarter? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Just to say that we clearly do not. As you all know, we don't give any sense of what's going on
in the fourth quarter. We actually just are closing our third quarter so we don't give forward guidance on any of it. I
think maybe Nikesh can give a sense of where PLAs are going in general?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, thanks, Patrick. Tim, I think the important part in PLAs, as I mentioned in the prepared
remarks, is that we are transitioning from giving users answers in terms of links to taking them down to entities. And
PLAs, product listing ads, is definitely a big step in that direction because we believe that's a great answer for the user
and a good user experience in the long-term especially and more interest in mobile devices. So from a long-term user
experience perspective we believe that is the right direction. That is a good user experience to have. Not going to
particularly comment how that is going to impact what happens in the next few weeks or the next few quarters.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: All right. Our next question?
Operator
And we'll go next to Ken Sena with Evercore.
<Q - Ken Sena>: Hi. Thank you. On Google Play it's my understanding that much of the 30% that developers don't
keep actually goes to carriers and OEMs. So I'm just wondering if you can update us maybe on those negotiations and
kind of when you see Google maybe receiving a greater portion of Play's economics? And then maybe if you could just
update us too on your thoughts on travel? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Okay. Nikesh will take the Play part, there.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, on Google Play, as you know, Google Play has been something that our teams have
worked really hard on in the last few years to make sure because that sort of just fills out the Android ecosystem and is
a key part of making the Android experience a great experience by having great content, great apps on the Google Play
system.
And in terms of economics, the economics, like you said, rightfully are shared between developers, carriers, OEMs and
us and our key with Google Play is to make sure that there's a robust ecosystem. People like Android devices, they
provide some great functionality. And we believe anybody who brings value to that ecosystem should have economics
of that ecosystem, which is a carrier, OEM or developer or us.
We're not going to specifically talk about who keeps what part of the economics, but just to say that we're comfortable
with the way the economics work out, and the more important part is it is helping drive the ecosystem in the right
direction.

Operator
And we'll go next to Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Co.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Great. Thanks very much. The first question is, curious how you guys are thinking about
the future of cookies in online advertising? Obviously, a lot of chatter about privacy issues and perhaps Google
working on adID as an alternative.
And then secondly, haven't heard a whole lot about Japan, although we're seeing pretty a fairly rapid shift to Android in
that market. I wonder if you could comment on the Google business in Japan and the pace of growth there? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Okay. So maybe, Nikesh, can you address the cookie question?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: I mean, from our perspective we believe that technological enhancements can definitely improve
user security, and we want to make sure that the web continues to remain economically viable in that transition. So we
have a lot of concepts in this area, but it's very early right now to try and actually elaborate them and talk about what's
going to work and what's not going to work. But as I said, the primary motive is to make sure that we can keep
enhancing technologically what's going on, but we want to make sure that we don't break the system and we make sure
that things stay secure and economically viable.
In terms of Japan, as I mentioned, Japan has been good for us this quarter, and as you've rightfully identified, that we
continue to see robust growth in the sort of multi-screen space in that market. Clearly, it's an early adopter market as it
relates to mobility and tablets and devices. So you can – we're feeling very good about how the consumer behavior
there is and how that translates into advertising.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Okay. Our next question?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Steve D. Ju>: Larry, a different question on Google Fiber if I may. It's now rolled out in a few regions around the
country. Can you share with us some of your early learnings in terms of how consumer behavior changed once the
connection speed stepped up materially in this new environment? And what kind of new services or products do you
think Google can roll out or how your existing services can change for the better? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Thanks, Stephen. So I think, again, it's very early on Google Fiber. It's been announced in
several places, I think they're really rolling out in Kansas City. I think one of the things that's unique about the Google
Fiber offering is that your television service is available right through the data connection. So one big change in having
a high speed data connection is actually the entire kind of television experience, cable/TV like experience, comes
straight through your data connection, through your gigabit connection, and people, I think, have been pretty excited
about that experience being a great experience for watching television, actually.
So our next question?

And we'll go next to John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.
<Q - John R Blackledge>: Great. Thanks for the question. Wondering if you could review the content strategy at
YouTube and the willingness to invest in areas like live sports, like the NFL, and how the content strategy would play
in the evolution of YouTube over time? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, thanks, John, for the question. I think I'll also give this one to Nikesh.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Well, as we've always said that YouTube is an ecosystem which is a combination of great users,
great advertising and great content. And we talk to content providers all the time because we understand that users
come to YouTube so that they can enjoy both user generated content, other forms of content both short form and long
form. So we're pretty comfortable that we're making great sort of progress with the number of hours that people watch
YouTube continues to go up.
The amount of videos uploaded to YouTube continues to go up, so as Larry mentioned, we're seeing a lot of YouTube
users coming off mobile. So we believe our content strategy on YouTube is working. We're constantly talking to
people about content all the time. And so sure we will talk to anybody who wants to talk to us about content but for
now we're happy with where we are. In the end our goal is to help make sure that our users have a good experience that
they get to see the right content on their and our advertisers are able to advertise on that platform.

Operator
And we'll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Hi. Thanks. A bigger picture question for Larry and components of the question have been
touched on in the call but there's been a debate for some time about the Internet becoming more vertical and accelerated
by the transition to mobile and that that could serve as a headwind for Google's business, yet your core revenue growth
has been remarkably stable, for several quarters now above 20%. And Larry you've talked about this broad topic in
prior calls but I was just wondering if you could give an updated view of the landscape as it relates to your efforts to go
deeper into the transaction funnel to offset verticalization as well as if you could share your perception of Google's
competitive position in a multi-device world versus the legacy desktop, laptop world?
And then secondly, any timeline or thoughts you could give on Project Loon in terms of it becoming a commercial
offering? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Hi. Thanks, Scott, for the questions. I think, so the first topic is a pretty complex topic. I
think we're very well-positioned in mobile. I have said this before, but we have Android. I think we have tremendous
services on Android, and we have obviously search and things that work across many different things. I'm
tremendously excited about this. I think we have the potential to really improve people's experience as they move more
onto mobile and spend more time there, and to make those experiences much more efficient and pleasurable and
beautiful for those users.
Also, as they do things with third-parties and one thing to keep in mind as we've done a lot of effort around the APIs on
Android, around working with app developers and around Google Play as a marketplace for those developers and those
things are evolving all the time in ways to help us, help users and help those developers. And so we have a lot of ideas
there and a lot of work going so I'm actually very, very excited about that. And I think we're tremendously well
positioned to help them [indiscernible] (50:45) move along and make users experiences better and to improve our
business and our developer's businesses.

I think the – and I find that I'm spending most of my time now on mobile and not so much on the desktop world. I think
that's what people are going to generally do over time.
I think on Project Loon, again, it's really early for that. We announced it because we had to because people were seeing
them and they're flying around and so on. But it's a small team. It's very exciting. We've been totally amazed by the
positive reaction we've gotten across the world and from ISPs and telcos and other people wanting to work with us,
which is tremendous. We want to work with all of them.
And I think we've hit on something important in trying to improve overall Internet access which is something that if
you're one of the significant number of people in a rural area or place that doesn't have great Internet access now, it's
something that really matters to your quality of life. So we're excited about that.

Jamie?
Operator
And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Larry, I just was wondering with advertisers
having more choice of broad platforms to use for spending their digital ad dollars and in particular on mobile, I'm just
wondering do you see a big acceleration in dollars moving from offline to online? Do you see that pace accelerating
over the next few years? And also how will Google continue to differentiate itself here?
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, I guess I will give that to Nikesh. I would just say we've always seen a lot of choices
in advertising. We've always competed well in that market. I think people are definitely getting more and more excited
about moving dollars online. For us, I think, the measurability of it, the strength of the tools that are available and the
technologies to do that. So we just see it as an amazing opportunity and I think people are more and more realizing that.
Nikesh?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, to build on what Larry said, I think he's right that we are expecting more and more dollars
to move towards these platforms for a variety of reasons. One, there are more options to more players in the market,
which are – that means they're all working hard towards the same goal of convincing advertisers that this is the place
where the users are and this is where advertisers need to be. Also, if you think about what's going on, as I said earlier,
in the context of YouTube we are going to see more and more video coming onto the web and online mechanisms
because it's more targetable and more addressable.
In terms of our differentiation, if you look at what we've done over the last many years is we've actually worked in
terms of trying to provide a comprehensive solution across all digital capability whether it's on Google, whether it's off
Google, whether it's in our network, whether it's with us, whether it's with partners around the web, whether it's with
mobile devices, whether it's on desktop devices, whether it's on display ads, search ads or video ads. If you look at it,
what we're trying to do is we're trying to make sure that when an advertiser wants to reach users, we can provide them a
comprehensive solution that they can go ahead and advertise.
And if you couple that with measurement, which is what sort of makes online so much more compelling, that people
are going to look at measurement, look at the analytics around it. So advertisers get a lot more information, they have a
lot more options and of course in the end, we want to make sure that we focus on very high quality ads. So if you
combine all of those things, we think we continue to be sort of kind of working towards providing the comprehensive
solution, and we work really hard with all of the players in the ecosystem whether it's publishers, agencies or other
media property owners. So we feel good about this.

And we'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. A couple things. First, on the rest of world acceleration, could you let us know if there's
any platforms like mobile or products like maybe YouTube that really kind of kicked it in the quarter, that really helped
drive that? Maybe it was Google Play?
And then on Motorola, it's now getting close to $1 billion run rate on annual losses. Could you remind us of the
synergies that you're seeing with that and why you're encouraged by that? And maybe when that can start to turn the
other way? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So clearly, on international not only is our kind of core search business performing very well,
but also as you've seen other revenues, which includes the Play platform is actually doing very well internationally. So
these two are the big contributors for that one.
As we stand on Motorola, I mean Larry mentioned very well at the beginning of the call, right, it is still early days for
us. I think that we have – Dennis and the team have already made a huge transformation at Motorola. We have now
great product quality.
The Moto X, the first of the products that have come out and it's actually been very well received, great product. So the
team is now really working on building out marketing and distribution, which is kind of the next phase of it. So that's
the mindset that we put at Motorola. This is not a this quarter or next quarter, but much more a more fundamental kind
of optimistic and reset view of the company. So that's how we think of these issues.
Thanks, Justin.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: We have time for one more question.
Operator
And we'll take our final question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two things I wanted to ask about. First just on
enhanced campaigns, can you give us some sense as what it meant for overall spending in the quarter? And then also,
how do you get advertisers to use the location and time of day modifiers going forward?
And then just on the U.S. business, there was a decel there of about 500 basis points from last quarter. Patrick, you
mentioned the networks shifts there, obviously. But was there anything else going on there?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: No, I mean as a – on your U.S. network, it really is, as you know, the – are changes in
policies. They basically affect dramatically more our network, and because of our network, think of AFS, is really very
heavy weighted to U.S., that's really what's been the main driver for that change. I will let Nikesh take the front end of
the question.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, in terms of enhanced campaigns, I'm not quite sure what you mean by what it meant for
overall spending in the quarter.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Was it positive? Was it incremental to revenue do you think in the quarter?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, to be fair, on the enhanced campaign side we're not actually trying to quantify the effect
because we believe it's part of the overall experience and it's a step in the right direction in terms of what we want to
achieve.
In terms of your question as it relates to location and time of day modifiers, I mean these are requests from advertisers.
But to give you an example, usually when a car rental company advertises when somebody is in an airport they are

likely to get a higher click through rate and a higher conversion than if somebody is searching for car rentals when they
are sitting at their desktop. So the location can be used as a great modifier in terms of advertising, in terms of creating
better conversion. That's just one example. We have millions of examples like that where you can actually use location
very effectively or time of day very effectively. That's a traditional example of when I'm hungry and you show me an
ad more likely to click on an ad which offers me restaurant choices or food choices than if I'm not hungry and it's late at
night.
So there are different modifiers that allow us to create different advertising. People shop more at lunchtime. So there's a
whole bunch of stuff that comes in when you start providing location and time of day modifiers so that's why I think it's
good.

I want to thank everyone for spending so much time with, us and I will turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Just before we close the call, I think we have great news to announce. All of you that have worked with us with the
industrial community group, you know that Willa Chalmers, who is part of our IR team, has been kind of missing in
action for the last two weeks. I'm just incredibly proud to announce that Jacob Alan Chalmers is now in the world and
has arrived a couple of days ago. Mom is doing incredibly well so Willa is doing great too. So just to let you know that
she has not disappeared. She's doing great. The whole family is – we're all excited about it and it's another great kind of
Googler addition to the family. So that's why Willa disappeared for a few weeks.
With that, I'll turn it back to Larry to close the call.
Lawrence E. Page
Thank you, all.
