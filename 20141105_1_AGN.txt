Brenton L. Saunders
Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning for this update on our third
quarter financial results and business performance. We are pleased to report an exceptionally strong third quarter, our
first following the combination of Actavis and Forest into a single company. We achieved a number of objectives
during the quarter. We drove dramatic growth in both revenues and earnings. We delivered strong growth in our key
brands and our North American Generics and International businesses.
We continued to invest in both brand and generic R&D to expand our product pipelines. We used strategic investment
and business development to expand our anti-infective and GI portfolios. And we accelerated our integration activities
across the board and are on target to pull forward synergy capture more rapidly than we originally estimated and
complete our integration ahead of schedule.
As a result, we are increasing our forecast for the remainder of the year. We are proud to report an 83% increase in total
revenue to $3.7 billion. This increase in revenues was driven by strong sales of key products in our North American
Brands business, continued strong performance across our North American Generic and International businesses and by
strength in our Anda Distribution business.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 158% to $1.3 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share rose 53% to $3.19.
Our Actavis North American Brands business delivered revenue of $1.6 billion. I'd like to share some highlights across
key brand therapeutic categories and there are many, as you can see from slide six. In our CNS franchise, we continued
to focus on the conversion of Namenda IR to XR, with XR sales increasing as we enhanced manufacturing capacity.
Viibryd, Fetzima, and Saphris also continued to deliver solid results.
In GI, we saw growth continue for Linzess, benefiting from the resumption of DTC efforts. And our Asacol HD and
Delzicol franchise has stabilized following the right sizing and training efforts with our sales force following the
integration in August. We also continued to strengthen our GI business with the announcement of our option to acquire
Rhythm Health, Inc.
In our Women's Health franchise, Lo Loestrin and Estrace Cream have both grown steadily for three consecutive
quarters. And finally, our products in respiratory and anti-infective continue to respond favorably to focused sales and

marketing initiatives and we have strong development momentum, particularly with Caz-Avi, and our pending
acquisition of Durata.
Patients, caregivers and healthcare providers continue to respond favorably to the benefits of once daily dosing of
Namenda XR. With inventory building, the conversion rate from IR to XR has climbed steadily to 38%, which is in
line with our expectations following the supply constraints. We believe that we are on a solid growth trajectory to
achieve approximately 50% conversion by year-end. As a result, we now plan to discontinue the general sale and
distribution of Namenda IR, immediate release tablets, in January 2015.
After that date, we will make the immediate release tablets available through a nationwide specialty pharmacy for
prescribing to patients upon an indication of medical need that's determined by their physician. While there is a lawsuit
brought by the New York State Attorney General seeking to force continued distribution of Namenda IR, we are
defending our right to make and implement this decision and have made these plans accordingly.
Going forward, we will continue to focus on educating physicians and caregivers about the benefits of once-daily
formulation. We are also preparing for the potential introduction of the fixed dose combination of Namenda and
Donepezil, as well as key expansion of the brand and therapeutic innovation for patient care.
Moving to Linzess, sales of the product were strong, up almost 30% quarter-over-quarter. We expect this trend to
continue as we support the brand with our fully integrated sales force and continued DTC initiatives, which we
resumed in September.
As you can see on slide nine, we are seeing steady growth for Lo Loestrin oral contraceptive. In addition, we received
positive news in October with the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals upholding our patent, and finding it infringed by
Lupin and Amneal. We are pleased that the patent protection on Lo Loestrin is secure to 2029. We will launch a
focused consumer campaign beginning in December to accelerate the growth of this product into 2015 and beyond.
On slide 10, in early October, we announced a proposed acquisition of Durata Therapeutics, a development and
commercialization stage company focused on innovation in unmet infectious diseases. We are extremely excited about
this acquisition. It is an example of the kind of focused strategic investment that we will be making to drive long-term
growth for our anti-infective portfolio. Durata's lead product, Dalvance, is the first and only IV antibiotic for acute
bacterial skin and skin structure infections with once a week dosing for two weeks. Dalvance is positioned uniquely in
this space due to its dosing benefits versus Vancomycin and the impact reduced dosing can have on hospital admissions
and costs associated with long-term in patient treatment for skin infections. It will complement our existing in-patient
focused antibiotic Teflaro, as well as our late stage development products ceftazidime-avibactam, which has an FDA
action date during the first quarter of next year.
In addition to the near-term revenue for Dalvance, the company's pipeline also includes a next generation Dalvance
with the potential for use as a single dose treatment in uncomplicated skin infections as well as other infection types,
including osteomyelitis. Last week, we received FTC clearance for the transaction, and we remain on target for a close
by end of year.
Our business development activities also focused on expanding our GI pipeline. On July 2, we completed the
acquisition of Furiex Pharmaceuticals, including Furiex's lead product, eluxadoline. In October, we announced an
exclusive option to acquire Rhythm Health, Inc. and its diabetic gastroparesis product, relamorelin.
Eluxadoline is a potential first-in-class treatment of symptoms of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, or
IBS-D, a condition that affects approximately 28 million patients in the United States and Europe. Earlier this quarter,
FDA accepted our NDA submission for eluxadoline and a European marketing authorization is under review. We
anticipate an FDA approval decision during the second quarter of 2015 and a possible launch of the product in late
2015 or early 2016. If approved, eluxadoline would represent a significant advance for patients with IBS-D.
Our exclusive option to acquire Rhythm Health, Inc., announced in early October, would bring another significant
opportunity to our GI franchise with relamorelin, a potential best-in-class Phase 2 agent for the treatment of diabetic
gastroparesis, a significant GI complication that could impact up to 40% of the type 1, and up to 30% of the type 2

diabetes patients who have not benefited from a new treatment for diabetic gastroparesis for more than 30 years.
Both of these acquisitions bring important opportunities that we expect will contribute to long-term revenue generation
in our GI business that will be highly complementary to our flagship product, Linzess, our Asacol HD/Delzicol
franchise and five other promoted GI products.
Looking at our late stage pipeline development on slide 12, we have a number of key drivers in the months ahead that
will continue to fuel our North American Brands growth. Near-term, we are expecting regulatory decisions by the end
of 2014 and into the first half of 2015 for five pipeline programs. We have PDUFA dates for Bystolic and Namenda
fixed dose combination submissions later this year.
In early 2015, we will be preparing for PDUFA dates for Liletta, our IUD contraceptive previously referred to as
Levosert; Viibryd low dose; and Caz-Avi, or ceftazidime-avibactam, an important part of our growing anti-infective
portfolio. We are expecting to resubmit our NDA for Cariprazine for bipolar mania and schizophrenia to the FDA this
quarter. In addition, we continue to support the development of Esmya for uterine fibroids with an ongoing Phase 3
study, and Sarecycline for acne, which we will initiate a Phase 3 program this quarter.
Turning to our sales force on slide 13. In August, we completed a significant sales force realignment to right size the
organization and provide significant training on core products within our core franchises. We now have completed that
effort and have right sized the Actavis North American sales team to approximately 3,500 sales representatives and
managers focused on conducting 13 million sales calls to 250,000 healthcare providers. We also enhanced our sales
efforts in 1,600 academic and community hospitals and reach into 400 national and regional health plans and GPOs.
We believe that our sales organization has been right sized to continue to drive product sales, and in terms of number of
calls, we lead the industry. We believe we are among the most effective and efficient field force in the industry. With
an extensive portfolio across the key therapeutic categories, we are relevant to our physician and health provider
customer base.
On slide 14, in our Generics business, our North American and International base business continued to perform
strongly. We continue to see strength in the base business, partially offset by additional generic competition of certain
key products, including generic versions of Lidoderm and our authorized generic version of Concerta.
Our Anda Distribution business also saw a strong quarter, driven by increased business with key retailers and
independent pharmacies. Anda continues to represent a significant strategic asset and the performance throughout 2014
has proven the power of Anda.
In our International Generics business, we continue to see strong contributions across our global markets, including the
UK, where our teams have continued to deliver strong performance due to their ability to identify product shortages
and changing market demands. Our business in Russia and some of our Eastern European markets are outperforming
the market as a result of our combination of generic, branded generic, and OTC products that make us an important
player in these markets.
Turning to generics R&D on slide 16, we are continuing to build the leading generics pipeline in the industry. In the
United States, we have approximately 228 ANDAs pending review at the FDA, 60 of which are first-to-file.
Year-to-date 2014, we've announced 19 first-to-file opportunities in our pipeline. We are fully committed to supporting
organic growth in our business by continuing to lead the industry in first-to-file opportunities.
Internationally, we are poised for continued long-term growth in generics, with 1,200 marketing authorizations pending
across various international regulatory agencies and 570 marketing authorizations approved this year to fuel near-term
international growth.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Todd, who will provide you with an overview of our financial performance
during the quarter. Todd?

Robert Todd Joyce
Thanks, Brent. I'll begin with an overview of our updated reporting structure on slide 18. As a result of the merger with
Forest on July 1, we are now reporting three operating segments, which include North American Brands, North
American Generics combined with our businesses outside of North America, and our Anda Distribution business.
Earlier today, we filed a Form 8-K disclosing our segment results on this basis for 2013 and for the first and second
quarter of 2014. As a reminder, the current year third quarter results include full quarter contributions from the recently
completed Forest acquisition and the Warner Chilcott acquisition that was completed on October 1 of last year. These
acquisitions have had a significant impact on our results of operation, including revenues and operating expenses, in
comparison to our prior year results.
Turning now to our results for the third quarter on slide 19, consolidated net revenues for the third quarter was $3.683
billion. Revenues from all three segments are tracking in line or slightly above our expectations. Non-GAAP R&D
investment for the quarter was $307 million compared to $136 million in the prior year period.
Non-GAAP R&D spending for Generics, Brands, and Biosimilars was $114 million, $164 million, and $29 million
respectively. GAAP amortization expense for the quarter was $874 million compared to $146 million in the prior year
period.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased to $3.19 compared to $2.09 in the third quarter of 2013.
Our non-GAAP tax rate improved from 27.2% in the year ago period to 16.6% in the current year quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.260 billion compared to $489 million in the prior year. Cash flow from
operations for the third quarter was $522 million. Our third quarter operating cash flow is net of $166 million in
acquisition and integration costs and $62 million related to the early redemption of the 7.75% Warner Chilcott bonds.
Turning to our segment results on slide 20. North American Brand revenue was $1.6 billion for the quarter, driven by
strong sales of key promoted products including Namenda, Bystolic, Linzess, Lo Loestrin Fe, Daliresp, Tudorza, and
Estrace Cream. Adjusted gross margin for North American Brands increased to 84.4% and non-GAAP SG&A as a
percentage of adjusted net revenues was 29.7%.
On slide 21, we see that our North American Generics and International business continues to achieve some strong
results, with revenues of $1.641 billion for the quarter, up 5.6% from the prior year period. On a non-GAAP basis,
adjusted gross margin increased 3.8 percentage points compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted SG&A as a percent
of adjusted net revenues for our North American Generics and International segment was 20.3%.
On slide 22, we provide details of our Anda results for the quarter. Revenues increased to $423 million in the current
year period, up from $307 million in the prior year, an increase of 38%. Gross margin for Anda grew 80 basis points
and the segment contribution increased 170% compared to the prior year period.
On slide 23, you see that our cash position remains strong, with cash flow from operations growing 155% in the first
three quarters of 2014, compared to the prior year period. We expect operating cash flow to increase significantly in the
fourth quarter to roughly $900 million. Fourth quarter operating cash flow will be impacted by acquisition and
integration related payments, but to a lesser extent than in the third quarter.
Slide 24 details our debt capitalization as of September 30. During the quarter, we repaid approximately $750 million
of debt, which reduced our leverage to approximately 3.3 times adjusted EBITDA. As a company, we remain
committed to driving shareholder return, while maintaining investment-grade financial strength for the long-term
sustainability of the company.
Before I turn the call back over to Brent, I would like to make a few comments regarding my plan to retire early next
year. My 17 years with Actavis have been extraordinary, both from a career and a personal perspective. I've had a
unique opportunity, particularly over the past five years, to be part of the fundamental transformation of our company
into an exceptional global specialty pharmaceutical company. I've also had the pleasure of managing an
industry-leading team of finance professionals that have made tremendous contributions to the success of the company.

I want to thank our finance organization around the world for their continued hard work and commitment to the success
of Actavis. I also want to thank Brent, Paul, and my colleagues on the leadership team for a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to be part of such a vibrant and exciting company. I look forward to the supporting of the transition once
the successor has been named to ensure that we continue to capitalize on the momentum we have built for the
remainder of 2014 and into 2015.
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Brent to review our updated forecast.
Brenton L. Saunders
Thanks, Todd. And on behalf of the management team, our colleagues across the company, investors and shareholders,
we appreciate your contributions to Actavis more than we can adequately state. And thank you for your participation in
supporting a smooth transition [ph] during (21:37) the months ahead.
Turning now to our forecast for the remainder of 2014. On slide 26, we've provided an update forecast for the second
half of 2014 revenue for North American Brands, North American Generics, International and Anda Distribution
businesses. We now anticipate total revenues of $7.4 billion. We have also updated our franchise level revenue
expectation for our North American Brands business. Revenue growth in the second half of 2014 will continue to be
driven by key products such as Namenda, Lo Loestrin, Estrace Cream and Linzess. We are also seeing solid results
from other key products, including Viibryd, Fetzima, and our respiratory products, Daliresp and Tudorza.
On slide 28, we have updated our forecast for the second half and full year 2014, and now estimate second half
non-GAAP earnings between $6.60 and $6.70 per share compared with the previous range of $6.25 and $6.50 per
share. Our assumptions include no additional competition on our generic version of Lidoderm, minimal contribution
from our generic version of OxyContin and continued strong sales of our key North American Brand products, as well
as investments in consumer campaigns for Namenda XR and Lo Loestrin. We are well positioned as we enter the last
couple months of the year and I couldn't be more pleased with how our business is performing.
We expect strong momentum in 2014 to continue into 2015, and we will provide a detailed update to our 2015
guidance as planned early next year. We are currently planning a business and R&D update in conjunction with our
fourth quarter earnings to more fully describe our deep and rich pipeline and business growth potential.
Finally, I'd like to close with an update on the significant progress we are making on our roadmap for accelerated
growth. We have executed exceptionally well on our objectives to combine these two successful and growing
companies, accelerating integration and synergy capture while making sure both the generics and brand business
continue to deliver strong results and we've done this while continuing to invest in organic growth. We are well on our
way to cementing a solid foundation for accelerating growth in 2016 and beyond.
We will generate a significant amount of cash that we plan to deploy strategically including adding to long duration
assets to expand our franchises with both marketed products and pipeline opportunities and we will continue to focus
on expanding our commercial presence in strong growth markets internationally and globalizing our existing
franchises. By continuing to follow this roadmap, I am confident that we can achieve our goal of accelerating growth to
$20 per share in earnings and further establish ourselves as one of the fastest growing and most dynamic
pharmaceutical companies in the world.
With that, let me now turn the call back over to Lisa to get the Q&A underway.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you, Brent. If I could ask everyone to just limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow up, please reenter
the queue. Holly, with that, can we start the Q&A?

Q&A
Operator
Yes, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman
Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Congratulations on a very strong quarter and congratulations to you, Todd, on our new – whatever
your new opportunity will be, but congratulations. Brent, how would you weigh the pros and cons of embarking on
another large transformational deal at this time? Is your organization ready for such a transformational deal? And as
part of that question, how would you weigh accretion on earnings or just simply a simple IRR calculation in
considering a deal versus accretion on a multiple, if you were to acquire a high P/E stock? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. I was wondering if I'd get that question. First let me just address Todd. He's not
going anywhere that quickly, we've got him tied here until we get a successor in place, and we're having fun together.
Look, I think as we think about our business and our ability to execute, we have a terrific team. I think the quarter
demonstrated that we can execute an integration successfully, while growing our business at the same time, and the
quality of our growth was really quite high. We saw growth in our Branded business, we saw growth in our Generics
business and our Anda Distribution business. We saw our supply chain execute on all cylinders across the board. We
saw all of our back office functions doing great things, our pipeline advanced. We did three business development deals
to add to our pipeline and to our market of products during the quarter. So you can see, I think, evidence is strong that
this team just knows how to execute with excellence while maintaining momentum in growth in the business.
So I think that we have proven that we know how to do deals, we know how to do integrations by the Forest
integration, the previous integrations both companies have done prior to getting together. I think our track record is
clear, Jami. So if there was an opportunity, I think we've demonstrated as a team that if it was a right strategic
opportunity with strong financial fundamentals that created long-term enduring growth for our company, we would be
very interested in it and we would only act if we believed we could execute on it.
So I think that answers the first half of the question. If – I guess as you think about how do you stay financially
disciplined in looking at deals, and what's more important, accretion or IRRs, I think at the end of the day, every deal
has to be looked at on its own merit, and one of the things that Paul and I have always agreed on is the strategic
rationale of the deal has to be clear.
And once that hurdle is behind you, then you turn to the financials and I think we've demonstrated a very consistent,
disciplined approach to doing deals. And EPS accretion, and in fairness, is easy today, the cost of capital is low.
Everybody can get to earnings accretion on almost any deal.
I think you have to look at can you create value for the long-term. Can you drive accretion to your top line? Do you
have long duration assets and strong pipelines for organic growth? And I think when those things – when you step back
and look at that, obviously you want to have strong internal rates of return, but you also want to make sure that they're
NPV positive in that over the long-term you're going to create shareholder value because that's why we're in this
business.
I don't know, Paul, if you have anything you'd add -
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I think you said it perfectly. That's exactly the way we've looked at it over the years and we
continue to look at it that way. I think we'll just take each one as it comes along.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Right.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Shibani Malhotra with Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Hi. Todd, best wishes for whatever you plan to do next. And I've got a couple of basic
questions for the Generic team. Two products that we're interested in. One, Pulmicort, can you provide us an update on
where you are with that product? And then two, we've been hearing that you are focusing on a respiratory pipeline as
well in generics, and can you just give us some color on that, in particular if you're doing any work on generic Advair?
Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. Certainly, Shibani, and thank you. Respiratory, as we have said many times, is
clearly the next frontier for growth in the generics business. We're very dedicated and focused on being successful in
respiratory development. Maybe for Pulmicort, I'll ask David to answer the question specifically.
<A - David A. Buchen>: Sure. Good morning, Shibani. The trial is ongoing, as I understand it. We do have final
approval for the product, and we are ready to go. The supply chain is performing well, and we're building inventory. So
we will wait and see how the court case turns out, but we are pleased with the way it's going so far, according to what
I've seen in the public domain. And as soon as the court rules, we'll be ready to go.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Great. And Shiba – yeah, with respect to Advair and the other respiratory, maybe Bob
Stewart can chime in.
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Yeah. Hi, Shibani. Regarding Advair as well as our entire respiratory portfolio, we're
investing a considerable amount of time, effort and resource to building out a respiratory portfolio within our generics
business. Advair is clearly one of them. Obviously, with Advair, you've got the complications of not only passing a PK
study, but obviously clinical endpoint, as well as the interchangeability of the device itself. Regarding who is the
frontrunner, I know there's been public disclosures out there regarding starting clinical endpoint studies. I don't think
that there's actually been enrollment yet. So our policy is not to issue a purchase order when we contract a CRO. So I
won't comment on who is the frontrunner at this point. Alls I'll say is, just stay tuned.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I think he meant press release when we --
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Yeah. Press release.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: But I think -
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: [indiscernible] (31:33) put purchase order down.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: But Shibani, I think I would just summarize it as we're fully engaged in respiratory
development, and I think one of the many connecting rods between our combination here is the expertise we have in
respiratory across brand and generic R&D, as well as our ability to do clinical endpoint studies, have only been
enhanced by this combination. We feel we're very well positioned.

<Q - Ken C. Cacciatore>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a question. You've always been friendly in the way you've

bit less friendly. And just also wondering, do you characterize what's going on in the industry right now as a unique

window in time, in terms of assets available and interest rates that you could borrow at? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah, Ken. I think that's a good question. I think we've always viewed ourselves as a
team that does friendly deals. I think that's particularly important when you're buying businesses where people matter.
And integrations in and of themselves tend to fail more than half the time, and I think when you do one in a hostile
environment, they tend to fail almost all the time.
People have been trained to hate each other for months and perhaps years during a hostile fight. The rhetoric is ramped
up and a lot of value could be destroyed in losing key talent and key relationships. And so I think we've always viewed
that our deals are about value creation, and when people matter, we're not going to do a deal that would be value
destroying.
I think, that being said, you never want to say never, so there are opportunities where people don't matter. I'll go to an
extreme example, when you're just going out and buying a file, like we did with eluxadoline, certainly the people of
Furiex are incredibly important, but there are only a handful of people. And could you conceive in the future doing
something like that with a little bit more aggressive posture if you had to, maybe you would, because the people are
less important to a transaction like that. But not our style, not something I think you'd see us do, but you never want to
be backed into a corner and say never on something.
And I think with respect to the time, I do think it's a bit of a unique window. I think given the need for consolidation
and what's happening in our industry, coupled with a low interest rate environment and relatively available capital,
companies that aren't investing for long-term value creation and long-term growth are missing an opportunity. And I
think you got to distinguish that with just going out and buying stuff. There are a lot of people who are looking at low
growth or declining assets and they're not going to create value over the long-term. They may create accretion in the
short-term, but they're not going to create value over the long-term.
And I think as you look at the types of deals we've done, whether it be Actavis-Forest, or Durata or Furiex or Rhythm
Health, Inc., we're looking at buying long-term, value-creating assets and things that are going to drive growth for our
shareholders over the long-term. And I think if you miss this window as a company or management team as a CEO,
you're going to regret it, if you just used your money to buy shares and pay dividends. I think you've not deployed your
capital wisely.

Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just, Brent, perhaps along those lines,
just curious in terms of the company's commitment to maintain its investment grade rating and also sort of thinking
about leverage in the context of potentially sort of additional transformational deals. And then just one quick follow up.
If you could provide like a same store organic growth number for the quarter, that would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So I think with respect to our investment grade, Todd said it in the script, we are
committed to maintaining our investment grade. We think that that's an important asset for us for the long term. And
that's something that we are absolutely focused on. We don't think that impairs our ability to do large deals. We think
there are lots of different ways to get things done, and we generate a lot of cash. So we know we can continue to
de-lever and use our capital both strategically and in a disciplined way.
I think with respect to organic growth, we clearly focus on that internally. We don't provide an external number. But I
think you can look at the growth we're seeing across the board in our products. You're seeing 17 products in our North
American Brand business, that drives 90% of our sales. When you look at those top 17 products, 14 of them are
growing year-over-year and some of them, like Linzess, up 100% year-over-year. Daliresp, 23%; Tudorza, 70%; even
Namenda is up 6% year-over-year. So very, very strong growth.

I think on the Generic and International business, you're seeing strong base business trends in the United States. You're
seeing that our commitment to our first-to-file pipeline leading the industry again, and frankly, statistically, if you look
at it, we're almost beating all of our key competitors combined. Canada, we're now in the top five, Russia for us has got
year-over-year growth in the same period of over 32% on revenue and 64% on profit. So we know that our business is
firing on all cylinders across the board and growing and we have strong momentum and we believe that will continue

Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Good morning. I have a longer-term strategic question for Brent and perhaps Paul. I'll
skip the "Actergan" question for now. I was curious how important you think biologics are, branded, generic or
otherwise, to your long-term vision and is the arrangement with Amgen just the tip of the iceberg of what you need to
do to ensure success? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So is that like "Bennifer"? You coined the first new phrase there.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Just wanted to get it on the record.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah, right. Look, I think biologics are incredibly important to us, on both the brand and
biosimilar generic side. And I can ask David Nicholson to comment as well. But look, our partnership with Amgen, I've
said it many times, is a terrific partnership. I've said it to Paul, even with the benefit of hindsight, it was the absolute
right decision and smart way for us to enter the biosimilar arena. Our teams have learned a lot from Amgen. I think
hopefully Amgen would say they've learned a lot from us, and the collaboration is strong. And we're looking very
carefully about expanding our relationship with Amgen as well as investing in the future biosimilars.
I think as you think about our generic business, clearly the growth in generics are going to come from our ability to
execute on hard-to-make smaller products that in combination will drive tremendous growth. The next frontier in
respiratory, and then after, that it's biosimilars. So we need to – for our long-term growth profile, we need to be in the
biosimilar space and we need to continue to invest. And that may be with Amgen, and that may also be on our own.
On the branded side, as we continue to move ourselves up the innovation curve, we've learned a lot about biologics
with our biosimilar experience, but we also have people like David who've done biologic development in the past. And
so we have a team in our R&D organization on the brand side that know how to do it, and if we could find the right
project with the right risk profile and the right innovation, we'd be very open to it. I don't know David, if you'd add any
thoughts to that?
<A - C. David Nicholson>: Thanks, Brent. Yeah. I think basically you nailed it. In my view, in today's R&D space, we
need to have the expertise in our organization to be able to work with both small molecules as well as with large
molecules, if we're going to capitalize on our therapeutic area of expertise. I think working in the biosimilar space is a
valuable and relatively low risk route into building expertise with large molecules and delivering products to the
market. The team here at Actavis loves working with Amgen, really building our expertise, and as you said, Brent, it
would be great to – from an R&D perspective as well as hopefully from a commercial perspective – to build on that
collaboration. We already have two projects in Phase 3 development, going well.

primary care space in particular, given some of the commentary from some of your larger and smaller peers recently?
How focused are you on this? And I'm interested in what you're hearing from peers. Thanks very much.
<A - William J. Meury>: Hey, Liav. It's a good question. I think to a great extent, the pricing pressures have been
built in to our projections going forward. It's fairly customary right now for health plans to incorporate some type of
price protection into contracts. In fact, for all of our major products, we have some degree of price protection. And so
we've appropriately captured that in our financial estimates.
I think one of the benefits that we have right now is, generally speaking, all of our products are at a very economical
price point relative to alternatives. I also think that most health plans consider us fairly predictable in the way we take
increases, which helps us when we're attempting to get our products put on formulary. And if you just look at the
numbers right now, for most of our key primary care products, we have unrestricted coverage rates that range from,
let's say 60% upwards of – for a product like Namenda XR, or even by Bystolic, upwards of 85%, 90%. And it's
something we're just going to have to manage moving forward, and be very realistic about what we expect from price
over the next several years.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I think the other thing, Liav, is, with our best-in-class field force, we continue to expand
users. So you have drugs like Bystolic with 300,000 writers, that helps in terms of having leverage with the plans
because obviously they need to minimize member disruption as well.

<Q - David R. Risinger>: Exactly. That's why it's so important to keep it going.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: That's why [ph] we've got handcuffs on him (43:52) right next to the chair. No -
<Q - David R. Risinger>: So my question relates to future deals. I just wanted to get a sense for whether a shareholder
vote matters or not, meaning will you try to avoid a shareholder vote on future deals, which could potentially trigger
some sort of an interloper? So if you could comment on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. I mean, I think we're going to follow the rules. We always take the high road, and
we always do what's right. And to the extent we do a deal that requires us to have a shareholder vote, we're – we
wouldn't do the deal if we didn't think our shareholders would be supportive. We're a very shareholder-oriented
management team. We try to always keep in mind that everything we do is for the benefit of our shareholders, and our
colleagues and patients, and in that order. And so, we would never do anything to try to slip one by our shareholders or
anything like that, David. We're – I think we're pretty straightforward when it comes to that. If the deal couldn't survive
a shareholder vote, then we shouldn't be doing it.

<Q - Chris Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple quick ones here. First, just following up on, I think,
Doug's question from earlier, is there a leverage ceiling we should think about for the company given that commitment
you've talked about earlier to investment grade, and just where is that ceiling? The second question is just a longer term
one. When you look out over time and the branded business continues to grow, Actavis becomes a much larger
company, does this hybrid brand/generic portfolio for the company continue to make sense? Or does there come a time
at some point in the future where it maybe makes sense to separate these businesses into more of a traditional brand
business and traditional generic portfolio? Thanks very much.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. So we have kind of a soft ceiling of 3.5 times leverage that we tend
to look at. As Todd said and I answered in the earlier question, we are absolutely focused on maintaining our
investment grade. To the extent we would have to go over 3.5 times, we'd probably want to make sure the rating
agencies were onboard, that we had a plan to de-lever rapidly so that we could get back into investment grade. So I
think you'd see us potentially try to – if the deal was right and strong strategic deal, and the financials made a lot of
sense, try to do it in a way that would maintain our investment grade. We don't believe that's any kind of obstacle for us
to doing what we think we need to do. So that's kind of where we stand.
I think in terms of long-term, do these businesses together make sense? They do. I think we've seen nothing but our
expectations exceeded in terms of how these businesses have come together. When you look at how the team is
working together, how opportunities in R&D have been strengthened by our combined expertise, how our ability to go
to our customers has only been strengthened by understanding their needs in a more robust way, our ability to execute
in markets around the world with a blended portfolio, and as the lines in the U.S. will probably continue to blur and
who the real customer ultimately is, and the consolidation of the customer base, it's, we think, strategic to have a broad,
diverse offering.
I think that being said, over the long-term, and we're talking now several years out, we're always going to be open to
value creation for shareholders, because that's how we run the company. So if there's another configuration of the
company in the distant future that creates value or unlocks value, we're going to listen to that, think about it and make
the right decision.
Operator
All right. And your next question will come from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks, guys. I just have two quick ones. Brent, are you seeing evidence at this
point that the primary care overlaid to the specialty selling process is adding to results? And then, the follow-up would
be to Paul. Any update on Revlimid and how you're thinking about that opportunity? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure. I think on the primary care, I would tell you that we absolutely believe that that's a
strategic asset. I think as everyone else has run away from primary care, we look at it as where all the volume is. And
so you need to get adoption in the specialty, but you're going to drive volume in primary care. But perhaps Bill could
weigh in on that as well.
<A - William J. Meury>: I think there's an interplay between primary care and specialists in many categories. Big
categories like depression, hypertension, most of the GI markets, and even in women's health, that you can only
capitalize on if you have coverage of both audiences at the same – and I think you see that in the numbers. I mean four
of our top five products, when you look at quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year, trends are fairly strong. And then
when there's a pure specialty play, as is the case in neurology or dermatology or infectious disease, we're fully
resourced to take advantage of that. I think it's difficult now given, as Brent mentioned, the blending of customers,
whether it's brand or generic or even primary care and specialty, to not have both capabilities.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I think with respect to Revlimid, I'll turn it over to Paul, but I would be remiss if I didn't
say that patents only get weaker with time.

There's been a lot written about that. I think our view is that we certainly – I think we advanced the ball. We're going to
continue to pursue this litigation with all deliberate speed and I think it was – as I have continually said, our case only
gets better from here. So we're looking forward to finding a – hopefully a resolution at some point, but if not, we'll

Your next question will come from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Hi, good morning, and congratulations on very nice quarter. Question I am getting a lot these days
is about value that you can add in a vertical that you're currently not participating in. Brent, you mentioned strategic fit
is very good. If you were to buy into another vertical, call it, let's say optology, would you – how would you – what
would be the kind of synergies that you could generate in a vertical like this. And if I can sneak one for Todd. Todd,
we're all doing kind of the math on your leverage. If we kind of look a year or two out and just take out all the one
timers, what's the kind of ballpark free cash you guys could generate?
<A - Robert Todd Joyce>: So in terms of the cash flow, we've given prior guidance on 2015 and we think we can
generate over $4 billion of free cash flow in 2015. We had a strong current quarter if you take out the onetime items,
we're approaching almost $800 million. We're going to – as I mentioned in the script, we're going to be, even with
some onetime items in the fourth quarter, we expect to be roughly around $900 million of operating cash flow. So cash
flow generation strong, de-levering at the end of this year roughly three times, at the end of the next year, two times. So
solid from a balance sheet and cash flow perspective.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: I think as you hypothetically think about entering new verticals, I think there are
obviously always cost synergies and back office any time you enter a market. There's sales training to sales
administration, samples management, compliance, HR, all that type of stuff, which is pretty typical for anyone. But I
think you have to – it's very vertical dependent. But back, let's say, when I was at Bausch & Lomb, for example, there
were plenty of products that if we could have taken to primary care during, let's say, allergy season, [ph] Apria (53:24),
for example, that we had for an antihistamine eye drop.
We had no ability to drive that into primary care during allergy season where they see a lot of that. Other things like
pink eye, when you have a good anti-infective, you need to drive that into pediatricians and primary care, and we
couldn't do that. So I think there are always opportunities. You got to look at it vertical-specific, product line-specific,
but we've – I think we've always shown in every situation that we're in, we look at it holistically, we look at it across all
of our assets whether it's using Anda for direct distribution to a customer, whether it's our generic capability to do
formulation and lifecycle management work, whether it's our branded business to drive things into a large prescriber
base. Those are all assets that when deployed right can bring a lot of leverage to anything you do.

<Q - Umer Raffat>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a quick question on Namenda. So I know you
mentioned you're expecting to do a hard switch by January 2015, assuming the injunction isn't granted in favor of New
York Attorney General. So my question is this, are there other states and other state attorney generals that have made
preliminary requests for hard switch detail? And are you expecting to see any other lawsuits come up in the next couple
months before a hard switch actually happens?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. First, I'm surprised that we got to number 11, Umer, and think -- that was the first
Namenda question. But I'll turn it to Bob Bailey just to quickly comment on that, our General Counsel.
<A - Ambrose Robert Douglas Bailey>: Sure. Thanks. In terms of other states asking for additional information, the
State of Texas has made a request at this point, but it's not on a timeline similar to the state of New York.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So I think the short answer is New York is the litigation you need to watch.
<Q - Umer Raffat>: Okay. Great. And just to be clear, if they block you, is it New York only that gets blocked or
nationwide?

correlation is on great CEOs, great stock prices, performance, and great CFOs. So big shoes to fill. Brent, can you talk
a little bit about the integration process? So the results were very strong, cost cuts are coming in ahead of schedule, but
where do you think you are on the sales force rationalization from an effectiveness standpoint versus where you want to
be? And when you think of the R&D rationalization process that you mentioned, will this be a major shift or just a
pruning and do you think the end result will be more to limit the rate of growth or will it be to reduce the current
spending rate? Thank you.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah, no. David, I think as you think about our integration of Forest-Actavis, we're, I
think, firing on all cylinders, the teams have deep experience from both companies on how to do integrations, I think
you're seeing that demonstrated in spades in our ability to execute with excellence. We have essentially taken most of
the big actions necessary for the integration. You'll see that play out as it builds upon itself in terms of synergies
throughout 2015.
But my sense is, in terms of decisions and actions taken, we're largely done. It's now about letting that flow through and
hit our P&L. There is some work to be done in some international markets still, but in terms of rough guidance, we're
probably 85%, 90% done, as we go into 2015, with the big decisions, and we'll just do some cleanup that requires a
longer lead time after that.
I think in terms of the sales force, we're basically done. We did all the heavy lifting in August and September; we did a
lot of the training in September and October. The field force is settled, they're trained, they're fired up. I got to meet
with about, what was it, 900 of the managers a few weeks ago. We had a great town hall with them, Bill had a great

<A - William J. Meury>: Yeah. Brent's right. Our aim was to be done with this by basically September, and we were.
Other than sales trends, which are the ultimate measure of effectiveness, we're looking closely at turnover, vacancy and
call activity. And it's all right where it needs to be. I mean, the sales force delivers on a per day basis, our per rep per
day basis more sales calls than any other sales force in the industry. And so, we like where we are right now, we were
fair but decisive when it came to integrating.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And I think Bill didn't say this, but we took the opportunity to create the strongest sales
force in the industry. And I think the talent level in our sales force is the highest, their commitment is the highest, they
outwork everybody else and it's an absolute strategic asset. And unlike, I think, some of our competitors, we internally
place a lot of value on our sales force. We're not shy about it, we know that they're sales representatives, we expect
them to sell in accordance with the rules and the laws and our compliance guidelines, but they're sales representatives
and they're professionals, they're well trained. We're trying to treat them more as therapeutic experts, they like that,
they like the professional development we give for them. And so I think we're poised to do great things with our sales
force.
<Q - David W. Maris>: And on the R&D rationalization process?
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Yeah. So that's ongoing as David and Bob Stewart continue to look at the portfolio. I
don't think you're going to see a huge move. I think you're going to see thoughtful, realistic planning. We're going to
invest behind those things that we believe have a higher success of being approved and become products, but also have
a commercial opportunity. As we've talked about, me-too drugs and the fifth or sixth drug coming into a category are
just not going to be successful anymore. So we want to make sure we're driving innovation and we're driving things
that we believe are worth spending our money on. I don't know, Bob, David, anything you want to add?
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Well, I think what you're seeing also, too, is the benefits of the integration as we've talked
about before. When you take the best of one organization, you put it up against the best of another organization, you're
seeing good synergy in terms of formulation development, you're seeing good synergy in terms of clinical expertise.
And we're able to leverage the strengths of what each organization has brought forward here to create an overall
product – more productive R&D organization. And I see – and I think you see some of that coming through already
with some of the spending favorability.
<A - David A. Buchen>: Yeah. I would just caution, too, the integration of the R&D organization is ahead of where
we want it to go to. It's not that we're not willing to invest in – we had said we'd spend about $1.2 billion, and I think
that's where we'll get to. And if we have more things to spend behind, because we think they're value creating, we'll do
that, and if we have things that we don't think are worth spending on, we'll spend less. We're not going to peg ourselves
to a number, and then just spend recklessly against that number. We're going to look at each project, and each
opportunity, and make sure we're building our business for the long-term.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Great. Thank you very much.

And today's final question will come from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Well, I guess I'll ask a few then.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: You get the final word, Marc.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: So, I guess, first of all, Brent, can you talk about the Namenda franchise big picture? How
should we look at this? How do you look at it over the next three years or four years? You got a $400-ish million a
quarter, so call it $1.6 billion. What kind of step down are you thinking about in 2015 as you make this transition?
And then, as we move into 2016, there's the potential that you have XR with the 30-month stay, and obviously you
have the combo that's going to come in, so how should we be thinking about this franchise two years, three years, four
years down the line? Second question is, maybe you could also talk about this new opportunity in the antibiotic

coming, the...
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Dalvance?
<Q - Marc Goodman>: No. No. The Caz-Avi opportunity, the combo, and obviously Cubist has a pretty strong
franchise there. So how do you think about this, and how it plays out, and what kind of ramp should we be expecting
there, and how competitively is it? And then, I guess I'll ask a third question since I have it, is can you talk about the
key generic product launches in 2015, and any notable cases we need to be watching? Thanks.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Sure. I guess that's why you went last, Marc. Three good questions. So look, on
Namenda, we're absolutely committed to the Alzheimer's space. We're committed to investing for innovation for this
horrible epidemic. And as you think about Namenda, we're going to continue to drive Namenda XR as the most
innovative product that we have. We're going to continue to promote it. We've talked about a DTC campaign to expand
the market. And what's interesting, if you look at Namenda year-over-year, you're seeing very positive growth in
market expansion, when it declined last year, and it's grown this year. And so, we believe that with the right DTC
outreach, with the right product, Namenda XR once daily dosing, we can continue to expand the market.
That being said, when the generics enter in the late summer of 2015, it will become a highly competitive marketplace.
The generics will be – generic competitors will be all over trying to switch patients back to IR. They'll have many
benefits of state switching laws and others on their side. And so we're going to continue to hang our hat at our
innovation, we're going to launch our fixed dose combination that will really simplify the pill burden for patients. We
know that that's important in this population. We know that resonates with caregivers and physicians. And so, we're
going to continue to drive that innovation. And we're going to look to continue to extend our franchise in Alzheimer's
with either other innovations around delivery, memantine, or perhaps in other areas, and David and his team are
looking at other ways to, for us to maintain our position in Alzheimer's. I don't know, Bill, if you had other thoughts on
this.
<A - William J. Meury>: I think that's right. I would just also keep in mind that only 30% of Alzheimer's patients
today receive a combination of Namenda and Aricept. And if you take a look at the guidelines or even were to survey
the neurology community, that figure could easily be upwards of 50% or 60%. So I think there's a lot of upside as it
relates to the fixed dose combination. The trends on XR look very good because it's more attractive product to
caregivers and physicians. And I think the DTC campaign should be very well received too.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: Do you want to comment on Caz-Avi, [ph] Chris (1:05:22)?
<A>: Yeah, the unmet medical need right now in hospitals for infections caused by gram-negative bacteria is as high as
it was for gram positive bacteria or MRSA infections over 10 years ago. Ceftazidime/avibactam is one of only two
products that will cover three different gram-negative pathogens that's pseudomonas, ESBLs and KPCs. The only other
product is colistin, which doesn't have a great benefit risk ratio.
And so, this is going to be used primarily in the ICU for very serious infections. It complements Teflaro. It
complements Dalvance. We have a great deal of capability right now in the hospital market. Our sales force is terrific.
They have a great deal of experience. And so, the expectations on ceftazidime/avibactam are very high. And as it
relates to Cubist, I would just say that there's room for two alternatives in this market. That product will perhaps be
more focused on pseudomonas whereas we're more focused on KPCs.
<A - Brenton L. Saunders>: And then, David, do you want to comment on key generic launches.
<A - David A. Buchen>: Yeah. Sure. I mean first of all, I'll repeat something Brent mentioned. We do have the, what I
believe is the industry's best pipeline with well over 200 ANDAs pending at the FDA, 60 which are first file. We have
so many shots on goal that we think we will be very successful. If you look out over the next 12 to 18 months, we've
got some big launches coming up that we're gearing up for, including generic versions of OxyContin and Celebrex,
INTUNIV, Daytrana patch, Androgel, and of course in 2016, Crestor, which is going to be a big one. And then if you
look at some of our pending lawsuits, we've got Pulmicort, we've got Epiduo, we've got the Xopenex HFA product, as
well as the Suboxone thin film, Fortesta and testing the testosterone-related products. So very, very strong pipeline both

Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Okay. Thank you, everyone. Brent, do you have any closing comments?
Brenton L. Saunders
Yeah. Lisa, thank you. I'd just like to underscore a couple quick things. First, I want to thank Todd, although he is not
leaving so quickly. I think his track record in 17 years here have been nothing but a sign of excellence. And to be fair,
I've said this many times, a sign of a great leader is seen and evidenced by the team that surrounds that person, and our
finance team at Actavis under Todd is best in class and that's just a demonstration of his leadership and commitment to
excellence.
Second, I would just say we're very pleased with the quality of our quarter. We saw strong momentum in 2014. We
expect that that momentum will continue into 2015 and we're excited to update you as regularly scheduled and this will
include our R&D update as well as our business update at the fourth quarter earnings call. So we thank you for your
time and we look forward to keeping you updated.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Thank you.
