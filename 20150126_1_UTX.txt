This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from UTC's website at
www.utc.com. Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise noted.
They will also speak to segmented results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do.
The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking
statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K
reports provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in
the forward-looking statements. Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two
questions per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting
yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permits.
Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thank you and good evening, everyone. I appreciate everyone's flexibility in accommodating our changed
schedule tonight for the snowstorm, which is quickly coming upon us. Let me start out and talk to us briefly about 2014
and then I'm going to hand it to Akhil. But as you can see from the press release that went out earlier this evening, 2014

is largely in line with the expectations we laid out last month at our investor event in New York.
Before we get to the results, though, I would like to take a minute and introduce or re-introduce Akhil Johri, our new
CFO. Akhil has been on the job for a few weeks now, but you'll recall he is a 26-year veteran of United Technologies
recently out of sabbatical as CFO of the Pall Corporation. He knows the business as well and is highly respected both
within UTC and externally. Needless to say we are excited to have him back on the team.
Akhil and [ph] Paul (2:05) will take you through the results and I'll come back with some thoughts on the year and
2015 before we get into the Q&A. Akhil? You have the floor.
Akhil Johri
Thanks, Greg. It is a pleasure to be back. UTC reported 2014 earnings per share of $6.82, up 10% versus the prior year
and up 12% excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. Sales of $65 billion included 4% organic growth
with all five segments growing organically for the year. Segment operating margins expanded by 90 basis points to
16.6%, reflecting the benefit of volume leverage and cost control at CCS, along with lower pension expense, synergies
and restructuring benefits at Pratt and UTC Aerospace Systems. Free cash flow to net income was 90% for the year as
we had indicated in December, and we completed $1.5 billion of share repurchase.
Moving on to slide 2, top-line growth continues. Organic sales were up 4% in the fourth quarter. Recall that Q4 of 2013
was our most difficult compare. So we feel really good about 4% organic as we exit 2014.
In the commercial businesses, we saw 8% growth in the Americas as the U.S. economic recovery continues. While
Europe was up slightly, Asia grew 7% with continued growth in China where sales were up 10%. Growth in
commercial aero OE was offset by lower commercial aftermarket sales at Pratt and Sikorsky. Military aerospace was
up 7%, led by the timing of OEM deliveries at both Sikorsky and Pratt, partially offset by a weaker aftermarket across
the segments.
Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide 3, and just as a reminder, we'll talk to the commercial business orders
on a constant currency basis as we usually do. So, overall trends remain consistent with our expectations throughout the
portfolio. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good traction in North America. U.S. consumer sentiment
reached its highest level in nearly eight years in December on lower gas prices and better wage and job prospects. ABI
trends remain positive and the outlook for commercial construction continues to be encouraging. And this is evident at
Otis where North America and new equipment orders were up 20% in the quarter and 40% for the year.
At CCS, orders for U.S. fire and security products and U.S. commercial HVAC equipment was strong, up 18% and
12% respectively. U.S. residential HVAC orders were down slightly year-over-year following a very strong Q3, while
sales were up 9%. Europe was soft again in the quarter, with commercial HVAC orders down 9% and Otis new
equipment orders down 3%. As you saw on Thursday, the ECB announced a significant new quantitative easing
program, aimed at stimulating economic activity in the region. In China, Otis new equipment orders were up 2% in the
fourth quarter, and finished up 6% for the full year. New equipment backlog remains strong, up 13% versus the prior
year. While we expect overall economic output in China to moderate, it should still outpace global GDP and our
Building & Industrial Systems businesses continue to be well-positioned in the region. As a reminder, however, China
domestic sales represent just about 6% of total UTC sales.
Moving to aerospace, revenue passenger miles continue to grow at slightly above the long-term trend rate and airline
profitability remains strong. At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial aftermarket sales went up 5%, driven by
continuing strength in spares. At Pratt & Whitney, total commercial aftermarket sales were down 6% in the quarter on a
tough prior year compare and in line with our expectations.
Taking a look at fourth quarter earnings on slide 4, total reported sales increased 1% as 4% organic growth was
partially offset by three points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Segment operating profit was up 10%, and operating
margins increased by 120 basis points, including the benefits from pension, and we saw profit growth and margin
expansion in all segments during the quarter. Earnings per share of $1.62 were up 3% and included a $0.26 net charge

from restructuring and other one-time items. That's about $0.24 related to the German tax matter that Greg discussed
last month and $0.09 of restructuring that was partially offset by $0.07 of one-time gains in the quarter. Recall that the
fourth quarter of 2013 had $0.09 of net restructuring charges. Absent the impact of these items in both years, earnings
per share were up 13%.
Free cash flow in the quarter was 119% of net income. Capital expenditures were $557 million as we continue to invest
for the ramp in commercial aerospace. We acquired $405 million of stock under our share repurchase program, and we
made nearly $300 million in voluntary pension plan contributions in the quarter.
One other item to note in Q4, the impact from sudden significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most
currencies created a translation effects related EPS headwind of about $0.04, entirely wiping out the small benefit we
had seen in the first three quarters.
The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has an even larger impact as we look at 2015. As you can see on slide 5, the U.S.
dollar has continued to strengthen not just against the euro, but against most other currencies as well. In fact, at a $1.10
euro, which is a little less than today's rates, we have almost $0.25 of headwind that wasn't contemplated in the initial
EPS guidance that we discussed back in December. The incremental negative sales impact from translation effects is
expected to be around $1.5 billion. We also saw a further dip in the global discount rates for pension expense. On our
measurement date of December 31, the U.S. discount rate was 3.9%, about 30 basis points lower than expected, adding
to another $0.06 of EPS headwind, net of slightly better asset returns and $200 million of cash contribution to the U.S.
pension plan. So all together, $0.30 or so of new, non-operational headwind.
Based on this, we are updating our 2015 sales and earnings expectations, as you can see on slide 6. As always, we
remain focused on what we can control. We are now targeting $3 billion of share repurchase at the high end of our
prior range. This take additional cost actions, and at the midpoint of the new range, we now have no contingency.
Together, these actions should offset half of the $0.30 headwind. So we now expect EPS of $6.85 to $7.05 on sales of
about $65 billion to $66 billion, down from our previous expectation of $7 to $7.20 EPS on sales of $66 billion to $67
billion. However, to make it clear, nothing has fundamentally changed in the health of the underlying businesses. Just
as we told you in December, strong operating leverage across the business should still allow us to deliver segment
earnings growth of $0.57 at the midpoint, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and pension headwinds in 2015,
and with no growth at Pratt. That's 8% growth operationally. And we will work to rebuild some contingency as we
move throughout the year.
With that, let me turn it over to [ph] Paul (10:45) to take you through the segment results.
Unverified Participant
Okay. Thanks, Akhil. We're now on page 7. Otis sales improved 5% in the quarter at constant currency, led by
double-digit new equipment growth noticed most notably in China and the Americas. Service sales were up slightly.
Overall, foreign exchange translation was a five-point headwind to the top-line in the quarter. Foreign exchange was
also a profit headwind, a full six points.
Operationally, Otis performance in Q4 was solid with operating profit up 7% at constant currency. Profit growth in the
quarter was driven by contributions from higher volume and productivity initiatives, most notably from strong
performance in the Americas and in Asia. We did see continued pricing pressure in the quarter, both in Europe service
and in China.
New equipment orders were up 12% in the quarter at constant FX. Asia was up 16%, driven by a large order in
Singapore, the Thomson Line transit project, and we saw low single-digit growth in China. New equipment orders
continued to be strong in the Americas where orders were again up double-digit, and for the second year in a row, we
closed the year with double-digit increases in new equipment backlog. For the full year, operating profit was up 4% or
about $100 million at constant currency on 6% higher organic sales. FX translation for the year had a two-point
unfavorable impact on both sales and profit.

Turning to page 8, Climate Controls and Security had good traction in the fourth quarter with 5% organic sales growth.
We saw strength in the Americas with residential HVAC and fire and security product businesses both reporting high
single digit growth, and commercial HVAC up mid single-digit. Outside of the U.S., EMEA grew low single-digit and
Asia was up slightly. Commercial refrigeration was up mid single-digit while Transicold was up high single-digit,
driven by solid growth in container and North America truck/trailer.
At constant currency, profit was up 6% in the quarter, driven by contribution from organic volume growth. FX
translation represented three points of headwind in the quarter. Margin was up 50 basis points from prior year to 15.7%,
continuing the CCS margin expansion momentum. CCS global equipment orders were strong, up 11% in the quarter,
driven largely by Transicold, which saw more than 50% growth. Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were up
mid single-digit, driven by the Americas.
Orders for global fire and security products finished the year strong, and were again up high single-digit based on
strength in the Americas, and global fire and security field orders were up 5% with growth in all geographies including
Europe. For the full year, operating profit was up 10% at constant currency on 3% organic sales growth, achieving
record margins of 17%, up 130 basis points from prior year. As Akhil mentioned, we do see significant headwind from
foreign exchange, both at CCS and at Otis. Geraud will come back in March to talk about specific guidance for those
two units.
Moving to Pratt & Whitney on slide 9, Pratt delivered solid results in Q4 with 12% operating profit growth despite
continued investments in E&D, and a 2% sales decline. In the quarter, 4% growth in military engines was more than
offset by a 6% lower commercial aftermarket. Recall that in Q4 of 2013, the commercial aftermarket business was
particularly strong, up 24%. Operating profit growth was driven by favorable pension and restructuring benefits. The
quarter also benefited from better aftermarket contract performance, which helped to offset lower aftermarket volume
in the quarter. Margins were up 170 basis points to 13.8%.
For the year, Pratt delivered organic sales growth of 2%, driven by mid single-digit growth in the commercial
aftermarket. Incremental investments in E&D were more than offset by tailwind from pension restructuring savings and
a stronger aftermarket, both from higher volume and better contract performance. These led to operating profit growth
of $200 million for Pratt with 140 basis points of margin expansion. This is at the high end of the original guide.
Turning to slide 10, UTC Aerospace Systems continued its strong momentum growing profits 17% on 5% higher
organic sales in the quarter. Commercial OEM sales were up 7% and commercial aftermarket sales increased 5% with
strong growth in spares even on a difficult compare. Similar to Pratt, the commercial aftermarket had a very strong
finish to 2013, which led to difficult Q4 comparison.
Military sales continued to be soft with the military OEM essentially flat and a low single-digit decline in the
aftermarket. Profit growth was driven by strong conversion on the incremental volume, integration synergies and the
benefit of lower pension expense. Operating margins increased 180 basis points to 17.6%. For the full year, sales were
up 7% and operating profit was up $327 million or 15% resulting in 130 basis points of margin expansion, in line with
our original expectations.
A strong full year organic growth of 6% reflects the UTC Aerospace Systems's position in a large and growing
commercial aerospace segment. The earnings growth and margin expansion followed a continued successful integration
of Goodrich, which is now yielding run rate savings of $400 million with line-of-sight visibility to $500 million.
Turning to Sikorsky on page 11, operating profit increased 38% on 10% higher sales. Sikorsky shipped a total of 72
aircraft in the quarter including 57 military platforms and 15 commercial. Overall, aircraft shipments were down five
compared to the prior year, but aircraft completion volume, that's the aircraft customization that occurs following
baseline aircraft delivery, those completions were up significantly driven primarily by international military programs.
We also saw growth in our development programs as a number of recently awarded programs, including the U.S.
presidential helicopter have began their development ramp. The operating profit increase was driven by the impact of
higher international military volume, better mix on commercial OE volumes and favorable contract adjustments,
partially offset by the drop-through from lower commercial aftermarket volume and unfavorable mix in the military

aftermarket.
For the year, strong international military and commercial OEM sales coupled with the ramp of funded development
programs drove sales 6% higher at Sikorsky. Adjusted for restructuring and special items, operating profit of $699
million was up 9%.
With that, let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thanks, [ph] Paul (18:15). So all in all, pretty good year for UTC. You think the business units delivered solid
margin expansion to 16.6% and we grew EPS 10% despite a slower than expected global economic environment.
Beyond the financial results, we also continue to achieve significant milestones on development programs and to secure
key wins for the future.
With the Goodrich integration now largely complete, we recently announced the elimination of the Propulsion &
Aerospace Systems organization. Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems will continue as standalone business
units, but now, reporting directly to me. This new streamlined structure better positions us to serve customers and to
focus on ensuring a successful entry into service and production ramp-up of our Geared Turbofan engine and the
numerous aircraft systems designed and developed by the UTAS team.
At Pratt & Whitney, the GTF engine completed FAA certification for the Airbus A320neo platform on December 19.
The certification marks a key milestone for the engine and the A320neo program, which remains on schedule to enter
into service in the fourth quarter of this year. And we continue to make good progress on the more than 35 new system
programs underway at UTC Aerospace Systems.
In 2014, we achieved major milestones including the entry into service on the Boeing 787-9, and the certification of the
A350. At Sikorsky, another major win in the quarter, India's Navy selected Sikorsky to fulfill the service's maritime
helicopter requirement, and negotiations are currently underway with the Indian Navy to procure 16 S-70B
SEAHAWK helicopters with an option for eight additional aircraft, along with a complete logistics, support and
training program. This represents a major step forward for Sikorsky in an important growth market, and positions the
business well for future opportunities there.
The Building & Industrial Systems businesses had another solid quarter with both Otis and CCS delivering 5% organic
sales growth. We feel really good about the progress we've seen in both segments. CCS organic growth has accelerated
while delivering 290 basis points of margin expansion since 2012, and Otis profits are growing again after a couple of
very difficult years. So good momentum across the board that's going to allow us to deliver solid organic growth in
2015. The growth rate exiting the year gives us confidence in our sales assumption of 3% to 5% organic growth in
2015, and we expect continued recovery in our North American markets, slight growth in Europe and moderated but
still solid growth in China and Asia.
As Akhil mentioned, we do have two headwinds this year that have worsened since we spoke in December, and as
much as I'd like to, I can't control the FX or the discount rates. Akhil hasn't figured out how to help me with that yet. As
usual, we'll do as much as we can to mitigate these headwinds, and that includes leaning out the corporate structure and
additional share buyback.
Lastly, we continue to make progress with our portfolio review, and as I promised, we'll discuss this in more detail over
the coming two months.
With that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: Good afternoon.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: When you describe the changes in guidance for the year, can you walk through how that
rolls out across the four different businesses compared to what you talked about in December?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure, Doug. I think for a more precise discussion, we'll wait for the President to stand up and talk
to you in March, but conceptually you know where this falls, right? That the FX headwind is largely going to be in the
BIS space, more heavily towards Otis, which has 80% of its sales internationally. And the pension headwind is going to
be more in the aerospace space where it'll be 40% or so at Pratt and the rest around UTAS and a little bit on the
commercial side. The good news of $0.15, which offsets half of that $0.30 headwind is going to be spread across on the
cost reduction side, across all the businesses a little bit, and at the corporate office as well, while the share count
reduction benefit will be more at the corporate office as you'll see a lower share count number.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: And if you look at the operational improvement part of this, so you're looking for – I'm not
sure how much of that $0.15 is operational improvements, but could you describe the kinds of actions you're taking that
perhaps you hadn't thought about back in December – you might have thought about, but weren't signing up for yet?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. I think obviously some of the announcements that have gone out over the last couple
of weeks are all part and parcel to this trying to lean out that corporate organization as well as lean out some of the
structures that we have on the aerospace side, specifically at the Aerospace Systems group. You'll recall, Doug, at
Aerospace Systems, we had two guys running the business – Dave Gitlin and Mike Dumais. We've consolidated all of
that under Mike, and we'll be consolidating all of the functional responsibilities over the coming weeks as well. So we'll
be taking out a significant amount of cost as we go through that. And obviously, eliminating Eileen's organization takes
a lot of cost out at the corporate level, some of which got allocated down to Pratt and UTAS. So all of this really
focused on leaning out the corporate and the overhead organization.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: But does that mean that most of this benefit is occurring on the aerospace side as opposed
to the BIS side?
<A - Akhil Johri>: BIS has already been working on that, as you know, over the last two integrations, if you will, first
fire, security into Carrier, and then now Otis with CCS. There has been a significant reduction in the overhead and the
management structure at those companies.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, if you think about it, Doug, Geraud has done on the commercial side what we're just
doing now on the aero side. I think we've taken out over 100 executives. For this one, we put fire and security into
Carrier, put that together under CCS, and then as we put the Otis business under the BIS banner, again, more and more
executives. And so Geraud has already leaned out the overhead structure in those businesses, and that's why you see the
margins where you do for BIS, why you see that very, very strong margin. It's – a lot of that's just cost reduction.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Doug.

<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Welcome back, Akhil.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Thanks, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: I actually just want to continue down that line there on the PAS elimination, I guess, of that
structure. Greg, a couple years ago when this organization was – stood up, I thought it was advertised as a cost saving
measure, and now it's being advertised again as a cost saving measure when it goes away. I'm just wondering if you
could explain a little more philosophically – excuse me. Which is it? And then you mentioned BIS as well. I'm
wondering if there's any larger scale changes that we might – that might be possible on these lines in that organization
as well.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, let's just talk about PAS. I mean originally, this was only about a couple of years when
we put Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand together, this is July of 2012. The idea was we put PAS in to oversee the
integration of those businesses, and to drive the $500 million of synergy benefit that we were expecting on the
acquisition. And I would tell you for the most part, that is complete. We've got about 400 of the 500 done, we've got
line-of-sight to the next $500 million, and more beyond that. So I think Eileen and that whole team did exactly what we
asked them to do in terms of driving cost reduction across.
Not – and it wasn't really just the Aerospace Systems. We also did significant cost reduction at Pratt, again, leaning out
the structure at Pratt to taking about a 20% reduction in the overheads at Pratt & Whitney over the last couple of years.
So they did exactly what we asked them to do. But again, time changes things and today, with that mission largely
complete, I thought it was best to have Paul from Pratt and to have Mr. Gitlin report directly to me. But it also gave me
the opportunity to take a guy like Mike Dumais, who did a wonderful job running his half of the Aerospace Systems
and bring them into the Corporate Strategy group and let him help me with this portfolio analysis. So this is a win-win,
I think, again, leaner organization, more focused. I get more line-of-sight to what's going on in the business, and the
business is getting less overhead costs to worry about.
As far as BIS, look, again, I would just go back to what I just said. I think Geraud has been doing what we're doing on
the aerospace side for the last three years there, or it started in 2011 when we put F&S into Carrier, again, significant
overhead reductions. The whole idea here is, again, not to have a lot of overhead. We don't need that. We want to a
decentralize organization, we want decision making close to the customer, and not at the corporate center. And my job
is not to tell these guys how to run the business. These guys know the customer. Each one of these guys at Otis, Carrier
and fire & security, they're out there on the front lines. Still, they just don't have that same overhead structure above
them, and I think Geraud would tell you he's got line-of-sight to a lot more clearly as to what's going on in the business
as a result of what he's already done.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. And a second question. A major event this year is the ramp-up of more work on GTF,
and you mentioned you got certified on Airbus. Can you, I guess, speak about the industrial part of the ramp-up that's
happening this year, and maybe give some context as to when you really feel like you can say we're hitting that – where
we should be on the learning curve from a manufacturing standpoint? And then secondly, from a cash flow standpoint,
if there's anything we should know about the profile as you ramp up throughout the year, will that impact the company
cash flow?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. So, Joe, let me just put it very simply. We're not going to be done until we're done.
But this year, we'll build about 85 engines for the Airbus neo platform. Next year, it'll be about 220, and it'll double
again in 2017. And so again, every time we double the engine production, we're coming down a learning curve. I think
by the time we get to about the 250th engine which is towards the middle of next year, we'll be pretty close or closing
in on target costs, not quite there. By the time we exit 2017, I think we'll be at or should be at target cost or somewhere
close to that, so a lot of work to do between here and there.
As I said, we're going to get additional negative engine margin this year, next year, and the following year, and then the
run rate actually levels out because the number of engine levels out and we continue to come down the cost curve. So,
we just did a whole review of the production readiness level at Pratt over the last week, had some of the best folks
around the business to take a look to make sure we were on track. And well, it's not without risk and there's a lot to do.

Got high confidence that the Pratt guys have their arms around this and we're going to be able to meet the production
needs at Airbus as well as Bombardier, as well as at Mitsubishi, as well as with Embraer in 2018. I mean a lot of work
to do, but a good process in place to make sure that we're going to get there at the right cost.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Just one minor correction, Joe, I think Greg said about 80 plus [indiscernible] (30:16) actually
more like 40 something for this year. And then the other point on your cash flow, I think there is clearly going to be
some stress as you've seen in our numbers for the last year or two. The aero ramp-up does add to the CapEx number
which has been above depreciation by a significant amount, and that's a number we watch very carefully. Obviously,
you know our gold standard is to be 100% of net income as free cash flow and last year, 2014 was not there. We still
have some pressure in 2015 as a result of that, but we are going to work very hard to take out some other things like
focusing on inventory and working capital to try and manage some of the CapEx requirements that exist in the business
from the aero ramp-up.

Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Just on the cost side, Greg or Akhil, but thinking about raw materials costs. You didn't address
that at all. And I would think in parts of your business, you could be getting some substantial relief. So maybe any
color there? And are there hedges or something that is kind of delaying potential positive impacts?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yes. Sure, Jeff. You know probably the biggest item is copper where you would expect a
significant saving there. We do hedge. We are hedged about 75% of our 2015 requirements at over $3, $3.05, if you
will. So there is really limited impact that we will see in the later part with the significant reduction in the copper that
has come about lately. But there is definitely going to be benefit on the oil side, the lower fuel costs both for jet fuels
that are used by our aerospace companies as well as in the large number of trucks and service vehicles that we have.
We should see some benefits there. We estimate maybe $50 million to $75 million of benefit which probably towards
the later part of the year help us build a little bit of our contingency back.
On the other hand, customers see the same papers that we do and the same report that we do, and there's likely to be
probably a little bit more pressure on the pricing side because they'll expect some of this to be passed through to them.
So we've got to balance both those things which is why we have not reflected that potential savings in our roadmap that
you saw on page 6.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: On the other key metals steel and aluminum, you're maybe not hedged per se, but are you kind
of indexed and contractually locked in there that you don't get any significant immediate benefit also?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, there's actually a little bit of headwind in aluminum right now. Iron ore and steel
prices have come down, but we don't really have a lot of hedges out there. We will see a little bit of benefit on steel, a
little bit of headwind on aluminum, which should pretty well offset each other, I would think, for the year.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And I was just wondering just back to where the prior question ended kind of on cash flow and
CapEx. So it looks like you actually throttled the CapEx back pretty hard relatively to the annual expectation here. Can
we go down from this $1.7 billion level in 2015? And how do we think about working capital in 2015?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Look, I think we have been looking at about a $2 billion number for CapEx going into last
year. I think the folks out on the businesses did a pretty good job of reducing that and trying to move some of that out.

Obviously, it puts a little bit of pressure on the $1.7 billion number that we've got this year, but we're not done. I think,
again, the CapEx investment will be what it needs to be. I think the bigger opportunity when I think about cash flow
goes back to working capital and goes back to inventory. We've got almost $10 billion of inventory out there. The turns
are not spectacular, and the focus has to be on improving turns and it's not in our factories. I will tell you our factories
are world-class. When they get the inventory, they can move it very quickly through the assembly and test process. The
issue is in the supply base where we don't have suppliers that all deliver 100% on time with 100% perfect quality.
As a result, we have a lot of buffer inventory at every level of the production process. So as one of the other benefits of
eliminating the PAS structure is operations is now going to report directly to me, and we've got a team under
[indiscernible] (34:42) who is very focused on supplier process improvement. And we're going to go after this
inventory reduction at its root cause, which I would tell you is supplier performance. If we can get our suppliers at the
same level of delivery and quality as our own factories, we can reduce inventory by a significant amount. And it's not
this year or next year, it's the next several years, but we're going to work at it. And I think that'll help us get back to that
100% of free cash flow and net income despite what is a little bit of elevated CapEx investment this year.

Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good afternoon.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Some of the additional cost reductions that you have talked about, does it change the plan in
terms of the $300 million worth of restructuring offset by $300 million in gains? Does that dynamic change at all
during the year?
<A - Akhil Johri>: No, Sam, we don't think so. We still think restructuring will be about $300 million for the year and
probably ratably across the quarters, $75 million each quarter, if you will.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then in total, what is your assumption about Europe right now? I know Greg said
slight growth, but is it different than it was in December and is it the same and it's just a translation issue, or have you
assumed a slower Europe at this point?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, despite the Greek elections on Sunday, I think generally – we think Europe will
probably be a little bit better with the quantitative easing that Mr. Draghi has initiated on top of the much lower fuel
prices, gas and oil. There's a natural stimulus that we ought to see in Europe this year that we didn't really see six weeks
ago when we were talking about Europe. So we say up slightly. It could be better. We had pockets of business that was
very good last year on the fire products side and Europe was very good. The service side, not as good. But again,
overall, I think we'll get better in Europe, we'll get better this year than what we had expected. So that may be a little bit
of upside.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then last question. This SEER 13 and you just talked about inventory, was there
any sort of a build in terms of the last of the manufacturing and what you could do this year? And does that all go back
out in 2015? Can you size that at all?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah. No, I think Greg mentioned this at the last call or the last meeting, about $115 million worth
of inventory buildup associated with the SEER 13. As you know, the regulations would say that we cannot produce any
more SEER 13 in 2015. So all that inventory was on our balance sheet at the end of December and will be sold through
the early part of this year, we expect.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. And that's just for those parts of the country that can't – we can't sell SEER 13 ...

Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good evening, guys, and welcome back, Akhil.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Thanks, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a couple of end-market color questions for you, the first on the military softness you
called out at UTAS. Is there any color you can give us on where you saw that? And I know the expectations around
military have been – we've been coming up a little short in both last year and some of the recent quarters. Can you give
us some color on where that came from?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Not a huge deal of impact, frankly. I think both OEM and the aftermarket on military side for
UTAS was down low single digit, so it's really not – nothing dramatic, nothing out of the ordinary. As we look ahead at
next year, Carter, I think the feeling is that the aftermarket might be actually slightly better, may be up low single digit
for UTAS while the OEM side will probably be down low single digits. So I think in balance, we still feel it's kind of at
treading water, if you will, nothing either positive or negative to talk about it.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. In Q4, OEM was essentially flat. Military aftermarket was down a little bit.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. And with respect to Sikorsky, if you were to give us a kind of real-time assessment on
how things look there on the commercial helo side, given obviously the anticipated weakness in oil and gas, and what
the expectation is there for spares, and what you're seeing, and any color there would be helpful.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. Maybe just – I'll give you a high-level. Akhil will – can tell you the right numbers.
But essentially, we are seeing some softness on the S-92 deliveries, as you would expect. I think we've got about 40
this year we had expected to deliver. There's a little bit of pressure there as some of the exploration companies are
scaling back. I just mentioned, though, that more than 80% of the use of the helicopters for offshore oil is for current
production. It's not for exploration. So you're talking on the margin, there may be a few aircraft that'll be a little bit
more difficult to sell, but Mick and team I think are on top of it down there. Aftermarket's been a little slower on the
commercial side than we expected. Part of that is because the reliability of S-92 has been so good, and the other part, I
think, is just cash conservation by some of the operators.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah. And there are some, as you would imagine, a little bit of concern about the oil and gas
related helo market, as you said. But I know Mick and team are committed to delivering on their plan, and they are not
going to let small things like this hold – come in the way.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thanks, guys.

<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thank you. Just a question on the balance sheet, because I guess one advantage of
having a very large balance sheet is that you can use it to offset surprise headwinds. And I guess if I just pro forma that
$0.15 of tailwind or offset into the three buckets, buyback is $0.05 of that. So I just wanted to check what the urgency
to use the balance sheet this year to drive earnings is.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I don't think there's any urgency other than the fact that we're not going to sit still and just
take and let these cost headwinds tank the year. I think, again, we're doing what we can to offset those. And the $3
billion, and we talked about that back in December, we said $2 billion to $3 billion, I would tell you with rates
remaining low, without a – I would say a very robust M&A pipeline, I think it's pretty easy to commit to the $3 billion
today.
And, again, I wouldn't suggest that that is a big use of our balance sheet when you got a $92 billion balance sheet,
obviously, you have room to do a lot more than an additional $1 billion if we wanted to. We're not going to commit to
anything more than the $3 billion today, but it remains an option if, again, share price remains low and the acquisition
pipeline doesn't fill up.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yeah, the key thing there, Julian, is to keep in mind as Greg laid out very clearly, we are interested
in M&A, we would like to do some transactions, the evaluations sort of prevent us from going too far out on that today.
Greg very clearly laid out the criteria that we look at, M&A transactions with, IRR of double-digit, accretive in year
two and neutral to ROIC for UTC overall by year four, and those are tough criteria in today's market. But at the same
time, we want to keep our flexibility and keep our balance sheet optionality available and not go much higher on share
buyback until we completely conclude on the M&A environment.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Understood. Thanks. And then just on commercial aero aftermarket, as you said, the
trends in Pratt and UTAS on sales were both sort of lower than the high single-digit growth guidance for 2015. So how
quickly do you think you'll snap back to the high single-digit trend? Is it something you could see at the beginning of
the year, and any impact you're seeing on airline behavior on aftermarket from oil?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yes, at this point, I don't think the trends were any different than what we expected. Remember,
Q4 last year was extremely strong. Pratt spares, if I remember correctly, were up 24%, and the UTAS spares were up
significantly as well.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: 17%.
<A - Akhil Johri>: So on that – on 17% [indiscernible] (43:08), as we saw. On top of those strong numbers, UTAS
grew 5% and Pratt was down 6% or 5%. So given that, it's really not a change in our expectations. We still expect
mid-single digit type of growth at Pratt and high single-digit growth in the aftermarket at UTAS. So I wouldn't call it a
change in trend. With regard to customer behavior, obviously, the expectation is that certainly on the Pratt side with be
airline profitability being what it is, we would hope for a little more content per visit when the engines actually come
back, and perhaps a little bit more provisioning in inventory build-up at the airlines, and that should help us a little bit,
but I won't – it's too early to call that.

<A - Akhil Johri>: The answer to your last question, not much yet. On the Pratt side is, these spares orders were down
about 8% or so for the quarter. And that is – again, no surprises there. Within that, however, I'd remind you that
V2500s were actually up mid single-digit, and the decline was in what has been a secular issue for us, which is the
legacy engines of PW2000 and PW4000 where retirements are hurting and the surplus parts market is hurting our
spares business a little bit. So no change there. The trends continue to be where they are. As I said earlier, we do expect
some benefit from the oil price reduction, but it's not yet showing in our numbers and maybe at some point, we'll get
some benefit there. On the UTAS side, again, the orders were up year-over-year probably a little lower than what the
sales were up, so I think we are still on track there for the high single-digit growth.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you. And you mentioned that Otis's orders in China were up 2% as you're probably
aware of the decline – the monthly decline in residential home prices has kind of been accelerating through December.
What are you seeing in terms of tone? You talked, I think, in December of looking for 10% growth in constant
currency, and new elevator sales at Otis in China. Is that still realistic?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, Cai. It's certainly within the realm of possibility. If you think about it, backlog at Otis
will end the year up about 13% year-over-year, and we'll convert probably 60% or 70% of that into sales. So as we start
the year, in a flat market, you would expect kind of 7% or 8% kind of growth in Otis China. We'll see. Again, there is
obviously pressure on home prices. We continue to see that, which has really held orders down for the year, especially
the back half of the year. But again, I think there is a pathway towards double digit if we see any recovery. We've seen
some stimulus measures take hold, seen some bank lending regulations ease a little bit to try and, again, re-invigorate
the property market. So I wouldn't give up on this. I think there's still opportunity there. But again, just given the strong
backlog that we end the year, I feel pretty optimistic we're going to continue to see growth in China.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thanks so much.

Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Greg, I want to be a little bit high-level. There's sort of two things.
One is restructuring and the second is capital spending. How do you think about the two of those as you put them
together to improve the profitability of the various business units?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, margin expansion and cost reduction's part of the DNA of UTC, and that's not going to
change. I don't care who's sitting in my chair. That's just the way we do business. And the businesses are always
focused on taking cost out. And so I think as we go into the year with this $300 million placeholder, we've got plenty of
opportunities to do cost reduction and probably more opportunities as there is funding as we start the year. But again,
we always find ways to fund the really good ideas. So we're going to continue on this path of cost reduction. It's just the
way we do business here.
As far as CapEx, we have been, I would say, over-consuming here. But again, it's all part of this, I'd call, the receding
of the commercial engine business with new GTF engines, and as a result, we're going to have to catch up a little bit out
of the spending. And that's not just Pratt, it's also, of course, at Aerospace Systems. You've got 50 new aircraft systems
going into production here the next few years, requires a lot of capital. So we're in a secular cycle here where CapEx is
just naturally going to be high. It will come down. But frankly, we're not capital constrained. We're going to fund what
we need to from a CapEx standpoint. We're going to fund what we need to from a restructuring standpoint. Because
they all have very, very solid returns and we've got a good process internally where all of these capital appropriations
as well as all the restructuring programs, they come through Akhil's finance organization, they're reviewed, they're
validated, and I think we're making solid investment decisions whether it's restructuring or CapEx.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Okay, I get it. I mean, it's really to drive the returns and improve the performance or
competitive position. The follow-up, I'm going to talk about maybe CCS for a moment. Usually, we find fire and

security as the one that's more of the challenged business unit, and this time I think it's this and maybe elements of
Carrier, rather a pleasant surprise. Could you talk a little bit about whether it's additional new product, whether it's
markets you've become more competitive, or what's the other change there? I mean, is it all – or is it something else
I've missed?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think you've probably hit on it and then some. I think again, part of it is, Geraud has
invested a lot in new products on the Carrier commercial HVAC side, we're seeing that start to pay off. We're spending
more money on the security side both fire products and electronic security, getting new products, driving a return of
growth. I also think the way we've organized the business, again, while we think about BIS as this central organization,
it's really decentralized decision making out in the field where you've got people that are focused on individual markets,
individual countries that are driving decisions that are helping to drive growth.
And again, as I think about 2015 while cost reduction will be important, the real key to 2015 earnings growth is going
to be top-line growth. And Geraud has a very aggressive plan out there. But I think he's got the products and the people
and the markets are going in his favor. He can actually see 5% or 6% organic revenue growth this year. And we will
see where we are at the end of the year. Even with tough conditions in Europe and slowing China, still feel very
confident we're going to hit those numbers.
<A - Akhil Johri>: And if you were to ask Geraud how, I'm sure he will tell you that with the portfolio transformation
pretty much behind in the fire and security space, there is a lot more focus on looking at the growth opportunities and
the growth markets and devoting the time and resources to make sure that we are capitalizing on those opportunities. So
he would fully expect that the growth profile for both fire and security and for the CCS business overall will be better
than what you've seen in the past.

Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Great. Thank you and good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to the guidance for a moment
in the prepared remarks, you suggested that the FX headwind was going to be $1.5 billion for the year and yet guidance
has come down by about $1 billion at the midpoint. I was wondering if you can just provide a little bit more color on
that and connect some dots?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure, Jason. This is – yes, the exact math is $1.5 billion on the top-line from the change in
currencies. We typically don't like to give guidance in decimal points this early in the year, so whether it's 64.5 to 65.5
or it's 65 to 66, I would say probably in our new range of 65 to 66, it wants to be at the lower end of that range. On the
other hand, to what Greg said earlier, we are hopeful that the organic growth might come in little bit on the higher side
of the range that we had before, the 3% to 5%. It may be towards the higher end as opposed to the lower end of that.
So, does it end up being 65.5 or 65.3? Too early to call. But we left the range in round numbers.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay, great. And then just a quick question on the efforts to reduce the buffer inventory, the
$10 billion. Can you talk a little bit about the reaction that you've seen thus far from your supply base and whether this
will lead to consolidations amongst your supply base? Just how they're reacting to it? And then I don't know if it's in
one business or another, but where the biggest opportunities might lie?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Enthusiastic support, Jason. Look, we have many, really, really good suppliers, large
suppliers. So you can't lump them all together. I think the bigger suppliers tend to be the better suppliers and one of the
things that we have been pushing in the supply base is consolidation of some of the second and third tier because quite
frankly, they can't afford to invest in the technologies and the systems the way the larger suppliers are. In terms of
where the opportunities are, I'll tell you it's primarily on the aerospace side. I think, again, as I go to BIS and think

about supply chain at Otis or supply chain at Carrier or fire and security, pretty well-developed and, again, a little bit
different in terms of the technologies. But again, their suppliers, I think, generally have performed better than the
suppliers on the aerospace side. Part of that is because of all the changes on the aero side. But really that's where most
of the work is going to have to be done is in that supply chain on the aero side.
<A - Akhil Johri>: And if I may, having grown up through some of those businesses, what happens is typically it's not
so much the issues inventory driven by the suppliers, it's because internally, nobody wants to hold up the line. So when
material planning people are concerned about a supplier performance, they end up safety buffer – safety stock and that
just builds upon itself. So even if one part is going to be off, you end up having a lot more inventory in the chain. So as
Greg said, once we can get all suppliers supplying on time with perfect quality, that's when you'll see all that buffer
inventory in our system start to [indiscernible] disappear, we'll get there (54:48).
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thank you, Jason.

Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good afternoon.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Otis, on North America new equipment orders, have been really strong for about two years
now. Greg, can you just talk on maybe give some color exactly what's going on there? What do you guys see as kind of
the [ph] market rate (55:14) of growth and how much share you might be picking up there, and what do you really
think is driving this outsized kind of growth that we're seeing?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, it's a couple of factors, David. Obviously, Otis is the ubiquitous brand here in the U.S.
and we have been gaining share back. But it's also a market that's recovering off of some very low numbers, and we're
still not even back to the 2007 level. So while the recovery feels really good, we still have a ways to go and I think Otis
has done a great job on the product side, and as well as the cost side to deliver much better value to the customers. The
customers value that, and the ABI has been improving. As you see, it's been over 50 now for most of the past year.
And quite frankly, we've also gotten our house in order. You remember the – some of the messes we had in terms of the
move from Nogales to Florence, South Carolina. That's behind us. Again, we're delivering product on time. It's very
good quality. All those things coming together are helping Otis regain the share here in the U.S. And again, I think the
party's not over. All of these orders that we've been taking for the last two years are going to come out in sales over the
next two years. And again, I think Otis in North America is going to have a very good couple of years coming up.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Great. Can you talk about how far you're still below product peak levels in North America?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: As I recall, 2007, we were about $1.2 billion in new equipment, and I think we're at about
$800 million, $900 million, maybe this year. So you've still got another 25% to go.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay, great. Business end market, I think Pratt Canada's sales were [indiscernible] (56:54)
were a little bit lower in 2014. What are you seeing in that market? We've got some players talking about things
improving. Are you actually seeing any sort of underlying market improvement, or is it just new product that they're
chipping through?
<A - Akhil Johri>: It's more a weakness on the helicopter side of the Pratt Canada engine market, if you will, right?
And some of the things that we talked about before, the operators had been a little gun-shy in terms of taking new
deliveries of engines. There is some concern we hear about inventory at the operator's level, people who are making
those aircraft for the helicopter market. So that's the space. On the business jet side, I think it's – there's no significant

change in trends. The engine shipments were in line with our expectations, probably just slightly ahead of last year, but
it's primarily the total drop in the helicopter market where we saw some weakness.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And, Greg, you mentioned the German tax case, I think, at the Investor Day, you
talked about $400 million potential cash tax or cash payment. Is that still the right number, and then is that explicitly in
the $90 million to $100 million free cash flow guidance?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It's in the $90 millions, it's not in the $100 millions. So if you want to think about it, 10% of
free cash will be about $600 million. So if we have to pay the German tax authorities before we have the case fully
adjudicated, you're going to see a lot of pressure on that $100 million getting closer to $90 million. So we're thinking
about it, we have – or we'll still working out, the attorneys still tell us that we're going to win eventually, but we may
have to put up the money in the interim. So we'll let you guys know.
<A - Akhil Johri>: And that's one place where the euro weakening is actually good news, right?
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Right, got it. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, thanks, and good evening, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: It's getting kind of late here, so I'll keep it [indiscernible] (58:58).
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It's kind of snowy here.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: It is kind of snowy. So you – obviously, you've taken a bit of [indiscernible] (58:05) on currency
upfront, which I think is commendable. But [ph] you've mentioned you've gone to (59:08) $1.10 euro?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, that's correct.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: $1.10 euro, okay. Okay, that's [indiscernible] (59:15). And then just, obviously, you mentioned in the
second bridge that a lot of that gets taken within Otis, which makes perfect sense. But how does the strong euro – sorry,
the weak euro, how does that impact Otis margins this year?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Right. The impact that we're talking about is more just from translation, so I don't think it – that
changes anything on an organic basis for the margins there. Within Europe, we still have the same operating
fundamentals that existed. There is still some pressure on the pricing side in the service business, but there continues to
be improvement as we continue to help improve the total number of units under contract in Europe. That was declining
for a while, and is starting to stabilize and move in the right direction; [ph] Joe (1:10:02) is very focused on that, but I
think there's nothing changing as a result of the currency. It's more just like...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: You should think about currency as simply a translation issue. The fact is we manufacture in
most of these locations where we sell. So in terms of real economic impact, it's really muted by the fact that you
manufacture, be it in China, or you manufacture in Europe. So this is just a translation and going against us right now.
We think $1.10 is the bottom, but we'll keep looking.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Good. I'll just – obviously, Europe is mainly a service market, so I was wondering if the translation
of that higher margin service in Europe to still see overall segment margin.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, there is a slight impact, Nigel, you're right, but it's not that material. There is some
impact absolutely.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. I just wanted to try and pull that out. And then just switching to – obviously, you've collapsed
the PAS structure. Does that imply that you haven't looked at the BIS structure, Greg, and you're comfortable that that
is driving synergies that you expected?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, look, I think – yeah, we've talked about this already a little bit on the call, but I think
Geraud has already done on the BIS side what we're doing on the aero side in terms of reducing structure. He's done it
over the course of the last couple of years from 2011 through this past year, and where we've been taking out
executives and taking out structure as we consolidated the back office functions as well as the overhead structures of
these businesses. So I don't think the opportunity exists on the BIS side the same way it did on the PAS side.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Well, thanks everyone for the audible tonight to change the timing of this. I hope everybody has a safe couple of
days here with the coming snowstorm, and we look forward to seeing you guys all in March. The IR team will be
available for a few minutes tonight and then all day, of course, tomorrow, so please give us a call if you have any
questions. Thanks a lot.
