Before we begin, I would like to note two changes in our earnings materials. First, we have introduced a financial
highlights presentation, which is a summary review of our revenue, expense and business segment trends along with
related commentary. We will use the financial highlights presentation to discuss our results.
In addition, we have consolidated our earnings press release and earnings review documents into one earnings release
document. The earnings release and financial highlights presentation are available on our website.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Izzy. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. Let me highlight some of the key
takeaways for the quarter. We achieved continued momentum in Investment Management and Investment Services as
we saw strong fee growth in these businesses, reflecting our focus on developing and delivering the very best
capabilities in the marketplace.
We drove continued progress on the expense control front, as our expense growth rate was well below the growth rate
of our fee revenues. We maintained a strong capital position, which prepares us well to comply with all the regulatory
requirements, while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses and maintain a high capital payout ratio.
Now as you can see on page 3 of our highlight deck, we had earnings per share of $0.93. Now that included $0.29 per
share for previously disclosed gains, net of litigation and restructuring charges.
Investment Management had another excellent quarter, with Investment Management and performance fees up 7%
year-over-year. Assets under management increased 7% to a new record, $1.65 trillion, driven by net new business.
Now also during the quarter we had $13 billion of net long-term flows, reflecting the strength of our liability-driven
investment strategies; and interestingly we also had $19 billion of short-term inflows.
Turning to Investment Services. Fees grew at 5% year over year, driven by strong growth in asset servicing, clearing
and treasury services, which more than compensated for a decline in issuer services.
So in spite of the continued runoff and high value securitizations in corporate trust, Investment Services overall had a
very healthy revenue increase. Assets under custody or administration were up 3% to $28.3 trillion.
In foreign exchange, our continuing enhancements are helping us gain new clients on our FX platform. And that
contributed to the sharp volume gains that helped mitigate the significant decline year-over-year in industry-wide
volatility. Now, of course, recently, market conditions have increased that volatility, which is generally good for market
participants.
Now we also saw an increasing contribution from our collateral services, which helped our growth as clients are
increasing their use of our optimization and segregation solutions.
On the expense front, our aggressive commitment to reducing expenses and improving productivity is showing up in
our numbers, particularly when you look at the trend in staff expense. Our normalized expenses were flat
year-over-year and up only 1% sequentially; very strong results when given against the revenue growth that we
experienced in Investment Management and Investment Services.
Our capital position remained strong, even after giving effect to the repurchasing of 11 million shares during the
quarter for $431 million. Interestingly, we've repurchased about 3% of our shares outstanding this year. Now we also
delivered an outstanding return on tangible common equity of 18% for the quarter. So all in all, good fee momentum,
good progress in reducing the growth rate of expenses, and an enviable capital position.
Now at our Investor Day conference on October 28, we'll discuss in more detail how we plan to enhance our revenue
growth, continue to control expenses, manage to the new liquidity and capital standards, and how we intend to deploy
the significant level of excess capital that we generate. Now much of the focus will be on the work underway to

maximize returns and create value for our shareholders, above and beyond what we're delivering today. But
importantly, we'll also share the key performance targets that you can hold us accountable to.
Now before I turn it over to Todd, I want to highlight two recent actions that we've taken as we continue to optimize
our business mix. First, we repositioned our Markets Group, exiting derivatives sales and trading. This will improve
our operating margin and return on capital. We simply were not a large enough player to get an adequate return on
capital and bear the increasing risk management oversight cost.
Second, last week we announced an acquisition that will add new specialized fixed income solutions to our diverse
portfolio of capabilities. We agreed to acquire Cutwater Asset Management, which is a U.S. based fixed income and
solution specialist. They have a 20-year track record and approximately $23 billion of assets under management.
Cutwater will operate as part of our investment management unit and work closely with Insight, our highly successful
LDI specialty boutique. It will allow us to extend our LDI and fixed income specialist strategy into the U.S.
marketplace. So we're very excited about that acquisition and also the repositioning of our Markets Group.
So with that, let me turn it over to Todd.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald, and page 5 of the financial highlights document details of our reported results. As Gerald mentioned,
we had an EPS of $0.93. That included $0.29 per share for those previously disclosed gains, net of litigation and
restructuring charges
As you look at our numbers, you'll note that we had a $0.01 benefit related to our loan loss provision credit, so we see it
as a $0.63 quarter. Now given the significant asset gains in the quarter, I think it's best that we start with the summary
of our adjusted results which are on page 6.
Revenue was down year-over-year as strong growth in Investment Management and Investment Services fees was
offset by lower investment and other income and lower net interest revenue. However, if you look at our revenue,
excluding the volatile investment line, it was up about 2%. I will provide more color on the revenue drivers shortly.
Expenses were flat year-over-year and up slightly sequentially, representing the continued progress on expense control.
Our operating leverage was up 245 basis points year-over-year, if you exclude the impact of the investment and other
income. Our pre-tax margin was 29%, and our return on tangible common equity was a strong 18%.
On pages 7 and 8, we will call out some business metrics that I think help explain our underlying performance. In terms
of our Investment Management business, on page 7, you can see that record AUM of $1.65 trillion was up 7%
year-over-year, driven by higher equity market values as well as net new business. During the quarter, we had net
long-term inflows of $13 billion and short-term inflows of $19 billion.
On page 8, you can see that assets under custody and administration at quarter-end were $28.3 trillion. That's up 3%
year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values. Linked-quarter, AUC/A was down 1% due to lower market
values as the FTSE, MSCI and the Barclays Bond Index were all down in the quarter.
We had an estimated $115 billion in new AUC/A wins during the quarter. Now many of our key metrics showed
growth on a year-over-year basis as well. The market value of securities on loan at period end showed strong growth.
Average loans and deposits in wealth management, as well as in Investment Services continued their trend upward.
Our key broker-dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances was also up. Our clearing metrics were also good.
Although DARTS volumes were off slightly as we typically see in the third quarter, active clearing accounts were up
and long-term mutual fund assets showed especially strong growth.
The number of DR programs declined in the quarter, reflecting an increase in the number of terminations that exceeded
the number of new issuers. In addition to that, we continue to maintain our pricing discipline in this business.

Looking at fee and other revenue on page 9, asset servicing fees were up 6% year-over-year and up slightly
sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth, higher market values, net new business and
higher collateral management fees. Sequentially, organic growth was partially offset by seasonally lower securities
lending revenue.
Clearing fees were up 7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Both increases were driven by growth in clearing
accounts and mutual fund positions, and by overall higher asset levels. The sequential increase also reflects higher
DART volumes.
Issuer service fees were down 2% year-over-year and up 36% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower
corporate trust fees, partially offset by new business and DRs. The sequential increase is primarily due to seasonally
higher dividend fees, partially offset by lower corporate trust fees.
When you look at our Investment Services, you will see that our Investment Services fees, as a percentage of
non-interest expense, what we call the coverage ratio, was 100% in the third quarter. That's up approximately 300 basis
points from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting strong fee growth with little changes in our expenses.
The impact of currencies for the full quarter had a neutral impact to our pre-tax income, but it's worth noting that it
caused a slight revenue increase that was offset by an equal expense increase, most of that impacting Investment
Management.
Investment Management and performance fees were up 7% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially. The
year-over-year increase primarily resulted from higher equity markets, the currency impact and higher performance
fees. The sequential decrease was driven by seasonally lower performance fees.
FX and other trading revenue was down 4% year-over-year and up 18% sequentially. FX revenue of $154 million was
unchanged year-over-year, and up 19% sequentially. Year-over-year, higher volumes offset lower volatility. As Gerald
mentioned, the enhancements we've made to our FX platform helped us capture more client activity. The sequential
increase reflects higher volumes.
Turning to page 10 of the financial highlights, you'll see that net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was
down 6% versus the year-ago quarter and essentially flat to the second quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily
resulted from lower asset yields and lower accretion that was partially offset by higher average interest earning assets;
and, of course, those assets were driven by higher deposits. The net interest margin for the quarter was 94 basis points.
That's down 22 basis points from the year-ago quarter and 4 basis points from the prior quarter.
Now we also point out here that euro-denominated deposits now make up approximately 15% of our average deposit
liabilities. During the quarter, as you're probably aware, the European Central Bank lowered the rate it pays on funds
left at the bank to minus 20 basis points.
To mitigate the impact of that move, we've taken a number of actions. As of October 1, we began charging for deposits.
We're also continuing to reduce our interbank placements. And as we mentioned before, we are increasing high-quality
liquid assets with the cash related to that. For the quarter, our securities portfolio increased by $10 billion. That's about
10%. We added agencies, treasuries and sovereigns, thus increasing our high-quality liquid asset portfolio.
Turning to page 11, you'll see that non-interest expense decreased slightly year-over-year and was up 1% sequentially.
We reduced staff expense year-over-year, as lower pension expense and the impact of technology in-sourcing and
streamlining actions offset higher professional, legal and other purchased services, the currency impact and the annual
employee merit increase. The sequential increase primarily reflects the incentive reduction recorded in the second
quarter that was related to an administrative error, as well as the impact of the factors that I just noted.
You'll notice that head count increased by 100 year-over-year. It was down by 200 sequentially. I want to remind you
of our technology, talent strategy, of in-sourcing developers to reduce our application development cost.
Year-over-year, we have eliminated more than 700 contractor-related roles in technology, and replaced them with
permanent staff. Despite this, our employee count is only up 100 positions and compensation expense is lower; clear
evidence that the strategy is working. As we indicated last quarter, we continue to believe that our operating expenses

for the full year should be about flat.
Turning to the capital ratios on page 12. They were unchanged despite the growth in capital. This was largely driven by
an increase in risk-weighted assets that's associated with the calculation for operational risk. Our estimated
supplemental leverage ratio was down 10 basis points to 4.6%, due to the increase in our balance sheet in the third
quarter.
A few points to factor into your thinking about the fourth quarter. We would expect a reduction in depository receipt
fees and it'd be a limited offset in expenses on that. Seasonally, higher performance fees in the fourth quarter will
somewhat mitigate the DR drop off, but will cause a related expense increase.
Net interest revenue is expected to be approximately flat to the third quarter. Expenses should be up sequentially,
driven by seasonally higher business development, legal and consulting expense, as well as the higher staff expense
reflecting the rise in performance fees.
The effective tax rate should be around 27%. And finally, we intend to continue to execute on our CCAR capital plan,
of course subject to market conditions. All in all, a strong quarter, good fee growth in our two segments, good expense
control, and we continue to execute on our capital plan.
With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Great. Thanks, Todd. And, Wendy, I think we can open it up for questions now.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we're ready to begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first
question comes from Glenn Schorr with ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: You got me? Sorry, I'm on mute.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Hi, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: How are you?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: So I guess the question I have is, it's not a big move, but capital ratio is down a little bit, SLR
down a little bit. Wondered if you could just give a little color around that?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, Glenn. This is Todd.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hey, Todd.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: In terms of the risk-weighted asset ratios, you did see a little pop in our capital. It was
somewhat offset. It would have been larger, but there was an OCI adjustment related to the accumulated transaction
account, largely driven by the change in the dollar value over the quarter.
And if you look in the denominator on the risk-weighted assets, there was a pretty significant increase related to
operational risk. And what happens to those models are informed by external losses. And there have been quite a few
external losses, even though they're not losses that we've incurred. When others take large provisions, it can inform
those models and drive higher operational risk calculations, and that's what we've seen.

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: And what is ops RWA as a percentage of the total?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I don't think we disclose that, but it is a substantial percentage of the total for the advanced
approach. It doesn't apply to the standardized approach.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: If you notice, Glenn, that's why you'll see the standardized approach actually increased.

Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Hi, good morning. Todd, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit upon the pushes
and pulls within NII as it relates to LCR, the final rules. You addressed the commentary about extending placements
and charging for the deposits, but just on LCR and just how much more you need to go and then how you'll be
adjusting to the final rules? Thanks.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. As you know, we got the final rules earlier in September. And they were a little
more favorable for the treatment of operational deposits and they're a little tough on muni assets, for example. So we
look well-positioned. Our estimates right now – and these are estimates – obviously it's easy to compute the
high-quality liquid assets, it's still fairly difficult to compute the actual denominator – but our estimates are that we're
well in excess of the 80% that we need to be on January 1.
Given that, we still are looking to do a little restructuring and some of that you might note in what we did this quarter.
Municipals are down a little bit. That's still open for discussion. There is a possibility that, that position on municipals
could change. And agencies, treasuries and some sovereigns, we increased as we brought down some of our
placements.
Actually, Ken, we're going to give a lot of detail on this on the Investor Day, but I think the good news is we're meeting
the standard. We're well-positioned to meet the future standard. And it's not having a dramatic change in our portfolio
or in our estimates around our net interest income.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. Thank you, Todd.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks, Ken.
Operator
Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hey. So just want to understand the methodology and process for charging for deposits over
there in Europe. Just wanted to make sure I understood how you're doing that. Is it a one size fits all? How are you
dealing with – people paying you via soft dollars or if you could give us a little color there?

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. Betsy, why don't I have Brian Shea address that. So, Brian?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah. Hi, Betsy. Generally what we're doing is essentially passing through the 20 basis
point fee that we're absorbing from the European Central Bank. Clients understand that we're actually not initiating this,
but actually passing through the fee that we're absorbing. We're working collaboratively with our clients to help them
manage their cash in a way that it reduces their exposure to that. And to the extent we can find other short-term
investment vehicles or off balance sheet cash management vehicles, we're helping them do that to reduce their exposure
to that cost.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: If you had people leaving excess deposits as a form of paying you for services, does that then
drive some higher hard-dollar fees if they're moving off of soft-dollar pay?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, generally with rates being so low, there's really then no earnings credit on the deposits
to start with. And it really isn't that issue, and hasn't been for some period of time. We're really just trying to work with
the clients to make sure that they have as limited amount of deposits on our balance sheet that they're subjected to that
cost. And so in some ways we're seeing some of our euro deposits come down, not surprisingly.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Which is good, because we don't have to hold capital against it either.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: So we're really trying to work very collaboratively with our clients to mitigate that cost. And
there really hasn't been any earnings credit on the deposits to start with.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: And typically that's not something that takes place much in Europe. It's nowhere near like
in the U.S.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. And you're two weeks into it. I mean, I guess the question is, how much impact do
you think this is likely to have on being able to shrink the balance sheet?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah. I think not a whole lot, Betsy, because we're seeing everybody else do it. So this is
becoming a fairly common practice. We had indicated that we had about 15% of our total deposit bases in the euro, it's
denominated in euro. We've probably seen that come down a little bit.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just another follow-up I guess on the balance
sheet. We've seen the deposits kind of continuing to balloon across this system for some time, I mean you guys in
particular. Do you guys have a slightly better sense of the source of these deposits? Is it essentially the same clients or
are you starting to see a different mix shift within that? And I guess, Todd, just as a follow-up to your point on moving
some of the cash and securities portfolio. Can you give us a sense of the pace at which you guys are willing to do that,
and does the current moving rates change that strategy for you at all?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, Alex. Why don't we start with where the deposit growth has come. I think there were
some dislocations in the third quarter, and I'd say there are a couple of drivers to that. I mean, one of the things that you
saw is that the Fed put a limitation on its total amount of reverse repo that is intended to do at quarter-end. So it
reduced it from really no cap to $300 billion. That meant that toward the end of the quarter that there were substantial
money market funds that had nowhere to place the funds. So the likely recipient of that is going to be the custodian for

those money market funds.
So I think that's a little bit of a temporary distraction, if you will, or disruption. I think also you've seen the large dealers
take down their match books which had a similar impact, and it was a particularly important period. And I think this is
a permanent reduction. But right now, the impact of the reduction is ending up in the banking system and it kind of
needs to I think work its way through. So we do think we'll probably see a little bit more of this before we see this cash
kind of find a permanent home.
In terms of your other question, I think we've made – substantially we did increase the duration of the securities
portfolio in the third quarter a little bit. I think now the repositioning is going to be what do we want to do within the
HQLA. We do have a fair amount of central bank deposits. They're low risk, they're low yield. And really the only
action that you could take would be to extend duration within that portfolio. If you wanted to increase the NIM, I think
we'd be a little bit defensive about that. There's potential capital risk to it. And I think the opportunity cost to taking on
very low yielding securities at this point is pretty high.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Got you. Makes sense. Thanks.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So a quick one. Could you – just it'd be helpful to try to think about how much of these
restructuring and litigation is environmental and how much is management action. Is it possible to break those two out
or at least give us some color on how those break down? And then, also, why the litigation restructuring drove up the
tax rate, like was there an accrual for fines or something in there? Just maybe help us understand some of that?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. There's about $60 million of restructuring expenses and about $160 million of
litigation expenses. When we look at the restructuring, that's largely around the actions that Gerald mentioned around
the Markets Group; and we think that's going to have some long-term positives for us. I would say that when we think
there is appropriate actions like that to take in the future, we will take them. In terms of the litigation, we apply a tax
rate that's reflective of the jurisdiction related to the matter. And that's why that tax rate was relatively low and the
after-tax impact relatively high.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then thinking about volatility here, we've seen not only last
quarter they're reflected in the results, but quarter-to-date. A lot of the investment banks have walked through how the
volatility we've seen here this current quarter is not really as helpful to drive revenues. Is that also what you're seeing or
is volatility, volatility and you're going to benefit on either side? In other words, are the trends that we've seen so far
sustainable here into the fourth quarter from your perspective?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. Just a quick comment on that. Some level – volatility, generally as we've said, is
helpful to most market participants. That being said, with more and more going to electronic trading and more and
more within the fine spreads and more and more within a very, very, very narrow range, the volatility benefits that
we've all experienced in the past are less. But volatility generally helps.
More important for us, since most of our foreign exchange trading is really on the backs of our servicing businesses, it's
more important for us to capture volumes. And so we're a volume-driven shop. And that's why we feel pretty good
about the level of volumes increases on our FX electronic platforms associated with our Investment Services
businesses. So generally it helps, but it's not nearly as impactful as it once was.

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. And I would add to that. The volatility we look for primarily, since we're not a big
fixed income or equity trading shop, it's really around our FX business, is related to FX. And we do print a volatility
index number that I wouldn't say is perfectly correlated, but it's correlated to what we're looking at. You can see in the
third quarter versus the second quarter, it's basically flat; down substantially from last year, but basically flat. So recent
events have tended to move that a little bit.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks for the color.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. First, just a clarification. The new asset manager that you bought, Tapwater (sic) [Cutwater]
(30:27) Asset Management, you said they'll be working with Insight, will that be a new investment management
boutique or will it be folded into an existing one?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Mike, it's going to be a new boutique as part of our overall enterprise. It's Cutwater, yeah.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then just my main question for the Investor Day on October 28 which I'll ask now,
but I'm guessing we'll get a bigger answer is, if you look at investment – and the servicing fees for this year relative to
assets under custody and you look at that ratio over time, it's one of the lowest levels that it's been if you go back 10
years, 15 years, even 20 years. And that's despite additional market share by BNY Mellon, especially, but by all the
largest players. So why don't you have better pricing, given increases in market share over time and given all the scale
benefits that you guys talk about?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. Mike, I think this quarter is a good example where we actually saw the fees rise faster
than the assets under custody. So some of our other services, our "value-added services" like collateral and some of the
other things, are starting to kick in. So this is a good example this quarter. And can't promise it every quarter, but this is
a good quarter where we actually are seeing the fee increase. And some of the pricing discipline we're putting in place
around the transactions and clients that we do business with are starting to pay off. So assets under custody were up
3%, asset servicing fees were up 6% for the quarter. So we're trying to accomplish exactly what you're suggesting.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And looking ahead, I guess just as a preview of October 28, the main reasons you think that
might continue would be what?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, again, some of the collateral services, some of the value-added propositions we're
offering our clients are fee-based, irrespective of assets under custody; and that's what we're trying to drive.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks, Mike.

Thank you. The next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Good morning. I had a two-part question on interest rates. The first, how are you thinking
about the current reinvestment environment? What do your reinvestment yields look like? And I was hoping you could
contrast U.S. versus Europe, given the very different rate dynamics. And the second, given the recent move down in the
10-year and long-term rates, how should we be thinking about pension costs next year?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, Ashley. Couple of things. In terms of reinvestment, typically what we model is we
look at the market and the forward rate curve and we estimate around that. We'll also model whether rates are just flat,

that they don't change, given their extraordinarily low levels, we don't typically model them going down a lot more, but
we obviously do sensitize to that as well. So when we look forward, we are assuming that we will reinvest. And when
we show our sensitivity in our Q, we will assume that we're reinvesting at the existing market levels.
In terms of the discount rate and the lower interest rates and the lower 10-year, the discount rate is a corporate credit
discount rate. So it's not quite as severe as the drop that you speak to in the 10-year, but it is down a bit from where we
saw it last year. And obviously that means the pension obligation would increase and the cost associated with the
pension expense would also increase. We give estimates in our Annual Report on what those numbers might look like
depending on what that discount rate is. So you need to get a good handle around the discount rate.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Okay. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks, Ashley.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Thank you, and good morning. Just one question. I wanted to get your thoughts around trends
in LDI. I noticed there were some outflows last quarter, inflows this quarter. Given some of the recent market volatility,
has there been anything about a rush to the exits on behalf of some clients who may have hesitated for one reason or
another. How do you see it tracking versus pension plan funded status? And maybe any quick color on the strategic role
on the capabilities of Cutwater versus what Insight already had? Thanks.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Sure. Wow, that's a great question. The LDI business still has very robust pipelines as
pensions broadly are looking to de-risk. In fact, if you remember, last quarter we actually had one sizable outflow. Net
of that, we had pretty meaningful inflows. So the business is robust, the pipelines are strong. And I would tell you that
it's – I mean it's obviously been a very big business for us in the UK specifically and around the world generally, but
we see the U.S. opportunity really continuing to expand.
Your question about how are pensions thinking about the current environment. When we saw the 10-year approach 3%
yield here in the U.S. last time and the stock market was doing really well, funded status levels actually got to a point
where more people were interested in it. And I think the general view was rates were going to continue to move higher.
There were obviously two sides to every market, but I think there was a view that maybe rates would continue to move
up and that funded status would even get better and that the LDI move in a pension plan might become even more
attractive.
This last move down, I think, has made people more thoughtful about looking at the opportunity to de-risk their plan
and to take advantage of it when it makes sense for them to do it. And we do think that people who've made the
decision – pension planners who've made the decision to de-risk their plan will be more active in doing so, as the
opportunity for that exists.
So another thing I would tell you, just to extend that point, the skills involved in doing LDI and every plan is different.
In the UK, you have inflation component, and that can be more complicated than some of the plans in the U.S., but the
skills involved really are about being able to create a solution around liability. So buying assets against a match
liability. That looks a lot like and is actually absolute return investing, generating risk adjusted returns for clients. And I
would tell you that the skills there really can feed two other large growth opportunities for us. One is around the
retirement space for individuals, so a lot of the techniques and capabilities are quite similar for creating retirement
solutions for individual investors.
And then also there continues to be a lot of interest, both on the institutional and broader investor front for absolute
return strategies that look like these strategies. So absolute return, real return, investing that you hear a lot about is
going to leverage those same capabilities. And so, Cutwater brings a much deeper capability in U.S. fixed income
markets.

Again, we have the LDI businesses inside Standish and Mellon Capital as well. But Insight, as now the largest LDI
provider in the world continuously winning awards for the great capabilities they have, being able to have the
intellectual capital sharing from our Insight team with our Cutwater extended capabilities in that new boutique, it really
is going to position us quite well, we think, to continue to benefit from pension de-risking trends.

Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi. Good morning, folks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Can you talk a little bit, maybe expand a little bit on the collateral management business. You
say you're obviously getting some traction there now. If you can opine a little bit about some of the discussions on
tri-party repo in the marketplace, including potential centralized clearing of that? And then I don't know if there's any
way to frame that contribution. As we model that and that growth for you over time, is that something you're thinking
about maybe starting to disclose in terms of the actual revenue as opposed to just the balances? I'll stop there and I'll
ask another one after that.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sure. So I will start with part of that. The collateral services, I think we said in our
commentary that the traction we're seeing is really on the optimization and the segregation side of it. We're beginning
to see the early signs of the transformation, where someone has the wrong collateral in the wrong place. And also as
more and more transactions are required to be collateralized all around the world, there's more increasing activity.
It has been slower over the last year than we thought, but it's now picking up pace and it's showing up in our numbers
and some of our growth rates, and that's one of the contributors to the solid Investment Services fee growth for the
quarter. Tri-party repo and tri-party repo reform, certainly, the technology expense that we put into that is largely
behind us.
We have a couple more waves to complete, but they're really very, very technical in nature. And generally, as you can
see, our tri-party balances are going up. They're probably shrinking in the U.S. and growing outside the U.S. The
dealers in the U.S. are getting smaller in their positions, but it's being taken up by the secondary dealers and the
non-U.S. players. So it's a global business for us, not only in tri-party, but collateral services broadly. So we're actually
quite encouraged with the potential growth rates of the business.
Your last point or question, should we give more clarity around it? That's something we're thinking about, but to be
continued, as they say. Todd, I don't know if you want to add, or Curt?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Curt, do you want add anything to...
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: No. Just maybe, Brian, a little color of what maybe some of the activities that are really
driving the growth. It's really the equity securities financing that's going on around the globe is one piece of that puzzle.
The other is, is that the collateralization of things like ETFs that need collateral underneath them. And third is really the
OTC market having to be now collateralized and segregated, and we're a natural place for that to happen between two
parties.
And lastly, we're helping the CCPs around the globe in segregation capabilities, whether it be providing our technology
or know-how or being a custodian on behalf of some of those segregation activities. So really those are the underlying
drivers to the growth that we've seen over the last year, and even a little longer.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Brian, it's probably also worth noting that the FSB put out a proposal this week around
required minimum margins for the transactions done with the banking system. At this point, I don't know, Curt, if you

want to comment on that? We don't really see that having a tremendous effect. It will take a little bit of leverage out of
the market, but we don't see it either as a positive or a negative at this point.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Well, the one thing that it will drive is, people have got to be smarter about their collateral
and how to optimize it, and make sure it's in the right place to reduce the capital cost associated with it, and the margin
cost associated with it. That's where I think our technology and algorithms are a great vehicle for being able to do that.
And we've always said that our benefits in the marketplace is really our technology, not the margining that we do. So if
it's a standard margin across the world, we don't see any impact to us, in terms of the strength of our business model.
We'd lead with technology and algorithms and solutions.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And, Brian, in response to the disclosure, we have components of this in net interest
income and securities finance. Some portions of it's in our securities lending activity, some of it's in our asset servicing
fees. And the tri-party itself, the custodial function that we show there, it's not a huge number. So it will be a bit hard
for us to break out something like that.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Right. It's all over the place. Yeah. And then maybe talk about Investor Day a little bit more
deeply would help, since it's such a good growth area. But that's helpful. And then, just two tiny clarifications. I think,
Todd, did you say the tax rate was 25% to 27%, or did you say 27%?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: No, I meant to say 27%. I slipped. It's 27%. I'd like it to be 25%.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Yeah. That would always be good. And then just if you can confirm the corporate trust runoff,
is that an 18-month drag on the fee revenues? And then I just wanted to squeeze in one there on the money in motion
on the active fixed income side. BlackRock said they thought they could gain something in tens of billions over about a
year or so in terms of market share. Maybe, Curtis, if you could opine on that?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Brian, we'll let you do those follow-ups. We're trying to restrict it to one follow-up.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: I'm sorry. Yeah, okay.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I think the first question was related to corporate trust. I would say that that's consistent.
We feel pretty confident that, that's starting to slow and it will turn over that time period. And then I will turn the other
one over to Curtis.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yes. No, absolutely. So there's clearly money in motion, as you've pointed out. We've
already seen it. We have both funded wins and to be funded wins, as well as verbal commitments that we're seeing,
both in the U.S. and beginning to happen globally as well.
We do think this is something that's going to play out over time. A lot of commotion right now. But we actually think it
will be sustained, and do think that money in motion is always to our benefit. I will tell you that we feel very
well-positioned here, both because we have strong performance, an array of very deep capabilities; and, very
importantly, a tremendous amount of capacity.
A lot of people who are thinking about whether they should put their own money in motion are evaluating just how
large any centralized investment team can be. And so, our multi-boutique model is perfectly suited for those people
who are looking for deep capabilities, but not too big. So that's a big part of our focus.

<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: Hello there. You mentioned the decline in the large brokers match books. What do you think is
behind that? Is it this daily reporting of the form FR 2052 to the Fed? Do you think that's what's prompted them to
bring down the match books, or do you think it's kind of broader factors?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: I think it's very simple. When you've got supplemental leverage ratio and cost of capital
being applied against this, and the cost of financing is significantly increased. So the cost to them to carry that match
book is much greater than what it once was.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And, Geoff, the other thing I would add to that is, the leverage ratio – even before you get
into the SLR, the leverage ratio could be a constraining factor in somebody's CCAR analysis. So that the very low
yielding, very low return treasury type of repo really doesn't make sense for them to continue to hold in a match book if
it's going to put pressure on their CCAR performance.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: And then just one quick bit of clarification. You mentioned flat expenses for the full year.
What's the base we should be looking at for that and should we be taking out any of the one-offs in year-to-date 2014?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. The way we disclose operating expenses, it excludes M&I, litigation and
restructuring. So that's what I mean by flat operating expenses. On a year-over-year basis, we expect those to be flat.

Thank you. The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning. Todd, you mentioned that you extended out the duration of the
securities portfolio with the change in strategy. How far out is that duration or how far out are you willing to go with
the rate environment the way it is?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. Not much, Gerard. We're bold and we're buying two-year and three-year types of
securities. So the duration of that portfolio would have just inched up a little bit. The contraction in interest rates that
we've seen on the securities that have negative convexity has probably bought that duration back to flat over the past
few days actually. But where there's a huge opportunity cost for us to do that and we don't think that getting a little bit
of current income at that kind of an opportunity cost makes a heck of a lot of sense right now.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. Thank you. And then on the operating expense side, the core expenses, you guys
have done an admirable job in keeping that down. Can you share with us, from a regulatory cost standpoint, I don't
know if you want to give us the dollar amount, but what percentage of your operating costs would you define as
regulatory-related today versus three years or four years ago? How much has – obviously it's gone up and we're just
trying to frame out how much has it gone up?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes. Gerard, it's a substantial number. It's hard to tease out with any real precision because
you might have some areas, for example, that have gotten more efficient, but they've had to take on a lot more
regulatory. So we can certainly look at projects and the cost associated with executing projects, whether it's compliance
with the LCR, the new Basel standards, the resolution recovery, [ph] FCA (49:44) and so forth.
When we look at some of our key functions, though, we are seeing substantial rises. We also had indicated that
specifically in our tri-party reform efforts, that our cost in operating that business went up as much as $80 million for
all of the broker-dealer and tri-party clearance business. So we've not reported anything more specific than that, but I
would say it is substantial.

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: That $80 million is just one example for one narrow business. So you can project that across
all of our businesses and put a multiplier factor on that, and it's a big number.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Would you guys say the regulatory costs are cresting? Obviously there's been a big ramp
over the last five years, but are we near a peak where they'll just stabilize or no, this is still just an onward and upward
number?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Gerard, the statement that we've made is we don't think that the rate of increase is
increasing. So I wouldn't say that it's necessarily cresting. We are still seeing. We have new items coming on. You have
the NSFR that we're going to eventually have to report. There's going to be more work around resolution and recovery
planning. So you have a number of new items that we face. We're putting some things behind us. Some things are still
in the developmental, and so there are some things that we will probably see in the future; and it's hard to project if
there might be additional. So that's what we know. So it seems like our spend rate is stabilizing. The growth rate is not
nearly as significant as it was, but it's on a bigger base.

Thank you. The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Just a quick question on the asset management business. I mean LDI has seen some good
flows. But if you look at the equity side of the equation, you've had net outflows for the last four quarters. Is that a
performance thing or can you just kind of help us think through the flows on the equity side?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yes, absolutely. I'd say there are a couple of things going on there. One of them is we
absolutely saw rebalancing. As you saw at the end of last year, markets had done well. A lot of the activity there was
from clients who had come to us and invested when the equity markets were at lower valuations and were taking
money off the table. Through this year, it's been a continuation of that. There has not been any significant outflow from
any one place. Again, we have an array of equity investment firms and each of them have experienced some level of
outflow across some of their product offerings.
Where performance – performance is always going to be differentiated across our entire platform. And where
performance has been on the softer side, flows have absolutely been more in those areas. So there's absolutely some
linkage. When a client is taking money out of the equity market, they think about what performance has been. So there
is some linkage, but there's nothing that I would say is systemic in any one place.
I will tell you that where we – one of the things that a number of our firms do is focus a lot on generating returns
against the risk that they're taking. So very focused on Sharpe ratio and also on managing against downside scenarios.
And in the last month, some of those strategies that might have lagged a bit during the past year or so have actually
done exceedingly well. So that's the broad story.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: And has it been mostly concentrated in institutional or across both retail and institutional?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Because of the size of institutional, it's much more institutional.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right. Okay, great. Thanks.

Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Thanks. Sorry for a follow-up here. A quick numbers question. But, Todd, just to
double check on the expense comment you made. I mean it looks like if you take your core number last year and you
assume kind of the same and back into the fourth quarter, you've got a pretty meaningful step up, closer to like $2.9
billion run rate versus like a $2.6 billion and change you've been doing to what – kind of over the course of the year. Is
that the right way to think about it? And if so, like, what essentially would cause the step up in the fourth quarter?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: That sounds a little bit high, Alex. Take a little sharper look at it. And we are excluding
M&I restructuring and litigation.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Okay. So you're saying like $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion is still the number essentially for
the next quarter?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I would expect. Again, we had indicated that we would expect it to increase from the third
quarter for all the seasonal factors that I mentioned. It's important, for example, DR revenue doesn't have a lot of
expense with it. It's going to be likely, some but not all of that will be replaced with lower margin business. That will
be one of the drivers that you have to take into consideration.
The other driver is that we have quite a few of our business development conferences and so forth in the four quarter,
and that will step up. And also our consulting and legal expenses we would expect to be higher in the fourth quarter. So
making adjustments for those, you will see them up. But in aggregate for the full year, I think you'll see it flat, maybe a
little bit down.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. And, Alex, just adding. I think we have a line item in the statement for you where the
third quarter of last year was $2.682 billion versus the third quarter of this year of $2.673 billion. And that's the way we
look at it. In terms of the core operating expense of the company, it was actually down slightly year-over-year and we
want to try to hold the expenses flat for the entire year.

given that your influence in the fixed income markets, I was just hoping you could share some color on any of the
liquidity challenges or investment opportunities you're seeing out there today?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: There's not a whole lot of investment opportunities in a very, very low interest rate
environment and they're a negative interest rate environment in Europe. The liquidity challenges are, Todd cited it
earlier, you look at money market funds trying to find places to invest when the dealer book's shrinking. You've got a
reverse repo market that has a demand much greater than the $300 billion cap. The demand was $407 billion at the end
of the third quarter. I suspect the demand is going to be even higher than that in the fourth quarter.
So you've gotten sort of tectonic plates working against each other. The dealers, the dealer books, their balance sheets
are shrinking by design for capital and cost purposes; and the liquidity that's in the system is even higher. So there's a
lot of search going on for some place to put the liquidity and get some yield; and it's a really hard equation right now.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Ashley, it's Curtis. I would add, there's been a lot of chatter about the market liquidity has
resulted to change in regulation, change in repo markets. And I do think that there is nervousness among market
participants about the idea that if there were a rush out of asset classes that we would see limited liquidity. We saw a
little bit of that, I think, over the past couple of weeks where markets were more volatile and there were some bouts of

illiquidity.
One of the things that's interesting about that period is it was while the interest rates were falling and so generally the
valuations and fixed income markets in aggregate were not as stressed. I think that periods of illiquidity and a rising
rate environment are the ones where a lot of the scenarios get drawn out. If you sit here at BNY Mellon and you watch
the entire evolution of market structure, from both an Investment Services and an Investment Management perspective,
we really do believe that the electronic platforms are being put in place and that all of the work around collateral for a
lot of transactions that are going to occur are critical. And we think it's actually a pretty big opportunity for us to help
recreate the pools of liquidity that the markets are going to need, whatever market environment we're in. So, Curt, I
don't know if you want to...
Gerald L. Hassell
Great. Well, thank you, everybody for dialing in. And just again to summarize, we're encouraged by our results in the
third quarter. However, we strongly believe we can, in fact, improve our financial performance even greater than what's
reflected in this quarter, and we'll be discussing more of that and our upside on Investor Day later this month. So, look
forward to talking to you all and seeing you in person at the end of the month. And just as a reminder, if you have
additional questions, please follow up with Izzy Dawood. So thank you very much for joining us today.
