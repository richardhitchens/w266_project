MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Laura and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Sprint 2012 Fourth Quarter Earnings Results. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brad Hampton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
Brad Hampton
Thank you, Laura. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sprint's fourth quarter 2012 earnings call. On today's call,
Dan Hesse will discuss operational performance in the quarter; Steve Elfman will provide an update on Network
Vision; and Joe Euteneuer will cover financial results.
After that, we will open the call to your questions. However, due to Securities Law issues relating to the pending
transactions, we will only address questions relating to the ongoing business and not with respect to the pending
SoftBank or Clearwire transactions. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation regarding this issue.
Before we get underway, let me remind you that our release and the presentation slides that accompany this call are
both available on the Investor Relations page of the Sprint website.
Slide two is our cautionary statement. I do want to point out that in our remarks this morning we will be discussing
forward-looking information, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
materially from our forward-looking statements.
We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review including our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

quarter ended September 30, 2012, and when filed, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2012.
Turning to slide three, throughout our call, we will refer to several non-GAAP metrics. Reconciliations of our
non-GAAP performance and liquidity measures to the appropriate GAAP measures for the fourth quarter can be found
in the attachments to our earnings release and also at the end of today's presentation, which are available on our website
at www.sprint.com/investors.
Let's move on to earnings per share on slide four. Basic and diluted net loss for common share for the fourth quarter
were $0.44 compared to $0.26 in the third quarter and $0.43 in the year-ago period. Basic and diluted net loss per
common share for the full year 2012 was $1.44 compared to $0.96 in the full-year 2011.
There were a couple of noteworthy items impacting EPS this quarter, that I'd like to cover. First, the loss per share in
the current period included incremental depreciation expense of approximately $400 million or negative $0.13 per
share on a pre-tax basis, primarily due to accelerated depreciation expense related to the expected shutdown of the
Nextel platform. Accelerated depreciation for the full year 2012 was approximately $2.1 billion or negative $0.72 per
share on a pre-tax basis. We continue to expect higher levels of accelerated depreciation in the first half of 2013, due to
the Nextel platform becoming fully depreciated by the middle of 2013.
The fourth quarter also included $45 million or approximately negative $0.01 per share on a pre-tax basis related to
impacts from Hurricane Sandy and $19 million or approximately negative $0.01 per share on a pre-tax basis related to
costs associated with the SoftBank and Clearwire transactions.
Net tax expense was $44 million in the fourth quarter and $154 million for the full year 2012. Net tax expense for 2013,
excluding the impact of pending strategic transactions, is expected to be between $170 million and $220 million.
I will now turn the call over the Dan Hesse, Sprint's CEO.
Daniel R. Hesse
Thank you Brad, and good morning. Thank you for joining us and as always thank you for your interest in Sprint.
Before I recap our overall performance for 2012, let me take a moment and touch on some of the key highlights from
the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide six, our adjusted OIBDA performance of $860 million marks the sixth consecutive quarter we've
exceeded Street consensus expectations and represents over 2% growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Our
wireless adjusted OIBDA margin held steady compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, in spite of a record quarter of
iPhone activations and a larger year-over-year increase in dilution from our Network Vision project.
Driven by continued strength in postpaid ARPU, Q4 represents our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth
in Sprint platform service revenues and our 12th consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Total Q4 operating revenues
of $9 billion are up year-over-year for the 10th consecutive quarter and reached our highest level in over four years.
Smartphone sales were strong for us in the quarter. We sold over 6.1 million smartphones in the quarter, including 2.2
million iPhones, a new quarterly record, with 38% going to new customers. Smartphones represented 77% of our retail
Sprint platform handset sales and 89% of our postpaid Sprint platform handset sales in the quarter, and we achieved a
balanced sales mix between the OS platforms. Third-party data indicates that in the fourth quarter, Sprint was the top
seller of the popular Samsung GALAXY S III handset.
We made substantial progress on our efforts to shut down the Nextel platform in the quarter. One third of the Nextel
platform subscriber base moved off the platform in the quarter, and we recaptured a healthy 51% of the postpaid Nextel
deactivations in the quarter and a record 50% of the prepaid deactivations.
Finally, we made continued progress on our Network Vision deployment, despite the impacts of Hurricane Sandy in the
quarter. Sprint LTE service is now available in 58 cities, and our run rate for putting sites on air is up 83% compared to

last quarter.
Please turn to slide seven. As we began 2012, the first year of the investment phase of our turnaround, I told you a year
ago that our primary focus in 2012 would be OIBDA performance to ensure we were maximizing operational cash
generation in support of our substantial investments. I'm pleased to report that we delivered over $4.8 billion of
adjusted OIBDA in 2012, $1 billion higher in 2012 analyst consensus one year ago.
In spite of the sizeable new investments in Network Vision and a full year of the iPhone in 2012, our annual adjusted
OIBDA decline was only a modest 5% from 2011. Although, we're far from where we want to be in adjusted OIBDA
margin performance, our achievements are notable under the circumstances.
We doubled our wireless CapEx investment year-over-year as we deploy a leading-edge wireless network to enhance
our industry-leading customer service.
In October, we announced a large investment by SoftBank which, when closed, will provide a $8 billion cash infusion
into Sprint and serve as a catalyst for accelerating our turnaround efforts.
In November, we announced the acquisition of spectrum and customers from U.S. Cellular in Chicago and in St. Louis,
which should strengthen our network performance in those markets.
And in December, we announced a proposed acquisition of the shares we don't own on Clearwire, which would give
Sprint complementary spectrum to our low and medium frequency spectrum assets.
Now the balance of my remarks this morning will be organized around our three unchanged overarching priorities: the
customer experience; the Sprint brand; and cash.
If you please turn to slide 8, I'll begin with cash. We ended 2012 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments of $8.2 billion, up from $5.6 billion a year ago, which included the benefit of $3.1 billion of cash received
in the fourth quarter from SoftBank.
Our adjusted OIBDA performance for 2012 benefited from continued top line growth. We had solid revenue
performance across all three areas of our Sprint platform wireless business, which resulted in year-over-year service
revenue growth of almost 15%. The annual Sprint platform postpaid ARPU rate of $63.05 is our highest level ever and
the 5% year-over-year growth represents our best annual improvement ever.
The fourth quarter is our 9th consecutive quarter of year-over-year postpaid ARPU growth for the Sprint platform. And
absent the impacts of Hurricane Sandy that Brad mentioned earlier, would have represented a sequential ARPU
increase from Q3 as we continue to benefit from our data price increase in 2011.
For 2012, postpaid wireless service revenue on the Sprint platform increased almost 11% year-over-year. In our prepaid
brands, both Boost and Virgin reached their best ever ARPU levels in the fourth quarter, contributing to nearly 32%
growth in Sprint platform prepaid service revenue versus 2011. And finally, wholesale and other revenue is up 85%
year-over-year.
As I mentioned earlier, full year consolidated adjusted OIBDA was $4.8 billion. When adjusted for the estimated net
dilutive impacts of Network Vision deployment, 2012 adjusted OIBDA would be our first year of annual OIBDA
growth since 2006, the year after the Nextel merger.
We were able to mitigate the impact of growing subsidy expenses associated with the industry dynamic of smartphone
growth and the full year of the iPhone, as well as our loss of revenue from our Nextel platform deactivations with
improvements in operational expense, including notably, service and repair and customer care costs.
Turning to slide 9, in the customer experience, 2012 was another record setting year for Sprint. As we reported
previously for the first time ever, Sprint is alone at number one among all national carriers in the American Customer
Satisfaction Index, the most improved U.S. company in any industry over the last four years and we're the only
company from all 47 industry studied to go from last place to first place in four years.

J.D. Power recognized Sprint seven times in 2012, including awards to three of our brands, Sprint, Boost, and Virgin
Mobile. 2012 also marked our best ever levels in both postpaid and prepaid calls to customer care and our lowest ever
expense for customer care credits. Also in 2012, we reached our best ever levels for customer satisfaction with our
retail experience, as measured by an independent third-party in both our company-owned and indirect channels.
While we've made great strides in the customer experience, postpaid churn isn't where we'd like it to be. Sprint
platform churn of 1.98% in the fourth quarter is down slightly from a year ago, but up from Q3 as we continue to
experience pardon our dust transition issues associated with our Sprint platform Network Vision upgrade and the loss
of Sprint platform customers when we lose an entire business account due to our aggressive Nextel platform migration
activities.
While I'm pleased with our recent run rates, we are behind our original objectives on Network Vision deployment and
admittedly our LTE coverage footprint lags our two largest competitors. We're working hard to catch up and we view
these network-related churn drivers as temporary.
In addition, we've reached the highest percentage of our postpaid base on contract since the second half of 2007,
another favorable leading indicator for future churn improvement. Prepaid churn is a highlight for both the fourth
quarter and 2012. Q4 prepaid churn of 3.3% is our best ever and represents our 16th consecutive quarter of
year-over-year improvement.
Our Sprint platform 2012 prepaid churn rate of 3.01% is also a best ever number. Both the Boost and Virgin brands
showed meaningful improvements in churn year-over-year.
As I move to our brand results in slide 10, I'll begin with a brief summary of the iPhone. For the full year 2012, we
activated over 6.6 million iPhones, well ahead of our contractual minimums with Apple.
As I've discussed on previous calls, the most important early-life profitability measure of the iPhone is the percentage
of activations that are new to Sprint. And I'm pleased to report that for 2012, 40% of our iPhone activations were new
postpaid customers.
We also continue to be pleased with the operational performance of the iPhone as we are observing fewer care calls,
fewer returns and exchanges, and lower early-life voluntarily churn rates for iPhone customers versus comparable
smartphone customers in our base. Performance to-date continues to support our decision to carry the iPhone.
Now turning to slide 11, I am pleased to report continued strength in the Sprint brand in our related subscriber
performance in the quarter when we continued our emphasis on the recapture of our Nextel subscribers. Sprint platform
postpaid gross adds were up 17% sequentially. And in addition, we recaptured 51% of the postpaid Nextel platform
deactivations.
Q4 marked our 11th consecutive quarter, a positive postpaid net customer additions on the Sprint platform. For the
full-year 2012, we added over 4.7 million customers to the Sprint platform, including over 1.5 million postpaid and
over 2.3 million prepaid customers. And we ended the year with 53.5 million customers on the Sprint platform, the
highest number ever.
We believe our corporate responsibility efforts including our sustainability initiatives, strengthen the brand. In 2012,
Newsweek ranked Sprint America's third greenest company, the only wireless or telecom company in the top 25. The
Sprint brand also stands for innovation. We were issued a Sprint record 618 patents in 2012, almost 2.5 patents every
business day.
So in conclusion, I've – and we have completed the first phase of our turnaround, the recovery phase in the first half of
the investment phase. One highlight of 2012 was the return generated for our shareholders as measured by Sprint's
stock price. Sprint's total shareholder return in 2012 of 142% was the second highest among the 500 companies making
up the S&P index. But our work is far from over.
Our prospects are improving, though. The investment by SoftBank, combined with the operational improvements over
the last five years creates a pathway for growth. As mentioned, we announced transactions with SoftBank, U.S.

Cellular and Clearwire in the fourth quarter, but we didn't let these initiatives take our eye off of operations. We look
forward to closing these transactions and we believe that Sprint will emerge as a more competitive company.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Elfman, who will give you an update on our Network Vision progress.
Steven Lawrence Elfman
Thanks, Dan. I'm pleased to discuss our continued progress on Network Vision during the quarter. In the fourth quarter,
we continued to make strong progress with the Network Vision pipeline and grew our pacing significantly. While the
build in the fourth quarter was of course impacted by Hurricane Sandy, our network pacing overall has been strong
enough that we are not changing the outlook of 12,000 sites for Q1 that I shared with you last quarter.
We now have zoning complete on nearly 29,000 sites and leasing complete on over 27,000 sites a 34% increase over
Q3 for both.
More than 19,500 sites are ready or have already begun construction, an increase of nearly 45% over the third quarter,
and this represents half of all sites to be upgraded.
Our weekly construction starts are up 56% from Q3 and sites completed per week are up 83% from last quarter. We've
doubled the number of cities under construction to over 450, and we have now launched 4G LTE in 58 cities with
nearly 170 more expected to launch in the months to come. We now have over 8,000 sites on air, nearly double the
number I reported three months ago.
We're also very pleased with the performance we are seeing on LTE sites we have on air. Average downlink and uplink
speeds are highly competitive in the range of 6 to 8 megabits per second for downlink and 2 to 3 megabits per second
for uplink. We expect this performance to improve as we bring full site clusters on air and continue to tune the network.
We're encouraged by this momentum as we enter into 2013 and are committed to deploying Network Vision as quickly
as we can. We're working hard with our vendors to make up for the delays they encountered in 2012. And with the
additional financial flexibility in 2013, we are planning to enhance the Network Vision build, adding more capacity and
density to LTE. Included in this is more rapid deployment of LTE on 800 we now expect to launch this year. We expect
to have LTE coverage for approximately 200 million pops by the end of 2013, depending upon backhaul availability,
which could push it into very early 2014.
Now, if you could turn to slide 15, please. In the fourth quarter, we continue to make strong progress on the winding
down the Nextel platform. At the end of 2012, we had approximately 2.1 million subs remaining, 1.6 million of which
were postpaid. We're on track to shut down the Nextel platform by the end of the second quarter.
Our operational shut down plans for the platform will be similar to that of the thinning process we engaged in last year.
The network will be shut down at switch locations in rapid succession followed by powering down equipment and
eliminating backhaul at each cell site, which we expect to substantially complete within 90 days.
The shutting down of the Nextel platform in the middle of this year will be an important turning point for Sprint, it will
enable us to remove the incremental expense in operating costs of running two separate networks and it should enable
us to improve our service to our customers on the Sprint platform by redeploying our 800 spectrum to CDMA voice
and LTE. This is expected to enhance in-building coverage. The deployment of approximately 2.5 megahertz to 3
megahertz of 800 spectrum to CDMA voice has begun to be deployed. Also, LTE on 800 is now planned to commence
in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Network Vision is now well underway and we are pleased with the service improvements and financial benefits we're
beginning to see. 2013 is expected to be an important year for Sprint, with Nextel network shutting down and the
modernization of the network expected to be substantially complete by the end of the year.
I'll now turn it over to Joe to take you through the financials.

Joseph J. Euteneuer
And thanks, everyone, for being here today. As Steve and Dan have discussed, 2012 was an important year for Sprint
as we entered the investment phase of our turnaround and made major investments in the future growth and strength of
our business; while maintaining a strong focus on profitability and improving our Sprint platform operations. Our
results in the fourth quarter reflect that continued focus, and we believe we are well-positioned as we enter the biggest
period of our investment phase in 2013.
Moving to slide 16, our Sprint platform postpaid business continued to show strong growth in both subscribers and
revenues during the fourth quarter. Sprint platform postpaid net adds were 401,000 in the fourth quarter. While Sprint
platform postpaid gross adds were down 10% year-over-year, they were up to 17% sequentially, and we estimate that
we are able to roughly maintain our share of gross adds during the quarter even while continuing to balance more costly
external acquisition with our focus on the Nextel recapture effort.
Our postpaid Nextel recapture rate remained strong in the fourth quarter at 51%. Getting the Nextel platform cleared
and shutdown on time, while recapturing as many customers as possible is one of the most important things we can do
for Sprint's future financial strength, and I'm pleased to say we are well on our way to achieving these goals.
In 2012, our efforts contributed to 67% decrease in the Nextel platform subscribers, and we recaptured 55% of Nextel
postpaid deactivations, which is double our historical recapture rate. In highly aggressive and competitive environment,
our focus in 2012 on preserving value from the Nextel platform as we work to remove this major operational cost from
our financials has really paid off.
As we've discussed with you throughout the year, our postpaid Nextel recapture rate in Q4 declined from third quarter
levels, and we expect further declines as we approach complete shutdown. Due to the fact that non-adjustable
subscribers such as zero use and negative ROI customers remain in the base until shutdown.
At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 1.6 million postpaid customers remaining on the Nextel
platform. Approximately 282,000 were retail customers and just under 1.4 million were business customers, with
almost two-thirds of these business customers having complex custom network solutions. Based on our current
knowledge, the total postpaid Nextel recapture rate for the first half of 2013 is expected to be between 30% and 40%.
As we have worked strategically in 2012 to move customers off the Nextel platform and thus remove a major
duplicative cost driver of our business, total postpaid net adds have been negative during the year, and we expect them
to continue to be negative in the first half of 2013 as we approach complete shutdown of the platform.
However, while we have worked through this important step for future improved profitability, we have managed it in a
way that has preserved revenue. Total postpaid service revenue was up approximately 5% in 2012, and total wireless
service revenue was up 6% during the year.
As we work our way through the knothole of getting the Nextel platform shutdown, we expect to exit the year with
strong postpaid revenues and higher margins. Out of this transition, we expect a much improved financially stronger
Sprint.
Sprint platform postpaid churn of 1.98% in the fourth quarter improved slightly from the prior-year quarter. While
churn did improve from last year, it is currently higher than our desired levels, largely due to network impacts as we
continue to go through the Network Vision deployment process. While we expect these impacts to be temporary in
nature, churn is likely to remain at elevated levels for the next few quarters before we start to see gradual benefits from
the Network Vision deployment.
Split platform postpaid ARPU of $63.04 for the fourth quarter was down on a sequential basis due to an approximate
$0.18 impact from customer credits related to Hurricane Sandy. Excluding the impact from Sandy, Sprint platform
postpaid ARPU would have been up slightly sequentially due to the continued penetration of our premium data add-on
charge, offset by dilution from the continued higher-than-expected recapture of Nextel platform subscribers.

As we've discussed previously, higher recapture rates cause ARPU dilution on the Sprint platform but are accretive to
the total postpaid ARPU, which at $61.47, was our highest in over six years and was up $0.29 sequentially.
Sprint platform ARPU remains near historic highs and grew 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. With continued
penetration of our premium data add-on charge expected in our base, we expect that ARPU on the Sprint platform will
continue to grow in 2013, but at a slower rate than in 2012.
Moving to slide 17, our Sprint platform prepaid business also continues to grow. We added 525,000 customers in the
quarter, including 188,000 customers we captured from the Nextel platform and our Virgin Mobile brand posted its
best-ever net adds, since we acquired it in 2009.
While the fourth quarter's Sprint platform prepaid net adds were down 42% from last year, the primary driver was
related to impacts on the Assurance brand from regulatory changes in the lifeline industry.
As Virgin Mobile and Boost net adds on the Sprint platform actually grew 37% year-over-year and contributed to 26%
year-over-year growth in Sprint platform prepaid revenues. Both Virgin Mobile and Boost had their highest ever ARPU
in the fourth quarter, so both of these brands are performing extremely well.
As I discussed with you on last quarter's call, the lifeline industry regulatory changes are expected to have a significant
one-time impact to our Assurance subscribers in the second quarter of 2013, as we implement a mandated
recertification process of our Assurance base. And I want to go into some more detail on this with you now.
The recertification process will impact customer accounts throughout the lifeline industry, and while we expect the
negative impact to our total prepaid base to be significant, we believe that the impact to us will be smaller than to other
carriers who did not already have a recertification process in place.
Because we launched the Assurance program with an annual recertification process in place from the beginning, we
have some experience in this process and its results. However, the impact to our subscriber base will be much bigger in
this case, because we are recertifying the entire base at one-time rather than normal rolling 12-month cycle. A normal
annual recertification rate is approximately 70%, with about 90% of those who's recertified qualifying for service.
Despite challenges from the complexity of new applications, we expect to achieve about this rate of recertification for
the entire Assurance base. We expect this result in a one-time net subscriber loss of approximately 1.3 million to 1.4
million to our prepaid base in the second quarter of 2013. While the subscriber impact is significant, revenue loss is
limited as these are among the lowest ARPU subscribers in our prepaid base, and we continue to expect growth in
Sprint platform prepaid service revenues in 2013.
The lifeline regulatory changes have also had some temporary impacts on our wholesale and affiliate business, as we
saw net customer losses in the fourth quarter for the first time in three years. This was primarily the result of a targeted
effort by our wholesale customers to eliminate inactive accounts in the base.
We expect impacts from the same recertification phenomenon that will affect Assurance and inactive account cleanup
activity to contribute to wholesale net customer losses in the range of 500,000 to 600,000 in the first half of 2013, but
we fully expect to return to positive net adds in the second half of the year. Even with the net losses in the fourth
quarter, we grew wholesale, affiliated and other revenue by 82% from the prior year quarter and 12% sequentially.
Let's move on to our wireless operating expenses on slide 18. Total wireless cost of service in the fourth quarter was
$2.2 billion or 30% of wireless service revenues, which was our best level since the second quarter of 2008. This
reflects a 2 percentage point gross margin improvement year-over-year, even with estimated net increase in Network
Vision dilution, which primarily impacts cost of service.
We continue to see benefits in the service and repair expense, which are down year-over-year due to lower transaction
volumes and higher refurbish replacement rates. We are also seeing lower rent and utility expense on the Nextel
network, primarily related to lease-exit charges taken earlier this year associated with the accelerated thinning project.

4G roaming expenses are also lower year-over-year, due to our flat rate with Clearwire. Total wireless cost of service
margin has also improved sequentially as lower service and repair and 3G roaming costs more than offset additional
Network Vision dilution.
Total wireless net subsidy expense for the fourth quarter was approximately $2 billion, an increase of $342 million
sequentially and $262 million year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to a 17% increase in postpaid gross adds
and higher levels of Sprint platform upgrades, resulting from not only the new iPhone, but also discounted older iPhone
models, high Nextel platform recaptures, and the popular Samsung GALAXY S III. While subsidy rates continue to
have an impact on the entire industry, Sprint had a balanced smartphone sales mix with the highest ratio of iPhone sales
going to new customers in the industry.
Total fourth quarter wireless selling, general and administrative costs of $2.4 billion were up year-over-year, but
essentially flat as a percentage of total wireless service revenues. Part of the year-over-year increase was related to the
additional selling expense associated with direct-sourced iPhones and wireless SG&A as a percent of service revenue
would have been lower without it. Year-over-year sales expense were also affected by a higher mix of postpaid sales
versus prepaid sales.
Please turn the slide 19. Our disciplined approach to grow throughout the year has led to strong adjusted OIBDA
results, and this continued in the fourth quarter. Consolidated adjusted OIBDA of $860 million beat consensus
estimates again and was up 2% from the year ago period. We are able to grow adjusted OIBDA, even while absorbing
additional impacts from the Network Vision project reflecting our strong focus on cost discipline.
Total estimated Network Vision net impact to adjusted OIBDA was approximately $130 million during the quarter
compared to approximately $185 million in the third quarter and approximately $50 million in the year-ago period.
While we continue to spend more each quarter as the build ramps, the sequential decline in Network Vision net dilution
was partly related to an OEM credit based on purchase levels for the entire year.
In addition, as discussed on the third quarter call, we expect some dilutive impacts from the Network Vision to shift
into 2013, due to build timing and therefore expect Network Vision dilution to adjusted OIBDA will increase
sequentially for the next two quarters.
Wireline adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter of $181 million was essentially flat to the year-ago period and up 15%
sequentially. The sequential growth was primarily related to delayed IP disconnect activity and a one-time tax refund.
Looking ahead, we expect wireline adjusted OIBDA for 2013 to be down approximately $200 million from 2012,
similar to previous years. The resetting of our inter-company transfer rates to reflect current market prices, which is
neutral to consolidated adjusted OIBDA is expected to pressure wireline margins along with continued cable, voice and
IP migrations.
Moving to cash and liquidity on slide 20; we continue to make improvements to our liquidity and capital structure this
quarter. We received $3.1 billion from SoftBank related to the issuance of a 7-year 1% convertible bond. We also
raised approximately $2.3 billion in the debt markets and used the proceeds to retire the final Nextel communication
debt maturities, nearly $1.2 billion in 2014 and more than $1.1 billion in 2015. This leaves us with no significant
maturities between now and December of 2016.
We ended the fourth quarter with total liquidity position of $9.45 billion including cash, cash equivalents, and
short-term investments of $8.2 billion and $1.3 billion of an un-drawn borrowing capacity under our revolving bank
credit facility, which expires in October of 2013.
We have started discussions with our banks to amend and extend the credit facility, including for the SoftBank
transaction, and we expect the process to be completed in the second quarter. We also have approximately $704 million
of expected future liquidity from our secured equipment credit facility, as we borrowed an additional $219 million
during the fourth quarter. We continue to expect to fully utilize the secured equipment credit facility, as we progress
through the Network Vision project.

Capital expenditures for the quarter were just over $1.9 billion and included approximately $1.3 billion of Network
Vision capital. Network Vision capital was up 24% sequentially as the build continues to gain momentum. Re-banding
expenditures, which are not included in capital expenditures, were approximately $46 million for the fourth quarter,
and we expect $200 million to $300 million of spend in 2013, depending on the timing of the Mexican border
re-banding program.
Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was negative $1.3 billion compared to negative $487 million in the third quarter
and positive $257 million a year ago. The sequential decrease was impacted by the seasonally high selling quarter and
continued ramp of the Network Vision project. As we are now in the middle of the investment phase of our turnaround,
we continue to expect free cash flow to be negative for the next several quarters.
Finally, I want to outline some expectations for 2013. 2012 has been a year of significant progress for Sprint, in which
we increased the growth trends of the company. We were able to grow total net operating revenues by nearly 5% and
produced adjusted OIBDA growth for the first time in six years, excluding estimated net dilution from Network Vision.
The investments that we are making in Network Vision are expected to bring major benefits to the future health and
financial strength of the company, and the growth of our core Sprint platform business and our Network Vision strategy
help Sprint enter into a $20 billion transaction with SoftBank, and we expect will give us the balance sheet flexibility to
become a much stronger competitor. I am proud of the accomplishments we've made in 2012, and I am excited about
the future.
2013 is a major investment year for Sprint, in which we expect to make even greater progress on our Network Vision
plans, while continuing to show growth in our core Sprint platform revenues and adjusted OIBDA. We have a lot of
moving parts with the pending SoftBank and Clearwire transactions, but our core business is growing well and will
continue with our balanced approach to customer acquisition and profitability as we go through the Network Vision
build.
Consolidated adjusted OIBDA for the full-year 2013 is expected to be between $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion. From a
capital point of view, now that we have some of the capital from SoftBank, we have some additional flexibility. We are
adding capacity to our legacy network to support the growing usage trends that are affecting the entire industry, and we
want to push our Network Vision build.
We want to catch up on any delays and build on the momentum we are seeing as best we can. And with the additional
financial flexibility, we also expect to spend some additional capital on improving density and adding incremental
capacity to the future state network as we go through the build. We believe that the faster we can deploy the capital and
the higher standards we can deploy in the network architecture, the better off we will be.
Including some delayed spend from 2012 coming into 2013, these areas will contribute to heightened capital spend in
2013, while we believe will help us move more quickly towards becoming a stronger and more competitive company.
In the first two quarters of 2013, we expect total capital expenditures to be at a similar to slightly higher levels to the
fourth quarter of 2012. Giving all the moving pieces with our pending transactions, we will provide an update on the
second half of the year as we approach the closing of the SoftBank transaction.
In closing, I am very pleased with the strong, steady results that we continue to produce as we execute on Network
Vision and move through our investment phase.
This year should be an important turning point for our company as we expect to close the two pending mergers,
shutdown the Nextel network, aggressively expand our LTE footprint, and continue to make smart investments that
should set us up for future growth. Our focus on disciplined, profitable growth will continue as we work to build a
stronger, more competitive Sprint.
I'll turn the call back over to Brad for Q&A. Thank you.

Thanks, Joe. In just a minute, Laura will instruct our listeners on how to queue up for the question-and-answer session.
I want to point out that you may access an audio replay or a webcast of our presentation on www.sprint.com/investors.
We will now open the line for your questions. Laura, please instruct our participants.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jonathan Chaplin [New Street Research].
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks so much for taking the question. And I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit
of context around the projections that were provided in the proxy, particularly the shift in your EBITDA expectations
between the first case that you presented in August and second case that you presented in September. It seems like the
material downshift in EBITDA for 2014. And then I'm wondering -- you're sort of fairly far along in [indiscernible]
(41:35) closing the deal at this point of SoftBank. I'm sure you've been exchanging best practices. I mean, if you can
give us some insights, where the upside to that forecast and the proxy comes from. What kind of value do you think
SoftBank could bring?
And then finally on the higher CapEx, I'm wondering if you could give us some more context on where the – how
many additional cell sites you'll be deploying for Network Vision and how quickly you can start deploying the
2.5-gigahertz spectrum and whether that's part of the first half of the year CapEx. Thanks.
<A - Brad Hampton>: Hey, Jonathan. Could you please repeat the first part of your question? We were having some
audio trouble in the room; we couldn't hear it very well.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Oh, I'm sorry. So the first part of the question was just context around the shift in the cases
that were provided in the proxy, the sort of $1.2 billion downshift between case one and case two for 2014 EBITDA.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah. Sure, Jonathan, remember the difference. Those cases that we put in the proxy are
totally related to supporting someone making a decision about whether they wanted to make an investment in Sprint
and not really the sort of business case that we're putting together as a result of changes in the business. You're talking
about two different points in time. So when we run sensitivities in the proxy, it's just to get people comfortable with
what the company could do. But since those numbers were run, obviously there's a lot of progress we've made in,
obviously, delivering the OIBDA results we've delivered including the fourth quarter.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: So, Joe, you regard those as very conservative forecasts, then, in the proxy and there's
upside to those based on the results that you've delivered?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: We're pretty confident in the future growth of Sprint as a result of the things we're doing
with Network Vision, the continued costs we continue to take out of the model, and I think with the fourth-quarter
OIBDA, you can see that we've continued to demonstrate our focus on profitability.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks, Joe. And any context around the CapEx in terms of the additional cell sites that you
guys will be deploying and how soon you can get the 2.5 into the network?
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Yeah. Hi, Jonathan; this is Steve. I think from a 2.5, at this point in time it would be
the Clearwire plans that they've laid out. There's nothing that we can discuss on 2.5 until that transaction would close,
number one.
Number two, in terms of the investment that gives us flexibility, this year is really to focus more on bringing up 800
site capability earlier. We really weren't going to be able to do 800 LTE until very early 2014. We're bringing that up
into the fourth quarter of 2013, and that should provide us more density, better coverage this year. So, that's one of the
few things that we've been able to benefit from with both sharing of best practices as well with SoftBank.

<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: So no increase in the total site count from 38,000 then?
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: No. Not at this point in time, no. Our plan is, at this point in time is 38,000 as we go
into the year.

Operator
The next question comes from Kevin Smithen [Macquarie].
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Do you currently expect to step up CDMA LTE marketing spend in Q3 and Q4 to drive net
adds, once the iDEN decommissioning is totally completed in June?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: This is Dan. Basically, what we will do in the second half of the year is change our focus in
our advertising spend from, if you will, Nextel recapture and internal movements more toward, if you will, the
customers that are out there in the market in general. So we're not providing expense guidance with respect to particular
areas yet for the second half, but generally what you'll see is a refocusing or change in the targeting of our marketing
spend in the second half of the year once basically the Nextel customers are no longer there.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Great. And, Joe, can you give us some color on your iDEN lease termination schedule? When
do the cash payments stop? I know that's going to be a drag on free cash. At some point I imagine that will disappear.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah. Sure. On those, remember, you have some of the leases that we've been able to
negotiate out of and others we'll have to continue to pay. So what you see is the difference. In OIBDA, you'll have the
total shutdown of the leases when we shut down the network. So you'll have the write-offs, you'll get an OIBDA
benefit, but you'll see in this statement of cash flows, the continued cash payment associated with those leases that
would remain.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: But our understanding is that over 2014 and 2015 that will phase out gradually those cash
payments.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Is it completed by the end of 2015 or is there still some residual?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: There might be some small residual. I could give you some more specifics, but yeah, it
pretty much tails off by then.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Okay. Great. That's very helpful.
Operator
Our next question comes from Phil Cusick [JPMorgan Securities].
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Hi, guys. Thanks. Thinking about CapEx in the first half, you gave some good details there, and
I know you don't want to give a lot of second half color until the SoftBank and Clearwire deals are done, but can you
help us think about it? Excluding Clearwire for now, do you think CapEx once you have the SoftBank money would be
higher or lower in the second half than the first?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Listen, we're in the process of continuing to work with these guys, and once we close the
transaction, we'll come back and give you an updated. We – look, we've been trying to be as fulsome as we can, but we
don't want to get ahead of ourself, and so with respect to [indiscernible] (47:40) we want to make sure, he can complete

his plans with us and then go out and properly announce.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Got it. I appreciate it. And then second, on the iDEN network, what was the run rate of costs
there? I think a year ago you told us that it was running about $1.4 billion before the thinning began. What's the run rate
of Nextel cost today, and what could we expect to be pretty much – could we expect that to be pretty much gone at
least on a reported basis a year from now?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: On iDEN or...
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: On iDEN. I'm sorry.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: On iDEN. On – yeah, so the thing to think about on iDEN is that basically when we shut
it down, you eliminate the rent other than the cash payments we talked about. Utilities will come off in the first 90, 120
days, and you got about $30 million of property taxes that will come off going into 2014 because you have to pull the
equipments physically off the tower, so that's about the timing of it.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: And what was the run rate in the fourth quarter? [indiscernible] (48:41)?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: We haven't given that level of detail.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Yeah.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah, we haven't said that. But you'll see the benefit in the OIBDA results and the
improved margin as you get into the second half of the year.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Thanks, Joe.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Dixon [FBR Capital Markets].
<Q - David M. Dixon>: Thanks very much, and good morning. Couple questions, if I may. On the zoning front, Steve,
I was wondering what changes would hypothetically be needed if you were layering in 2.5 and whether that could
affect the pacing of the build, again just hypothetically if – just talking to the flexibility there.
And then secondly, just on backhaul, could you just remind us how much you've got locked in in terms of capacity and
how important do you think owner economics are there given your differentiation focus is built around unlimited?
And then lastly, just on the pacing that we're seeing, Steve, the latest week-to-week pacing, how are you seeing that?
What's the current pacing of LTE upgrade sites per week? And if you could provide an update on perhaps any insights
on churn, maybe too early, but insights on churn that you're seeing inside of upgraded markets versus non-upgraded
markets. We did see a bit of a step up in the quarter.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Is that all, David? Let's do your hypothetical first and actually it's not a hypothetical. When we
renegotiated the various tower deals, because of Clearwire's relationship to us, we were able to put 2.5 on the towers.
<Q - David M. Dixon>: Terrific.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: That has nothing to do with the transaction or not, so in the bulk of the sites.
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: In the bulk of the sites, we can put 2.5 up when we need to. I'm going to try and go
back, you know in terms of the backhaul, your question was about owners' economics. Well, for backhaul, other than a
percentage of them that we'll be doing in microwave, a fairly low percent, the rest are indeed leasing through the
various AAVs, and so we don't have the opportunity to have owners' economics on that.
And so, then I'm not sure of the rest of the questions...

<Q - David M. Dixon>: Really, yeah, so just on backhaul, Steve to clarify...
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: [indiscernible] (51:32)
<Q - David M. Dixon>: ...yeah – just how much capacity you have locked in?
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Oh, how much? Well, we've got – it's scalable to...

<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: ...lock in 100 meg, yes. So that's – that will not be a problem for us at all. And then
in terms of the week-over-week growth and where we are, I think I kind of gave that where we had the growth from last
time in terms of weekly starts, completes and on airs, the growth that we had in that, I gave in the discussion, in my
talking points. And the other one and what do I think is going to happen with churn? I hope it improves.
<Q - David M. Dixon>: All right. Thanks very much.
<A - Steven Lawrence Elfman>: Yes.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mike McCormack [Nomura Securities International, Inc.].
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Can you just talk a little bit about what you see as far as pricing trends
as we go through 2013? What might be baked into your expectations? I know the smartphone surcharge should, I
assume, start to tail off at some point during the year. So, just some thoughts on industry price, and particularly around
AT&T and Verizon with the pool data plans. As people move up the stack into higher data tiers, obviously your delta
or discount becomes a little bit wider there. And then just lastly on the tablet strategy, just give us an update on your
thoughts regarding the substandard tablets and what you're trying to drive there? Thanks.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Yeah, hi, Mike, Dan here. Our assumptions for the year are that we won't see any significant
changes in pricing in the industry. Both AT&T and Verizon's new rate plan structures are fairly new, T-Mobile has
kind of announced what their plans are. Not that – we of course always reserve the right to make pricing changes, but
we aren't anticipating any currently.
And you're right, I believe as usage begins to increase that our value proposition of unlimited will just begin to look
more attractive. And we still do have some tailwinds, if you will, with respect to customers who either don't have
smartphones or got smartphones before we put in the additional $10 surcharge.
Secondly, with respect to tablets, what we like about tablets is we generally see them as a no-to-very-low subsidy
device and even though they bring in less incremental revenue, let's say, than a first-line or a smartphone accretive.
Our issue with tablets is, of course, we've got the iPad for the first time very late in the year and of course, Apple to,
actually to their credit, they protect their brand very well, but it take some time to get advertising in the market that
meets Apple's approval.
So we really didn't have much of a marketing quarter in the fourth quarter with respect to tablets. And we hope that that
will improve, i.e., we need to increase awareness out there in the marketplace that Sprint carries the iPad, and we intend
to work on that in 2013.
So, tablet sales were a significant piece of the net adds of both AT&T and Verizon. In this past quarter, they were not a
significant piece of our net add performance in the fourth quarter and we hope to improve that in 2013.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: All right. Dan, just some – another clarity on the pricing issue. I guess, I was more taking
the other way as those price start to – start to increase more dramatically, do you guys think you have an opportunity to
price up instead of flat to down?

<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, we're not currently planning to change our prices, so we think we're priced at a good
competitive level right now, and we probably would not consider a price increase until we felt that we had a very strong
network position, and we, of course, are closing the LTE gap rapidly. We think we'll be in a much more competitive, if
you will, network situation compared to Verizon and AT&T in the second half of the year. We'll always continue to
evaluate the opportunity to raise prices, and I'm not saying that we wouldn't do that, but we're not currently
contemplating raising prices.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Great. Thanks, Dan.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ric Prentiss [Raymond James & Associates, Inc.].
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: Yeah, good morning, guys. Couple quick ones. First, you mentioned pricing. What are your
thoughts as far as the U.S. industry with installment pricing or financing of the handsets? What do you think the U.S.
appetite will be? And have you guys thought about that as well?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Yeah. This is Dan again. We have thought about it, and we're going to take a kind of a
wait-and-see approach. We're going to watch what happens in the market, how customers respond to it and we evaluate
options and alternatives going forward. But I think, right now, if you just look at the preponderance of the gross adds in
the industry in the postpaid business, customers still like the, if you will, the subsidized devices that are part of a rate
plan and a contract. So we'll – as the industry evolves, we'll evolve with it.
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: And so is it safe to say that you could implement something quickly if you wanted to if it felt like
the industry was moving that way?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Yes. We can move quickly if needed.
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: Okay. And the second question, the U.S. Cellular deal, you mentioned a little bit about it. What
was attractive about that transaction? Is there any others out there that might be of interest? Just kind of what attracted
you to the U.S. Cellular Midwest markets?
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: Well, we certainly won't speculate on any future potential transactions, but with respect to U.S.
Cellular, it gives us a much stronger spectrum position particularly in terms of PCS spectrum in dense markets like
Chicago and St. Louis and particularly in Chicago. As you may remember, we've had quite frankly more network
issues in Chicago than we've had in other major markets, and we needed to enhance our spectrum position. So that was
the real driver; it'll help us improve network performance. We are also picking up additional customers or subscribers
in both those markets from U.S. Cellular. So we think it's going to be a very good transaction for Sprint and it helps us
provide a better network performance in Chicago and St. Louis to Sprint customers.
<Q - Ric Prentiss>: Great. Thanks, Dan.
<A - Brad Hampton>: Operator, we have time for one final question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Barden [Bank of America Merrill Lynch].
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two if I could, please. Just one, you guys
have been -- I think, Steve, you're kind of clear about some of the priorities for deploying the incremental flexibility
you have with respect to capital liquidity. On the capital side of the network, I was wondering -- maybe, Joe, is there
anything that you're doing with this new flexibility from a funds perspective on the operating side? I know Bob, for
instance, has talked about maybe expanding the retail platform presence. Other things that you kind of have maybe teed

up for the first half for the year on the operating side?
And then second, just with respect to the expected T-Mobile launch of the iPhone, you guys as a result are showing us
that there are plenty of new people that want a new experience with the iPhone. T-Mobile's got lower prices; they've

<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: I'll take your first one in regards to the operating. Yeah, I mean things like new stores, we
continue to look at replacing our old C-stores with better markets in the A&B type thing, so that is one thing we are
looking at and have started in 2012, but have a little more flexibility as we move into 2013 and 2014.
<A - Daniel R. Hesse>: David, Dan here for the second part. We have in our, if you will, in our forecasts assumed that
T-Mobile will be getting the iPhone in 2013. We have competitive plans around that. We, of course, take that seriously.
T-Mobile as a competitor and the iPhone is a very competitive device and we have plans in place, but I'm not going to
disclose what they are.
<Q - David W. Barden>: If I could just follow up with one last one, I'm sorry. But – just on the wireline side, I think
Joe at the beginning of last year the expectation was that wireline was going to be down about $350 million
year-over-year. And it didn't really do as badly as that. I think you're expecting $200 million down next year including
the transfer pricing shifts. Could you talk a little bit about what was different than expected in 2012 for the wireline
business relative to the expectations?
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Yeah, it was just really the slower roll off of the cable guys. The cable companies didn't
roll off as fast as we thought so that was really it.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Got it. All right. Thanks, guys. Congrats.
<A - Joseph J. Euteneuer>: Okay. Thanks.
