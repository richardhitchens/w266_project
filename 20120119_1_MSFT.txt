discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the risk factors
section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We
do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Bill. And thanks everyone for joining us. I'm pleased with our performance this quarter. Despite a challenging
PC market, we delivered solid financial results. We saw strong demand for our business products and services, and had
a record holiday season driven by the unique entertainment experience we have built with Xbox 360. This quarter, the
strength of our product portfolio enabled us to grow revenue 5% to $20.9 billion. Combined with our ongoing operating
expense discipline, even as we prepare for a big launch year, we delivered record earnings per share of $0.78.
Similar to prior periods, we saw broad-based growth across geographies, with particular strength in emerging markets.
Within our segments, the Microsoft Business Division had another good quarter, as businesses and consumers around
the world looked to Microsoft to meet their productivity needs. Six quarters post launch, Office 2010 continues to
exceed our expectations, with increased consumer and business PC attach worldwide.
We saw double digit revenue growth across our key business application workloads, including Exchange, SharePoint,
Lync and Dynamic CRM and ERP. As businesses large and small look to the cloud to lower costs and enable new ways
of supporting a distributed workforce, they are turning to Microsoft. With Office 365 we give customers powerful
productivity and collaboration tools at great value. Today more than 100,000 businesses have made the commitment to
our online services. Whether on premise or in the cloud, Microsoft remains the top choice for productivity.
The Server & Tools business delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute on our strategy of cloud
optimizing every business. CIOs are increasingly turning to our business infrastructure offerings including Windows
Server, Hyper-V and Systems Center as they look to Microsoft for the security, flexibility and manageability they need
to build world class private clouds. This quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of double digit growth for
Windows Server Premium revenue and the eleventh quarter of double digit revenue growth for Systems Center. On the
data platform, we remain the worldwide unit share leader with SQL Server.
Consistent with our strategy, we are growing our revenue share with marquee customer wins on mission critical
workloads and business intelligence capabilities. This year, we will bring to market the next generation of our server
offerings, including Windows Server 8, SQL Server 2012 and Systems Center 2012, which deepen and broaden our
platform for the private cloud. Combined with the power of Windows Azure for the public cloud, our offerings give
enterprises the identity, virtualization, application development and management tools they need to officially progress
into the new era of hybrid IT.
The PC market was challenged this quarter with particular softness in the consumer segment. However, Windows 7's
momentum in the Enterprise continued, and today over one-third of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7.
And with the future release of Windows 8, we believe the ecosystem will benefit from the new range of capabilities and
scenarios that it enables.
In Search, we saw improvements in RPS this quarter as we partnered closely with Yahoo! to address the monetization
challenges of the combined-ad platform. We are pleased with the progress and are working hard to continue that
trajectory.
In the year since Windows Phone launched, we have worked diligently alongside our partners, including Nokia, to
bring a differentiated experience to the mobile platform. Earlier this month, at the Consumer Electronics Show, we
showcased the latest innovation in Windows Phone to very positive reviews. With these new devices, we are increasing
the choices for consumers around the world to find a Windows Phone that is exactly right for them.

As I mentioned, Xbox 360 had a record holiday season, as we continue to differentiate home entertainment, whether it's
using Bing voice search on Xbox to quickly find the movies and shows you want to watch, or enabling more interactive
TV as we demonstrated at CES with Sesame Street and Elmo, Xbox and Kinect are bringing together our technologies
to redefine the living room experience.
Beyond gaming and entertainment with the Kinect for Windows program, which launches February 1, our technology
will further innovation and creativity across industries.
During the quarter, we started the integration of Skype's world-class communications products and global network
platform into our portfolio of products and services. While it is still early, we are excited by the momentum we have
seen thus far and by the opportunities to redefine social and real-time communications for consumers and businesses
around the world.
As I have consistently mentioned, operating expense management is a priority for Microsoft. Reflecting our ongoing
discipline and prioritization of investments, operating expenses grew just 4% this quarter.
In summary, we delivered solid financial results despite a challenging PC market. The strength of our product portfolio
drove solid top-line growth. We delivered record earnings per share, and we are well-positioned for future growth.
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by business segment.
Revenue for the quarter was a record $20.9 billion, up 5% or $900 million year-over-year. Operating income was $8
billion, cash flow from operations was $5.9 billion and earnings per share was $0.78. Foreign exchange did not
materially impact our net income this quarter.
Enterprise demand remained strong, as our customers continued to add both products and seats to their enterprise
agreements, and our renewal rates remain solid. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.3 billion and our
contracted not billed balance was approximately $19 billion.
Turning to the PC market, as I mentioned last week, it was a challenging quarter for the industry. Factors such as the
flooding in Thailand, macroeconomic uncertainty and competing form factors resulted in an overall market that we
estimate declined 2% to 4%.
In the PC market, it appears that the impact of the hard drive supply chain constraints were not limited to a specific
region or OEM type. While absolute volumes were impacted, we did see the following trends continue: PC sales to
emerging markets outpaced developed markets; the business PC refresh cycle continued with business PC growth of
2%; the decline of Netbooks negatively impacted consumer PCs, which were down 6%. Netbooks, which a year ago
represented about 8% of the PC market now represent only 2%. Excluding Netbooks, consumer PCs grew 2%.
Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division where revenue was down 6%. As usual
you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. The primary differences between the PC market and
Windows revenue were the continuing growth of emerging markets faster than developed markets and inventory
drawdowns from the prior quarter.
We have now sold 525 million Windows 7 licenses since launch, and as Peter mentioned, we are seeing sustained
momentum on enterprise deployment. In December, we announced that Windows 8 beta would be available in late
February and we also previewed the Windows store which will be the hub where users can discover and download
applications. For developers, the Windows store represents a significant opportunity given its broad reach, flexibility
and favorable economic terms.

Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 3%. Recall in Q2 last year that we
recognized $224 million of revenue for the Office 2010 Technology guarantee program and if you exclude that,
revenue grew 7% for the quarter. Consumer revenue declined 17% year-over-year and declined 2% when factoring in
the impact of the technology guarantee program that I just mentioned. The outperformance relative to the overall PC
market was driven by attach gains which continued despite being 18 months since the launch of Office 2010.
Business revenue grew 9% and within business, multiyear licensing revenue grew 12% and transactional revenue grew
3%, driven by strong attach worldwide. We continued to see strong growth in our productivity solution offerings. Lync,
SharePoint, and Exchange each grew double digits. We've previously shared with you the opportunity that we see for
unified communications and we are beginning to realize that potential. Lync revenue grew over 30% as customers such
as Volkswagen and LA Fitness chose Microsoft to be their voice and video solution.
This quarter, Office 365 became the first major cloud provider to comply with leading E.U. and U.S. standards for data
protection. Meeting these high standards enables businesses to more fully realize the potential of the cloud. We also
had our first major service enhancement to Office 365 which extends the company's next generation cloud productivity
service to reach businesses in 22 additional markets. During the quarter companies such as Jet blue, Campbell's Soup,
Patagonia and Wunderman chose Office 365 to enable their employees and customers to work together in the cloud.
We are also pleased with our momentum in cloud services for education where we now have more than 22 million
users, a 100% increase over the prior year.
Our Dynamics business continued its momentum where revenue grew double digits both in CRM and ERP. Dynamics
CRM revenue grew over 30%. Dynamics CRM had important competitive wins this quarter against Salesforce.com and
Oracle such as Safety-Kleen Systems and the American Heart Association. The common theme among switchers was
that Dynamics CRM has a familiar user interface which improves productive while delivering lower operating costs
than the competition.
Now let's move on to Server and Tools where revenue grew 11% driven by multiyear license revenue that was up
mid-teens in enterprise services. We saw broad-based strength across our products. In our data platform business, SQL
Server, grew low double digits outpacing industry growth due to the strength of our premium edition.
This quarter, we saw competitive database wins against Oracle such as U.K. based retailers, The Cooperative Group,
which switched to SQL Server because of its advantages in business intelligence, security, flexibility and cost. We also
saw strong market anticipation for SQL Server 2012 with over 100,000 downloads in the two months since the release
candidate was made available.
In the private cloud, Windows Server Premium revenue grew high teens and Systems Center grew over 20%. On
Tuesday, we announced Systems Center 2012 which brings many of our Azure Cloud capabilities to an integrated
private cloud management solution for the first time. We also announced great competitive wins against VMware with
accounts such as T. Rowe Price, Unilever and Lufthansa Systems. Systems Center 2012 integrates each separate
component product into one unified solution, streamlining installation and reducing the time it takes to deploy from
days down to hours. Additionally, we provided a clear path to Windows Azure for customers who are looking for a
public or hybrid cloud solution.
In the public cloud, our December release of Azure enhanced ease of use and simplified deployment as well as
delivered new open source capabilities with Hadoop support. We are seeing strong growth in the number of large
customers signing up to use Azure. One such example is Sony Pictures Crackle online content service, which has
moved to Azure due to the cost savings, agility and performance it provides.
Now I'll move on to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 10% and operating performance improved for
the second consecutive quarter. Online advertising revenue was up 13%, driven primarily by search. The increase in
search revenue was driven by both weight and volume improvements. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the
quarter at 15.1%, up 40 basis points this quarter and over 300 basis points year-over-year.
Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices Division, where revenue grew 15%. According to third party
research, Xbox was the number one console in the U.S. during the calendar 2011 and had 46% of U.S. console sales in

December. During the quarter, we sold 8.2 million consoles, which was up over 25%, despite a soft gaming console
market. Kinect continues to impress customers with 18 million Kinects having been sold since launch just over one
year ago. Xbox Live members grew 33% with 40 million users now enjoying Xbox Live. In December, Xbox released
the new Metro style dashboard and added dozens of new entertainment applications and content partners to the
platform. While it is early, engagement has been quite impressive, as the number of people using entertainment apps
from November to December increased by almost 50%.
We continue to make progress with Windows Phone. During the quarter, Nokia began to bring some of their great new
devices to market, which adds to the growing list of compelling phones available from our OEM partners. At CES, the
talk of the show were the new LTE Windows Phones from Nokia and HTC that will be available on AT&T in the
coming months, joining the Lumia 710, which is now available on T-Mobile.
In October, Skype officially joined Microsoft. This quarter over 200 million people used Skype to communicate with
family, friends and businesses. For calendar year 2011, over 300 billion minutes of calls were made over the Skype
network, an increase of 50%. The teams are working closely on the integration across Microsoft, and we will share
more as we get further along the roadmap.
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 17%, driven by the following:
first, we saw an increase in costs resulting from the strong Xbox console sales and increased Xbox royalties. Second,
Enterprise Services continued to grow rapidly. And third, Online Services and traffic acquisition costs increased.
Operating expenses were $7.3 billion, an increase of 4%, driven primarily due to compensation, legal expenses, and
Puerto Rican excise taxes. This quarter we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends.
So in summary, we saw strong demand from our business customers and our Xbox platform delivered a record holiday
season. We were able to navigate a challenging PC market to deliver solid top-line and earnings per share growth.
With that, I will hand it back to Peter, who is going to discuss our business outlook.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I will discuss our expectations for the third quarter and full fiscal year.
Beginning with the Windows and Windows Live Division, we expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market
dynamics similar to the past several quarters. PC growth in emerging markets will outpace developed markets, and
business PC growth will outpace consumer PC growth. We also expect the hard disk drive shortage to continue to
challenge the PC market through at least the next quarter.
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division, for the third quarter and full fiscal year, transactional revenue,
approximately 40% of the division's total, should lag the overall PC market, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to
emerging markets. And multi-year licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low
double digits.
Moving to Server and Tools, approximately 30% of the division's revenues comes from transactional licensing, 50%
from multi-year licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect
transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market, multi-year licensing revenue should grow low
double digits and Enterprise Services revenue should grow high teens.
Turning to the Online Services Division, we are focused on improving the financial performance of our Search business
and are looking for ways to increase RPS and streamline costs. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect
revenue to show year-over-year improvements in RPS.
Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices Division, we continue to be very pleased with our share of the worldwide
console market. However, the console market is softer than we previously expected and as a result we now expect
revenue to grow high single digits for the third quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year.

Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company, COGS growth will continue to be impacted by the changing
mix of revenue as we have seen the past few quarters. We expect COGS to grow about 8% to 10% for the third quarter
and mid-teens for the full fiscal year.
As a result of our focus on operating expense management, we are lowering our fiscal year guidance. We now expect
operating expenses to be $28.5 billion to $28.9 billion for the full fiscal year, including the impact of Skype. This
represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 6%. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the third quarter
and full fiscal year. And we still expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for the full fiscal year.
For the third quarter unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. We continue to expect
unearned revenue at the end of the fiscal year to grow low double digits compared to the prior fiscal year.
As we look forward, we have the strongest product pipeline we have ever had. We're pleased with the early enthusiasm
around our upcoming wave of products that enable CIO's to cloud optimize their business. And we are excited by the
opportunity to unify the consumer experience across our phones, PCs, tablets and TV's with our new Metro style
design.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill and we'll take some questions.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and
avoid long or multi-part questions. Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Holt. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.
<Q - Adam Holt>: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. My question is about the material improvement in OSD
[Online Systems Division] margins quarter-on-quarter. It looks like you held firm on expenses year-on-year. Does that
reflect a new philosophy around that business in terms of driving profitability? And can you update us on where think
you are on the RPS improvement? Thank you.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah. No, thanks, Adam. As we've been saying, the key to profitability in that business is to
grow our top line because it scales really well, the marginal impact of that is very high because it's a high fixed cost
business. We have been, as we've been growing share and improving our RPS, especially this quarter, holding the line
on operating expenses and really streamlining.
The most important thing long-term, as we've said, is to continue to grow that share and grow the revenue per [ph]
served (23:20). So we're pleased with that trajectory and want to keep on that. And we are watching the costs very
carefully so that that revenue marginally goes to the bottom line and that's what you saw happen this quarter; and that's
the trajectory we hope to stay on.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citigroup. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Hi. Thanks. Just wondering on the EDD [Entertainment & Devices Division] side, it
looks like you called out the Nokia payments as part of COGS as a driver and I'm wondering, you've been pointing us

to mix of revenue type as mainly the driver there of COGS. Could you help us out with how meaningful those
payments were and how should we expect those to continue to track as we move into future quarters?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, it's part of it. There were several things impacting the gross margins in the E&D business.
Obviously one is just the volume of consoles and the mix of consoles, high end versus low end, the mix of software
whether it's first party or third party, that has a different margin characteristic. And so that's the biggest piece in E&D.
Then the Nokia piece is also another piece that plays into that. But the biggest piece is the mix of business in the E&D
business, and the Nokia is also another driver of that.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund of Nomura. Go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Thanks, yeah, on the hard drive shortage issue, I spoke with Gartner on Monday, and they
were looking for PCs of down 1%. You guys have said down 2% to 4%, and they helped reconcile that, suggesting that
there were some issues in terms of the pipeline of products and if inventories were reduced in the pipeline, that might
reconcile why the two of you are viewing the industry somewhat differently. I'm just curious if you think that's going to
continue into the next quarter? I know we're going to see impact in this next quarter. I'm just curious whether you and
Gartner might be more in line with each other going forward or if there's more inventory reduction in that pipeline that
might be an ongoing impact above and beyond perhaps what we're seeing from the numbers that Gartner and IDC are
giving us?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, that's impossible to say, Rick. I'd say, obviously for this quarter we obviously are very
confident and comfortable with the estimate. As we said during the remarks, we expect the impact to continue on at
least through the next quarter and I think the best thing to do at the end of that, we'll probably all have a better view and
we can kind of assess where we are and what it looks like going forward.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: I'd say just generally on the inventory as well, obviously, as I said in my remarks, there was an
inventory draw down to end the quarter. I think there was an overall – I think both IDC and Gartner have also talked
about the fact that the overall supply chain for PCs is obviously leaner than it was three months ago. So we'll have to
see how fast people kind of ramp back up, how fast the PC ecosystem rebounds, and that will obviously impact, as
Peter mentioned, inventory at the end of the quarter as well. So a good question.
Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Hi. Thank you. I was wondering, Peter, if you could talk a little bit about which businesses
are the furthest along regarding their COGS transition as you move more and more of your revenues to the cloud? If
you could kind of rank order them for us.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, I'd say Office 365 is really far along. We've had a lot of good momentum, and obviously
one of the things that drives you up the margin scale is getting the economies of scale with volume. We talked about
some of the numbers, 100,000 businesses, the great sort of demand we've had for sort of the Office business all up,
including Office 365. So I'd say that's probably farthest along, followed closely by Windows Azure as we sort of add
new enterprise customers, new ISVs, new developers to that. Certainly, Office 365 is accelerating up the ramp.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: The other thing that I would add is obviously OSD is we'll call it kind of our largest cloud
property, and as Peter mentioned earlier I think in one of the questions, it obviously has achieved scale and as a result,
every incremental kind of search ends up becoming 100% margin. So we are at different stages I think within some of

the different business products, but certainly around running a cloud infrastructure, we feel like we've got quite a good
handle on that primarily from our Search business.
Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from John DiFucci of JPMC. Go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Thank you. My question is actually a follow-up to Rick. It has to do with the Windows OEM
revenue bridge. Just curious on some of these items, how they sit today? For instance, I believe Bill and Peter you take
account for that inventory changes in the Windows attach and inventory line. And last quarter it added about 5% to the
quarter. This quarter, it was a 2% hit, and Bill, you noted the inventory draw-down had an effect there. Can you give us
a sense of where you think channel inventories are today relative to what you might call normal levels? And then also
just quickly on that last line in that bridge, the OEM revenue adjustment, when is this going to stop being negative? It
has been slightly negative for quite some time now, and shouldn't it have stopped like three years after the Vista
launch? Because wasn't it related to XP and having Internet Explorer as part of that, as a meaningful part of that versus
for Vista?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, I'll take the second one first. Next year that should go away. So to answer your question,
yes, that's what you would expect and that's what will happen.
You know, the first question on the inventory, in any given quarter inventory is going to be -- sort of go up and down
depending on what's going on in the channel. As you noted, sometimes it's a tailwind, sometime it's a headwind like it
was this quarter. It's hard to say precisely where it stands and what it's going to be like next quarter. We'll look at it
when we get there.

Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler of Sanford Bernstein. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you. Question for you, how much of the year-over-year decrease in the consumer
revenue on the Office product is due to licensing, licenses specifically included specifically in OEM sales of PCs as
compared to stand-alone Office sales to the consumer market?
<A - Bill Koefoed>: It's mostly associated with OEM. The driver that we use for that part of the MBD business is
specifically tied with the PC unit growth of consumers and so as I mentioned in my remarks, we actually outperformed
that, but that's the best driver that, it's not complete but that's the best driver of trying to be able to predict or interpret
that result.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Okay.

Our next question comes from Phillip Winslow of Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Hi, guys. Good quarter. I just have a question on just the Windows Division. When you
think about the impact of Windows 8 coming out theoretically, obviously the second half of this year, how do you think
that's going to impact build plans amongst OEMs but also inventory levels when we get to the summer? Thanks.

<A - Peter S. Klein>: It's probably premature to talk about that. I think we need to get closer to that. So the thing I
would say is just from an ecosystem perspective, there is an incredible amount of excitement and innovation going on
across vendors, like the chip vendors and all the OEMs. We actually see that starting today with the ultrabooks that
you're seeing with Windows 7. So the fact of the matter is there's a ton of innovation happening today for Windows 7.
There's a ton of excitement for enterprises for both Windows 7 and looking forward to Windows 8 and what that gives
them in terms of an end user experience and IT manageability. So I don't think about it so much as looking forward.
There's a ton of innovation going on today. You see it in ultrabooks. You see it what both the ARM and x86 chip
vendors are doing, so that sort of continues on the regular pace.

Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.
<Q - Kash G. Rangan>: Hi. Thank you very much. If you look at the last few quarters, you have been through tough
comps, slightly slower revenue growth rate and also the mix issues that have caused the gross margins to go down, as
you come out of this tough cycle and start to get into the next set of launches, should we think about the gross margins
starting to go in the other direction just based on what looks to be better mix between your Windows? That's typical of
software business as you get into a launch year. Part of me says maybe the margins are bottoming here. Of course I
completely respect the fact that you have got certain other mix issues that are more longer term as you have the
Entertainment & Devices businesses, the costs there, etcetera, but shouldn't margins start to go back up as you head
into a launch year? Thanks.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yes. Thanks, Kash. Certainly margins are a function of mix. And to the extent there's a higher
mix and higher margin products, that will have a positive impact on margins. And it's not unrealistic to think that in a
launch year you can see higher growth in higher margin products. So it will depend on what the mix is, but I think it's a
very plausible scenario.

Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities. Go ahead, your line is open.
<Q - Brendan Barnicle>: Thanks so much, guys. I was wondering if you could give us color on what you saw
geographically in terms of growth trends and in particular Europe or Asia that was weak or strong?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: We saw particular strength in emerging markets, particularly what we call the BRIC markets,
Brazil, Russia, India and China. That was really a driver of growth for us. And that's exciting for us because we've got
strong and growing positions there, and that's where kind of disproportionate economic growth is happening
worldwide. But as Bill mentioned and as I mentioned, we saw broad-based strength in demand across geographies but
with particular strength in emerging markets.

<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yes, it's interesting. Subscription businesses aren't that much different from our existing
multi-year licensing business in the sense that it builds up-front and then recognized over time, just like our multi-year
licensing agreements, and so it really doesn't have a significant impact on the sort of flavor or character of our revenue
recognition or unearned revenue.

Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Oppenheimer. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.
<Q - Brad Robert Reback>: Great. Thanks a lot. Peter, the business PC growth rate was down about 300 basis points
sequentially. Was that all economic or hard disk drive?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, I'd say – the one thing I'd say is the overall business environment sort of remains very
strong for us, and so all of our sort of macro indicators for business spending on IT remain good, unearned revenue, our
renewals for enterprise license agreements, and sort of enterprise deployments of Windows 7. In terms of PCs, as we
said, there's still growth and we're still sort of in the refresh cycle. I do suspect that some of that is due to supply chain
and maybe a small amount due to macro, but it's small.

Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen. Go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Gregg Steven Moskowitz>: Okay. Thanks, and good afternoon. Peter, you mentioned ultrabooks earlier and on
the heels of CES we're going to be seeing a lot of them hit the market. Can you talk about what this means for
Microsoft? And more importantly, when might ultrabooks be ready for the mass market from a cost perspective?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: For me, what it represents is sort of the excitement and the opportunity long term in building
compelling devices for consumers and businesses around the world. There's so much innovation still to get done.
There's so many new form factors, so many new use cases, and I think it's great to see what the ecosystem does when it
works together, as I mentioned before. You know, in terms of the sort of price points and mass market, we'll just sort of
wait and see how that evolves before commenting on that.

Our next question comes from Tim Klasell of Stifel, Nicolaus. Go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Tim Klasell>: Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a question on the EDD. You mentioned a little bit of
softening in the console sales. Do you think – is that due to mix shifting towards lower priced units? Or is that business
just getting more seasonal? As we model that going forward should we make that a more seasonal holiday type of an
event than we currently do?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: In terms of the over – first of all, we feel -- for our console business we feel really good about
our sort of relative position in the market and our ability to take share and have a really strong competitive position.
In terms of the seasonality, I don't think there's anything that indicates it's more or less seasonal than we've seen in the
past. Like many consumer businesses like this, it will always be relatively stronger at the holiday season, and in terms
of some of the mixes, it – some of it's a function of product cycle. If you think about the Kinect centers and how we

have sold those in to our installed base and now are selling more bundles, those kinds of things, the seasonality hasn't
materially shifted.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Obviously when big title games come out, that tends to also drive kind of a big cycle. So that's
also something to pay attention to around this business.

Operator
Okay. Our next question comes from Robert Breza of RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Breza>: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Bill, maybe could you just comment a little bit back on I think it
was the Credit Suisse analyst talking about the Windows 8 release at the end of February. Given the complexity you're
adding into Windows 8 with mobile, etcetera, making that kind of a cross platform experience, do you expect that to
kind of delay the traditional milestones? Or how should we think about Windows 8 going forward? Thanks.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: I wouldn't think about kind of traditional milestones. I would say one of the things that Tami
talked about at CES last week was just how important it is for us to work on and with developers to create a really
vibrant developer ecosystem. And so one of the things we also talked about with the beta release was the Windows
Store, really making sure – we're going to have quite a few apps that are going to be up on the Windows Store at beta.
Obviously one of the things she and Steve both talked about last week is that any Windows 7 PC could run Windows 8,
but obviously there will be some new and interesting form factors that are going to come out here as we get further on
down the road. So I don't know that I would think about it except as, we said earlier, we're on track, we feel really good
about where we are on the product, and this next super important milestone is the beta release and having a really great,
great developer ecosystem to kind of surround that. So great question.
<Q - Robert Breza>: Thank you.
