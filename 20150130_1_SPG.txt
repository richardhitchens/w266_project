David E. Simon
Good morning. We had strong results to wrap up an exceptional 2014. We opened Premium Outlets Montreal. Started
construction on two new Premium Outlets in strong and growing markets of Tampa and Tucson. We announced our
first new full-priced development project in the last several years with the Shops at Clearfork in Fort Worth, Texas,
anchored by Neiman Marcus. And most importantly, we continued to produce strong operating and financial
performance.
Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.47 per share. On a comparable basis, excluding the operating
results from WPG properties in the prior-year period, our FFO per diluted share increased 12.3% for the quarter or
$0.27 year-over-year. As a reminder, our FFO per diluted share is calculated strictly in accordance with the NAREIT
White Paper. And we encourage the industry to acknowledge the importance of using this long-standing measure
without modification.
Our fourth quarter FFO per diluted share was impacted by approximately $0.04 from our share of Klépierre's costs
related to both their bond tender offer and their tender offer for Corio, as well as unfavorable effects of foreign
currency devaluations. For the year, on a comparable basis, excluding the operating results from the WPG properties,
the spin-off transactions, and the debt extinguishment charge, FFO per diluted share increased 13.9%. After taking into
account the spin-off and debt charge, we beat our initial guidance of 2014 that we provided to you by an impressive
$0.40.
We continued to record strong key operating metrics and cash flow. Occupancy increased across the portfolio, and our
Malls and Premium Outlets combined occupancy ended at the year at record 97.1%.
Leasing activity is healthy. The Malls and Premium Outlets recorded releasing spreads of $9.59 per square foot, an
increase of 16.6%. Comp NOI increased 4% in the fourth quarter 2014 compared to an increase of 6.1% in the fourth
quarter of 2013; and an increase in total of 5.1%. So, we had an increase of 4% over an increase of 6.1% last year. And
as a reminder, approximately 95% of our domestic property NOI is included in our comp NOI calc.
Total sales in our portfolio increased 2.3% in the fourth third quarter compared to last year even with major
redevelopment occurring at several of our premiere properties. As I said, we opened Montreal October 30th, it's a great
excitement. We commenced construction in Tampa and Tucson, and the construction in New Jersey with Gloucester
Premium, Philadelphia Premium Outlets, continues to move forward. All of those will open in 2015. We are slated to
begin construction of four new domestic Premium Outlets in 2015 which include Columbus, Ohio; Clarksburg,
Maryland; Norfolk, Virginia; and Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Now, during the quarter, even with all that new development, we completed several redevelopments including the
addition of Nordstrom and small shop expansions at St. Johns Town Center, the relocation of Bloomingdale's at
Stanford Shopping Center, as well as the expansions at Premium Outlets in Mexico City and Toki Premium Outlets in
Japan. We started a construction in King of Prussia. We are underway with the expansion to connect the plaza and the
court that will add approximately 150,000 square feet to Pennsylvania's top retail destination, and it's expected to be

completed in August of 2016, and at Phipps Plaza, we are adding an AC Hotel by Marriott, a luxury residence; both
expected to be completed in 2016 as well.
Construction continues on major redevelopment expansion projects at some of our most productive mall properties,
including Roosevelt Field, Houston Galleria, Stanford, and our premium outlets in Woodbury Common, Las Vegas
North, Livermore San Francisco and Chicago. These major redevelopments are to be completed in late 2015 and 2016.
Redevelopment and expansion projects are ongoing that is under construction across all three of our all platforms in the
U.S. and Asia and have a total committed spend of $2.1 billion. So again, that's under construction. Acquisitions, we
closed on Jersey Gardens and University Park Village for $1.09 billion on January 15 and are excited to include these
great properties in portfolio. And both Jersey Gardens and UPV has sales per square foot of $850 per foot.
Let me turn to Klépierre. We are pleased with our investment in Klépierre. Our net equity investment is up $850
million even with the weaker euro. And as the largest shareholder, we are excited for them as 94% of our Corio shares
were tendered in support of Klépierre's acquisition. And once the merger is completed expected by the end of the first
quarter, the integration of the two companies will begin.
Now, let's talk about our balance sheet. We ended 2014 with a debt-to-market capitalization ratio of 29%, industry
leading. Our interest coverage was 3.8 times, industry leading. Net-to-EBITDA of 5.4 times, industry leading. Our
long-term issuer rating of A and A2 continues to be industry leading. So let's not lose sight of this significant
differentiating and positive attribute of our balance sheet as compared to our peer group.
A few of the capital market activities; by the way, this replaces Rick's listing of tenants. We retired $2.9 billion of
senior notes at an average coupon. They were at 5.76%. We issued $2.5 billion of new notes with a weighted average
term of 12 years and a weighted average coupon of 3.32%.
We amended and extended our $4 billion revolver until 2019. We closed 16 new mortgages with a weighted average
interest rate and term of 3.29% in 8.4 years, and we became the first U.S. REIT to establish a global commercial paper
program issuing $400 million of CP at a weighted average interest rate of 18 basis points.
So let's turn to the dividend. We announced our dividend this quarter of $1.40 per share, an increase year-over-year of
12%. We will pay at least $5.60 in dividends of 2015, which is an increase of 8.7% compared to last year in totality.
And if we include WP's dividend, we've more than doubled our dividend since the Great Recession.
Now, let's turn to guidance. Our guidance of FFO is $9.60 to $9.70 per share. This range represents 8% to 9% growth
compared to our reported FFO per share at $8.90 for 2014. Our range is based on comparable NOI growth of
approximately 4% for our malls, premium outlets and mills platforms. It also assumes no additional acquisition or
disposition activity beyond what we just completed with Jersey Gardens and UPV. And it also includes the unfavorable
impact of recent currency devaluations which should approximate $0.10 compared to the currency levels that existed in
2014.
So let's conclude. We produced another exceptional year with our results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2014
beating guidance for an unprecedented 10-plus years in a row. We achieved record levels in occupancy, FFO per share
and dividends despite the loss of approximately $1 per share of FFO from WP and the debt extinguishment charge. And
we continue to improve our portfolio and consumer and customer services for the benefit of stakeholders and we're
very excited about 2015.
We're ready for any questions.

<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Hey, David. Good morning. I guess, since I'm first, you know what's coming. I guess, I get
the honor of asking you what the heck is going on with Macerich?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I thought we were going to talk about your headline that said mixed bag. So what was
mixed bag, our record revenue growth, our record comp NOI growth, our record balance sheet, our record occupancy,
our record rental rate? I wanted to talk about your headline first. Can we do that?
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: We can all read the note, but the guidance coming in below the Street is an offset to beating
for the quarter. One would call that perhaps a mixed bag, but we can talk about it...
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think on the guidance, look, first of all, those are your numbers, not ours. And
obviously, that's predominantly driven by the currency devaluation that's occurring both with respect to the yen and the
euro. The good news is even with that because of our – at least our hedge in Europe, we're up $850 million in
Klépierre.
So, yes, we're going to have some volatility. It's about 1% of our – where the rates are today versus where they are, it's
about 1% of our earnings, which to me is somewhat immaterial. So I do think we need to put that in perspective. I'm
not sure that should've generated your headline, but you certainly understand our position, I understand yours.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Appreciate that. So back to the elephant in the room.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. What's your question?
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: A little California-based mall company called Macerich. What can you tell us about what's
currently going on, what was going through your head a couple of months ago when you put out the announcement that
you did? What can you say about it?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, as much as we – I'm sure you'd love to talk about – we disclosed our stake of – it
was 4.1% and got diluted down to 3.6% in Macerich. We still hold that position. And at this point, it's really not
appropriate for me to add anything other than the fact that we still own it. And there's not a lot more I can say. Actually,
let me take away the clarifying statement. There's nothing more I can add to that.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: You may not want to answer this, but I'll ask it anyway. If there were nothing going on, one
might assume you'd be happy to tell us that you own a position in another company, that you thought the stock was
undervalued at the time, but if you can't comment on it, it would suggest that there's something going on other than
that.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, we don't – we never comment on M&A activity. And we still own the stake. And
as you know, we're significantly in the money on the stake. There's no – there's been no P&L impact on our stake as I
know some people have asked Tom that question. And it is what it is. There's nothing really I can add other than that.
And I'm sorry I can't, but there's nothing more than I can add to that.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: All right. I and my mixed bag will get back in the queue. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: It's all right. Listen, it's a two-way street. You give it to me, we're going to give it back a little
bit anyway. That's what you like about us.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Yeah. It's Michael Bilerman with Christy. David, let me just try just a different angle.
When you made the stake, you said you may seek a waiver and you put that out publicly. So, at least, can you comment
on whether you've made the ask for the waiver and if there's been a response, and if you haven't made the ask, why
haven't you?

And then the second part is just the intent of taking the stake. And was it solely for the purpose of a passive investment,
just to – you thought you have a lot of cash hanging around, so it's something that you think you can't buy assets in the
private market so buy something that you know really well that you think is trading at a discount, make money, and go
home, or was it made for the purpose of moving forward with a non-passive agenda?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I can't – Ross asked the question. I can't add to that other than we have managed to find
investments as evidenced by the – little over $1 billion that we just spent in January 15 to buy two really good assets
with really good growth potential that we think this year will yield terrific results.
I'm still of an old-fashioned real estate guy. I like current yield going in. And the current yield going in is very
attractive with once Rick and the Mills team, certainly with Jersey Gardens works their magic, I think we got a lot of
upside. And not to say that I think Michael Glimcher did a great job with that asset.
But there's nothing, nothing I can add other than what I said to Ross just earlier, Michael. And I'm sorry, but as you
know it's just inappropriate for me to comment further.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: Hey. It's Christy McElroy here with Michael. Just following up on the currency and the
impact to 2015, you mentioned a $0.10 impact embedded in your guidance. How are you thinking about hedging that
exposure potentially? Would you expect to take on more debt to provide a natural hedge or maybe put in place any
other foreign currency hedges? Just want to get a sense for how that's rolling through the numbers.
And then just related to that, I'm wondering if you've seen any impact at all from the stronger dollar in terms of a
change in traffic or sales at any of your centers that have a higher international tourism component to the customer
base?
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. Happy to answer those. So let's just talk about the net. We are pretty well hedged on the
Klépierre initial stake. So we are not as hedged with our McArthurGlen investment. The problem, as you know, to get
the perfect hedge and with rates as low as they are in the euro, you'll never going to make up that. But I would say,
generally, we're reasonably hedged in the euro in kind of the 80% 90% range.
But since rates with debt – but rates are so low there, the math is such that it's still going to have an impact on us. So
the good news that I see at least is that the business there is not necessarily reflecting the devaluation. So I think the
consumer there is still shopping and doing that. And so I think it's kind of a more of a temporary thing, but it's going to
impact us for next year. And it is what it is.
The same thing with the yen in a sense that from a book value point of view, we're basically completely hedged. But
again, the yen's rates are so low, there's just no way to do it. Now, we've locked in some forwards on the dividend
yields – I'm sorry, on the dividends that we both get from Klépierre and from Japan. But as you know, we
equity-account for both. So that doesn't impact – that's just cash flow, which is important to be hedged on cash flow.
Don't get me wrong. But still, at the same time, it does – as we take our share of the equity income on those businesses,
we're going to have exposure. And it is what it is.
So I hope – I assume that answered your question on that front. I mean, from an investment point of view, book value
we're essentially hedged, but it's not going to mean a lot. We're still going to have some volatility, not from a cash flow
point of view but from an earnings point of view. That answer your question on that front?
<Q - Christy McElroy>: Yes, it does. Thanks, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: Now, on the sales, look, I think it's very interesting, because there's some commentary around
it. We did see a little bit of flattening out in the Florida area, kind of first as one initial – as you know, in terms of
devaluation, Latin American customer happened quicker than, say, the euro devaluation. We don't have any earnings
impact from that. That just might have impact sales.
Christy, as you know, we are undergoing huge transformational redevelopment in King of Prussia, the field, even the
former shops, we're changing a lot of the tenant mix, changing the transition hall from phase 1 to the phase 3 that's at
on the strip, as well as we had this unusual anomaly that we have one retailer that's in a state that doesn't pay sales tax.

They had an extraordinary amount of sales in 2013 that didn't repeat because of their own constraints that they pose for
2014 that also may have flattened sales in terms of how you're thinking about it.
But I would generally say, you put all those things together, our portfolio does, what, $620 a foot, still industry-leading
given size and scale. We're adding to the mix. We're doing a lot of great of stuff. So you know how generally I feel
about retail sales, okay? And you have seen even with flat retail sales generally over the last two or three years, you've
seen our comp NOI increases. You know my argument on that. But at least, I hope that gives you some color as to how
you might think about our number compared to others out there. But the portfolio has never been stronger or better.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: I appreciate the color. Thanks, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Well, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on the trend of the outlet sales.
<A - David E. Simon>: They actually were slightly better than malls, because the malls had those kind of two or three
things, Craig, that I just discussed. And our premium outlets on from a – both from a cap point of view had better
results than the mall business.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Okay. Great. And then how far is the ground-up development Shops at Clearfork from the
University Park Village that you just acquired?
<A - David E. Simon>: How far along is it?
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Well, how far are they from each other?
<A - David E. Simon>: Three miles or so. Three miles, Rick? Roughly three miles.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah, three miles.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. But it's different trade areas, but I'd say three miles, because there's a river that runs
through. It's one of those things.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Okay. And then is there any further things that you could do with Cassco just given the size of
their project beyond Shops at Clearfork?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Hi, Craig. It's Rick. Right now, we are obviously focused on the first phase. There are a
number of elements to that phase. They do have some additional land. And depending on how this goes, we'd obviously
be open to try and do some additional development. But right now, the first phase has our attention.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Great. And then finally just – maybe this is for Rick. Have you seen what you think might be a
change in pace in either store openings or store closings in the mall space for 2015?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, basically, obviously, we had the announcements that everyone has seen. So there is a
little more pressure on some closings, but conversely we're at record occupancy. We've just come out of our meetings
in December and we're – got a lot of momentum in the business, because there are a lot of people that are looking for
space and we certainly anticipate we're going to be able to hold our market share.
And there's always going to be the churning that we've had historically, but we're going to basically be able to keep
things pretty much where they are now in terms of occupancy. And everybody we replaced is going to be replaced by
someone that was more creditworthy and more productive on a sales per foot basis.

<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. But, Craig, we clearly have, at this point in time, compared to last year more retailers in
the bankruptcy. So, as you know, we're not sure how many stores we're going to get back. Some have already
announced, so it's really closing stores, some, in fact, are even liquidating. So we are – I mean, it doesn't change the
fundamentals of our business. But 2015 is going to be a lot of work in releasing those retailers, because depending on
when we get it and how much time we have to lease it up, there could be a little gap there.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with MLV. Please proceed.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Your same-store numbers have been bouncing sort of in the 4% to 6% range over the past
three years, and your lease spreads kind of in the 15% to 20% range. I mean, your guidance for same-store was 4%.
How should I think about that in the context of the past few years, where the average is sort of above that?
And then kind of related to that, where are you at in terms of occupancy? Is that what you think of as maybe
approaching kind of a frictional ceiling and whether that could constrain your same-store growth at all?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think – look, we've always tried to be realistic and conservative. I forget, Steve, what
we announced last year what the comp NOI was, but 4%...
<A - Steven K. Broadwater>: 4%.
<A - David E. Simon>: So we were fortunate to outperform that. So, Paul, we are taking into account – we do have
more bankruptcies this year. So I think it's appropriate for us to be conservative, because, as you know, we don't control
– we don't get the space back and then we can have downtime and so on. So if there's a conservative element to it, I'd
say it's a little bit because of the – just the bankruptcies that we're having to deal with in 2015 versus 2014.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay. Thanks. And then just maybe as we think about investments, you've got $3 billion in
developments, redevelopments at what you target as a 9% yield. On acquisitions, the cap rates for today are kind of half
that for decent properties. And I mean, how do you think about that spread both in terms of kind of evaluating
acquisitions, what makes an acquisition whether it's a single asset or a portfolio, or an M&A deal at a much lower yield
than you're getting on your redevelopments? I mean, what makes it compelling from your perspective?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I mean, there's nobody been more active in new development and redevelopment
than we have been, but it's not like, oh, let's just do a redevelopment. There is a lot that's required to get there. And then
new development, we want to build stuff that is at the end of the day going to fit in the – certainly in the top half of our
portfolio, over the long run. So that's – we have a hell of a portfolio, so that's hard to achieve. And we're going
reasonably quick when we get to new development and redevelopment. And so at the same time, we are not going to
buy anything or anybody unless we feel like we can add significant value to it.
Now, let's take a couple of recent examples. It's not bad for my net investment in Klépierre to be up 4x, okay? Not bad.
And we felt like we could add value to that business, and thankfully we have. The same thing on the going-in yield
with the two deals we bought for Glimcher is around five, and we think they are A assets, A+ assets. And obviously,
we think we'll be able to grow those. So that's a great opportunity. And look at – the one thing that I think the market
has lost sight of is just everybody's balance sheet again. It's like, forget about it.
Our balance sheet is 5.4 EBITDA multiple. It's 3.8% interest coverage despite having – I still look at those 10.75%
quarters that I got outstanding till 2019, right, Andy, 2019?

<A - Andrew A. Juster>: Right.
<A - David E. Simon>: We still have room depending on where rates are to roll that down and even to make a stronger
coverage ratio in balance sheet. So, I mean, we've always looked at everything. We'll look at everything. We're not
going to chase deals. And when it comes to acquisitions, unless we feel like we can add value to that property with
either our infrastructure or leasing know-how, development know-how, we just don't do it.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Does your leverage in your balance sheet advantages? I mean, do you think of that as an
important lever to pull when you're looking at bigger deals capitalizing on that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, sure. I mean, look, it led to – let's just go back to 2009. I mean, the fact of the matter is,
in the retail real estate sector, there's nobody because they were so levered, and we did some tough financings including
equity. But there's nobody in our sector other than maybe, say, Taubman that has outgrown whatever dilution. And not
only have we outgrown it, we've just blew it away.
Everybody else is still trying to get back to their record FFO per share that they had in 2006, 2007 and their dividend.
We're blown through those dramatically. And what that balance sheet that we had, even though we panicked like a few
others, allowed us to be conservative yet signaled the market that we're alive and well, blow through the growth that we
had. We had a year or two of flatness or step-back, but we're able to use that to find good investments that have fueled
our growth.
So I would hope even in capital-rich times, we're able to do that as well. But it's – we're pretty conservative. We don't
want to blow the balance sheet. As you know, my background in the real estate world, besides being an M&A banker,
which was outside the real estate and in short in all sorts of industries, was directly involved in restructuring real estate
workouts. And it ain't no fun and we are never going to get there. So we have a great asset. We've worked hard to
achieve it and it's a great thing, but you can't take it for granted.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - George Auerbach>: Thank you. Just a follow-up on Christy's question. David, have you quantified the impact of
redevelopment at King of Prussia fields? And I forgot the other asset you mentioned. But just sort of what that's done to
the overall sales growth, trying to think about your portfolio on a more normalized level adjusting out some of the
noise.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Look, yeah, I'm not making excuses and you know how we've all had this discussion
about our tenant sales and how I think about it. But if you take these anomalies, I'd say, generally, we'd be around
4%-ish. But again, our number is our number, and you know how management feels about it. I appreciate you may
have a different point of view. We have nothing to hide or – we had a few anomalies. We're not making excuses. We'll
accept being dinged on it, if you want, but there's a lot of transforming. We do have exposure to certain markets. We're
in Brazil. It takes a little breather. And we had this strange thing in a state.
I mean, I'm giving you enough, but we tend not to talk about specific retailers. But you could figure it out with a state
that doesn't have sales tax. And it is what it is. Same time, we do FFO pursuant to the white paper. The number is the
number. We pointed out the $0.04 only because we thought maybe the market didn't know that we had to pick up our
share of Klépierre's transaction costs associated with both tenders, as well as the currency dropped pretty precipitously
quarter-over-quarter of last year. So we thought it was important to do it, but the number is the number.

<Q - George Auerbach>: No. I was asking because in the Macerich Analyst Day, they mentioned that I think there
were three big redevelopments they had that lowered their same-store growth on the whole portfolio by 100 basis
points. So I know one or two assets can really move the number. That's why I was asking.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. No, no. It's a legitimate question. I was talking more about tenant sales. On our comp
NOI, they're all in our number. So all of those that I've talked about are in it even though we're taking some immediate
step-backs as we redevelop it. So those really aren't affecting our comp NOI, at least those assets that I talked to you
about.
<Q - George Auerbach>: Great. And I guess just the last one from me. You and the board have increased the dividend
pretty meaningfully over the last couple of quarters at a pace above FFO growth. I guess, as redevelopment spend kind
of maybe tapers off into 2015 and 2016, should we anticipate that the dividend growth will continue to outpace FFO or
AFFO growth for the foreseeable future?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Look, our taxable income has got a lot of variability. As you know, we paid out 100%
of our taxable income last year. I did underline – I hope you saw that at least $560 million, I will underline that, that's at
least $560 million or so. The answer is our taxable income is growing significantly as our earnings are. And so it's very
conceivable that that could be an outcome of that.

<A - David E. Simon>: Let me do clarify that. I mean, we – let me just clarify that. They do pay us a dividend. So we
do have the dividend income in our numbers. Okay?
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: But obviously, it's – the movement up and down goes in the comprehensive income or loss. In
this case, it's income, because it's up. But that's not an FFO number. So – and the only thing in our FFO guidance is
their dividend income, okay, Alex?
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Yeah. That's what I – I just want to make sure that that's the way you were accounting
for it. The next thing, David, is, right after the world woke up to lower oil, after Thanksgiving, you announced two
projects down in oil country. So just sort of curious what you guys have – obviously, tenant demand was unaffected by
it. So should we just take away from this that the retailers are unfazed by the drop in oil and they just see continued
strong sales down in those markets or is your view that maybe some of the tenants who initially indicated that they
would be interested in both of these projects may start to have second thoughts?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, Houston Galleria has been under construction for quite some time, well over a year so,
but Texas itself is so diversified than it used to be 20-plus years ago. 20-plus years ago it was oil and basically real
estate. Today, it's tech. Houston is very diversified. Obviously, oil and gas is important, but it's got the medical focus,
all the universities, and Dallas, Fort Worth, that's less and less oil and gas completely. That's more – so the answer is
we don't think it'll have any impact.
Fort Worth, we're excited about, because Neiman Marcus is obviously huge in that area. They're relocating from one
mall to this to be their flagship store in Fort Worth, and we think the demand for that is great. No issues in Houston
Galleria, which is one of the top five centers in the country. And so, when you put it all together, it's really – long run,
there's no issue at all.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And I guess same applies to Tulsa?
<A - David E. Simon>: True. Yeah.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then final question is, as you guys start to do more of these mixed-use or
added density to some of the projects, some of your malls, how do you underwrite the projects as – there's a return
from, obviously, adding apartments or adding hotels, and then there's hopefully the additional return of just added
traffic to the mall that allows you to drive higher NOI and cash flows. So, if we think about the returns as you guys
pencil out densifying some of the sites, how should we think about the incremental return from just boosting NOI
versus just adding an additional use to a center?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Hi. This is Rick. Basically, when we add an apartment or a hotel, those stand on their own.
It's a separate analysis. If there is some incremental benefit, great. But, we do not theoretically create any kind of
incremental return based on adding more mass or densifying an asset.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. So, Rick, is there like an incremental that we can expect or you guys expect or
you don't underwrite that any way, shape or form?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We do not underwrite that.
<A - David E. Simon>: None.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: Zero. Don't give my guys any ideas.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: To sandbag the numbers, never would cross our minds.
<A - David E. Simon>: No, don't give – no, no, no, don't give – my development guys, when they come in and they
want a project approved, don't assume, they'll come in and say, it's going to do this to the mall, we should approve it.
Forget it, it doesn't happen that way.

<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you?
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Good. Have you all noticed any change within the last three months in your conversations

<A - David E. Simon>: No.
<Q - Carol L. Kemple>: Okay. And then, are there any new concepts that are coming into your malls or outlet centers
that you're excited about that you can share?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, here we go again. All right. So, Rick – this is Rick's – he loves this part, so, Rick, let her
go. Okay? Here we go. Here's the list.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Unleashing the fury. In the outlet sector, every – literally, every month, we're finding more
and more retailers that understand that this is a very valuable and profitable distribution channel. And so, just Alice +
Olivia, Citizen Watch, Jonathan Adler, Helzberg, literally, we could go on, but the answer is there's a great deal of new
entrants into the outlet sector.
Into the mall sector, we're doing stuff with ATHLETA, David's Tea. We're doing – NYX is the new concept from
L'Oréal. UNIQLO is very actively looking. And interestingly, it's lost in the sauce, but L Brands is dramatically
growing PINK and Victoria's Secret. So, there's a lot of very good dynamic demand for our properties.

Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Yes. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: I would like to, kind of, go back to the 2015 guidance, and again, the point of your
guidance relative to where consensus is. It sounds, based on your comments, is about 1% of earnings which is about
$0.09 to $0.10 that's FX-related. But, I'm wondering what else is in guidance that maybe we're not – maybe the Street is
not fully appreciating, which is why our numbers seem a little bit high. Is it again some of the working through of some
of the retail bankruptcies that have happened that needs to...
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. I think – I don't know what your comp NOI is. And I also think a lot of it has to do in,
maybe, how you're factoring in our development spend, because most of 2015 and a lot of 2016 is back-end weighted.
So, you've got – we've got our share around [ph] 2.1. So, I mean, that would really be the – that would be our only
other guess. But, I'm sure Tom can walk you through how you do it. But, maybe you have a little bit higher comp NOI.
I mentioned we are conservative on that number, because we are looking at a little bit higher bankruptcies than we

looked at last year. We, obviously, always try to do better, but our development spend tends to be back-end weighted.
So, depending on how you factor that in, and then obviously, the currency delta from the yen and the euro is around
$0.10 from 2014 to 2015. So, you add it up, and it is what it is.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Got it. Could you just talk about, in 2015 guidance what average occupancies baked into
those numbers?
<A - David E. Simon>: Pretty consistent with what 2015 – or 2014 showed.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Great. Okay. That's helpful. And then, in the supplemental when we just take a look at the
development page, the outlet – the yields on the outlet business, on the outlet development is up to 11% versus 9%
previously. Is that a mix change?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Montreal was a little lower yield, and Tampa is much higher. Tampa, we think, will be a
great outlet center, one of the – at the end of the day, one of the leading outlet centers in the country. And it absolutely
has that mix change.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Great. And then, lastly, with Jersey Gardens, just curious what your thoughts are in regards
to what NOI growth could look like once the rents start to reset for a lot of the tenants?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: What we have – this is Rick. We have already set the baseline overall on our NOI growth.
The Jersey Gardens should be, in excess of that, once we start doing what we think can be done there, and as David
said, they did a great job before, and we're just now taking it to the next level and allocating space and bringing in
incremental more productive tenants that's going to drive rent and sales.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: That's very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. No worries.

Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Hey, everyone. Just, maybe thinking about the comp NOI guidance slightly differently, just as
we think about the 4% versus the 5.1% and also in light of the comments about higher levels of bankruptcies, I guess,
what would – and how much of the higher level of bankruptcy is sort of the difference between the 5.1% and the 4%?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look again, we're factoring that in. And like I said, last year, we had – our business has
certain level of volatility to it. Not a lot, because we don't have to go sell all our product at the start of every year like a
lot others companies. So, because we have mostly contractual rents, the big variability is unanticipated bankruptcy, the
timing of which that occurs when we get it, and then how long it takes us to lease it up. So, and I said last year, Steve
Broadwater, we projected – what was our NOI projection?
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: 4%.
<A - David E. Simon>: 4%. We got 5.1%. So, again, we're factoring that in; we'll see. Obviously, we've got variability
to some extent, marginally on expenses, and we have certain variability on overage rent that we have a long history of,
kind of, modeling that but it does create some variability.
We also are – we also have a lot of redevelopment work. We're not necessarily taken out of comp. The big projects like
Roosevelt Field and King of Prussia and those – we're moving a lot of tenants around and the form shops. We've got
Copley. I think, Copley, if I remember from our budget sessions, is going down $2 million this year; really pissed me
off in our budget meetings, because we're re-tenanting into a better group. But, that's the nature. You got to re-tenant,
you've got to improve the mix. When you're bringing in a better tenant, they have a longer build-out; all of that takes
time. So, we hope to do better. It's not too shabby. We move on.

Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you doing?
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: So, a few questions for you. First, David, on Klépierre. I was curious if you could help
give us a broad sense of the magnitude of the upside you think you might have there, perhaps in terms of percentage of
G&A expense, portfolio upgrading, closing and evaluation gap with Unibail, just curious for your thoughts there.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it's better that the management team here does that. But, I will say, generally, just from
my perspective, we're – they've done a really good job over the last couple years with our strategic help to continue to
move in the right direction, reduce the smaller assets, focus more on the bigger ones, upgrade the marketing, tenant
mix, et cetera.
I think Corio has got a better portfolio than a lot of people think. The integration there is a little more complicated than
it is, say, in the U.S. when it comes to integration, because of the rules out there. I won't bore you with all of the
technicalities about it. But, I think, net-net, over a period of time, there's great upside in running a better, more efficient
company with – after the Corio merger is completed, and I would expect that gap would continue to narrow, which it
has dramatically, but will continue to narrow.
And like I said, I mean, I'm not – the most important thing in all of this, this is great, but are you making money? Our
net investment is up $850 million in two years – two-and-a-half years, maybe it's three years now. Okay. So, I'm sorry,
it's three years now. So – and I still think they've got upside to move forward.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: I appreciate that. And following up on, I guess, some of the earlier stronger dollar
questions, clearly makes your purchasing power better overseas. Wondering if that perhaps might make you more
perhaps aggressively inclined on expanding your international portfolio?
<A - David E. Simon>: We only want to do it if we think we can make money. So, I have no desire to expand
international unless we think it's a profit opportunity for us.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Fair enough. And then last one. Wondering how much of your energy costs are variable.
I'm just trying to get a sense of if there could be a positive impact to margins.
<A - David E. Simon>: Not really, because we tend to charge that to the tenants. And so, we just pass on that savings
to them. To some extent, the share that we pay for ourselves will have an added benefit, but it's not overly material.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thank you. So, just turning to your expenses. If I look at – there's a trend in operating expenses as
a percent of your revenue. It's been turning down for a very long time, and which has helped, obviously, your expense
recoveries and whatnot. And just curious if – is this a trend? I mean, it's hard to imagine [ph] any point (59:47) more
favorable towards [indiscernible] (01:00:09) run rate. But, given like rising expenses and rising taxes, do we – what do
you think this settles out, and how does that impact your expense recoveries going forward? And maybe, should we
expect some kind of reversion to the mean at one point?
<A - David E. Simon>: No. I think we're always trying to improve our operating margins. So, every once in a while
there'll be modest changes from year to year. Obviously, in 2009 recession, we took a very tough view of that. Now,
we're still getting the comp NOI growth even though we're less focused on that, like, we were in 2009. I shouldn't say
less focused, but we're not as – we're not trying to ring every nickel out of it. We also have marketing expenses,
customer relations, consumer relations expenses that we're focused on doing. So, there'll be year-to-year variability to
it, but we're still trying to improve it.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: So, if I – maybe I can ask it in a different way. For 2014, you ended with about 32%, 33%
operating expenses as percent of rents. In your guidance, are you implicitly modeling in that stays flat, or improves, or
reverse back?
<A - David E. Simon>: Relatively the same.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: Relatively flat.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: And just last question, when you – how do you compare the quality of – I know there's different
regions, but Klépierre with Corio versus a Macerich, how would you describe the quality between those two portfolios?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, that's a good one. I mean, I would say it's hard to necessarily compare one to the next. In
Europe, the supply and demand is reasonably favorable. But, on the other hand, the U.S. is really caught up on that
front, because there's been, as we all know, no new really full price development for a number of years.
So, the occupancy costs are a little higher in Europe than they are – for a retailer than they are in the U.S. But, I don't
know. I'd have to give that a little bit more thought. I don't necessarily – I look at it more in that specific market as
opposed to one country to another country. That's a little tougher comparison to do, but let me give it some thought.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Yeah. I mean, so, the reason I asked that is, when you have your choices of capital, where to
deploy capital and you have Macerich trading at 4.5%. And I know if you take it further despite some operating
margin, you can pull out of it, if you take down the whole little portfolio, and when I compare it to maybe a Klépierre
or Corio on quality, and with that portfolio trading at maybe a 5% cap rate – and this is just rough math, by the way –
or higher, how do you make that relative comparison in terms of where to deploy that capital?
<A - David E. Simon>: I mean, the most important thing is you got a risk adjusting, and you don't – in the U.S., you
don't have currency risk. So, as you can see, no one's really happy about our currency risk today. So, I mean, I'm not
overly worried about it. But, it is – we do have a little bit of risk. The U.S. is a safer – we should get a higher return
when we go outside of our natural borders. It is slightly harder to underwrite. It is a little more complex. There are
more rules and regulations to do what you want. And we – even though we've had a profound impact on Klépierre, we
know U.S. investing better than we do – we know outside U.S. investing. So you certainly would want a higher return
anywhere outside the U.S. for those and other reasons. So, it gets kind – in your question, you got to factor that into it.
Now, the rates there, I mean, the rates there really, really attractive. So, if you can take into account the higher risk
adjusted rate of return, you may have better investment opportunity. But, at this point, we don't look at a mutually
exclusive, the U.S. or Europe or Asia. We like to look at each individual idea or investment on its own and then
stress-test it with our own corporate opportunities and our own internal opportunities, and see what it means for a
balance sheet and our management bandwidth.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Hi. Just a quick one. What sort of yield are you looking at for the Clearfork development?
And is there any update on – any thoughts on plans for the Oyster Bay site?
<A - David E. Simon>: Clearfork will be – it's not yet – it hasn't started construction, but we'll outline that once we put
it into service. So, it's not in our 8-K yet, because we haven't actually started construction. We're getting – it's going to
happen, but we're finalizing our cost numbers and the leasing plan and all that, and should start in the next two months
or so. So, there's some grading going on in the site now. So, we'll let you know on that. But, it will be attractive,
value-enhancing return.
And your – Oyster Bay, I think, will be a very active year. We have an unbelievable plan and vision of what we want to
do with the properties. We're working now with the various – the town and the various agencies about going through
the approval process. I'm sure you'll see more of that this year as it comes out, but we've actually developed the plan, a
very unique lifestyle, mixed use center that we think will have great appeal to us financially as well as all of the
community groups there.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Linda Y. Tsai>: Hi. How would you characterize holiday sales overall? Does the outcome say much to about the
underlying strength of the economy?
And then, also in the context of recent store closure announcements, I realize a lot of these retailers were already
struggling. But, how much of an impact did the holiday season have or were they likely to close anyway in your view?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think on the latter question, the arc of the retailers that have already announced
bankruptcy or closing was really beyond a given quarter and a given result in the holiday, they have been struggling for
an extended period of time.
In terms of the holiday sales, in some places they were stronger. Some of the stronger retailers reported better sales, but
there were a larger percentage that were weaker. But, overall, is the economy is stronger? It is. Is the lower oil and gas
prices putting some incremental disposable money in the consumers' pocket? It is. Confidence is up. So, overall, the
macro factors are encouraging.
<Q - Linda Y. Tsai>: Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Hi. I guess, good afternoon now. This is getting a little long, so I'll try to be quick. If you
could just comment on your capacity and interest in issuing more euro-denominated debt, giving Bund is at 0.3%?

<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Good question. I think the answer is, we're going to seriously consider it. Right, Andy?
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: Yes, absolutely. We always look at both currencies. Right now, we could issue 10-year euro
debt at under 1.5%, significantly under. So, it's something we'll look at. And the basis play has become a lot more
favorable in the last couple of months.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then also, just acknowledging that you've already spun-off your
lower tier malls within the portfolio you have now, could you just describe any differences between tenant productivity
in your top tier versus lower tier centers, and also tenant interest?
<A - David E. Simon>: Within our – the existing SPG portfolio after spin?
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: That's correct.
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: I would say not dramatically different in terms of tenant demand. I mean, sure, the top 20
centers always are going to have somewhat more demand than the next 20. But, generally, nothing, no great variation
there.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I wanted to just make sure I understood, the redevelopment
pipeline you guys have right now is pretty much completed in 2015 and 2016. But, then, as you look forward, what
kind of annual spend and redevelopment do you think you'll have as you go out to 2017, 2018, et cetera?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, Rich, the 2.1 is directly from our 8-K. And that is only projects that are actually started
and then corporately approved through our approval process. So, for instance, it doesn't include Clearfork yet, it doesn't
include Oyster Bay, it doesn't include Copley, it doesn't include a whole host of other deals. So, the number that we've,
kind of said generally was around $1 billion a year for the foreseeable future. And I still – Rich, would generally say
that's probably a pretty good number.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay. Good. So, you feel comfortable with that. That's great.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Thank you. And then, I also wanted to ask, usually, early in the year, maybe by the middle
of the year you've pretty much covered a lot of the leasing, Rick, that is going to happen for the year. So, 2015 by
middle of the year would pretty much be handled. And I'm curious with occupancy as high as it is, is that moving up? I
mean, are you done with more leasing at this point in the year for 2015 than you might normally be?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We are ahead this year over last year. We're about 65% through our renewals in 2015. And
we've obviously made a major focus on getting as far out ahead of it as we can. So, we can be responsive. And because
our occupancy is higher, those tenants that are looking for space understand that if they don't commit, someone else is
going to get the space. So, that, obviously, is also encouraging people to accelerate their decision-making as well.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay. Good. Got you. So, normally, this time of year, you'd be maybe half-done, something
like that, or less?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay. All right. Good. Thank you, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott O'Donnell with MetLife. Please proceed.
<Q - Scott O'Donnell>: Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. And I've got a quick question. You guys have been a great steward
of the balance sheet for bondholders. I guess, I have to ask the question, why the commercial paper program – how
does that make sense from a strategic standpoint, and can you explain the strategy around exposing yourself to the
short-term money markets?
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: Well, Scott, we go back – it's Andy. We go back a long time. As you know, we've got a $70
billion equity market cap. It's less than 1% of our total market cap, and it helps us. One of the things we're looking at is
as we significantly want to roll down our debt cost, we have a huge opportunity over the next two years as our average
interest rate is about 5.65% on the $5 billion of debt that comes due. It allows us to look at potentially, one, prepaying
some of our secured debt where we can borrow at, what is it, 15 to 16 basis points, and there's absolutely no risk. It also
diversifies our investor base.
We've had significant strong investors. And there's really no risk, because just like in the olden days, as you know,
when we used to have the bank's debt on a competitive deadline, now we just replaced that with, as you know,
commercial paper. And the regulations in the market is far, far different than it was 5 years, 10 years ago. So, we had
no problem. We started in October, there were some volatile markets. We had absolutely no problem rolling over any
of our, if you would, euro paper or our USD paper. And it's, again, something in a small way that we're going to
continue to do, and to be proactive and opportunistic.
<Q - Scott O'Donnell>: So, I get that. So, you're doing it more from a transactional flexibility standpoint rather than a
strategic part of your capital structure? Because, I think we've talked over the years about this, you guys have long-term
assets and you tend to want to fund them long-term, right?
<A - Andrew A. Juster>: Yeah. Absolutely. And that's why we significantly increased our average weighted term as
we reduced the rate and that will continue to be the case.
<Q - Scott O'Donnell>: Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Okay. Any other questions, operator?
Operator
At this time, there are no further questions.
