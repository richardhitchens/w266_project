Hello, everyone, and welcome to GE's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Presenting first today is our Chairman and
CEO, Jeff Immelt; followed by our CFO, Jeff Bornstein.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our earnings release, presentation and supplemental have been
available since earlier today on our website www.GE.com/investor. Also, some of the statements we are making today
are forward-looking statements and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.
As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.
And now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Immelt.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, Matt.
GE executed well in a slow-growth and volatile environment. We see optimism in the United States and here orders
grew by 23%. In addition, Europe is strengthening and we see positive momentum. Meanwhile, the resource sector and
related markets continue to have headwind. As you know, we closed Alstom on November 1, 2015. As a result, the

fourth quarter of 2016 was the first quarter where Alstom was organic.
So I'll give you a few ways to look at the quarter. On a reported basis, orders were up 4% and revenue was flat. On an
organic basis, in other words including Alstom in November and December in the organic calculation, orders were up
2% and revenue was up 4%. We also show the calculation that excludes Alstom results from the organic calculation.
And segment operating profit grew by 6% in the quarter.
For the quarter, we had some pluses and minuses. Orders were strong, ahead of our expectations. Service growth was
very strong for both revenue and orders. Alstom synergies are ahead of plan. Some businesses had very strong years,
Aviation, Healthcare and renewables. On the negative side we failed to close a couple of big power deals in tough
markets and, in addition, restructuring exceeded gains for the year.
We were active in the portfolio in the fourth quarter. We announced the acquisition of LM renewables, strengthening
our wind supply chain. We further simplified GE announcing the disposition of our Water and Industrial Solutions
businesses. The GE Capital team has done a great job. We closed $86 billion of asset sales in 2016 and the move to
become an industrial finance company is very positive for GE. I'm particularly excited about the Baker Hughes merger,
which creates a strong full-stream competitor in the industry. This is a good move for investors and customers.
For the quarter, industrial and verticals earnings per share was $0.46, up 6%, and for the year, EPS was $1.49, up 14%.
Industrial EPS was up 12% for the year. We accomplished much of what we set out to do in 2016 and we have no
change for our framework in 2017. To recap the year, we finished in line with what we saw in December and within the
range for the year. Overall earnings per share was $1.49, in line with consensus, organic growth was 1% for the year,
and margins at 14% were at the low end of our range.
Corporate and Alstom were in line with expectations. Foreign exchange created $0.03 per share of headwind for the
year and we launched incremental restructuring, which gains failed to fully offset, and this created $0.02 of headwind
for the year. We met or exceeded most of our cash targets at $32.6 billion. Free cash flow plus dispositions were in line
with our December outlook. We had good cash execution across both industrial and capital and we returned more than
$30 billion to investors in buyback and dividends. We'll go through each of those in more detail.
In all, we were able to offset a challenging oil and gas market to deliver a year in line with expectations. Orders grew
by 2% organically in the quarter. Services were particularly strong with growth of 20% and we ended the quarter with
backlog of $321 billion, up $6 billion from 2015. We saw solid growth in Aviation, renewables, Healthcare and Oil &
Gas. Renewable orders grew by 32%. Healthcare had great international strength with China up 20%, Europe up 6%,
and Latin America up 16%. GE to GE orders were up 67%. Now overall equipment orders declined with tough comps
and transportation versus last year.
Oil & Gas orders grew by 2% organically, our first growth in two years. We see some firming in the market. This
includes a 42% orders growth in turbo machinery. Oil & Gas equipment grew by 10% with services down slightly. And
for the year, Oil & Gas digital orders grew by 30%. Service orders were strong across the company. Power was up 19%
and Transportation was up 101%. Renewables capitalized on multiple repowering opportunities to drive growth.
Aviation service grew by 8% with spares up 14%, and we closed our first big lighting-as-a-service deal with Walmart.
Orders in the U.S. grew by 23% and were down about 5% globally. We saw strength in the developed markets, which
grew by 8%, and we booked some big global orders included a $1.4 billion order with the Iraq Ministry of Energy for
gas turbines. We're gaining share with LEAP in the narrow body segment. GE Capital facilitated $5 billion of industrial
orders in the quarter. Orders pricing was down slightly with sustained pressure in oil and gas. In addition, renewables
were impacted by U.S. pricing dynamics. This was in line with our expectations.
Predix and software orders, in other words excluding AGPs, grew by 36% in the quarter. At $4 billion, orders were up
22% for the year. Seven of 10 segments grew by at least 10%. Let me give you some more details, for instance, for
energy, a key market. Here Energy Connections was up 26%, renewables were up 126%, and Power was up 213%. For
the year, we signed 427 partnerships and have 22,000 developers on Predix.

We created a few big global partnerships including Reliance and Maersk, and we signed the first enterprise-wide
software agreement with Exelon to apply Predix across more than 2,000 power generation assets. Lastly, we acquired
ServiceMax to extend our analytics across field service. So orders were in line with expectations and consistent with
our goals for 2017.
Segment organic growth was up 4% in the quarter. This was up 8% without the headwind of oil and gas. We saw
substantial strength behind the launch of new products. Power grew by 15% with nine H turbines shipped. Aviation
organic growth was up 6% with 44 LEAP engines shipped. Life sciences grew by 9% and renewables grew by 26% as
we shipped 1.9 gigawatts of onshore wind products. Services organic growth was up 5% and was particularly strong
with aviation spares growth of 18%. And we saw strong revenue growth in Europe, Japan, India, Middle East, China
and Russia. Overall, global revenue grew by 3%.
Now gross margins were down 10 basis points in the quarter driven by difficult mix and this reflects NPI launches with
the LEAP, H turbine and new wind products. The segments continued to drive down SG&A, which was a benefit of
about 30 basis points, and segment operating profit margins were up 10 basis points excluding Alstom and up 110 basis
points all in.
Total industrial margins for the year were 14%, at the low end of our 14% to 14.5% guide we gave you in December.
Excluding Oil & Gas, margins were up 30 basis points. We made good progress on gross margins this year, up 40 basis
points, and service continues to be strong with margins up 170 basis points on the year.
Just a few comments on Alstom execution. For the quarter, Alstom generated $4.7 billion of orders, $500 million of
segment profit and $500 million of cash. So we're seeing solid growth in grid, steam turbines and services, and we
believe Alstom is making GE more competitive and we have good momentum for 2017.
In the fourth quarter, we announced the exits of Water and Industrial Solutions. We've seen significant interest in the
platforms and discussions are progressing. We expect to close water around mid-year and industrial solutions late in the
year. Net proceeds will be approximately $4 billion and we're targeting gains of about $2.5 billion. The gains will be
offset with additional restructuring this year. At the outlook meeting, we talked about roughly 100 basis point margin
improvement per year in 2017 and 2018. About half that comes from running the cost play we've been running and
leveling off spend in big programs like the H, the LEAP and new wind turbines.
We've got programs around product and service cost that Jeff and Philippe Cochet are leading, and we'll drive synergies
in Alstom and Baker Hughes and will continue to begin to bring down our corporate cost. The other 50 basis points
comes from incremental costs out of two big buckets: digitalization and integration learnings on structure that we'll be
spreading across the rest of the company. In total, we're working on a list of close to $1.7 billion with a target of getting
$1 billion of cost out over two years.
We've announced the new IT structure to run IT horizontally across the company, and we expect to save $450 million.
We also recently announced a partnership with PwC to hire 600 members of our tax team that will drive another $100
million of savings per year.
For cash, Industrial CFOA was $8.2 billion in the quarter, the biggest cash quarter in our history. We had significant
growth in CFOA and free cash flow versus fourth quarter of 2015, both growing by more than 30%. We saw a $3.2
billion reduction in working capital for the year. When you add back the $600 million from the 2016 payment of our
long-term incentive plan and cash from restructuring, free cash flow conversion was significantly above last year.
We received another $4 billion dividend from GE Capital, for a total of $20 billion in the year. We reduced net P&E by
more than $1 billion versus expectations in the year as we completed the investment in major NPI launches. For the
year, free cash flow and dispositions were about $33 billion above our plan, and GE's balance sheet remains strong. We
returned $30 billion to investors in dividend and buyback, a record, and we remain on track for our goals in 2017.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.

Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a fourth quarter summary.
Revenues were $33.1 billion, down 2% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were down 3% to $30.4 billion. As you can
see on the right side of the page, the Industrial segments were flat on a reported basis. Organically, Industrial segment
revenue was down 1% excluding Alstom and up 4% including Alstom for the months of November and December for
both 2015 and 2016.
Industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.46, down 12% excluding gains and restructuring, which were a net $0.04
of a headwind in the quarter. EPS was up 6%. The operating EPS number of $0.43 includes other continuing GE
Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I'll cover on the GE Capital page.
Continuing EPS of $0.39 includes the impact of non-operating pension, and net EPS of $0.39 includes discontinued
operations. The total DiscOps impact was immaterial in the quarter and down significantly from last year, which
included the gain associated with the Synchrony exit.
As Jeff said, we generated $30 billion of CFOA in 2016, up from $16.4 billion last year, driven by increased dividends
from GE Capital. Industrial CFOA was $11.6 billion, down 5% excluding deal taxes and pension contributions. We
generated $8.2 billion of industrial CFOA in the fourth quarter, which was up 34% versus last year. This was driven
primarily by $5 billion of working capital, with improvement across all buckets including receivables, inventory,
accounts payable, and progress collections.
Industrial free cash flow was up 39% and free cash flow conversion was 212% in the quarter. On a full-year basis,
Industrial free cash flow conversion was 84% excluding deal taxes, pension and Alstom. Adjusting free cash flow
conversion for gains, free cash flow conversion was 106% for the year.
The GE tax rate was a negative 2% for the quarter, driven by tax benefits associated with the non-core business exit in
Aviation. On a pre-tax basis, the gain on the disposition totaled $49 million. But because of the high tax basis on the
Aviation deal, after-tax gains were $325 million. Normalizing the tax rate by excluding the tax benefit associated with
gains and restructuring, the tax rate for the quarter was 12%, right about where we expected.
I want to be clear that the tax benefits associated with the disposition did not fall through in our earnings. They were
spent in restructuring charges. Similar to prior quarters, the GE Capital tax rate was favorable, reflecting a tax benefit
on a pre-tax continuing loss. For the year, the GE tax rate was 9%.
On the right side of the segment results, as I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were flat on a reported basis and
down 1% organically, but they were up 4% organically including Alstom organic. Excluding Oil & Gas, which
continues to be challenged, organic revenue including Alstom was up 8%, with strength in Power, renewables,
Aviation, and Healthcare.
Industrial segment op profit was up 6% and Industrial op profit, which includes corporate operating cost, was up 2%.
On the bottom of the page, as I mentioned earlier, Industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.46, up 6%, excluding
gains and restructuring, with Industrial operating EPS up 5% on the same basis. For the year, we delivered $1.49 of
EPS, which was up 14% versus 2015. Included in the $1.49 was $0.02 of uncovered restructuring that I'll go through on
the next page.
So next on Industrial other items for the quarter, we had $0.08 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other
items that were taken in corporate. This was $0.03 higher than we planned associated with the acceleration of Alstom
and Lighting restructuring costs as well as higher BD costs associated with the decisions we've made around Water,
Baker Hughes, and additive.
In total for the quarter, restructuring charges were $1 billion on a pre-tax basis, with $300 million related to the Alstom
synergy investments. We also made significant investments in Lighting, Oil & Gas, Healthcare in the quarter.
Gains in the quarter were $0.04, principally driven by non-strategic business exit in Aviation. As I mentioned before,
gains were $49 million on a pre-tax basis but $325 million after tax, which drove the low Industrial tax rate quarter.

The Aviation divestiture was principally on the tax line because of the high tax basis associated with the business. The
gain was more than offset in earnings by higher restructuring.
In the fourth quarter, we incurred higher uncovered restructuring charges than we planned. And at the bottom of the
page, you can see that for the year, we incurred $0.02 of uncovered restructuring. We chose to accelerate restructuring
as we had good projects with attractive returns, and it was the right thing to do for the company as we head into 2017
and 2018.
In 2017, we expect restructuring to be about $2.5 billion, funded by the Water and Industrial Solutions dispositions,
with a heavier spend in the first half of the year. For the first quarter, we're estimating restructuring spend of about $1
billion, with no offsetting gains. For the full year, as we said, we expect gains to equal restructuring but there will be
variability by quarter.
Next I'll cover the individual segments. First I'll start with Power. Power orders in the fourth quarter totaled $11.1
billion, higher by 16%. Organic orders in the quarter including Alstom organic grew 14%. Core GE orders of $8.3
billion were lower by 4%. And Alstom orders of $2.8 billion grew 160% organically. Equipment orders grew 1%. Core
equipment orders of $3.3 billion were down 28% on lower gas turbines, 22 versus 55 a year ago. We received orders
for eight H turbines in the quarter versus 12 last year, bringing total H orders to 25 for the year and an ending backlog
of 32.
Alstom equipment was strong with $1.7 billion of orders including 26 HRSGs versus six last year and 11 steam
turbines versus two last year. Organically Alstom equipment orders grew four times. Service orders sold $6.1 billion up
32% with GE core services up 24% to $4.9 billion and Alstom orders grew $1.2 billion. We booked orders for 58 AGPs
in the quarter versus 42 last year. Total service upgrades including AGPs grew 87%. Alstom service grew orders 61%
organically with strength in India the Middle East and Africa.
Backlog finished the year at $84.7 billion, up 10%. Core GE backlog grew 8% and Alstom's backlog of $18.3 billion
grew 18%. Revenues of $8.5 billion grew 20%. Core GE revenues of $6.5 billion were up 6% driven by equipment
higher by 10% and services up 4%. Equipment revenue grew on gas turbine shipments of 35 units versus 28 last year
including nine Hs, for a total of 26 Hs for the year. Service growth was driven by 27 more AGPs than last year, 62
versus 35, offset partly by fewer installations. Total AGP shipments for the year were 145.
Total Alstom revenues of $1.9 billion grew 83% organically. Operating profit of $2.1 billion was up 27%. Core
operating profit was $1.7 billion and Alstom contributed $359 million in the quarter. Core earnings were flat on higher
volume, favorable FX and positive value gap offset by the mix impact of nine Hs this year versus zero last year. H
margins are positive and continue to improve but still well below the margins on our mature app products.
Alstom synergies were $454 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the year. The business shipped 104 gas turbines
this year. We had expected to ship 110 to 115. We expected to ship six more units but those transactions did not close
in the quarter but we expect that those units will close in 2017. In addition, although aero turbines were up in the year
we expected to ship more in the fourth quarter. Again, we think those units will likely close in 2017.
We operate in very tough geographies in this business and there's always 500 megawatts or a gigawatt of deals that are
hard to close and it's been the nature of the business over the last several years and we expect this dynamic to continue
into the future. In 2017, we expect a flat market for gigawatts. For the year, we're planning on 100 to 105 gas turbine
shipments. We have a strong equipment backlog of $17.6 billion which was up 27% and a strong services backlog of
$6 billion to $7 billion which was up 6%.
The Alstom integration performed well this year with total year orders of $10 billion, building a backlog that is up 18%
and delivering over $1 billion of synergies in the year. Our outlook for Power remains consistent with the expectations
shared at the outlook meeting albeit off a lower base. As we said December, we expect double-digit earnings growth in
Power in 2017. In order to achieve that, we need to execute on Alstom, product margin improvements and deliver
services growth. Lastly, the team has to deliver the incremental cost-out actions given the market conditions we face.

Next is renewables. Renewable Energy had a strong orders quarter. Orders in total grew 32% to $3.3 billion. Core GE
wind orders were higher by 48% to over $3 billion. We took orders for 1,180 turbines versus 827 last year, up 43%
principally in the U.S. where the orders were up 54% driven by the safe harbor qualification in 2016 for 100% PTC
benefit going forward. Units were higher by 43% and megawatts were up 54% on the larger two and three megawatt
turbines.
The business also booked $300 million of additional repower upgrades and services. Alstom orders, principally hydro,
were $290 million in the quarter. Backlog finished the year at $13.1 billion with GE core up 16%. Revenues in the
quarter grew 29% to $2.5 billion with GE core revenue up 20%. The business shipped 786 turbines versus 847 last
year, but the megawatts shipped were up 11% on the larger units.
Alstom revenues of $279 million were higher by 161% organically. Operating profit of $163 million was up 3X on
better Alstom results. The core business was down 8% on increased NPI spending on the two and three megawatt
turbines, lower price and foreign exchange partly offset by volume growth and some product cost out. Alstom
generated $48 million of profit in the quarter on strong synergies.
For the year the team delivered about $200 million of synergies, well above the plan, driven by sourcing and SG&A
efficiencies particularly in hydro. We expect renewables to have a solid 2017 and contribute double-digit earnings
improvement. The unique repower upgrade offering we expect will continue momentum and the team is making good
progress on driving down costs of the new NPIs, critical, given the competitiveness in the industry. We expect to close
the LM Wind Power acquisition in the first half and the vertical integration of blades will also help drive results.
In Aviation, we had another solid quarter in the fourth quarter. From a demand perspective, global passenger air travel
continued to grow strongly with our RPKs up 6.1% year-to-date November, with strength in both domestic and
international routes. Airfreight volumes grew 3.2% year-to-date in November. Orders in the quarter were $7.2 billion
up 5% with equipment orders higher by 2%.
Commercial engine orders were down 4% on lower CF6, CFM and GEnx orders partially offset by strong GE90 and
LEAP orders. $1.8 billion of new commercial engine orders included $478 million for LEAP, $186 million in orders
for CFM, $577 million in orders for GEnx and $326 million for GE90. Military equipment orders of $360 million were
up 2% driven by another large T700 order for 306 units.
Service orders grew 8% in the quarter. Commercial service orders were higher by 16%, with CSA growth of 22% and
spare orders up 14%, to an ADOR [Average Daily Order Rate] of $44.5 million a day. Military service orders were
down 18% and $480 million on tough comparisons. Backlog finished the year at $155 billion up 2% with equipment
backlog of $33.3 billion down 5% and service backlog of $121 billion up 4%. Revenues grew 7% in the quarter to $7.2
billion.
Equipment revenue was up 1% driven by commercial growth of 8% with 692 engine deliveries versus 643 last year
including 44 LEAP engines. This was partly offset by military down 35% on lower shipments. Service revenue was
higher by 12%. Commercial spares rate was $43.5 million a day, up 18%. Op profit in the quarter totaled $1.7 billion
up 11% primarily driven by favorable price, volume and productivity partly offset by the LEAP mix. Margins
expanded 100 basis points in the quarter.
Aviation had a very good year. The business shipped its first LEAP engines and currently 20 A320neos, powered by
LEAP, are flying across six different customers. Reliability has been excellent and the engines are performing to spec.
We had expected to ship a total of about 100 engines in 2016 but in coordination with the air framers, we delivered 77
for the total year meeting all of our commercial commitments. These units will now deliver in 2017 with total
shipments of about 500 LEAP engines for next year. The team is also executing and leading our additive strategy.
Arcam and Concept Laser are great platform additions to our capability. We believe 2017 will be another solid year of
execution in Aviation.
In Oil & Gas, the environment continues to be challenging and activity levels remain muted. External market indicators
appear to be stabilizing with expected more balanced supply and demand fundamentals partly influenced by the recent
OPEC production agreement. U.S. onshore rig count grew 33% versus the third quarter but was essentially flat versus

the beginning of the year. Forecasted E&P spending expected to be flat to modestly up in 2017. The business had an
encouraging orders quarter. Orders of $3.3 billion were flat year over year and up 2% organically. Orders for all
business segments were up sequentially versus the third quarter.
Equipment orders grew 4% versus last year, with TMS up 48%, subsea up 26% and surface up 35%. Downstream was
down 45% on no repeat of a large African order last year. Service orders were down 3%, with TMS up strongly at 40%,
offset by digital, downstream, subsea and surface which were all lower. Orders for the total year were down 27%.
Backlog finished the year at $21 billion, down 9% versus last year end, with equipment down 32% and services growth
up 7%.
Revenues in the quarter were down 22%, with equipment down 25% and service down 19%. Revenues for the year
were also down 22%. Operating profit of $411 million was down 43% on lower volume and price, partly offset by cost
out, which totaled $170 million in the quarter. Total cost-out actions for the year were $700 million. Total cost out over
the last two years was $1.3 billion.
2016 was an extremely difficult year for Oil & Gas, and the business expects the first half of 2017 will continue to
remain challenging with sequential improvements in the second half of the year. Offshore drilling and subsea activity
will likely remain low in 2017. Consistent with what we discussed at the December outlook meeting, we expect the
business to deliver lower earnings in 2017. Increased activity in North America onshore and stabilization in the Middle
East and Europe are needed to drive improvement in our shorter cycle and surface businesses in the second half.
We've made significant progress on integration efforts with Baker Hughes and have dedicated more than 200 people to
it. We gave you an update on December 8; no change to that outlook, and we expect to close the deal midyear.
Next up is Healthcare. Healthcare had a good quarter. Orders grew 3% to $5.4 billion. Organic orders were strong and
emerging markets up 10%, led by China higher by 19% and Latin America up 60%. Europe orders were higher by 6%
organically, and the U.S. was lower by 1% organically.
In terms of business lines, Healthcare systems orders grew organically by 3%, with imaging up 5% on strength in CT,
MI, and ultrasound, partly offset by lower LCS. Life sciences orders grew 6% organically, with BioProcess higher by
7% and core imaging up 6%. Healthcare orders for the total year grew 3% reported and grew 5% organically. Revenues
in the quarter grew 3%. HCS revenue grew 2% organically, with ultrasound up 6% and imaging up 2%. Life sciences
continued to deliver strong growth, with revenues growing 9% organically, driven by BioProcess higher by 15%.
Healthcare revenues for the total year grew 4% reported and 5% organically.
Operating profit of more than $1 billion grew 10% in the quarter. Volume and strong cost productivity more than offset
lower price and higher digital spending. Margins expanded 130 basis points in the fourth quarter.
Healthcare executed strongly in 2016, delivering good organic growth and operating leverage and earnings. They
delivered $450 million of cost out versus their $350 million target. Margins for the year expanded 100 basis points. In
2017, we expect the same focus on cost and product competitiveness with similar results. We will launch 25 new
products and are targeting a point of share in 2017. We expect China, Africa, and Asia-Pacific to continue their strong
growth. Europe is expected to be roughly stable, while the U.S. may be a bit slower due to the uncertainty around the
repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act.
Next on Transportation, fourth quarter carload volume improved modestly, up 2.1%, driven by intermodal carloads up
3.4% and commodity carloads up 90 basis points. Commodity volume was driven by agriculture, which was higher by
7.4%. Metals were higher by 25%, and chemicals were higher by 2.4%, which was partly offset by coal down by 2.8%
and petroleum down almost 16%. Notwithstanding the improvement in the quarter, we expect 2017 to continue to be
difficult for volume growth. Year to date, carload volume was down 4.5%, driven by intermodal down 1.5% and
commodities down over 7%.
Transportation orders of $1.4 billion were down 58%, consistent with the North American market. Equipment orders of
$64 million were down 98% on no locomotive orders versus 1,113 units last year, including the large 10-year 1,000
loco India order. Service orders of $1.3 billion were very strong, up 2X, driven by a large multiyear modernization

order to retrofit 500 locomotives for the North American Class I railroad over five years. Backlog finished the year at
$20.1 billion, down $2.4 billion, driven by equipment liquidation. Revenues in the quarter were down 23%, with
equipment down 38% and services up 2%. We shipped 171 locos in the quarter versus 320 last year. Services grew 2%
on higher contractual services, partly offset by lower spare parts.
Operating profit of $317 million was down 6%, primarily driven by lower volumes, partially offset by cost-out and
restructuring benefits and mix. Margins expanded 450 basis points in the quarter. The Transportation team executed
well in 2016 in a very tough environment. Consistent with the outlook meeting, we expect 2017 to be even tougher,
with expected loco shipments down 50%, pressuring operating profit down double digits. Having said that, we expect
the team will outperform the industry.
Next, Energy Connections & Lighting, orders for the segment totaled $3.1 billion, with Energy Connections orders of
$2.8 billion and current orders of just under $300 million. Energy Connections orders grew 8% reported. Organically,
including Alstom, orders grew 5%. Power Conversion was lower by 23% on continued headwinds in oil and gas.
Industrial Solutions was down 1% but outperformed the North American market by a couple of points in the quarter.
And grid orders of $1.5 billion grew 27% in the quarter. Revenues for Energy Connections were higher by 15% and up
16% organically including Alstom. Power conversion revenues were down 18%. Industrial solutions were down 3%,
and grid grew 56% in revenues in the quarter. Current and lighting revenues were down 14% with current growing 5%
and the legacy business declining 26%, as we continue to resize the business downward.
Operating profit in the quarter totaled $102 million. Energy Connections earned $98 million and current and lighting $3
million. Energy Connections earnings were driven by $100 million of grid earnings, $42 million of industrial solutions
earnings, up 59%, partly offset by power conversion, which was down. Alstom's synergy execution was strong in 2016,
delivering $226 million of benefits, above our target of $175 million.
In 2016, the market backdrop for these businesses was tough, but it was not a good execution year either. In 2017, we
expect this segment to deliver double-digit earnings improvements, with better execution in industrial solutions,
lighting, and power conversion, and we expect grid to continue to perform well. Our estimate is the industrial solutions
divestment will happen later in the year.
Finally, I'll cover GE Capital. The verticals earned $478 million in this quarter, up 9% from prior year, driven
principally by lower impairments in EFS. GECAS, EFS, and Industrial Finance all had strong quarters, and overall
portfolio quality remained stable. In the fourth quarter, the verticals funded $3.8 billion of on-book volume and
contributed to enabling $5 billion of industrial orders. Other continuing operations generated a $262 million loss in the
quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, preferred dividends, restructuring costs related to the portfolio
transformation, and headquarter operating costs, partially offset by tax benefits. These costs will continue to come
down as excess debt matures and we right-size the organization structure.
Discontinued operations generated $300 million of income, with gains and other exit-related items largely offset by
operating costs. Overall, GE Capital reported net income of $218 million. We ended the quarter with $93 billion of ENI
excluding liquidity, with continuing ENI of $82 billion. Liquidity at the end of the fourth quarter was $51 billion.
Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter, we closed $17 billion of transactions bringing the total closed
transactions through the end of the quarter to $190 billion. We have signed agreements for an additional $4 billion in
the fourth quarter, bringing the total signings to $197 billion, which essentially completes our plan given that the
majority of the remaining assets will run off as it makes better economic sense. We remain on track for 1.1 times price
to tangible book that we initially estimated.
GE Capital paid $4 billion of dividends during the fourth quarter for a total of $20 billion in 2016 versus the original
$18 billion target for the year. Dividends of $5 billion ahead of the original plan announced in April of 2015. Overall,
the GE Capital team delivered a strong verticals performance while executing on all aspects of the exit plan.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.

Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, Jeff.
We have no change to our 2017 framework. Let me take you through the pieces. Orders grew by 2% in the quarter
organically, Oil & Gas seems to have bottomed and services are very strong. Alstom is generating orders growth, so we
see line of sight for the 3% to 5% organic growth for the year.
We're executing on a $1 billion incremental cost-out play with plenty of restructuring to support it, so we see our way
to 100 basis points of margin enhancement. Alstom is executing well and should add EPS at the high end of our range.
And we end the year with good momentum and working capital. Meanwhile, GE Capital continues to execute on their
transition to an industrial finance company.
So to confirm on 2017, we see EPS of $1.60 to $1.70, operating cash flow of $16 billion to $20 billion and cash to
investors of $19 billion to $21 billion and buyback and dividends. So a good outlook for the company, a solid year in
2016.
And now, Matt, let me turn it back over you.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Great. Thanks, Jeff. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Scott Davis of Barclays.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Scott. Good morning.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I know we've talked in December about the election, but now you've had a couple months. I
mean, what are your customers – I mean, I understand Healthcare could get pushed out a little bit but what are your
customers in Power and renewables and some of these other areas where you could have some regulatory uncertainty?
Is there a risk if they push back orders or delay projects, things like that? I mean clearly, just the U.S., but how do you
think about that, Jeff?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Scott, I'll take a crack. I would say we haven't really seen much change so far. I think if I
took it by segment, the Affordable Care Act is getting the most, I would say, both attention and the media and by our
customers, I think you could see some caution around the Affordable Care Act as you go forward. We haven't really
seen that much but that could happen.
I think on the renewables side, really with the PTC over the next few years, I think that's pretty much locked in place.
And then I still think the basic thesis around gas power in the U.S. remains intact as it pertains to being a baseload
technology in the future. And then I think outside the U.S., I really haven't seen much change in interplay post the
election in terms of what our customers are saying and how they're thinking. I don't know, Jeff, could you add anything
to add to that? I think that's the lay of the land, Scott.

<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Thanks a lot. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Julian.
<Q - Julian Mitchell>: Hey. Just wanted to focus on Aviation. So I guess you had a very good EBIT number in Q4,
helped by the gain and the high teens growth in commercial spares sales. Should we think that, that profit growth sort
of levels out in the first half of 2017? You don't get the same growth rate in spares presumably. LEAP shipments sort of
catch up after a light Q4. And then also longer term, your commercial engine orders were down about 940 units in 2016
overall. How are you thinking about the cycle and your commercial OE revenues?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, let me start with a few things; then I'll let Jeff weight in. The gain was not recorded
in Aviation, okay? That was recorded at corporate. It was offset in restructuring, so none of the gain results are
reflected in segment performance at Aviation. We had a strong spares year this year. We're up double digits. Our
expectation is the spares sales rate, the ADOR will not be up that strongly next year. We're thinking high single digits.
And I think our expectations are, as Jeff shared with you in December, that we're going to continue to grow the
operating profit in Aviation next year, notwithstanding the LEAP shipments.
So right now our estimate is we'll ship something close to 500 leap engines next year. And that's factored into that
outlook. And we expect the services business partly with the spares growth I just talked about, to continue to grow
smartly in 2017.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think, Jeff, just to echo, Julian, what Jeff said, I think the two things I think about in
Aviation is the business model as it pertains to services and revenue past remodels and things like that, I think investors
should feel great about that. And then execution on the LEAP, and I think Jeff laid out the LEAP shipments, we're kind
of on learning curve. And those two elements I think really are the ones that dictate Aviation growth. But we think the
Aviation team did a good job in 2016, and they are well-positioned to do another good job in 2017.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: And the commercial equipment backlog is very strong. We took fewer orders on new
commercial equipment engines in 2016, but the backlog is very strong.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Great.
Operator
The next question is from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. Good morning. Since I only have one question I'd love to focus on cash here. And
within that, Jeff, is there any factoring this quarter from GE Capital into GE Industrial? And then also while it's the
strongest cash flow quarter in a while, still a little bit below what we thought you guys implied when we talked about it
before. And then as you think about it progressing through 2017 and beyond, maybe just talk a little more about kind of
the cash flow initiative comp that really can give investors confidence that the cash flow part of this story is improving.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Okay, there's a lot to that. Let me start with fourth quarter, Steve. So we improved
working capital in fourth quarter about $5.2 billion which, best we can tell, is the strongest working capital quarter the
company has ever had. And I want to just give you some of the pieces on that. So within working capital, accounts
receivable generated about $0.5 billion, $1.2 billion generation in inventory, $1.8 billion generation in AP, a lot of that
being renegotiated terms. We've talked about realigning or aligning suppliers with customers in terms of the time sync
between build and collect. And then $1.7 billion on progress, orders were a bit better as a result. Progress was a bit
better. That's how you get the $5.2 billion.

So within that accounts receivable performance, you asked about factoring. For the total year, factoring with GE
Capital was $1.6 billion change for the year. It was $1.7 billion last year. So actually year-to-year, it was $100 million
less of a benefit in the year between what we did with GE Capital around factoring. And in the fourth quarter,
importantly, and you see it because our receivables $500 billion, is from the third to fourth quarter of 2015, the benefit
was $2.3 billion. The benefit going from this past third quarter to this quarter was $700 million, so it was actually down
$1.6 billion year-to-year between third quarter and fourth quarter each of those years. So there's very good underlying
performance here. It's not just about – it's actually very little to do with GE Capital factoring.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, I would add, I think the one piece that we're still not happy with in terms of Q4 is
inventory. And I think we generated – we reduced working capital by $3 billion for the year and still didn't do what I
think either Jeff or I want to see on inventory. We expect inventory to go down by $2 billion next year, and we think
that's going to give us to a ton of momentum as it pertains to CFOA and working capital in 2017.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So let me just follow up and answer that part of your question. So we came in at $11.6
billion of Industrial CFOA. We were shooting to be something closer to $12 billion of CFOA in the latest update we
gave you. When you subtract CapEx in Industrial free cash flow, we ended up at $8.9 billion. That was actually right in
the middle of the range we gave you coming into the year on Industrial free cash flow.
But the $400 million light is really all about inventory, and it's essentially the $1 billion roughly, the $1 billion sales
miss left more in inventory than we expected and not all of that would have converted to receivables and then from
receivables would have converted to cash, but a significant piece of it would have been. So I would say on an Industrial
free cash flow basis, a couple of hundred million lighter. On Industrial CFOA, closer to $400 million lighter, and most
of it's about that volume not going out the door, not being rev-recced.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And this is on people's incentive plans for 2016 and 2017.
Operator
The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey, guys. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: So we're getting a lot of, obviously, questions around tax policy and we've gotten a lot
of questions from investors on you guys have a relatively low tax rate as it is, but there's some conversations we've had
with investors that say it can go substantially lower, something like almost to like a 0% to 5% type of range. I can't
quite get there just doing the high-level math, so maybe if you could just give us some color on how your – the tax
value, how your tax guys are kind of looking at what's out there from a tax policy perspective?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So at this point, Steve, this is all speculation, right? I mean the only point of reference you
have is a little bit of what's coming out of the new administration and then what exists in the form of the Brady Bill and
House Ways and Means.
And I think what GE wants, and what we think is most important competitiveness for U.S. companies, is essentially a
competitive tax rate, something that looks more like the OECD average, which is roughly 21%, 22%, and this notion of
territoriality that you pay the tax in the jurisdiction that you actually earn it. And then from there, those earnings are
fungible and can move cross border. Those are the essential things. And then as a transition item on historical foreign
earnings, the companies left onshore, we want a reasonable transition tax if one is necessary, in order to true up the
historical performance.
The real delta between that as a minimum to make U.S. companies more competitive and put them on an equal footing
with most of the people we compete with, countries we compete with, is this question about border adjustability. And
as I'm sure you understand the way border adjustability has been described, there is an incentive for exporters to export
more because there is essentially no tax on exports, and that's about trying to drive more production and manufacturing

into the U.S.
So if a company is a net exporter, you could envision, under border adjustability, they pay a lot lower tax rate against
those exports against U.S. But you've got to remember in the case of General Electric, 55%, 60% of what we do, we do
outside the U.S. Border adjustability doesn't impact at all what we pay for taxes in Sweden or Switzerland or the U.K.,
Japan or China. And so although companies may find themselves in a place with a real relatively lower U.S. tax
liability, I don't think it changes in anyway how they think about what their foreign tax liabilities are.
Operator
The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Hey. Good morning, guys
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Kaplowitz>: Jeff, can you give us a little more color on your Power business? It's understandable that
you would see some delays in shipments. It's a pretty difficult market. But did you see any incremental delays in
closing deals toward the end of the year? And was it a result of GE being more careful around financing or customers
just wanting to delay delivery? And then you mentioned you still expect double-digit earnings growth in Power. How
dependent are you on some of these delayed turbine shipments to reach your 2017 forecast?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So maybe I'll start, Jeff. So a couple things happened in the fourth quarter. We had six,
arguably seven, but I would say six gas turbines that we absolutely thought were going to ship. Four of those were
13E2 class turbines that were going into Bahrain and Iraq. And these are just enormously difficult geographies to get
stuff done. And right up through the end of the year we thought those transactions were going to go. They didn't end up
going. I think we're confident they will go in the first half of 2017.
The second was two 9Es that were going to West Africa. And then as it turns out in the end, the customer came back
and rethought whether they wanted the 9Es, which we had made in inventory and whether they actually might want to
go with an H-class turbine instead. So that likely will book as an order in 2017, not clear yet whether if it converts to an
H, whether it will ship in 2017.
And then I'd say the last piece is, although for the year we did pretty good on aero turbines, we were up about 10 units
for the year. We were down 10 units year over year in the fourth quarter, and we missed about seven trailer mounts in
the fourth quarter. And again, we're talking about places like Libya, Iraq, really, really difficult geographies where we
just didn't get those short-cycle convertible TMs across the finish line. I think our outlook for TMs and aeroderivatives
largely remains intact for 2017. They're just really difficult transactions to get across the line.
And I'd say the last thing is although we had a good AGP quarter, we did 145 for the year, very close to right in the
middle of what we guided, we expected to do more than 145 AGPs for the year and other upgrades, dry low NOx,
DLNs. We had built sets because we thought we could deliver incremental upgrades here in the fourth quarter, and
some of those just moved to the right. We didn't get all the upgrades we thought we'd get done in the quarter, and that's
really the delta in the fourth quarter as it relates to Power.
Now when you think about next year, it's really, as I said earlier, there are three or four things we need to happen so
Alstom performed very well in Power in 2016. We overdelivered on synergies. The business delivered everything they
said they were going to do around Alstom. Orders were very, very strong. The backlog, from the time of closing until
year end, is up 18% year over year, very strong up on equipment, even stronger than the 18%.
So we need the Power business to deliver the incremental improvement in Alstom from 2016 to 2017. We need our
service business to do more or less what they did this year. The service business for the year grew operating profit
about 7%. We're looking for mid-single digits, that kind of performance in 2017. We've got to deliver the structural
cost out, just given where we are in the industry and the volatility. And then the last one is we took a lot of headwind
this year on the H launch, both the ramp of the H and the individual unit costs. Now the units we shipped in the second

half of the year were profitable, significantly more profitable than the beginning of the year, but still much less
profitable than a lot of the F technology that they're replacing.
And so we're looking for that turnaround, a meaningful turnaround, hundreds of millions of dollars in 2017. As we
come down not just the cost curve on the H, but you'll notice in our orders OPI, we've been getting price on the H for
the last five quarters in a row. And so we think prices are much better as we deliver 23 Hs in 2017.

Your next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys. How are you?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey. Just a follow-up on the Power and also in renewables. As you think about ramping
the development programs, both those segments on a core basis had margins down, Power 150 basis points, renewables
160 this quarter. How do they turn around in 2017? Do both of those still – do you envision the core piece having up
margins? And how much of this swing in the development programs is part of that versus other factors?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Maybe I'd start, Shannon. I think the development programs explain a ton of the turnaround
year over year. I think in the case of the Power business, the H investment was, I don't know, $300 million or $400
million of headwind in 2016 versus 2015. We think most of that turns around. In the case of the onshore wind business,
we were going through a big product conversion process in 2016 as well. So I think we feel like on both those cases we
should see core margin enhancement going into 2017, and that's both on what I would say both on the development
side and also on the product cost side.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I think of the H we just talked about that, both price and unit cost and less development
cost. I don't think it's more complicated than that. On renewables, you don't have the price element. Price is a real
challenge in onshore wind turbines. Some of it is the competitiveness around getting the PTC safe harbor orders. So in
renewables, it's a little bit of program costs around the 2.X and the 3.X turbines. It's a lot about product unit cost and
volume. So we're going to ship order of magnitude a number similar to what we did this year, roughly 3,000 wind
turbines. But in addition to that, we're likely going to do more than 800 repower units in 2017. So we expect the
volume to be up materially and that also to contribute with volume leverage to margin improvement year-to-year.
Operator
Our final question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
<Q - Andrew Burris Obin>: Yes, good morning. Just to go back to the question, overall revenue, as we look at sort of
your revenues versus consensus, it just seems that revenues are relatively weak, relative consensus across the board,
and usually you guys hit the numbers pretty close. And it's not just power, it seems to be across the board, and just has
anything happened broadly in the last two weeks of the year after the analyst meeting to drive the slowdown? Is there
sort of a broader development that explains it? Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think, Andrew, I would say the fourth quarter organic revenue was Power up 15%,
renewables up 26%, Oil & Gas down 21%, Aviation up 6%, Transportation down 22%, Healthcare up three, and
Energy Connections up 16%. So the total organic revenue growth was up 4% for the quarter. I think clearly, Power is
explainable. I think clearly Oil & Gas even though I like the orders performance in Oil & Gas, it's a harder segment to
call. I think other than that, Andrew, it's really just noise. It's $31 billion, or $30 billion to $35 billion a quarter.

There's going to be puts and takes on the revenue line, but I think if you think about 2017, as being an organic guide of
up 3% to 5%, and you've got 4% organic in Q4 in revenue, I feel pretty secure about the 3% to 5%, guide for 2017. I
just think you've got to look at it that way. Look, Power didn't do as much revenue as we would've liked. It was still
substantially up organically up 5% organically without Alstom and up 15 with Alstom. So that's not bad.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I would just add to that, Andrew, so Power was light, no question. Oil & Gas was mostly
transaction, convertible volume less than the team was forecasting. Everything else was actually better. When you add
up the rest of the portfolio against our framework, they came in higher on revenue.

Okay. Great. A couple of quick announcements before we wrap. The replay will be available this afternoon on our
investor website and our first quarter 2017 earnings call will be on April 21. We'll also be holding our annual
shareholders meeting on April 26 in Asheville, North Carolina. Jeff, back to you.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Yeah, so, Matt, just to wrap up, again, I think the teams' focus on 2017, here's the ways that the GE team's compensated
as they look forward into next year. 3% to 5% organic growth, we just kind of went through the pieces of that. 100
basis point margin enhancement, I think a combination of run rate an incremental cost out actions already in play and
strong free cash flow in dispositions. I think good momentum in Q4, more work to do but I feel like the momentum
around the company is very good. So we're aligned with what we showed you in December and off and executing.
Thanks, Matt.
