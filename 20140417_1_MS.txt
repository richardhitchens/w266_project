MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Celeste Mellet Brown
Good morning. This is Celeste Brown, Head of Investor Relations, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs
and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may also
include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at morganstanley.com for reconciliation of
such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties
that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley.
This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our
consent is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everybody. And thanks for joining us. Before I comment on our performance this
quarter, I'll discuss our thoughts on capital returns both for this year and for the medium to long-term. The recently
completed CCAR was a significant inflection point for us. As you know, we secured a non-objection to increase our
capital returns. We respect the CCAR process and made significant investments in that process over the past several
years and we have a program specifically focused on continuing to raise the bar each cycle.
In 2013, we asked for, and received, to non-objection to maintain our dividend and the ability to purchase the balance
of the Wealth Management business. In mid-2013, we applied for our first buyback since 2007 of $500 million. In this
latest CCAR, we applied to double the dividend, our first increase since 2007, and a $1 billion buyback. We intend to

add meaningfully to our capital requests in future years. Going forward, we will look to drive our dividend yield to at
least levels commensurate with the broader S&P, which has historically been around 2% sustained by growing earnings
from Wealth and Investment Management. In fact, an 80% to 100% payout on just the earnings from Wealth and
Investment Management suggest an annual dividend at two or three times our recently increased level, just based on
2013 earnings and share count.
In addition to growing our dividend substantially, we expect to continue to increase our buyback, with a focus on both
mitigating employee issuance and reducing our share count. Share buybacks will make up the difference between
dividends and the total payouts which we intend to drive toward a 100% of firm earnings over the next several years.
Now, clearly when we can do this is obviously a function of regulatory approval.
Turning now to the businesses in the first quarter. In challenging markets, for institutional retail investors, we drove our
revenues and PBT higher across our three business segments versus a year ago as we continue to execute against our
strategic plan. Ex DVA, our revenues were up 4% versus the first quarter of 2013, while our expenses were up 1%. Our
expense ratios improved across the segments and our overall earnings per share grew 13%. In fact, Ex DVA, our
earnings grew despite a significantly higher tax rate than a year ago.
ROTE from continuing operations excluding DVA improved as well to 9.8% while ROE improved to 8.3%, up 130
basis points and 80 basis points year-over-year respectively. We continue to work towards sustainably higher ROEs
across all of our businesses through the execution of our strategy with a particular focus on growth in the bank, which
we believe is substantial as well as on a fixed income ROE and our broader firm-wide expenses.
I look forward to your questions at the end of the call. I'll now turn it over to Ruth to discuss the results in detail.
Ruth Porat
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided
reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. The impact of DVA in
the quarter was positive $126 million, with $76 million in fixed income sales and trading, and $50 million in equity
sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $8.8 billion, up 7% versus the fourth
quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 33%.
Earnings from continuing operations, applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders, excluding DVA, were
approximately $1.3 billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share, excluding DVA, were $0.68 after
preferred dividends. On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $8.9
billion, earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $1.4 billion,
reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.72 after preferred dividends. Book value at the
end of the quarter was $32.38 per share and tangible book value was $27.41 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $835 billion at March 31. Deposits as of quarter end were $117
billion, up $4 billion versus 4Q. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $203 billion, compared with $202
billion at the end of the fourth quarter.
Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that our common equity Tier 1 transitional ratio
will be approximately 14.1%, and our Tier 1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 15.6%.
Risk-weighted assets are expected to be approximately $398 billion at March 31. Reflecting our best estimate of the
final Federal Reserve rules, our common equity Tier 1 ratio, using the pro forma Basel III fully phased in advanced
approach, was 11.6% at March 31. Our pro forma standardized ratio was 10.2%.
We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the recent U.S. regulatory proposal to be approximately
4.2%. For reference, under the prior methodology, our supplementary leverage ratio is 4.5%, up from 4.2%. These
estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision. We continue to expect to see the required 5% level in 2015,
including an assumption for increasing returns of capital to shareholders, despite the Feds recently announced more
demanding requirements.

In addition to the mitigation items we highlighted on the fourth quarter call, we see opportunities to mitigate the recent
inclusion of the CDS long add-on through steps such as compression, re-hedging and roll-down.
Turning to expenses. Our total expenses this quarter were $6.6 billion, down 18% versus the fourth quarter, due to
significantly lower legal expense, seasonality, and our focus on cost reduction. Compensation expense was up 8%
versus the prior quarter on higher revenue. Non-compensation expense was $2.3 billion, primarily reflecting lower
legal expenses, seasonality, and cost management.
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues, excluding DVA, were $4.5 billion, up
21% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.3 billion, down 29% versus the fourth quarter. Compensation was $1.9
billion for the first quarter, up versus the fourth quarter on higher revenue, reflecting a 41% ratio, excluding DVA. The
decline in non-compensation expense to $1.4 billion primarily reflected significantly lower legal expenses. The
business reported a pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion, excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, revenues
were $4.6 billion, and pre-tax profit was $1.4 billion.
In Investment Banking, revenues of $1.1 billion were down 17% versus last quarter, reflecting seasonality. Results
represent strong performance for a first quarter across all products. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley
ranked number one in global-announced M&A and number two in global IPOs and global equity and equity linked at
the end of the first quarter.
Notable transactions included, in advisory, Morgan Stanley acted as advisor, on the five largest transactions including
as exclusive financial advisor to WhatsApp on its $16 billion sale to Facebook. This transaction reflects Morgan
Stanley's continued leadership in the largest and most complex transactions in the technology sector. And as exclusive
financial advisor to Suntory Holdings, in its acquisition of Beam Inc., for $16 billion. This continues our leadership in
cross-border activity as well as in Japan.
In Equity Underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as joint global coordinator for the $2 billion IPO of Altice Group. This
is the largest ever IPO of a cable operator in EMEA. Morgan Stanley also recently acted as lead financial advisor to
Altice Numericable on its acquisition of Vivendi's phone unit SFR, including acting as joint book runner on its €16
billion of noninvestment grade acquisition financing.
In Debt Underwriting, Morgan Stanley also acted as active book runner for Exxon Mobil Corporation's $5.5 billion
offering of senior unsecured notes. This transaction is Exxon's first U.S. dollar senior unsecured debt offering.
Advisory revenues of $336 million declined 25% versus our fourth quarter results, due primarily to seasonality.
Announced advisory transactions were up significantly versus a year ago.
Equity Underwriting revenues of $315 million were down 24% versus the fourth quarter, driven by lower global market
volumes and typical seasonality. Fixed Income underwriting revenues were $485 million, essentially flat to the fourth
quarter as market activity remained at very high levels.
Equity Sales and Trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $1.7 billion, an increase of 13% for last quarter. Revenues
were strong across regions and products, driven by higher client activity. Cash revenues were up, driven by increased
volumes in all regions. Prime brokerage revenues were up significantly, driven by higher balances and robust client
portfolio management activities.
Derivatives revenues grew as volatility trended higher. Fixed Income and Commodity sales and trading revenues,
excluding DVA, were $1.7 billion, up significantly from the fourth quarter. Revenues increased significantly in all
major products. Commodities saw broad-based strength across the energy complex, driven by extreme weather in
North America and increased client demand.
Revenues outside of Commodities were driven higher by seasonality and strength in credit products. Average trading
bar for the first quarter was $50 million, essentially flat to the fourth quarter.
Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were $3.6 billion in the first quarter. Asset Management revenues of $2
billion were up versus last quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher market levels at the beginning of the period and

positive flows. Transaction revenues decreased 10% from last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $540
million, down 6% versus the prior quarter, due to fewer trading days. Investment Banking-related fees of $181 million,
down 12% versus last quarter, reflecting a lower U.S. Equity Underwriting calendar, most notably with fewer
closed-end funds. And trading revenues of $275 million, down 15% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting lower gains in
deferred compensation plans.
Net interest revenue increased 2% to $539 million, driven primarily by higher revenues from our bank deposit program
and continued growth in our lending product. Other revenue decreased to $62 million from $110 million. Net interest
expense was $2.9 billion, down 3% versus last quarter. The compensation ratio was 60%, up versus the fourth quarter,
due to seasonality.
Non-compensation expense was $762 million, down 13% versus last quarter, due to the absence of an impairment
charge as well as continued expense discipline.
The PBT margin was 19%. Profit before tax was $691 million. Total client assets surpassed $1.9 trillion. Global
fee-based asset flows were $19 billion, a record level. Fee-based assets under management increased to a record $724
billion at quarter end, representing 37% of client assets.
Global representatives were 16,426, essentially flat to the fourth quarter. Bank deposits were $132 billion, down $1.6
billion versus the fourth quarter, approximately $108 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks. We continued to grow
our Wealth Management lending balances and increase our penetration rates with our retail client base. Our mortgage
balances increased 10%, and our PLA balances increased 9%, our committed undrawn PLA facilities grew at an even
more rapid pace.
Investment Management revenues of $740 million were down 12% from the fourth quarter. In Traditional Asset
Management, revenues of $437 million were up 2% from the fourth quarter, driven by higher market levels and client
flows. In real estate investing, revenues of $131 million were down 18%, driven by lower investment gains. Merchant
Banking revenues were $172 million, down 32%, driven by a tough comparison to very strong investment gains in the
fourth quarter.
Expenses were $477 million, down 6% from the fourth quarter, due to declines in compensation and non-compensation
expenses. Profit before tax was $263 million, down 22% sequentially. NCI was $54 million versus $46 million last
quarter. Total assets under management increased to $382 billion, driven by market appreciation and increased flow.
Turning to our outlook. As we begin the second quarter, our Investment Banking pipeline is strong across all products.
M&A is particularly robust. The pipeline is growing, with an increase in activity from EMEA and Asia. On the
financing side, the flow is healthy for both equity and fixed income underwriting.
With respect to Sales and Trading, overall economic and market conditions continue to be favorable for equities.
However, the challenges that weighed on certain parts of Fixed Income markets for much of the quarter persist. On the
retail side, trading activity is consistent with levels we saw in the first quarter, though we entered the quarter with a
tailwind from higher equity markets. In addition, we continue to have momentum with FA adoption and client
penetration is increasing, an important driver of growth, profitability, and increased earnings consistency.
Over the last several years, we have assiduously worked to reposition our businesses in a way that is aligned with
regulatory change. We have made the tough decisions, provided metrics to demonstrate our progress, and have a suite
of businesses that are complementary. Thank you for listening, and James and I will now take your questions.

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello. So I have a couple-parter on commodities first. Just if you could frame how much of a
contributor it was to FICC in the quarter, whether it'd be relative to last year or prior peaks, obviously something went
very well there.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, there were a number of important factors in the overall FICC performance, strength in
commodities clearly being a big driver, given volatility in the market, due to weather and robust client activity, but as I
noted, we also have strength in credit corporates and mortgages and those continue to be strong areas for us. So, overall
it was up meaningfully. It was the biggest driver in year-over-year performance.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. And I don't know if there's anything you can update us on, there's, one of the
competitors sold a piece of their physical business, you guys have been contemplating that. A, if there's an update on
that and B, in the quarter, how much of a contributor was that, just for the thought process on the go forward?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Sure. Yeah. To try and help you size it, if you exclude the two physical oil businesses that we're
selling, overall fixed income was up slightly year-over-year on a percentage basis. So, it's still up excluding the two
physical oil businesses. And then in terms of, where we stand on those, we're continuing to work on the sale of
TransMontaigne we'll give you an update when we have something more to say on that.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. That's cool. You also mentioned, and we could see it in the numbers, prime brokerage
is doing awesome and curious, on how you weigh that business doing as good as it's doing with the fact that you still
have the lowest leverage ratio in the group and has some work to do? So I heard your comments on what you can do in
[ph] de-risked (19:08) land but is there any pricing benefit that you can pass through on prime brokerage? Just curious
how you balance that.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, I think there are really two different points within your question. Prime brokerage is a gem
franchise for us. We've spent a lot of time talking about how we manage our business across nine boxes, product on the
one hand, cash derivatives and PB and geography on the other hand, Americas, Europe, and Asia, and we manage
really intently within each box, but over many quarters, I've talked about the importance of adjacencies, in particular
with our PB clients. The deeper we go with them, the deeper they go across our franchise so we think we have a very
positive, strong, mutually productive relationship with our PB clients, and that's an important franchise for us.
If I switch to the leverage part of your question, in our view, we have a very strong, clear path to improve our leverage
ratio, and it is consistent with the business strategy we've talked about, the real levers are things that go to things like
compression trades, or RWA rundown and FICC. So that's a very different answer. It doesn't affect what we're talking
about here on the PB franchise side.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Cool. I appreciate that last one. Without opening too many cans of worms here, I
wanted to get your thoughts on all the focus on high frequency and what it means for your equity business, how can
you help us frame that? That would be super helpful.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Sure. You know, since 2009, Morgan Stanley has been very vocal with regulators and it has been
on the record about the necessity for changes to market structure to protect clients. We've advocated for increased
transparency and trading protocol. You can see that in docs we filed with regulators as far back as 2009. They are all in
the public domain. So we welcome ongoing enhancement to equity market structure. We think we've been a real
leading voice in this area for a long time. And in fact, we've implemented protocol and governance consistent with this
in our business.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: And then maybe just to be annoying, the book mentions like a really big number for
speedway, and I think it is, controls a lot of volume. I don't know if you want to help us with what's the real number in
terms of contribution or size that.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, just to clarify, what it is, it's an execution tool in our electronic trading tool kit. It's consistent
with offerings across the street. We make it available to all our clients, many of whom you're familiar with. And the
key to us in all that we do is risk management. Risk management checks out latency, and latency is inconsistent with
extreme speed strategies. And also to clear up any source of confusion, it facilitates connectivity only to lit exchanges

around the world, it doesn't connect to any dark pool anywhere. And overall HFTs are not a meaningful driver of our
business.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. That's good for me. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted – I noticed that the capital allocated to the institutional
business came down by about a billion and a half linked quarter. Is that directly related to RWA reductions that you
would have had in the fixed income business? Or is it more complicated than that? And if it is, maybe you can explain
to us what's driving it?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Sure. It is more complicated than that, but we did have a further reduction in risk-weighted assets in
fixed income. They are, in fact, down to $199 billion as of the first quarter, down from $210 billion in the fourth
quarter. So continuing to make progress there.
The way we calculate required capital is based on whatever the capital regime is in place at a point in time, and this
quarter, as a result of the regime change, in particular with the Basel I numerator moving to the transitional Basel III
numerator, that drove the capital reallocation. You know, the Basel III transitional numerator, by definition, has
deductions that phase in over time. So in managing the business, we look towards the Basel III fully phased in lens so,
this is, it's a lot of, there are a couple of moving pieces. Yes, we reduced the risk-weighted assets, but the biggest driver
here at the table is the regime change.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And if I can just relate the comment that you made about the increase in the old-style
SLR in the quarter which I think you alluded to about 30 basis points.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Correct.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: How does that relate to the target that you laid out back in January for a 30 basis point to 40
basis point increase just from exposure compression and the like? Is that being driven by that or were there other puts
and takes?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So there were a number of drivers, as I said, we're still very comfortable greater than 5% in 2015
and with increasing returns of capital. This quarter in the numerator, we benefited from higher earnings, and as we
talked about in prior calls, that has what I keep calling a multiplier effect because it reduces the deductions on DTAs,
and importantly it also increases the investment capacity for those items that get into that 10% bucket, thereby reducing
the numerator deduction.
In addition to that we have been quite focused on mitigating some of the numerator deductions, so you're seeing the
benefit of that beginning to flow through, and then, in the denominator, of course we're continuing with compression
trades and RWA reductions, as I indicated.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And then just to beat a little bit the on the SLR horse, there has been a proposal made
just in the month of March by Basel, people assigned different acronyms to it, but I've heard CCAR, which would be a
standardized approach to counter-party credit, which I've heard broadly could be a plus as well, and I was wondering if
you had done any numbers on that preliminarily?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah. That, if CCAR is adopted, that would be about a 50 basis point benefit to the SLR and a 30
basis point benefit to the standardized ratio.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Wow. So it's quite meaningful.
<A - Ruth Porat>: It is.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And you're calling it CCAR? Is that like a patented Morgan Stanley term?
<A - Ruth Porat>: You can use it if you want.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Thanks. I guess the only other question that I would really have would be if you
could, we talked a little bit about commodities and the fact that Fixed Income would still have been up or FICC would
still have been up year-over-year even with the planned sales having taken place. Can you give us a little bit more color
on what you saw in the rates business in the quarter? Because obviously for banks that have, that have a heavier
contribution from rates and from FX, so it's called the macro businesses, we saw, much, much weaker results so far.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, look, I think that we, and I said this, we saw, the same headwinds you've heard from others
with lower client activity. That was a tougher market, just given all that was going on in the environment. For our rates
business, it was, down year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes but up nicely versus last quarter. We are really focused
on this centralized federalized resource management across all of the macro product, but it has been, it was a tougher
part of the market.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. So mix was just one of the more important differentiators for you guys, I guess?
<A - Ruth Porat>: It was. As I said, it was commodities, it was credit, it was mortgage.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Right. Just one final question on Wealth Management, a 10% increase in the loan balances
linked quarter is obviously strategically what we want to see, but it is a very large percentage increase on what's
starting to be a fairly sizable business. How comfortable are you that that your risk controls are where they need to be
in what's obviously been a tough mortgage market?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So, the growth, again, we've got a couple of things going for us. One is very low penetration with a
very large client base. We're meaningfully under-penetrated versus our peers and we've been slow to build this product
precisely for the reason you flagged which is top of our list, which is ensuring tight, proper credit risk management and
all of the processes around it, as well as ensuring that it's a good experience for our clients and our financial advisors
so, it's up a nice percentage. I would say the other thing that's benefiting that is it's up a nice percentage off of a small
number, and we're continuing to see good growth in the mortgage side, given this low penetration. We're finding that
FAs that use the product are using it longer and increasing their penetration. The credit standards are very tight, FICO,
above 750, LTV 60%, and, again, it's with our client base, so we know the clients, we have their assets here.
And the other growth area in PLA is a very, is a highly overcollateralized, significantly overcollateralized product, as I
think you know, it's securities-based lending. And again, it's all with our existing client base. There's virtually no credit
losses to date and risk management has been the driver across all of these businesses.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So, one, just real quick, want to clarify, I believe, Ruth, you said that your IB backlog is up.
Just want to make sure, is that based on year end? Because Goldman highlighted that their IB backlog actually shrunk
since year end.

the pipeline continues to build. I think you can see that just from the flurry of announcements that have occurred since
quarter end.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Yeah. No, it's great. It's just good to see continued momentum there. And then another one,
the CCAR was sort of a surprise here to some firms this year, and I guess the Fed highlighted some process
improvements in their comments. Do you guys have any outstanding process improvements with the Fed? And was
there anything in that CCAR process that sort of jumped out that investors should be aware of?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So I think the whole industry, is awaiting kind of the formal Fed feedback process, but I think
we've generally received positive feedback about our processes. As James said in his opening comments, we've
invested meaningfully in the process, and for the last several years we have something we call our CIP program,
continuous improvement program, so regardless of what we even hear back, we look to up the approach and the
analytics each year, and that process hasn't stopped. We continue to raise the bar for ourselves on the overall process.
We feel good about our processes around CCAR.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Terrific. And is it your view that the Fed feels good about your processes as well? I
understand you can't – based on the information you receive from the Fed, is that your perception?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Brennan, I don't think we want to get into business of trying to explain what the Fed's
view is or isn't. All that matters to us is we put in for a buyback and dividend and they're approved and we're continuing
down the path that we laid out.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Appreciate it. Just trying to maybe get some insights into what is proving to be a very murky
process for all of us on this end.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Understood.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Yeah. And then is it right that you guys have slimmed down your management structure in
Wealth Management? I think we saw a reduction in the number of divisions and regions. And maybe could you help us
think about whether that's driven by potential expense benefits or whether that's done to slim down, decision making
and the like or maybe help us understand that move a little bit.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I think it's probably what I would describe as the last gasp post the integration. This
has been a four-year integration, and now that the business is very stable, I think the FA head count was flat to maybe
modestly up. The new leadership under Shelley O'Connor determined that she could make some changes there to just
make the organization faster moving, a little more nimble, a little more efficient, and put the team in place to make that
happen.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Great. Thanks a lot for taking the questions.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: No problem.

around that? What are the prime brokerage revenues this quarter versus a year or two ago? Or can you give us some
market share figures around your prime brokerage business?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well as you know, we don't break out components within businesses. The client balances and
revenues are all up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.

leaving Morgan Stanley and then they've come back. Have you gotten back to pre-crisis levels? Do you expect to get

back there?
<A - Ruth Porat>: These are the highest balances that we've had since the crisis. We've continued to nicely, steadily
build.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Okay. And shifting over to Wealth Management, you're redeploying the deposits. What are
the yields and margin that you're getting as you deploy those deposits?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So last quarter in the deck we laid out a couple of things because we thought it was important as
everyone is doing their analysis, so we'd show you what the asset growth would be and the changing mix over time as
we moved from cash into AFS and loan deployment and included yields there, current yields, and then if you just
follow the forward yield curve. And those really haven't – we're getting the benefit of the improving mix but yield by
product hasn't really changed much, as you can see with the rate environment. But really the upside to us is the ongoing
deployment across the portfolio.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Separately, I'm looking at your deck from January where you said you wanted to drive ROE
above 10% in Fixed Income and Commodities. Did you exceed that in the first quarter and how is that progressing?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well we've certainly have progress because you can see the revenues, and I just provided the
RWAs, so we've had higher revenues, reduced RWAs now down to $199 billion. That's relative to the $210 billion last
quarter and to about $250 billion-ish last year. So we're certainly getting better returns in that business and our view is
that we have more to do there. As we said when we look at ROE and we're managing to ROE in that business, it's about
revenues, expenses and capital optimization, and the team is continuing to focus on all of those.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Can you give us any update on the run off of legacy assets in FICC?
<A - Ruth Porat>: I think you sort of get that, Mike, in the RWA rundown. So, the, that's a combination of passive and
active, and part of the active is how trades are structured and part of it is actually running down as much as we can, as
rapidly as we can, and so if you go back to third quarter of 2011, we had $390 billion of risk-weighted assets in our
fixed income business, and as you know, we keep bringing forward our target and time, we brought forward that $180
billion from 2016 to 2015 and what that really captures is your question, we're running down those legacy assets as
rapidly as we can. We are pleased to have that deadweight capital pushed out of the business.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: And then my last question, your ROE target is for a 9% ROE and this quarter you're still
below that. Can you either reaffirm or give us a timeframe when you think you'll achieve your ROE target? And I'm not
saying a return on tangible common equity, if you can give that to us too?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Right. So on the, obviously our ROE, we're looking at an ROE in excess of cost-to-capital, we're
talking about a 10% ROE, I appreciate you're looking at the building blocks we provided last quarter. We did see
progress across our businesses, and our view is that the upside continues to come from the bank, it's in its early days,
and given the opportunity with the bank and moving again from overweighted and cash to deployment into loans as
well as AFS, there's a real benefit there. The continued focus on expense management, and then the ongoing higher
returns to capital, that 9% number is obviously without higher capital returns. We're pleased to have doubled our
dividend, doubled our share repurchase program and, as James said, our intent is to continue increasing return to capital
over time.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: So just to be clear so now your target – since you've been – since you're able to return capital
now, your target is now 10% return on common equity?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Our target has consistently been 10%. When we tried to break out last quarter was what it would be
without return, higher return to capital, and then the return to capital takes it above and beyond that, but we've been
continued to be focus on 10% return on capital is kind of the next stop along the way.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Okay. And this quarter return on tangible common equity was what?
<A - Ruth Porat>: 9 point, 9.3.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: I wanted to discuss your 10% FICC ROE target for a moment. Clearly the progress you've
made mitigating RWA, it has been nothing short of extraordinary which has driven required capital levels down pretty
meaningfully. What I'm wondering is given the tough treatment for derivatives under the modified SLR approach, even
when we contemplate some of the future benefits from various forms of mitigation, whether it is CDS maturity
matching, SA-CCR model approval et cetera, it appears that required capital for FICC under the modified SLR
calculation could still be pretty materially above that under the risk-based framework, so essentially I just wanted to
clarify that the 10% FICC ROE target which you've highlighted in the past is still achievable? Whether one evaluates
under a leverage or risk-based lens?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes. And we look at our businesses under risk-based and leverage-based capital lens now. It's the
current leverage-based capital rule, but again we have the added lens of what's at the SLR and business unit leaders,
have their balance sheet under that SLR lens, and that's helping really put a spotlight on the opportunities for mitigation
in the areas where mitigation is absolutely key. So as you pointed out in your question, there are additional work
streams that can be added to that which we discussed last quarter with the inclusion now of net long CDS sold, that
opens up an added work stream. And so we do see a good path forward to greater than 5% under the SLR, including
higher return to capital, and yes, we hold ourselves accountable for that greater of risk-based capital and leverage-based
capital.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Thanks. That's really helpful. And one of the things I wanted to, I guess, inquire about
was the Fed had clearly stated its plan to consider applying additional capital surcharges on wholesale borrowings. The
details that have been disclosed thus far regarding the methodology or the potential approach remains somewhat
murky, but I wanted to see if you had any additional thoughts or insights regarding, how that rule making could
potentially shape out.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So you're right, the rule is that the discussion at this point is unclear. I think the terms that have
been used such as short-term wholesale funding is one phrase. We talk a lot about the difference between short term
wholesale funding and durable funding, and we've invested quite meaningfully, as we've talked about on many calls, to
term out our secured book, and that's built in durability that has been evident in all sorts of periods of market stress,
market stress in Europe. And we think that liquidity durability is important. You know, our LCR, are well north of the
100% requirement in large part because of all that we've done, all that we've invested. It doesn't come for free. It's
expensive to term it out and get that durability. But we have a LCR that's higher than 100% for that reason.
And we're very supportive of the Federal Reserve's focus on CLAR, the mirror test of CCAR but focused on liquidity,
given all that we've done to build in what is a very durable approach to liquidity and funding. So I don't know which
way it goes because some terms are being used in a sort of broad way, but again given what we've done with our capital
stack, we feel that we've built in a lot of the durability that is what regulators are looking for.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And I guess one more question on the SLR proposal. Parsing out the language in the
Fed's document, it highlighted two key size criteria for identifying systemically important banks, one being GAAP

assets in excess of $700 billion and AUC in excess of $10 trillion. And based on your interpretation of the Fed
proposal, do you believe that the [ph] GSIV (42:02) classification can potentially be avoided for those banks which
operate below those designated thresholds? And specifically, would you consider optimizing your balance sheet size if
it enabled you to potentially bypass a tougher 5% leverage rule or is that simply not a viable strategic option given
growth initiatives at the bank and other potential opportunities that will drive future balance sheet growth?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well given our suite of businesses and the strength of these businesses, we don't see going below
$700 billion as practical. In particular, we see the opportunity to mitigate a number of the items, as I've already
discussed, both the gross up and the denominator and reduce some of the deductions in the numerator which are
accretive to the SLR. You know, if you look at some of the relationship across our various businesses, so for example
as I've talked about on prior calls, within our Investment Banking franchise, quarter after quarter after quarter we've
had about $500 million of Fixed Income underwriting, and that's a service that our clients want, it's accretive to the
overall relationship, it's accretive to the bottom line for the firm, and it does require that we have a corporate credit
capability, origination and distribution.
And so there are a lot of linkages between the businesses, increasingly so with the Wealth Management business, and
our view is that when we look to the single most important thing, which is how do we drive ROE for this firm, given
there's a path to increase the SLR that enables us to keep this suite of products as we've defined them and as we've
reshaped what we're doing in Fixed Income, our judgment is that the best way to drive ROE is with this suite of
products, and which don't see how that would take us lower than $700 billion of assets.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Understood. And just one final one on the numerator upside you had discussed
regarding the SLR. We really appreciate the helpful detail in terms of the individual components that you just
aggregated driving the 80-basis point build in the SLR over toward that 5% goal. I was hoping you could at least clarify
the level of incremental preferred issuance that's assumed to help close that gap just to get some clarity on those which
will impact future earnings versus those which will have essentially be earnings neutral.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Sure. So as you saw, we did about $2 billion of preferred last year. That was in two transactions.
We will continue to optimize our capital stack and do think that preferred plays a valuable role in that. So we're going
to continue to leg into more over time. I think when you – the two that we did last year you can see that we tried to size
them modestly size them appropriately size them, whatever word you want to use for it, we'll continue to leg into more
over time. And so that is another addition to the numerator. I would say that what we're quite pleased about is the pace
with which we've been able to mitigate a number of those numerator deductions and that investment basket has within
it a couple of opportunities to continue to mitigate some of the numerator drags.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. That's great. Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on a strong quarter.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Can you update us on the expense efforts? Obviously good revenue this quarter so
expenses were higher, but it sounded like in the past that there's still some opportunities within FICC to manage the
expense base, and I was hoping for an update either on FICC expenses or just overall expenses.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So we're very much on track for the expense target ratio that we laid out at the end of 2012, going
into 2013. And just as a reminder, at the time we had an 84% expense ratio and with the $1.6 billion reduction,

assuming revenue is constant so you don't have to adjust for the noise around activity-based revenues, we said we
would get to a 79% expense ratio, excluding elevated legal expenses and if there were any write offs, any write-offs,
and that would be by the end of 2014. This quarter we're at a 75% expense ratio, excluding DVA, and so I think what
that underscores is expenses very much part of the DNA of all of our business leaders, we have the balance of the year
to continue focusing on expense reduction, but it's built into programs across all of the various businesses and we're
constantly looking for ways to add to the program. It doesn't end this year. It keeps going. It's just business is usual at
this point. But we're pleased that we're at a 75% expense ratio relative to that 79%, with still more time to get to the end
of the year when we said we would hit that number.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And if the revenue environment proves a little bit tougher from here in say the
markets businesses, do you feel like you can still maintain the expense ratio around here or still look back towards the
79% goal?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, so what we indicated was that we would be at a 79% – back at the end of 2012 when we laid
out the $1.6 billion, we said a 79% expense ratio, assuming revenues were flat to 2012, and again depending on where
the world goes, I think what we've evidenced over the last many years here is that we don't stand still, but we're pleased
with the way we're starting off the year.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then outside of kind of the core expenses, it didn't seem like there was any
unusual litigation this quarter. I know it's really hard to tell looking forward, but any thoughts on how we should be
modeling out litigation expense from here?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well you sort of answered the question. It is lumpy, as you've seen. Our view is that litigation does
remain a headwind for the industry. We're pleased to have FHFA behind us, but legal can be lumpy as you've seen.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just switching to the Wealth Management, the 19% PBT was in line
with what we had had for this quarter, just any updates on how you feel about the 22% to 25% target by the end of next
year?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We still feel very good about that, and I'll hold that as something that we are looking to deliver.
And as you know, that doesn't assume any benefit from rates in the environment. We've got a number of factors that are
taking that higher. I think one of the important ones really is what we're continuing to do with lending product and the
benefit from the growth in lending, and you can see the ongoing momentum there. And what we're pleased about is that
we've always said we have a bit of a tailwind given we're underpenetrated with our clients, and what we're seeing is as
FAs start working with their clients with lending product, they continue to further penetrate their client base and we see
much more of a take up. So that is an important element of it, along with, back to your prior question, the continued
focus on expense management.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe a follow-up on the Wealth Management
business. You mentioned some seasonality in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, I think fewer days. Maybe just
a little color on the comp. Matt just asked about the margin, but how that impacts it and just the outlook as we kind of
go throughout the year, just assuming less seasonality?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So as you said, seasonality comes from a couple of things. One is several fewer trading days
relative to the fourth quarter. There's also seasonality on the comp line because FICA is a first quarter event, so when
we compare our 19% quarter this year to our 17% quarter last year, that's really isolating the difference in quarterly
seasonality and a nice pickup from the 17% last year to the 19% this year.

What we also saw in the first quarter this year was some lower issuance activity, in particular in closed-end funds, and
what's most – of greatest interest within the Wealth Management system is U.S. new-issue product and in particular,
closed-end fund, and that was just a bit lower. We had a nice underwriting calendar but it was more skewed outside of
the U.S. and very little closed-end fund activity. So as we're looking forward to the second quarter, we have a couple of
tailwinds going into the second quarter. Asset management fees will be modestly higher, given the starting S&P level,
and we're clearly focused on the transaction volume which is a function of the environment and the new-issue calendar.
But the pipeline is stronger in the U.S. It's clearly too early to tell, but it's stronger in the U.S. And then in aggregate
expenses should a bit lower given the comp point I made, FICA being a first quarter event, and non-comps do tend to
be a little bit higher in the second quarter, but overall should result in an improved margin here.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, just on the trading side, whether it's on
equities or fixed income, anything like lumpy this quarter? And then any color, I know it's still early, but on the fixed
income side in terms of the OTC markets transitioning onto SEFs? Like any color there? Thanks.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So, as you know, as it relates, nothing really lumpy to note. I mean, we had, there was a good
volume of activity, prime brokerage activity with portfolio rebalancing, just given volatility in equity markets. And
then in terms of, the impact of SEFs on the market, we really think the lower volumes last quarter were related to
broader market events, and, in particular, lower volumes in macro as I've already commented on, given all that was
going on globally and markets lack conviction, they traded in the tight range, spread product did better but macro was
weaker, and we think it's very tough to disaggregate the extent to which, if at all, that was really SEF related. We think
that it was swamped by what was going on in macro.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hi. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the expense question. I just want to check, if
you think about your closest competitor on an apples-to-apples basis, they're at around a 70% expense ratio, you guys
are 75% in the strongest quarter, target of 79%. Do you think this is an interim target and you can get more as you
move forward as revenues get better and/or you still have some more expense leverage elsewhere? Can you just kind of
walk through that?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, I obviously can't comment on any other peers, and we each have different business mixes.
You know, I'm often asked the question about our comp ratio as an example, and the comp ratio within Wealth
Management is off of a formulaic grid so it starts higher than say our institutional securities business. And is it trending
lower? Yes, it is absolutely is trending lower. We've talked about that quite a bit. It will continue to benefit from the
growth in lending product. But you've got some real apples to oranges comparisons if you just start with that line.
As it relates to our non-comp expenses we're continuing to see benefit across the franchise, the ability to use
technology more broadly across the franchise, as an example. And so we are focused on the items that we identified
internally as part of the 2014 plan. As I said, we're continuing to add to it because it's part of the DNA within all of the
business unit leaders to look for opportunities to be efficient, whether it's working across divisions or in any other
approach to the business. But I would just, going back to my comp differential, say part of it is also business mix.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay.
<A - Ruth Porat>: And to be clear, those business mixes also have different capital requirements, so there are a whole
host of different elements that go along with it, so when we talk about ROE it's revenue, expenses and capital.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Fair enough. I was just talking about the institutional business, but I hear your point. Maybe
just quickly another question on the dividend. I think James had mentioned looking at a payout that would approximate
or get close to the net income of the Wealth Management business, but as that business gross, it seems like you would
start to, if you were to approach that level of dividend payout, you would exceed sort of the 30% soft cap of the Fed, do

you think that is doable?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I think, you know I don't want to get into who, sort of hard projections, but what we're
indicating is that with our business mix now with half the firms business essentially coming from a relatively stable
annuitized set of businesses in wealth and asset management, one thinks about your dividend payout a little bit
differently as it relates to your ability to afford it coming from things that you know are fairly predictable. Obviously
when you aggregate it all, you come up against what appropriate payout levels are at a regulator level and that's a
different question. We're indicating we believe we have capacity given our business mix.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then one last quickie. On the physical oil sale, you mentioned
sort of – or gave a guide on the revenue impact. What would be the net income impact? I assume it's a lot smaller?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well in terms of the businesses that we are looking to sell, as I indicated last quarter, one of the
things that was quite intriguing was precisely that is the more modest PBT and we're reducing risk-weighted assets
pretty meaningfully.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: So it's ROE accretive?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah, and that's obviously over time. You have to transition these things.

Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Hey. Good morning. How are you?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: I just have a couple of follow-ups on Investment Banking. So I guess first with respect to M&A
announced activity in North America has actually recovered to the strongest levels since the year 2007, but you guys
have been noting on the last couple of calls here that EMEA more recently has been feeling better. So I just wanted to
get some thoughts, does it feel like we're still in a distress asset sales cycle in Europe or are you starting to see I more
traditional strategic M&A accelerating there, which I think would be necessary to see a real recovery in activity in that
region?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well we've seen some broadening across industries of activity and what we still haven't seen is a
real growth in the number of deals, but if you look at the dollar volume in EMEA, it's up and the acquire activity out of
EMEA cross-border activity is up. So again, it's early days but what's very positive is whenever a negative trend
reverses itself and comparable to GDP growth in EMEA is still modest, but it's gone from negative to positive, and
we're starting to see the knock on benefit to some of the activity levels.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: And I would just add the largest economy and the economy that's doing best over there
is Germany, and having made a couple of trips recently, I think the corporate CEO's are still quite conservative in their
views. So there will be a tipping point here. Obviously with what's going on with Russia and the Ukraine, that's putting
a dampener particularly on the German CEO view until we get better clarity there. But I think there will be a tipping
point. We're not there yet. There have been isolated transactions across the U.K., Spain and other places.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Great. Appreciate that color. And then Fixed Income underwriting results have obviously also
remained really resilient and I know it's still an attractive rate environment, but are you starting to see a mix shift there
at all in terms of what products are really driving the strength? Has there been any change in mix?
<A - Ruth Porat>: There has in the sense that it has been a much more of a refinancing story and now we're starting to
see the benefit of the higher levels of M&A. In the first quarter, I think what was notable is there were a lot of deals
across investment grade high yield leverage loans. It wasn't as though there were some really big chunky items that

drove the quarter. It was a balance across the various products, and but what you're starting to see is much more of this
is event related and we think given the pipeline in M&A that bodes well for continuation of strong debt underwriting,
notwithstanding the fact that we've had a long string here of strong quarters of debt underwriting.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Mm-hmm. Okay. And I guess with respect to how that ties in with FICC results, you know,
there was a flurry of activity, corporate issuance in March, so I'm just trying to get a better understanding around the
results, the strong results within credit and maybe how much of that was a function of issuance really starting to pick up
towards the tail end of the quarter. Just any color around maybe how credit specifically progressed throughout the first
quarter.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Credit was on the Fixed Income side was pretty consistent throughout the quarter. I think if you go
back a couple of quarters ago when there was more volatility in credit markets, what you saw was notwithstanding a
strong new-issue calendar, it was pretty much buy and hold and you didn't see the follow through to secondary trading.
You're seeing more of that follow through to secondary trading now. And hopefully that continues in particular, given
the volume of what we would expect would continue to be new issue products on the Fixed Income side, assuming the
M&A pipeline continues to hold up and we see the execution continuing as it has these first couple of weeks in the
quarter.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Great. Thank you.
