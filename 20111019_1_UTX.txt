Gregory J. Hayes
Good. Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. So you guys saw in the press release this morning, another solid
quarter; 6% organic sales growth and orders generally in line with expectations despite an uneven macroeconomic
environment. Earnings per share were $1.47 in the quarter and that's up 13%, and free cash flow was robust at 132% of
net income.

There's a lot of uncertainty and things to worry about in the world economy, and things like continued high
unemployment in the U.S. and Europe, a weak U.S. housing sector, the banking crisis in Europe and the political
impasse in D.C. to name just a few. But importantly, order rates across most of our businesses remain generally in line
with our expectation for the year, sustained by continued strength in emerging markets and a resilient commercial
Aerospace aftermarket. The developed economies have certainly slowed a bit over the past few months and commercial
construction markets remain particularly weak in the U.S. and Europe. But the economies in China, India, and Brazil,
while slowing slightly, are still delivering growth rates well above developed economies.
Also, airline traffic continues to hold up and capacity discipline is expected to result in another profitable year for the
airlines. In addition, Boeing and Airbus, holding large backlogs, have both announced increases in their build rates
buoyed by emerging market demand and replacement of older, less fuel-efficient fleets. So uncertainty, clearly, but
we've operated in this kind of uneven and uncertain economic environment before and we know how to respond.
With the slower macro growth outlook, we're taking preemptive steps to position the business to grow earnings next
year by taking out even more costs as we – even as we continue to invest in growth areas and in bringing new
technologies to market. So we're increasing our restructuring estimate this year from $200 million previously to $300
million plus, while keeping to our commitment of restructuring equal to one-time items for the year.
We still see sales for this year around $58 billion, that's up around 7% from 2010 and with better than expected third
quarter results and only one quarter to go, we're once again increasing our EPS guidance. We now expect 2011 EPS to
be up 15% to $5.47 a share, that's up from our previous guidance of $5.35 to $5.45. The higher EPS outlook reflects
benefits from lower interest costs, lower taxes, and higher profits at Sikorsky partially offset by lower profit
expectations at Fire & Security and around $0.05 of deal costs relating to the pending Goodrich acquisition.
On Slide 2 now, turning to third quarter results, as I mentioned sales grew organically at 6%. Carrier had another strong
quarter with 9% organic growth driven largely by continued strength in the Transicold business and growth in
emerging markets. And Sikorski grew 21% organically with higher aftermarket sales and more military aircraft
shipments.
Earnings per share were $1.47, that's up 13%. Restructuring expenses of $0.06 in the quarter were partially offset by
$0.04 of net positive one-time items. In comparison restructuring and one-time items in last year's third quarter was a
charge of $0.09. So excluding restructuring and one-time items in both third quarters, earnings per share increased this
year by 7%. Lastly FX was a benefit of about $0.04 in the quarter.
Now just the usual reminder that we're going to talk to our segment results, excluding restructuring and one-time items,
and on that basis, the segment operating margins of 16.3% in the quarter was 10 basis points lower than last year. This
benefit is from cost reduction and operating leverage from higher sales across the businesses were more than offset by
higher E&D investments. E&D was higher by $62 million versus last year's third quarter. All of that increase was Pratt
& Whitney as they continue to develop four separate gear turbo fan platforms.
As I mentioned earlier, free cash flow in the quarter was 132% of net income. That's great performance even as we
contributed $156 million in cash to our domestic pension plans. In addition, we also contributed $450 million of stock
to the plans this past quarter. Even at the current low interest rates, our domestic pension plans are now nearly 90%
funded, and we don't see the need to make additional contributions to our domestic pension plans through at least the
end of next year. With year-to-date free cash flow at 109% of net income, we now expect free cash flow for the full
year to exceed net income.
We spent $675 million on share repurchase in the quarter, and this concludes our share buy-back for the year with a
total spend at $2.2 billion. You'll recall that we decided to suspend share buy-back for the next 12 months as a result of
the Goodrich transaction.
Okay. Slide 3. As you can see from these order trends, order trends are generally in line with expectations with the
exception of some weakness at Fire & Security. Commercial Aerospace aftermarket remains solid with Pratt &
Whitney's large commercial engine spare orders up 3% for the quarter, and that's on top of 35% growth in last year's
third quarter.

Hamilton Sunstrand commercial spares orders were up 24%. That's after 13% growth last year. Carrier's U.S.
residential HVAC orders increased mid single digits in the quarter. However, we did see a shift in consumer buying
patterns with more and more customers opting for lower-featured, lower-efficiency products. At Otis, new equipment
orders were up 12% at constant currency, driven by emerging market growth, and we continue to see strong growth in
the emerging markets with the combined BRIC orders for the commercial businesses up a strong 23% this quarter.
So despite a slowing world economy, we saw another good quarter with strong organic sales growth, solid earnings
growth and robust cash flows, all while we continue to invest in these game-changing technologies. I'll come back in a
minute to talk about the remainder of '11 and our outlook for 2012.
But for now, let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the business unit in detail.
Akhil Johri
Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 4. At Otis, both sales and profits in the third quarter grew by 12% with operating
margin of 23.7%, in line with the prior year. Foreign currency accounted for approximately eight points of profit
growth and seven points of sales growth. New equipment sales in the quarter were up 9% at constant currency led by
strong growth in China and Russia. Service sales were also up, with continued growth in contractual maintenance and
repair.
The positive impact in operating profit from higher sales volume and some real estate gains was partially offset by new
equipment pricing and commodity headwind. As Greg said, new equipment orders increased 12% at constant currency
with continued strong growth in emerging markets, led by China. Their orders were up over 30%. Orders in North
America were flat and were down low single digit in Europe. Otis closed the quarter with a strong new equipment
backlog, up 9% versus prior year at constant currency. We remain confident in full year profit growth of about $225
million at Otis on high single digit sales growth.
On Slide 5, Carrier profits increased 13% on 8% higher sales. Organic sales growth was 9%. As expected, Transicold's
first half organic growth rate of about 50% has moderated to high teens. Similar to the second quarter, North America
residential shipments were mixed with split system units up mid-teens, and gas furnaces down mid single digit. Profit
growth was driven by solid conversion on volume and continued good performance in our joint ventures, partially
offset by commodity headwind.
Carrier posted a record Q3 operating margin of 12.7% even as we saw a significant movement in the U.S. residential
business towards low-margin, entry-level units. Carrier remains on track with our prior guidance of profit growth of
about $325 million on 10% organic sales growth.
UTC Fire & Security delivered profit growth of 8% in the quarter on 5% higher sales. Organic sales were up 2%.
Product businesses were up high single digit, and service and install businesses were down low single digit due to
continuing softness in the U.K. and Americas businesses. Third quarter orders were flat year over year organically.
Backlog continues to be strong and is up approximately 15% organically both year over year and from the beginning of
the year.
Operating profit in the quarter grew 3% at constant currency. Benefits from higher overall volumes and a favorable
litigation resolution were partially offset by continuing productivity challenges and a very soft market in the U.K. With
the slowdown in the order rates and continuing productivity issues, we now expect full year sales at Fire & Security to
be up mid single digits on 3% organic growth and operating profit to be up approximately $100 million instead of $150
million.
Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up slightly from the third quarter last year. Sales from
higher aftermarket and increased large commercial engine deliveries were partially offset as expected by fewer military
engine deliveries, lower Rocketdyne and Power System sales, and unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. Large
commercial engine spare sales were up about 10%.

Operating profit in the quarter was down 11%. The benefits from net higher sales were more than offset by high E&D
and unfavorable currency at Pratt Canada. Restructuring savings offset higher pension costs. Excluding E&D, operating
margin was about flat. We continue to expect Pratt's full-year operating profit to be down around $100 million as we
continue to invest in next generation product platforms.
Hamilton Sunstrand posted another solid quarter with profit growth of 11% on 8% higher sales. Sales growth continues
to be led by the aerospace, aftermarket and industrials businesses. Notably, commercial spares were up more than 30%
versus last year. Areo OEM sales were flattish as commercial aero growth was offset by lower space and defense
volumes.
Profit growth in the quarter reflects the benefit of higher aftermarket and industrial sales and lower E&D, partially
offset by lower military vehicle sales and higher new program warranty costs. Operating margin was up 60 basis points
year-over-year to 18.7%. As Greg said, commercial space orders increased 24% year-over-year with book to bill
slightly above 1. Industrial orders were up about 10% at constant currency. Based on Hamilton Sunstrand's strong
year-to-date performance, we now expect operating profit for the full year to be up more than $100 million on high
single digit sales growth.
Turning to Sikorski on Slide 9. Operating profit increased 34% on 21% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorski
shipped a total of 73 large aircraft, nine more than the third quarter of 2010. 66 aircraft were based on military
platforms and seven commercial. There were no deliveries of Canadian maritime helicopters in the third quarter. The
contract requirement is for four additional aircraft in the fourth quarter, but customer discussions indicate that need may
be only for two or three more. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by higher international military aircraft deliveries
and increased aftermarket volumes.
Solid conversion on net higher sales resulted in margin expansion of 110 basis points to 12.1%. Of note during the
quarter, Sikorski delivered three S-70 I aircraft to it's launch customer in the Middle East. These deliveries mark the
first for Sikorski's international variant of the BLACK HAWK. For the full year at Sikorski, we now expect profit
growth of approximately $125 million on sales growth of high single digits.
With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thanks, Akhil. So it was another good quarter, strong organic sales growth, earnings growth, and cash flow, all
of that in the face of a slowing world-wide economy. We're very confident in our increased EPS guidance of $5.47 on
$58 billion of sales for the year. That's up 15% earnings on 7% sales growth. That's the kind of performance you've
come to expect from UTC.
As you know, we've announced some transformational news, recently. First of all, of course, the largest acquisition in
our history, in fact one of the largest Aerospace acquisitions ever, Goodrich Corporation. It's a strategic transition that
will boost UTC's position in the Aerospace system sector and will generate significant customer and shareowner value.
As you know, Goodrich products are complementary to UTC's and our combined technologies will provide more
intelligent, more electric, and integrated products that customers are increasingly looking for. Also, Goodrich has a
stable and strong aftermarket with higher content on newer platforms similar to Hamilton Sunstrand. We're bringing
together two great companies. As we said earlier, we expect this deal to close in mid 2012 and we would expect it will
be accretive to EPS in 2013.
Last week, I'm sure you all saw, we also announced agreements with Rolls Royce to acquire their share in the IAE joint
venture as well as to partner on future engines for mid-sized aircraft, most significantly utilizing geared turbo fan
technologies. When this transaction closes, we'll likely consolidate IAE which will results in incremental sales at Pratt
& Whitney in 2013 of over $1.5 billion representing the remaining two-thirds of IAE. We also expect an operating
profit benefit in 2013 of $75 million to $100 million which is largely Rolls Royce's 1/3 share of IAE's profits partially
offset by the amortization of intangibles. This deal will also streamline support for the A-320 family of engines, enable

a smoother transition of V-2500s to the GTF platform and provide significant long term benefits to Pratt & Whitney's
aftermarket business from the increasing installed base.
The new partnership agreement with Rolls Royce is further validation of the game-changing GTF technologies. In the
meantime, the GTF development programs at Pratt remain on track, meeting all of the key milestones and performance
benefits, on fuel efficiency, noise, and emissions.
Also, you probably saw, we announced two key organizational changes. These changes will allow us to continue to
drive growth and margin expansion on both the aerospace and commercial side of the business. Our seasoned
management team will build on the same agenda that made us successful, portfolio transformation, offering integrated
systems and solution to our customers, and continued cost reduction.
So we talked about our increased guidance this year and some transformational news, but I'm sure what most of you are
interested in, of course, is what about 2012? So let's look at 2012. This is on now Slide 11. As always, a lot of puts and
takes at this time of the year. The outlook for some of our end markets certainly feels weaker today than just a few
weeks back. And we're certainly looking at tighter DOD budgets, although longer term we will benefit from being on
the right platforms such as the JSF, the 53K and the BLACK HAWK programs. And international military markets still
offer significant opportunities despite the DOD budget cuts.
Yields on ten-year corporates have come down, of course that puts pressure on our pension expense. At a discount rate
of 5% we'll see around $0.15 of head wind next year. Not much we can do about interest rates, but we have done the
tough things in sun-setting the U.S. pension plan. So in a little time and a small rise in interest rates, this problem is
going to go away; it'll be in the rear-view mirror.
And we've talked in the past about E&D at Pratt peaking in 2012. That will be a headwind for us next year. Again,
more detail on that in December. Also assuming a mid-2012 close, the Goodrich transaction will be dilutive to earnings
next year by about $0.30 to $0.40 from financing and other deal costs, accounting conformity, amortization of
intangibles and restructuring costs. Of course we expect this deal to be solidly accretive in 2013 and beyond as we start
to realize the synergies and get some of the one-time costs behind us.
On FX, that remains a big unknown. Just within the past few weeks, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most
currencies. The euro, as you know, went from $1.45 in late August to $1.32 in early October and now it's back at $1.38.
Given this volatility, we'll make a call on FX rates for 2012 once we get closer to our outlook meeting in December.
And of course you all know the impact FX can have on UTC earnings, both positive and negative, but really too early
to make a call.
Of course, we know how to operate in uncertain times. Our increasing restructuring in 2011 and this will generate
additional savings in 2012 and our companies are better positioned than ever to grow earnings with a strong
aftermarket, significant presence in emerging market and high content in the growing commercial aerospace segment.
So in spite of all of the headwinds, the uncertain economic environment and the Goodrich-related dilution, we still
expect earnings growth in 2012. As is our normal practice, Louis will provide detailed guidance on 2012 at the
December 15 Investor Meeting in New York.
So, solid results year to date and we're confident on delivering on our increased outlook of $5.47 a share, 15% earnings
growth on 7% sales growth. We see a strong trend in emerging market orders even as developed markets have shown
signs of weakness recently. We've stepped up our cost reduction efforts and continue to drive margin expansion, not
just this year, but into 2012 and beyond. And as always, we're committed to grow earnings even in a difficult
environment. We have a seasoned management team and we're focused on what we can control, that's cost and
operational excellence.
So with that, let's stop and open up the call for questions. Giovanni?

[Operator Instructions] And first on the line we have David Strauss with UBS.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Greg, you talked about ratcheting up restructuring this year. Can you give us a sense, any
quantification of what kind of tail wind that would provide next year, not only the additional restructuring you're doing
this year, but also the benefit of 2009/2010 restructuring?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. So again, we're going to take up restructuring from $200 million to $300 million plus.
We've got some good news coming on the tax line that we see – we've got visibility to a gain on a disposition. So again,
restructuring equals gains for the year. I think that's first and foremost. As I think about next year, we're going to see at
least $200 million of tail wind from restructuring into 2011 – I'm sorry, into 2012. We're going to do some additional
restructuring at Sikorsky as we size the business for the – what's happening in the marketplace. I think as you're always
also looking along with Scott Buckhout at some additional reductions on the commercial side as they bring those two
businesses together. So there's lots of things to do and some of that is actually going to be good short-term payback.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And then as a follow up, again thinking about next year, I know FX is a moving target,
but I think for Pratt Canada that should be locked in at this point. Can you talk about the headwind there? And then
from a commodities standpoint, given the move in copper and steel, what kind of – what kind of tail wind that could
provide next year?
<A - Akhil Johri>: David, this is Akhil. For Pratt Canada, you're right, most of it is locked in. We expect about $50
million headwind next year as the Canadian dollar was still stronger against the U.S. dollar versus what we had hedged
before. On the commodities, we deliberately put it on a question mark column right now because the copper goes down
to close to $3 and wants to start to go back up. We'll see how it all shakes out and Louis will give greater guidance,
more detail in December.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think it's important to note, though, I mean commodities, we have seen pricing has stuck on
the Carrier side. We have moved prices up on Otis as well in response to some of these commodities. So for the year,
although it's still going to be a headwind of $150 million, I think we've got about, what, 50% of our copper locked in
for next year already? So again I think as the prices that Carrier announced, they take effect October 1. Those stick. It
shouldn't be a huge headwind.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And last one on the interest expense line, you had talked about first it was going to be
relatively flat, then $50 million lower. It looks like it's going to be a lot lower now than in 2010?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Yes, it is, David. And some of it is, if you recall, we talked about having an issuance of about $1.5
billion early fourth quarter. And now we're moving that out because we have cut back our share buy-back, our cash
flow is coming in stronger than we expected. So that's all good news, and that's what we're reflecting in this increased
guidance.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Right. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey, just first on Goodrich, Greg, can you give us a little more granularity on the $0.30 to
$0.40? I certainly applaud you for taking it all in and not ignoring it, if you will. But how much of it is actually kind of
deal-type noise versus kind of true kind of economic restructuring?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Okay. Well, let me try and give you the thesis here as best that we can do it today. I just
want to stress here that we are still – these are preliminary numbers because there are some big moving pieces like on
the accounting conformity side, but you're going to pick up about a half a year of Goodrich earnings assuming a late
June close. Then you've got about $200 million of actual deal costs, and that includes the integration teams. So that's a
cost – most of that goes away in year two. You're probably down to $25 million or so of discontinuing integration
teams. You've also got interest on the new debt which is about $200 million. I think they've got about $70 million of
interest on their old debt.
Accounting conformity, we're guessing on a full-year basis that will be about $300 million in the first year, so a half a
year is $150 million, but again, remember, excess over averages is going to go away down there. The pre-production
E&D is going to go away. We still need to work through the details, but let's say that's $150. Intangible amortization is
about $300 million. $200 million of that's for inventory write-up, write up their inventory, amortize over inventory
turns, so that happens relatively quickly. Then there's the customer intangibles, another $100 million of that gets spread
out over the next, I don't know, 10 or 15 years.
Then, of course, you've got the equity issuance. We have assumed in the math you're going to do a $4 billion equity
issuance, about 50 million shares. That costs about $0.15. So those are all the pieces. I think by the time we get to
December with Louis we'll have a little better feel for that. We'll have some of this stuff nailed down, the timing of the
debt and all that, but that's kind of broadly where we are.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And are there any substantial deal costs with closing the IAE deal? Will that deal be modestly
accretive post closing? Or is it dilutive in 2012?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No. it should be modestly, and I say modestly, accretive. The fact is we're not borrowing any
money, we're not using any bankers, and I tell you, issuing debt and using bankers is very expensive. So we're not
going to do that with the IAE transaction. We're going to use foreign cash, and we'll see just a little bit of good news at
Pratt Whitney next year for, again, probably a mid-year close there and maybe just a penny or so of accretion.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. And finally from me and I'll pass it on. Could you just speak the China demand kind of
stepped back, larger across all UTC? I mean obvious the Otis orders look pretty good. It sounds like HVAC is decent.
Just the whole state of play there, kind of the tensions in the country on potential slowing demand versus the reality of
the fact that there's still quite a bit of activity and how you see things playing out over, say, the next two to four
quarters there.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It's interesting. We all read, of course, we saw that GDP slowed down all the way to 9.1%
here. We haven't really seen – I told the guys yesterday, we haven't seen a stop sign or even a yield sign in terms of the
growth here. We're continuing to make very good traction. Otis orders are up like north of 30%. I think Carrier was
almost 20% up. The only place where we have seen any sign of weakness was really at Fire & Security and a little bit
at our Sullair, which is the Hamilton Industrial business, that Compressor business, and those are really infrastructure
projects where we've seen a little bit of slide to the right. But in terms of the commercial construction, the social
housing and the effects of the urbanization trends, those all continue apace.
So I feel very good really for the next year on China. And, look, it will no doubt slow down if the world economy
slows down, but these macro trends that have existed for the last 10 years around urbanization continue. The West is
still growing, if not on the East, and we're participating in all those markets.

Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you, and good quarter. So maybe give us a little bit more color on Rolls. I mean,
they talk of this deal adding US$220 million if converted. You talk of it adding, what was it, $80 million to $100
million in op profit. Maybe walk us through the pieces there. And is that number a full-year number? Is it before
amortization? How much is amortization?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Okay. Again, the deal here is a little bit complex, and it's – unfortunately, the accounting
makes it even more so. But if you think about this, Cai, we paid $1.5 billion for the collaboration rights associated with
Pratt's – or I'm sorry, with Rolls' investment in IAE. So we get that 33%, and we're going to pay them $1.5 billion at
close. The second piece of the deal is we're going to pay flight-hour payments over the next 15 years, and in return for
those flight-hour payments we're going to get the intellectual property and the engine designs and the right to produce
all of those parts that Rolls is currently producing. All of that gets hung up on the balance sheet as an intangible that
will build up, and we'll amortize that over the life of the program. So we'll see, as I said, very modest next-year
accretion of about a penny.
The following year we get about $75 million to $100 million. Again, that's all-in after amortization, and it gets more
and more accretive every year. And again, as you stop the engine deliveries on the V2500 in 2015, 2016, it becomes
even more accretive because then all you have is an after market stream for the 30 years or so. So I think we're paid a
fair price, but this is – there's a great return on this and it's really just about monetizing what's going to be a great
aftermarket stream on the V.
Importantly I think, what really set this deal apart for us is Rolls Royce has validated the GTF technology. The fact is,
the next mid-sized aircraft, whatever that will be, we're going to be in a partnership with Rolls and we're going to use
the GTF as the baseline configuration. And that of course is a big turnaround from where we were just a few years ago.
I think it's important, I think the IAE joint venture, our relationship with Rolls, has certainly morphed over time. It's
much better today and I think this deal is just a further personification of that
<A - Akhil Johri>: One of the benefits Cai, is the smooth transition as Greg mentioned. We're moving the customers
from the classic 320s today to these NEOs. And I think that's been a big positive to this whole transaction.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: No clearly, with the growth in the aftermarket annuity, it's a great deal. But maybe help us
understand roughly how much is the amortization likely to be on an annual basis? Is it straight line? Roughly how
much is the cost of the OEM engines to Rolls? Those kind of questions, so we get a sense of the leverage in the out
years?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Cai, I don't think we want to get into those details. It was a private transaction and I can probably
help you a little bit more afterwards. But that's...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I would tell you we're still, of course, working through all of this with regulatory
authorities too, Cai. I think as we get closer to the deal close and everything is done, we'll have a better view of all of
this. We still have to value all the intangibles. But you can think about, you know, we're going to be building that
intangible over 15 years and amortizing it out. It'll build up. So you're not going to see straight-line amortization. But
we'll – we can get you those details as we get closer to the deal close.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. And then the last one, you talked about kind of issuing 50 million shares. But really
kind of going through your cash flow, it would look like you could get away with less, kind of, tell us, kind of, what's
the range in terms of the size of the equity offering and kind of flexibility you have if the stock price is a little lower as
it is today?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, it's – as part of this whole transaction with the rating agencies, we've modeled in a
25% equity issuance of some form, be that a straight equity issuance or be it some combination of mandatory converts
or equity. The fact is we're not going to issue stock at $75 a share. That's significantly undervalued. It's why we didn't

use stock in the pricing of the deal. We're going to be opportunistic about this in terms of when we issue the equity and
how much equity and what form that takes.
In terms of using foreign cash, clearly if we can bring cash back from overseas if we see a change in the tax law that
makes it more efficient, it reduces the need for equity. And if you think about it, at the end of the deal, we're going to
have debt to cap is going to move from 32% to call it 48%, all right. That was the ratio that we agreed to with the rating
agencies. That's why I think Moody's reaffirmed our rating and why we continue to have the A1P1 on the commercial
paper.
Now if we bring cash back from overseas, it reduces the amount of debt. It'll also proportionately reduce the amount of
equity so that we can keep it in line. It's not dollar for dollar, but it's just proportionate trying to keep that debt to equity.
I think what's really important, though, is if the law changes and we are able to tap into that foreign cash, 60% of our
cash is overseas, it allows us to do a lot more investing here in the U.S.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Terrific. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes, Greg, nice quarter. Join the chorus on that one. You're, on the Goodrich deal, obviously we
recognize you're paying for technology, but also for people. Can you – the concern, of course, is that people can walk
out the door. Can you talk about how you're handling the potential loss of talent with Goodrich given this nine-month
period of uncertainty where obviously Goodrich talent is susceptible to being poached. How are you and Goodrich
management kind of help – working together to kind of prevent that and keep people steady as she goes while we go
through this kind of nine-month period of a question mark?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It's a great question, Heidi. And I think it's something I know that Marshall Larsen and
Elaine are working on. We're going to have, bring two great companies together, as I said. And we've got great people
at both companies. And the key here is to retain the great people in those businesses. And I think, again, we're going to
work – I know Tom Bowler and our HR guys are working with their HR folks to make sure that we've got the right
incentives in place so that we don't lose the talent. Elaine and Marshall are going through, identifying what the new
organizational structure is going to look like. And the sooner we get this deal closed, the easier that it's going to be.
And it's all really about the people. Great technology, but without the people it doesn't mean anything. They've got a
performance culture. We've got a performance culture. We're going to merge the two of them together.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Heidi, the best example I give to this question is Greg Hayes himself. He came through an
acquisition and look where he is at UTC. UTC offers great opportunities for people who perform.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: But are you guys able to get in front of these guys and talk about retention guarantees or things
that again, because obviously when we see large deals like that, one of the worst things that we've seen commonly
happen is the poaching of kind of the best – the best talent during that period.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Heidi, all I can tell you is we think that UTC is a great place to work. And I think it's Elaine
and Marshall's job in the coming months to make sure we convince the Goodrich folks and the Hamilton folks that
there's a great future here. And look, it's always a risk, but it's certainly on the radar screen and we're working with the
people. We're can't do very much, we just filed Hart-Scott-Rodino this past week, we're just doing the regulatory
filings, but as much as we can, we're reaching out to people and making sure they know they're an important part of the
future of these great businesses.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Are you getting any color on whether this deal could potentially close sooner? Or can you make
that case, that it helps make sure that you retain more of the company if you could close sooner?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We just filed Hart-Scott. So we'll see in 30 days we'll hear back from Justice and then we've
got the European and Asian filings to do. We're going to stick to the June closing timeframe here. Sooner is better. No
doubt for many, many reasons, people being one of the big things. But we'll work through this as quickly as we can.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Then one final question on it, and it's just a nit, but are there any terms and conditions in the deal
concerning how Goodrich does, kind of better or worse during this period? Because, obviously, management had a high
sense of how they were going to do. You've done your best due diligence, but if they don't do quite as well, is there any
re-pricing potential?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, look, they're a public company. They've got shareowners they've got to satisfy. They've
got a performance culture there as I said. They're going to make their numbers that they've committed to. We feel very
confident in the forecast that they showed us both for this year and into next. They release earnings here in the coming
week or so and I think it will probably be just about in line with what everybody expects.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: And I think I know the answer to this question, Greg, but one last final thought on my part. The C
Series has obviously – we see what's happening in the news there. Can you talk about what this means in terms of any
additional headwind this might portend for GTF on the NEO? Does R&D change on that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I'm sorry, Heidi, were you talking about the C Series in terms of the schedule or?
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Well, just in terms of – there may be a question at to its future, obviously. But I think that there
was some leveraging that you were expecting to happen on what you were doing on C Series that translates to NEO and
that may not necessarily be intact?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Look, they are different engines although they have the same essential core. It's just scaled
up from the C Series to the NEO. But that's really the extent of the synergies in terms of the testing and in terms of the
design. We think the C Series is still going to be successful. We haven't seen a lot of orders recently, but we still think
long term this is going to be a great airplane in its niche, which is 105 to 130 seats. It's fuel efficient. It's got great
technology. And it's going to be successful. And, really, look, it's going to be out there. We're on time with the – with
the engine. We expect to, I think, have it certified by the end of next year for entry to service in 2013 still. So we're still
going full speed ahead.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Shannon
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Can you talk a little bit about what the order trends were in the Transicold business on
the container and the reefer side?
<A - Akhil Johri>: Sure, Shannon. I think the truck-trailer side has seen reduction in orders, which is not surprising.
Some of the large fleets in the U.S. booked big orders early in the year and have now slowed down. So we've seen
significant reduction in the North American truck trailer orders on a year-over-year basis, although year-to-date is still
very strong. Europe truck trailers is slightly down year-over-year as well. Although containers continue to remain very
strong and we're almost 2X what the orders were last year in the third quarter. Now compares there are likely to get
tougher in Q4, but so far, so good.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And then maybe a little bit more about what's going on at Fire & Security and
also what you hope to accomplish with the consolidation of Fire & Security and Carrier?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: The combo with Carrier and Fire & Security is going to create an $18 billion business. It's
going to be headed up by Geraud. And I think the key for that combination was really this focus on building controls.
You guys will recall the IBS integrated building system strategy that Louis has been talking about for a couple of years.
This is really the end game of that strategy and how it's going to play out. We've created a controls business under
Mark Barry, I believe, at, what are we calling it, climate controls and securities systems, CCSS. And I think that the
controls is the linchpin to this whole thing.
At the same time we're going to run the playbook that we've run at Carrier for the last three years. There's going to be
portfolio transformation opportunities. There's going to be cost synergies. And it's going to be a great business on a
consolidated basis. Two very good businesses and put them together. Importantly we're still on track, I think, for the
margin targets that Louis laid out. It was 12% for Carrier and 15% for F&S. We're going to get there next year on a
consolidated basis
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: It looks like Carrier is running ahead and Fire & Security behind. Is it fair to say the
consolidated comes a little bit more from Carrier beating and Fire & Security missing?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Look, I think we have an opportunity next year for F&S to get to a 15% on a standalone
basis. Part of that was through portfolio rationalization. Part of it also is from recovery in some of our markets. If you
think about the $15 million drop we've just taken in the guidance at F&S, really the key there was our market in the
U.K. I think that business is down earnings about $60 million year-over-year. We've seen some big market issues as the
government in the U.K. has contracting spending. We've seen some margin and we've seen some productivity issues.
That's really the problem. I think again, we'll get that issue behind us. Once we do that, and we focus on some of the
portfolio transformation issues at F&S in terms of calling out some of the under-performers, we still feel confident we
can get to the 15% on F&S.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And final one, is transforming that portfolio going to be some additional divestitures or
is there going to be an acquisition component to this given your desire to build more into the building automation side
of things?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think yes to both sides. I think obviously there's an opportunities there to cull the portfolio
at F&S. Geraud team have just started working with Scott and his team on that. I think they've got some ideas already.
We'll hear more about that in the coming months. But also, Mark Barry's Controls business is an opportunity for
acquisition over the medium term here. So, again, I think it's both things we'll be doing.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
<Q - Rob Stallard CA>: Morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Rob.
<Q - Rob Stallard CA>: Greg, I was wondering if we could talk about the aerospace aftermarket, clearly, contrasting
results on the orders between Sunstrand and Pratt. I was wondering if you could talk about what the underlying drivers
are here and whether it is just comps on year-on-year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, comps is a big thing. Pratt was up 35% last year in orders last year in the third quarter,
up 3% this year. And Hamilton was up I think 13% last year, up 24% this year. If you dissect the Hamilton orders
though, what you see is that the parts business, that ongoing recurring spare parts was up about 10%. So pretty – not
nearly the robust 24% that we talk about. It was really provisioning on 787 that drove the order growth at Hamilton.
And again, this is the long-awaited payback for that big investment we made in the 787 and that's going to drive growth

at Hamilton next year as well. This is really just the start of the provisioning cycle on the 787.
<Q - Rob Stallard CA>: And do you expect the numbers between the two divisions to maybe converge going forward
because they are so big at the moment?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, unfortunately I think the businesses are just fundamentally different. Hamilton is on
every platform out there. And they obviously as you see the new aircraft come to market, they're going to see
provisioning orders, they're going to see parts from every commercial aircraft out there.
Pratt's a little bit more limited. I mean you'll see growth obviously from the V2500 fleet. You've got the 4000s out
there. You've got some 2000s. But you would expect I think stronger growth in the aftermarket at Hamilton in the
coming years as opposed to Pratt. We'll start to see again the V2500 pick up even more strongly now that we've got the
Rolls Royce share and then the GTF at the end of this decade will pick up significantly.
<A - Akhil Johri>: The other thing to keep in mind is Pratt spares are also driven by the cycling time on the engines
and when they come in for overhauls, I think that does drive the timing of the spares a little differently based on the
profile of the engines coming in for repair work.
<Q - Rob Stallard CA>: Okay. And then on the industrial side, Greg, it does look like some of your shorter cycle
industries have weakened on the order front in the third quarter. Do you expect this deteriorating trend to continue into
the fourth quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No actually, if you think about it, orders at the industrial businesses in the third quarter I
think were up about 11% at constant currency. Sullair was up 8%. I think Sundyne was up strongly. Milton Roy was up
nicely. So all of the businesses on the industrial side of Hamilton were good. On the commercial side of the business, I
think you're going to see, again, fairly decent order trends from the emerging markets. The U.S. we're not seeing
anything here, right, on the commercial construction side, Europe, nothing much on the commercial construction side
in the Eurozone. We're are seeing strong growth of course from Russia, Poland and those markets, but Europe not
much, but all kind of in line with what we expected for the year.

Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. To go back to something you talked about, Greg, earlier in terms of
repositioning and a focus. You've done two large deals in a short order of time and you've hinted at some divestitures.
Is this just going to be a different effort at reshaping United Technologies' portfolio?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: These deals, although they got announced within a couple of weeks ago, really have been in
the works for well over a year. And I think Louis and the rest of the senior management team we've been looking at the
entire portfolio here. This is really just a part of the overall strategy at UTC which we want to have the growth
businesses in growth markets and I think we're positioning the company to be exactly that. And this portfolio analysis
is not a one-time event, it's something that we're going to continue to do, continue to look at opportunities both on the
acquisition and the divestiture side to better position UTC for long-term growth.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: All right. No. That's what I gather and hence also the management changes in terms of focus
and emphasis. I guess that's all part of it?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It is indeed.

what are the issues? I mean this has been an ongoing challenge to get it right. I mean frankly – and then just one other

item and if you can answer that is you had a small – what is the size of the real estate gain at Otis?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: The real estate gain at Otis was how much?
<A - Akhil Johri>: About $15 million, Howard, the real estate gains at Otis. So about a penny.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: About a penny. As far as the CMHs look we have an agreement with the Canadian
government to deliver six interim configuration aircraft this year. The final configuration aircraft will be delivered
starting at the middle of next year. We've had some issues with some software glitches. We've had some other issues.
But the helicopters are ready to be delivered. I think it's just a question of aligning the customer requirements right
now. And I know Jeff and the team have been working with our friends on this for quite some time. And we have the
helicopters being they're being built in Stratford. They're ready to ship. It's just a question of what the customer needs at
this point.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I mean I still don't understand what that means. I mean, are we going to see larger losses
because of the further delays? And that's the good news is we're going to get them behind us this year and next year
more profitability?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, I think in fact we lose $10 million, $12 million a copy on these helicopters. And that's
not really changing in terms of the timing of the deliveries. You're still going to see headwind next year and into '13 as
you deliver the remainder of the 28 helicopters.

Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Thanks. Yeah, I just had a question on your commercial businesses. I mean you mentioned
that in Carrier you'd seen some trading down. I just wondered more broadly, obviously, if the volume outlook in
commercial, for low level, if it's managing to deteriorate further in developed economies? You mentioned pricing
earlier, but if you see volumes weaken and you see a mix shift, are you worried that pricing generally, when you look at
what your competitors are saying and doing, are you worried that pricing generally may start to moderate in the coming
months as you see volumes soften and commodities have leveled out?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: To be clear, I don't think we expect to see volumes softening any more than they already are.
If you think about Carrier's residential business here in the U.S., I think the total market for split systems is about 4.7.
It's been kind of banging along the bottom there for the last two or three years. We haven't really seen any growth.
At the same time, as commodities have increased I think we have seen some pricing traction. But the real issue there in
the business is what is the consumer sentiment. Last year, we had stimulus-related benefits, rebates, that allowed
customers to trade up to higher efficiency units. The stimulus is gone. Those tax credits are gone. So because of the
consumer sentiment here in the U.S., consumers are only buying what they need to buy. And they're buying entry level,
lower-featured products. And so if you think about the business in the U.S., I think we were up about 8% in the quarter
in terms of units. But total sales were flat, because, again, you traded down. So now 75% of what we're selling is entry
level SEER 13.
So look, it's hard to imagine it's going to get any worse than this. There's still 93 or 94 million air conditioners out there
in service today that have to be replaced. There's not much going on in the housing market. We don't expect growth in
housing. At the same time, we've got a good position in terms of our cost, continue to take costs out of the business,
continue to drive margins in that business. And when the market recovers, and it will, we're going to be well positioned
to get great operating leverage there.

<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then if I'm comparing the new equipment orders organically for Otis and
commercial HVAC, Otis has been out growing the HVAC orders for the last sort of six months or so. Do you think
that's sustainable for any particular reason in terms of geographic weighting or new products or anything else?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, it's really, it's all about China. You think about where Otis' position in China, they saw
30% orders growth rate there. Carrier saw about – just under 20% growth in orders. And it's just, the market position
that Otis has is just phenomenal. We've got about, just north of I think 22%, 23% market share. We go to market at four
different price points in the China market. And they've got a very strong team in place in China. Carrier, good team,
they've got good market position. But I think, again, just because of the weighting and the size of the Otis China
business, it's going to drive higher growth there.
<A - Akhil Johri>: One other factor, Julian, is that in China, orders benefit from social housing which is more of
residential type of air conditioning. So like-for-like, while Otis benefits from the residential sort of social housing,
Carrier does not. So I think that is a part of the difference as well.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Thanks a lot. And then just one final one, you mentioned some of the restructuring going
into Sikorsky. On the commercial side though, both Bell this morning and Eurocopter last month have sounded very
positive about what's going on there. So could you just give an update on the different trends in Sikorsky?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think again, what we're seeing on the military side, BLACK HAWK production has
probably peaked this year and it'll probably stay about flat into next year. Where we are seeing growth on the military
is on the international side. I think we shipped three of the first three S-70is out of Mielec this quarter, in fact. On the
commercial side, order trends have not been great. Right now, and again, we're transitioning from the S-76C++ to the
S-76D. I think we'll have that aircraft certified mid year next year. We'd expect orders to pick up. But in the interim I
think we'll be done delivering S-76s here at the end of the year. S-92 continues to sell well for the oil and gas fleet. And
again I think it's – it will be a good story, but it's not going to be a great high growth story for next year.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terry Darling>: It's early and we're not going to steal any thunder from December here, but just wondering if
you could tie up all the changes to the 2012 puts and takes landscape and give us a sense whether you think 10% plus,
excluding Goodrich and IAE is still a reasonable place to be thinking at this point?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, look, we're targeting 10% earnings growth, Terry, for the businesses. I think again the
two big question marks we have right now are really around FX and pension and what happens there. But the base
businesses, I think, we're going to continue to push them to get towards 10%. We're doing the restructuring now. We're
doing whatever we can to try and make sure that that happens. We've got these big kind of unknowns though around
FX and what's going on in terms of the developed economies and the macro environment. I would tell you ex-Goodrich
dilution next year, we're going to outperform the peers. We've taken the hard action, we've done what we needed to do
on the pension side. We've right-sized the business. And so I think again, you'll be happy, I think, with the guidance
that Louis provides in what's a very tough economic environment.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of – you made a comment – we've talked a lot about
different specifics. I just want to make sure we're clear on your earlier comment, that just in the last few weeks you've
seen some incremental weakness in end markets. Are you talking about the truck markets? Can you just be clear with
us in terms of which end markets you're really thinking of in that particular comment?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think, I look at the Carrier and the residential business in the U.S. and we had a very
strong start to the third quarter. I think July was good and then August things started to slow down, and even a little
further in September. Truck/trailers is the same kind of phenomenon. There was a lot of early ordering and so we've

seen orders pull back on the truck/trailer in the North American market. I think again, it's just as we're seeing consumer
sentiment in the U.S. and in Europe, giving the banking crisis in Europe, consumers are pulling back and not spending.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. And then just lastly on the DOD spending outlook for 2012, has anything changed with
your thinking there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, I think that it's all about as we had expected. I think we'll wait and see what the super
committee comes up with here. We're hopeful that the folks in Washington are going to be able to come together and
come up with a reasonable plan with the deficit and hold the defense spending in line. But the worst thing that could
happen is stalemate, of course, of the super committee, because the DOD budget cuts would be huge. I don't think
anybody wants that to happen. I don't think anybody is going to let that happen.
<Q - Terry Darling>: And it sounded like you were a little more optimistic on the international sales, defense sales
next year, or am I reading too much into that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think it's just a continuation of what Jeff's been talking about for the last couple of years.
We positioned the business to have a great product offering, that's the BLACK HAWK, in a low-cost manufacturing
location and it continues to get traction. There's orders out there from Turkey. There's orders out there for Singapore,
for Saudi. I think there's lots of opportunities.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Back to the Rolls agreement for a second. Does the relationship essentially between you two
remain stale until there's actually a platform to pursue? Or is Rolls going to start to share in the core R&D that you have
ongoing for the next gen of the GTF?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think they'll continue to be a part of the IAE joint venture because they're going to continue
to supply their share of the engine for some period of time until it transitions to us. In terms of investment in the next
generation platform, we're both going to go down the path of making sure we've got the best possible technology when
that platform becomes visible. We're going to be investing of course in the gear, they're going to be investing in other
core parts of the engine. So when the thing does come together, we both have the latest and best technology to offer.
<Q - Myles Walton>: So are you pursuing dual architectures or similar architectures with split responsibility?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, I think it's going to be a GTF architecture. This is not going to be a three spool engine,
this is going to be GTF and it's going to be a single platform.
<Q - Myles Walton>: So they are sharing in the core R&D starting as soon as this agreement is done.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, as soon as we have visibility to what the next aircraft is going to be.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Okay. Okay. And then on Sikorsky, the guidance of $25 million increase in EBIT, is that, from
Akhil's comments it sounded like potentially a couple of the CHPs were shifting out. Is that essentially what's causing
that? Or is it better performance as well? And I guess are you expecting the same number of CHPs or have that – has
that number slipped out?

<A - Akhil Johri>: No, I think, Myles, you're exactly right. It is the shifting of the two CMHP's, if you will. That's
what we have taken into account in our forecast here. Their operating performance, even without that, it's pretty good
as is. So I think they were tracking well towards delivering on the margin expansion and the growth in the profits that
we were expecting. This shift will probably not impact 2012 as such. It may move to 2013 in terms of the deliveries
that if – that we miss if any this year.

Our next question comes from Joe Nadol.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. You're very busy. Just a couple of follow-ups here. Just on Fire
& Security, the – between productivity and demand, which is the bigger impact on your numbers? And could you speak
a bit more specifically, if possible, about what you're referring to with productivity? Is there one facility that's
under-performing in the U.K., et cetera?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, if you think about the $50 million drop, about half of that is actually from lower
volumes. Orders are essentially flat here in Q3. We had expected, I think, a 5% or so organic growth for the year. We're
not going to see that. So that's the biggest piece of this. You also got a little bit of bad news on FX versus our last look.
And then you've got the U.K. issue. I say the productivity issue is not just U.K., it's really the field organization where
we had expected significant productivity benefits from all of the restructuring actions. We just haven't seen the traction
that we had expected to see in the field in the Installation and Service businesses. And the U.K. market is tough. We've
recognized after the year, it's worse than what we had expected. We're focused on it.
These operational issues, they happen. We know how to fix these things. I think that's what Geraud and Scott and the
team are focused on right now, is fixing the field productivity issues and fixing the issues we've got in terms of
performance. Because look, it happens. It's unfortunate, but we're on top of it and we're going to get it fixed.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. In both of these businesses that are coming together, Carrier and F&S, you're looking at
– I'm sure there's going to be some integration from a top-level standpoint in terms of overhead. At the same time,
you're looking at divestitures from within – it seems to me, at least, from within both businesses, certainly within
Carrier working on the international residential and with F&S, you've implied there are some opportunities. So in terms
of a chicken/egg situation, which is coming first? Are you really starting now and looking at divestitures or are you
going to bring the whole thing together and then look at paring some of the businesses off?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We have been looking at this portfolio transformation at F&S really for the last year or so.
We're closer on that that you might think. Timing wise, Carrier is further down the pipe in terms of some of its
divestiture opportunities and they're continuing to work those things so I expect you'll see fourth quarter this year, early
into next year, hopefully the conclusion of that portfolio transformation. And then it will start to pick up I would think
at the F&S side of the business in the second half of next year.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay.
<A - Akhil Johri>: Joe, you'll recall, we've been doing stuff at F&S as well. The [ph] man-guiding (59:45) business
which is the low margin has out of the portfolio pretty much now over the last few years. It's something we're focused
on, but with Geraud's additional oversight, I think we'll probably get some more things done faster.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Finally, you may have given this, I may have missed it. In terms of pension for next
year for the overall company, if current rates stay where they are, what's the head wind?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It's about $0.15 cents, that's at a 5% discount rate. That assumes, I think, 3% return on assets
this year. So, we'll see. For every 10 basis point change in the discount rate, that costs us about $20 million of expense.
You guys can do the math. We'll see where we are on December 31. Unfortunately there's nothing to do until then.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Right. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.

Our final question comes from Deane Dray with Citi Investment.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of clean up questions. The first is the
Otis China escalator problem. Has that all been resolved?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think in terms of the root cause, we certainly have understood that, we understood that right
away, a supplier issue with a bolt that was undersized. I think, again, we're still working with the authorities in Beijing
to make sure that they understand our quality control processes are intact and it's never going to happen again. It's an
unfortunate incident, but, again, like any other problem that we find we get to root cause, we get it solved, and we make
sure it doesn't happen again.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great, and I might have missed this, but the expectations for fourth quarter in the
price-cost, how does that net out? You said that Carrier is facing some additional head winds this quarter. What's the
expectation?
<A - Akhil Johri>: I think next quarter Carrier will see the benefit of pricing. The commodities are still head wind. So
I think net-net, we still see a little bit of head wind but it's going to be a lot less than what we've seen in the third
quarter.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Okay. Last one back on residential Carrier, Greg, you talked about the mix shift and the
focus on buyers towards the lower end 13 SEER. But it also raises the question of whether you're at a disadvantage in
not having a lower price point brand to begin with so that in good, better, best, you're skewed towards the better-best
brands with Carrier?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: In fact, we do have three brands. If you think about it, Carrier is the premier brand out there
and it's the higher efficiency products. You have Bryant and you have Payne at the entry level. I think Payne at that
price point competes very, very effectively. In fact, that's where we've seen most of the growth is coming out at the low
entry line Payne. It's got a great cost footprint and it's very competitive on the low end. I don't think we've lost any of
that share. In fact, we've probably have picked up a little bit as we've been able to leverage that low-end brand.

Gregory J. Hayes
Okay, thanks Giovanni. Thanks, everybody, for listening. Another solid quarter. We're confident in our improved 2011
outlook and we're positioning UTC for 2012 with increased restructuring this year and a commitment to grow earnings
even in this tough macro environment. And beyond 2012, we've aggressively invested in strategic deals to transform
the business and we've continued to invest in strategic technologies to grow the business over the long term.
Thanks all for listening. I'll remind everybody that we'll be in New York on December 15 for an evening with Louis to
talk about 2012 in detail. Have a great day. Thanks.
