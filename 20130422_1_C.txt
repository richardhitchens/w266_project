MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello and welcome to Citi's Fixed Income Investor Review with Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach and Treasurer
Eric Aboaf.
Today's call will be hosted by Peter Kapp, Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Kapp,
you may begin.
Peter Kapp
Thank you, Regina.
Good morning, and thank you all for joining us.
On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach, will speak first. Then, Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will take you through the
Fixed Income investor presentation, which is available for download on our website, Citigroup.com. Afterwards, we
will be happy to take questions.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements,
which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of
factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings
including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to John.

Thank you very much, Peter, and good morning, everyone.
We're very pleased to be hosting our Fixed Income Investor Review this quarter. Today, we're going to update you on
our continued execution and progress in several areas. Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, is going to review some specifics on
our strong balance sheet, liquidity profile, and capital position as well as review our recent issuance activity and current
funding plans for the remainder of 2013. Before I turn it over to Eric, however, there are some key points from our first
quarter results announced last week that I would like to highlight to start us off here on slide two.
As you know, last week we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the first quarter of 2013. Excluding CVA and DVA,
net income was $4 billion. During the quarter, we benefited from seasonally strong results in our markets businesses,
sustained momentum in Investment Banking, continued year-over-year growth in loans and deposits in Citicorp, and a
more favorable credit environment. Additionally, we utilized $700 million of our DTA during the first quarter and
continue to be focused on generating sustainable U.S. taxable earnings, which are the primary driver of DTA
consumption.
We continued our focus on efficient, disciplined balance-sheet management, and reduced our assets in Citi Holdings to
just under $150 billion, or 8% of our balance sheet.
We also reduced the earnings drag caused by Citi Holdings, with a net loss of less than $800 million, driven by
improvement in credit costs, including a $375 million reserve release related to North America mortgages. We began
utilizing these reserves as the mortgage portfolio continues to shrink, credit performance continues to improve, and we
are becoming more comfortable that the housing market continues to show evidence of recovery. We will continue to
analyze this portfolio and adjust our reserve levels accordingly.
Our liquidity position remains strong, with $376 billion of liquidity resources and an estimated LCR of 116%, which is
still comfortably above the 100% requirement.
Our capital strength again improved during the quarter, with the Tier 1 common ratio increasing to an estimated 9.3%
on a Basel III basis. We now expect this ratio to reach at least 10% by the end of this year.
We remain focused on achieving the 2015 financial targets that we set out in March. First is achieving an efficiency
ratio in Citicorp in the mid-50s range. Second, we want to generate a return on Citigroup's tangible common equity of
over 10%. And third is reaching a return on Citigroup's assets of between 90 and 110 basis points in a risk-balanced
manner.
In summary, we are encouraged by our first-quarter results, but the environment remains challenging, and we're sure to
be tested as we go through the balance of the year.
Turning to slide three, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter. Revenues of $20.8 billion grew 3% from last
year, while operating expenses of $12.4 billion increased 1%, driven by higher legal and related costs in Citi Holdings.
Excluding legal and related costs and repositioning charges, core operating expenses were $11.5 billion in the first
quarter, down slightly from the prior year. Looking forward, core operating expenses should decline as we begin to see
the benefits of the repositioning actions announced last December.
Credit costs of $2.5 billion declined 16% versus last year. Net credit losses of $3 billion were down 25%. However, the
loan loss reserve release also declined by nearly half to $652 million.
As I mentioned, excluding CVA and DVA, we earned $4 billion of net income in the first quarter or $1.29 per share, up
from $1.11 per share last year on a comparable basis, driven by revenue growth and lower net credit losses, partially
offset by the increase in legal and related expenses, a lower net loan loss reserve release, and a higher effective tax rate.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric.

Eric W. Aboaf
Thank you, John.
I'd like to start on slide four by reviewing our credit trends and comment on the reserve releases we reported last week.
Overall, in the first quarter, we reported net credit losses of $3 billion. NCLs decreased 17% year over year on an
adjusted basis and were slightly lower than in the fourth quarter.
The dark blue bars represent the performance in Citicorp, which has continued to improve steadily, with NCLs down
9% year over year. The gray bars show the improvement in NCLs at Citi Holdings, which are down 32% year over year
and down nearly two-thirds from the first quarter of 2011. I'll provide more detail regarding Holdings credit trends in a
few moments.
Giving the improving trends in both net credit losses and delinquencies, we released reserves in both Citicorp and Citi
Holdings. As John noted earlier, we released a total of $652 million of loan loss reserves in the quarter, including $361
million in North American Cards.
Significantly, we also released $375 million of reserves related to the North American mortgage portfolio in Citi
Holdings, offsetting roughly 60% of the mortgage-related net credit losses during the quarter. If the mortgage portfolio
continues to demonstrate improving credit trends and the housing market remains stable, we would expect this
proportion to increase, with a resulting benefit to credit costs.
Along the bottom of the slide, you can see that we ended the quarter with total loan loss reserves of $24 billion, or
approximately 3.7% of loans. Of this total, $14.3 billion are attributed to Citicorp and $9.4 billion to Citi Holdings.
Turning to slide five, looking at Citi Holdings, let me describe our continued progress in reducing the amounts of these
assets. Holdings assets have declined by 81% from their peak in 2008 to $149 billion and now represent less than 8% of
our consolidated balance sheet and 23% of our estimated Basel III risk-weighted assets.
During the first quarter, Holdings assets declined by approximately $7 billion, reflecting $2 billion of asset sales, $4
billion of net paydowns, and roughly $1 billion cost of credit. Holdings' North American mortgages are down 17% year
over year to $86 billion, and 6% or $6 billion quarter over quarter.
This quarter, we signed deals to sell $2.8 billion of residential first-mortgage loans, including $1 billion of delinquent
mortgages and $1.8 billion of current loans. You may notice that other assets in Local Consumer Lending increased
during the quarter by $3 billion. Some of the loan sales we signed had not yet closed at the end of the quarter, so they
are transferred to held-for-sale and other assets.
Regarding the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney JV, we have not yet received a formal update from them. With that said,
we carry the total investment, including other financing we've provided, at approximately $8 billion on our balance
sheet. We also hold deposits related to the MSSB customers, which Morgan Stanley would assume in stages starting
shortly after completing their purchase of the investment stake. The initial deposit transfer would total roughly $15
billion, with the rest transferring over the subsequent two years.
In the months following the sale and depending on a number of decisions we could make, we expect Holdings assets to
decline by approximately $8 billion. The net liquidity outflow, however, will be less than $10 billion, which includes
the transfer of deposits offset by cash inflows for the investment stake. At the same time, based on what we know now,
we estimate that the sale of the remaining 35% interest will add approximately 40 basis points to our Basel III Tier 1
capital ratios.
On slide six, we show credit trends in the largest part of Holdings, the North American mortgage portfolio. This data
includes both residential first mortgages and home equity loans. Net credit losses in this portfolio have steadily
declined. Credit trends were particularly favorable in the first quarter, with net credit losses declining to $639 million,
down 33% from last year and half of what they were in the first quarter of 2011. We've also witnessed a significant
decline in the delinquencies in this portfolio, with 30-day delinquencies down by 29% since last year and 19%
sequentially to $6.1 billion, with improvement across all of our delinquency buckets. The first quarter reduction in

delinquencies was driven by asset sales I just mentioned as well as reduced flows into the early buckets across our
portfolios, which we attribute to continued improvement in the housing market.
We continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce this portfolio at attractive economics. Our current reserves against this
portfolio are $7.5 billion, representing 36 months of NCL coverage and 123% of delinquent loans, both reflecting
modest improvement from last quarter.
Having covered credit trends, let me turn to slide seven to discuss how we are reshaping our balance sheet to support
our client activities. Over the last two years, we've managed our balance sheet down from the $2 trillion average we
had been running while adding both customer loans and deposits in a disciplined manner. This quarter, we again
maintained our average and end-of-period GAAP assets at around $1.9 trillion. We believe that by managing a more
compact balance sheet, we can better focus on our customers' needs while improving our profitability, consistent with
the ROA and ROTCE targets our CEO shared with the market.
On the asset side, we've maintained our cash and investment securities at roughly 24% to 25% of the total balance
sheet. Year over year, total loans were flat but we've continued to shift the mix of loans within our overall portfolio.
Citicorp lending his increased as we lend to our core client base, and Citi Holdings' has shrunk as we've continued to
wind down those portfolios. On the liability side, our deposits and capital have grown while we've reduced our
long-term debt outstanding. This shift has enhanced our stable funding mix and reduced our funding costs, as I'll
describe more in a moment.
Turning to slide eight, given our strong balance sheet, we have been investing capital in our Citicorp lending
businesses, so let me describe what we are seeing in loan volumes. In Citicorp, loans grew 5% year over year and were
essentially flat quarter over quarter, as underlying growth was offset by seasonality. Lending in our Institutional
businesses was up 9% year over year and 2% quarter over quarter. Lending increased 13% in Transaction Services
from the prior year, driven by trade finance in North America, EMEA, and Latin America. We saw 8% growth in our
Securities & Banking loan book year over year, driven by growth in corporate lending in North America and Latin
America and private banking loans in North America and Asia.
In our Consumer businesses, we saw growth in some markets offset by continued customer deleveraging in North
America. International Consumer Banking loan volumes increased 4% year over year, led by 12% growth in Latin
America. North American Consumer loan volumes were down 2% year over year and 4% quarter over quarter, as the
cards market continues to reflect both consumer deleveraging and the normal post-holiday repayments. Later in 2013,
when our announced acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio is completed, which is currently expected in the third
quarter, we will add approximately $7 billion of receivables to our balance sheet and a new partner for our Retail
Services business.
On slide nine, let's spend a moment looking at deposits, which serve as our primary source of funding. This page shows
average deposit trends by business, with the end-of-period amounts below. Overall, our average deposits grew by 6%
year over year and were down 1% quarter over quarter, reflecting the previously mentioned $10 billion of TAG-related
runoff which occurred at the end of the fourth quarter, offset by continued growth in consumer deposits. Going
forward, we would expect modest growth in average deposits in Citicorp but with the potential for some quarterly
period-end fluctuations. As I mentioned earlier, when Morgan Stanley exercises their call, we would see a reduction of
approximately $15 billion of deposits, offset by our underlying deposit growth in the quarter.
As you can see from the table at the bottom of the page, we've continued to shift our deposit mix towards operating
accounts, which now represents 80% of our average total deposits. This mix shift combined with market conditions, has
helped us reduce our deposit costs from 85 basis points in the first quarter of 2011 to 58 basis points in the first quarter
of 2013, as we continue to demonstrate pricing power and strong demand for our operating account products and
services. In fact, our U.S. deposit costs reached a low of 23 basis points in the quarter and our international deposit
costs declined to 83 basis points. Both of these are important factors in driving our overall funding costs lower.
On slide 10, I want to show you how some of the balance sheet growth that we've just reviewed is affecting our net
interest revenue and margin. This quarter, we saw NIM increase slightly to 2.94%, up one basis point from the prior

quarter and four basis points from last year. Let me give you some context. We and most other banks continue to see
pressure on loan and investment portfolio yields in this low rate environment, but we are seeing favorable yield trends
in some of our portfolios. In aggregate, this pressure costs us approximately 20 basis points of yield year over year. But
this pressure was offset in two ways.
First, as I mentioned, our deposit costs continued to decline, which was worth approximately 14 basis points year over
year. Second, we reduced our long-term debt, which was worth an additional 12 basis points through tenders, buybacks,
and maturities. We have continued those liability management activities, which I'll discuss a moment. As a result, our
improved funding costs reflect a mix shift towards a greater proportion of deposit funding. Deposits now fund 56% of
our earning assets, up from 50% in the first quarter of 2011, while long-term debt funding has declined from 21% to
13% over that time.
On a full-year basis, we should be able to maintain our net interest margin above the 288 basis points we achieved last
year. However, there will be quarterly fluctuations. And in particular, we expect the net interest margin to decline
sequentially in the second quarter by a few basis points. We believe we can largely offset the effects of the challenging
interest rate environment through continued liability management and a continued focus on deposit pricing.
On slide 11, I'd like to discuss the sensitivity of our net interest revenue to interest rate movements. This chart
illustrates the estimated annual effect of a 100 basis point shift in interest rates on our net interest revenue. Now, I
would point out that disclosures on interest rate exposures are not standard across the industry. With that said, we
believe that the upward trend here is informative. As you can see, we believe we are modestly positioned for rising
rates. If rates were to rise by 100 basis points across the curve and across our major currencies, we estimate the annual
increase in our net interest revenue to be approximately $1 billion, or a six basis point improvement in our NIM. In
contrast to our current position, back in 2010 we were positioned for falling rates and a double-dip recession and would
have gained if rates fell. Importantly, the scenario shown here is just one of numerous scenarios we model routinely as
part of our balance sheet stress testing and risk management processes.
Beyond the effect of net interest revenue, we are also conscious of how rate movements would impact the AOCI
component of our equity, especially in the light of the proposed Basel III capital rules. The value of our high-quality
available-for-sale securities portfolio would be marked down on the balance sheet in a rising rate environment, but the
value of our deposits would not be correspondingly marked up under GAAP. We currently estimate that a 100 basis
point parallel shift in rates would result in a decline of slightly less than $3 billion in our equity account, including the
effects on available-for-sale securities, cash flow hedges, and our pension liability. This corresponds to less than a 2%
reduction of our tangible common equity and a roughly a 40 basis point decline in our estimated Basel III Tier 1
common ratio, all based on quarter-end amounts.
Importantly, given the relative short duration of our AFS portfolio, we estimate that approximately half of the OCI
mark would accrete back over 2.5 years. In addition, as we've just discussed, we would expect rising rates could yield
$1 billion of additional net interest revenue over the first year, which would replenish capital further.
Now that we have described loans, deposits, and net interest revenue, let me turn to slide 12 to describe in more detail
our long-term debt, which is the primary source of funding for our non-bank subsidiaries. This chart shows the
composition of our long-term debt outstanding over time, including senior debt, subordinated debt, trust preferreds, and
credit card securitizations. As you can see here, our long-term debt outstanding has decreased by $77 billion year over
year and $5 billion quarter over quarter to $234 billion. At the same time, we have maintained our weighted average
maturities in the seven-year range to help ensure a stable funding base.
As we said in January, we continue to expect our long-term debt outstanding to decrease, but at a slower pace this year.
Some of this net reduction will occur through maturities and some will result from our targeted tender offers, debt
buybacks, and redemptions. Much of this reduction corresponds directly to the runoff of Citi Holdings assets and from
the measured use of liquidity. Generally speaking, any reductions in our long-term debt will be scaled to the funding
needs of our business and will also be dependent on a favorable economic environment. We will also be cognizant of
potential new regulatory guidelines under OLA [Orderly Liquidation Authority], which I will discuss more in a
moment.

Moving to slide 13, this page demonstrates how the combination of issuance activity and expected maturities continues
to reshape our long-term debt footprint. In 2012, we significantly reduced debt outstandings. Maturities were driven by
the last of our TLGP bonds coming due and were complemented by significant buybacks, tenders, and redemptions.
We issued $15 billion of long-term structural debt, almost all at the parent company. Throughout 2013, we currently
expect long-term debt maturities of approximately $28 billion. And as we previously stated, we are targeting buybacks,
tenders, and redemptions of another $10 billion to $15 billion, with an expected total issuance volume of $20 billion.
Of course, these plans are absent any unforeseen circumstances or any regulatory guidance, for example, on OLA.
During the first quarter of 2013, we issued approximately $8 billion of long-term debt in dollar, euro, and Aussie
denominations and for terms of three, five, and ten years. We repaid $6 billion of maturing debt and retired
approximately $2 billion of long-term debt through tenders or buybacks. Next quarter, you'll see the reductions
associated with the redemptions of $3 billion of high-cost trust preferreds, which we just completed this month. And
last week, we also launched a tender offer for two of our outstanding subordinated notes.
In addition, while not technically considered long-term debt, our issuance of preferred stock also influences our overall
funding plan, as it complements our long-term debt funding and will play an increasing role in our capital structure. We
completed a $575 million preferred stock offering in the first quarter, bringing our total preferred stock outstanding to a
little over $3 billion.
Turning now to slide 14, I'd like to discuss the pending regulatory guidelines for OLA against the backdrop of our
funding and liquidity position. The implementation of the Orderly Liquidation Authority under Title II of the
Dodd-Frank Act is of significant interest to many of our fixed income investors and is an important factor in
developing our funding plan. We generally support the concept of single-entry receivership as a way to limit future
government bailouts and believe that OLA requirements could improve the overall stability of the financial system.
Recent discussions of potential OLA requirements have focused on holding a prescribed amount and type of debt at the
holding company level to recapitalize the banking subsidiaries in the event of a crisis.
Based on what we know now, we believe that our capital structure positions us well to adapt to a potential OLA
requirement, especially relative to our parent institutions, many of whom tend to run with less long-term parent
company debt than we do. Whatever final form the rules take, we will adjust our capital structure accordingly, just as
we have done with all prior regulatory developments. That said, many questions about the implementation of OLA
remain, including the timing of the proposed rules, guidance on the types of debt that may be used for bail-in, and
required bail-in capacity relative to assets; that is, the denominator and the required ratio.
Given the uncertainty surrounding implementation, we've presented what we believe to be some relevant data points for
evaluating our preparedness for the potential requirements under OLA. On this page, we've listed the amount and
components of debt at our parent company, which is a subset of the consolidated amounts shown on slide 12. Given
that our parent company has historically been our primary issuance entity for both senior and subordinated debt, we run
with a healthy amount of bail-in capacity based upon a few of the ratios calculated by industry analysts and that we've
included here. We obviously welcome more guidance from the Fed and the FDIC, and we're closely monitoring the
situation for new developments.
Now that I've covered both deposit and long-term debt funding, I'd like to discuss our liquidity resources on slide 15,
which includes unencumbered cash and liquid securities. As you can see, we currently have $376 billion of liquidity
resources, down from the peak of $427 billion at year-end 2010. As we've discussed on prior fixed income calls, during
2011 and the first half of 2012 we've deliberately maintained a substantial liquidity buffer. Given the uncertain
economic outlook and the uncertain pace of balance sheet leveraging, we felt that maintaining significant levels of
liquidity was prudent at that time.
During the second half of 2012, we began to consciously manage down our liquidity portfolio, reflecting the improving
economic outlook in the markets where we operate and our evolving financial position, including our growing deposit
and capital base. We reduced our liquidity buffer primarily by reducing long-term debt, limiting deposit inflows, and
actively deploying cash by lending to our client base. And by managing down our liquidity resources, we've been able

to reduce our cost of funds and improve our net interest margin.
Our outlook continues to be flattish to down slightly during the remainder of the year, though we expect that our
liquidity levels may fluctuate day to day and quarter to quarter due to episodic deposit flows and business-driven assets.
Our liquidity strategy allows us to meet the proposed Basel III liquidity requirements ahead of schedule, as we show on
slide 16. The Basel III liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, is designed to ensure banks maintain adequate liquidity to
withstand an acute 30-day stress scenario. The LCR calculation includes unencumbered cash and highly liquid
unencumbered government, government-backed, and corporate securities in the numerator, and net outflows in the
denominator. The net outflows are calculated by applying assumed outflow factors, as prescribed in regulatory
guidance, to various categories of liabilities such as deposits, secured financing, and unused commitments.
As you recall, in January of this year the Basel Committee amended the LCR requirement. The key changes included
an expanded definition of liquid assets and a change in the outflow estimates for certain types of deposits and
commitments. The rules will phase in from 2015 to 2019. The Basel LCR rules remain in a formative stage and
continue to evolve, and we'll still need to see U.S. rules once they are written.
Based on our current interpretation of the proposed LCR regulatory guidance, we've continued to refine or estimates for
this quarter and prior quarters, as you see on this page. At the end of the first quarter, our estimated LCR was 116%,
flat to year-end 2012 and representing additional liquidity of roughly $52 billion above the required fully phased-in
100% threshold.
Finally, turning to slide 17, let me summarize our capital strength both on a Basel I and Basel III capital basis. As of the
first quarter, we estimate that our Basel I Tier 1 common capital stands at $128 billion, and our Basel I total capital is
$174 billion. Our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio was 11.8%, including the impact of the U.S. market risk rules, which
became effective at the beginning of the quarter, up from 11.1% on a comparable basis last quarter.
Under Basel III, our estimated Tier 1 common ratio as of the first quarter was 9.3%, up [from] 8.7% in the fourth
quarter of 2012, with the increase driven predominantly by our earnings and DTA utilization. Our capital base is one of
the strongest in the industry as compared to both the U.S. and international banking peers. As John mentioned, we now
expect to reach at least 10% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio by year-end 2013.
On slide 18, let me give you some context for how we are optimizing our regulatory capital structure as we prepare to
meet the Basel III requirements on a fully phased-in basis. The left panel illustrates our current capital structure under
Basel I, including the effect of the final U.S. market risk rules, where we had 11.8% Tier 1 common capital and 16.1%
total capital as of the first quarter.
The middle panel illustrates our current Basel III capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis, including our outstanding
trust preferreds as Tier 2 capital. Under the Collins Amendment, our trust preferreds begin to lose qualifying Tier 1
capital treatment this year with a three-year phase-out, but continue to qualify as Tier 2 capital. As a result of this
phase-out, we have begun to redeem our trust preferreds, including the $3 billion which settled last week and will be
reflected during the second quarter. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to redeem further series of TruPS.
The third panel shows the capital structure proposed in a Basel III NPR. Looking ahead to 2019, six years is a
substantial amount of time to make further adjustments to our capital structure. We issued $2.25 billion of preferred
stock in 2012 and an additional $575 million in the first quarter of 2013, bringing our total preferred stock outstanding
to approximately $3.1 billion. We expect to continue to take actions based on the proposed Basel III standards,
including redeeming additional trust preferred securities and issuing preferred stock, as market opportunities arise in
the coming years. The long implementation timelines until 2019 allows us to pace ourselves when accessing the
market.
Moving to our last slide, let me summarize four major points. First, while the environment remains challenging, we
grew both revenues and net income in the first quarter, including a reduced drag for Citi Holdings. We also continued
to grow deposits and loans year over year in our core businesses.

Second, our capital base continues to be one of the strongest in the industry, and this is reflected across every one of
our significant capital ratios, including our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common. We now expect this ratio to reach at
least 10% by the end of the year. Our liquidity remains strong and our estimated liquidity coverage ratio is
approximately 116%, which is comfortably above the proposed required minimum.
Third, we're well reserved and our credit trends remain favorable, reflecting the high quality of both our consumer and
corporate portfolios.
And fourth, we have efficiently managed our balance sheet to approximately $1.9 trillion and continue to expect to run
at this level this year. While we've managed down the overall size, we've also shifted the mix into loans and deposits.
As a result of these purposeful actions, we've reduced our long-term debt footprint substantially in 2012. By
comparison, 2013 reductions will occur at a more measured pace.
That concludes our Fixed Income review. John and I will be happy to take your questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David MacGown.
<Q - David MacGown>: Good morning. A deposit question and then a Dodd-Frank question.
So I think this is for you, Eric, and you were talking about this. Could you talk a little bit about how the Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney deposits that are being transferred over are captured in the LCR today and what impact that will
have on the LCR going forward?
And then the Dodd-Frank question, there was some new guidance put out I think by the FDIC last week around living
wills. And I wondered if you have any perspective for us on how we should be thinking around that.
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: David, it's Eric. Let me start with deposits. The current deposit treatment for – let me start back.
The deposits for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney total about $55 billion. And I think as I mentioned earlier on, about $15
billion will flow out up front; and then subsequent to that, about $5 billion per quarter, so it flows out in a measured
way. Those deposits right now are treated primarily as retail deposits under the output factors that you'd find in the
LCR for that, so they're reasonably high quality. And what our intention would be would simply be to continue our
deposit growth plans, both in consumer and in corporate deposits, each of which are roughly half of our deposit base.
And we think that will over time offset any of the outflows.
<Q - David MacGown>: Thanks, and then the living will question?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: Do you want to be a little more specific?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: David, it's John. Look, the FDIC did come out with – actually the Fed and the FDIC
together came out with some new guidance last week, which we're still in the process of working our way through. But
I think it's more indicative of the fact that this is, as we always thought it would be, much more of an iterative process.
And we would just expect that it's just something else then that we'll have to put into our submissions and we'll work
our way through it. But again, we're still going through some of the details from last week's changes.
<Q - David MacGown>: Thanks, John.

<Q - Robert Smalley>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for doing the call.
With respect to slide 14 on Orderly Liquidation Authority, and thanks for putting that in, could you talk a little bit
about how you guys see the optimal mix between senior and subordinated debt? There has been a lot talked about with
the idea of having a layer of sub debt that should support the senior debt and impact funding positively for senior debt.
On the other hand, we have the ongoing Moody's review. And does that complicate matters?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: Rob, it's Eric here. I think there are a couple answers to those questions.
First, on the optimal mix, the optimal mix is primarily driven by the regulatory requirements here in banking. That
means that we need a certain amount of total debt to fund our non-bank activities primarily, and that is scaled to the
size of those activities. On the other hand, we need sub debt from a Tier 2 capital perspective. And you see there's a
page in the back there where we've dimensioned how much sub debt we have under the Basel I framework, which is
quite healthy. We have enough sub debt under Basel III so far. And so the sub debt effectively becomes scaled to those
regulatory requirements.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. And does the Moody's review complicate that at all in terms of how you see cost of
funding going forward, assuming that there's a high possibility that subordinated debt at the holding company could get
downgraded to below an investment-grade rating?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: I don't think we expect very significant changes in terms of impact on cost of funds or liquidity
from Moody's. If you remember, Moody's is one of three rating agencies. It is doing an industry-wide review. And I
think the rating agency impact would have been a lot higher 10 years – 20 years ago when rating agencies were really
the only method to really understand the strength of a banking institution. Now many of you on the fixed income
investor side do your own proprietary evaluation, and clearly there's an enormous amount of market data, so we don't
see very much impact.
We can also turn back to some of the Moody's announcements in January and February of last year. Remember where
they did a very large and significant industry review with multi-notch potential changes in January and February. We
had an immaterial impact on our liquidity and quite marginal impact on credit spreads. Then in June of last year, they
announced their final decisions; and again, an immaterial impact on liquidity and quite a modest or even marginal
impact on credit spreads. So we don't see a lot of changes specifically from that action.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Great, thanks.

Your next question will come from line of Ryan O'Connell.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Good morning, a couple questions on the business, please. John, you talked about Asia on the
earnings call, but I'd just like to revisit that a little bit. There's yet another [Wall Street] Journal article today about rapid
growth in Asia. You said that creates a drag, so that has been very clear; I guess two questions though. One, you
mentioned I think that Citi was out of the Indonesian card market for a few months, and I guess I didn't have the
background on that. And two is a broader question. Obviously, you've got very good franchises over there. Are you
hanging back a little bit? Do you think your competition is getting a little too conservative? Is that part of what's going
on?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Let me try to address – so the first question was on the Indonesia cards. We've essentially
been out of the market in Indonesia as far as being able to access new credit card customers for almost two years now.
We're allowed to reenter that market beginning in May. So that's one of the things that we talked about.
And then secondly, as far as holding back, I don't view it as – we're not holding back. We are sticking, of course, to our
defined target market, which is much more of an affluent or emerging affluent customer throughout Asia. And so the
growth that we've been able to generate in Asia so far is in tune with that strategy.

Now you need to remember, we said that Korea and Taiwan were both drags. And you take a look at some of the data
that we give you – Korea in and of itself has got something – almost 30% of the loans that we have in the Consumer
business in Asia is in Korea. So when you're undergoing a drag in Korea, it certainly is going to have a much larger
impact then on your franchise.
We do continue to see good growth coming out of Singapore, out of Hong Kong. So it's a mixed bag for our franchise
right now in Asia.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then the other one – and I think this is probably just a
numbers/geography question.
But as Eric pointed out, your corporate loans were up about 9% year over year, which is – that's impressive, frankly.
But then if I look at the Securities & Banking lending revenues, they were down about 7% year over year. So I'm just
trying to square that.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: When you take a look at the revenues themselves – and I guess you're looking at the
revenues excluding the impact of the loan hedges. I'm -
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Yes, this is on page 11 of the slide deck for the earnings conference call.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes. Yes, you've also got – yields for the most part have come down slightly from, again,
last year. It's not that we're seeing a resurgence in yields on the corporate loans. And beyond that, I really don't have
much other commentary to offer.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Okay, that's all right. Thanks a lot.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All right.

Your next question will come from the line of David Knutson.
<Q - David Knutson>: Hi. A couple questions have been asked, but maybe a follow-up then.
On Orderly Liquidation Authority, it seems that you can meet the requirement or some kind of requirement through
issuance but also RWA management. So when you think about a potential rule, does RWA – decreasing your RWAs or
issuance – how does that balance out? Will you favor RWA reductions or favor meeting any kind of requirement
through issuance?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, it's John. I guess first and foremost, we still need to understand whether the rule is
RWA-based or GAAP-asset-based. We don't know.
So again, there is no real formal guidance at this point in time on what the OLA mandate might be based on. So it's a
little difficult to respond to the question as to what we might favor. You're asking for a hypothetical answer to a
hypothetical situation. So I think I'll just hypothetically say I really can't answer that right now.
<Q - David Knutson>: Fair enough. In that same vein then, on the timeline – so there has been some Fed talk – and
you've included a couple of quotes here on the slide deck. But as they come out with some kind of NPR later this year,
the rule doesn't probably get written until well into 2014. And then do you think you get a Basel timeline to implement,
or do you think it will be a little more accelerated?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: When you say a Basel timeline, do you mean all the way out to 2019?
I do anticipate that whatever – assuming that there is additional guidance, I would anticipate that we will have some
timeframe, beyond a year or two, to come into compliance. This could be a significant shift, especially for others in the
industry, where they don't have any significant amount of long-term debt currently at the parent-company level.

For us, I think you're looking at we might need to make an adjustment here or there. Others, it could be a much more
significant impact.
<Q - David Knutson>: And then one last question. Last week, there was some more Fed speak on the idea that some
of your peers have different business styles or structures or risks. So would you expect Citi to favor or to come out of
this review or this rule favorably, relative to other guys, or unfavorably, due to your business mix – your international
exposure perhaps – or something else?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm actually drawing a blank as to what you might be referring to, so I apologize.
<Q - David Knutson>: Well, the idea is if everyone is required to have – let's just say 30% of something -
<A - John C. Gerspach>: You're back on OLA again?
<Q - David Knutson>: Right – okay, I'm sorry. Do you expect Citi will have more or less, given its unique business
mix versus some of your peers?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Again, I'm not quite sure – 30% of what? I don't know what the 30% is. So I'm sorry, I just
can't give you an answer.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.

Your next question will come from the line of Mark Kehoe.
<Q - Mark Kehoe>: Good morning. Just two questions. The first question is if you could talk about the impact of the
FDIC assessment on CLO holdings, and whether that has changed your appetite to hold CLOs in the bank? Or your
perception around that area, please.
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: Mark, it's Eric. The FDIC calculation is pretty complicated from a number of different respects.
And in fact, if you go deeply through the calculation, there are a number of parameters that CLOs and other areas fall
into, whether it's your concentration of top 20 exposures, whether it's some of your market risk, and so forth. And those
all blend together. And so we don't see any large impact from that rule generally on our book.
I think, in addition – I think as you know – we run a pretty pristine book of liquid assets for our liquidity portfolio. We
may have a couple billion dollars of CLOs, but we don't have a significant position which would be impacted one way
or the other.
<Q - Mark Kehoe>: If I can, the next question I had was, can you discuss whether you've seen any changes in the
large corporate deposit area, particularly in the Transaction Services area, with the ending of TAG and corporate
deposits generally moving towards the too-big-to-fail bank versus – I'll just say short-term money market instruments?
And related to that is whether you are more comfortable taking some of these short-term large corporate deposits?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: I think the only material – or the only item that has really changed is the TAG deposits, right?
There were clearly a set of deposits around the system that were in individual banks. We had $10 billion of that, so on
our $900 billion base, 1%. Fairly immaterial. And I think that has been recirculated to other banks in some cases. And
then we had, below the surface, some inflows from others, undoubtedly.
Beyond that one-time move, I don't see a lot of changes in the corporate deposit base. I think our corporate deposit
clients primarily leave their deposits with us because of cash-management accounts, custodial accounts, clearing
accounts. And they continue to do that.

They leave them in a mix of operating balances and time deposits. And over time, I think you can see that we have
shifted that mix. So we are purposely less price-oriented in terms of attracting corporate deposits. I think there's a page
in the appendix where we literally describe that mix shift, and you see it as a pretty positive trend for our corporate
deposits.
I think in terms of money-market accounts, I don't think there's a lot of shift right now from corporate depositors,
whether it's large corporate or middle-market players, into the money-market system. I think the banking-system
deposits, if you look back over the course of the last two decades, have built corporate deposits in a pretty stable way.
And we expect that to continue. As GDP continues to expand, there are more deposits in the system. There's more
money supply. And that money supply invariably ends up at banks in a pretty stable and – sort of a year-on-year
increase as time comes by.

Your next question comes from Louise Pitt with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Louise Pitt>: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for holding the call again. I just have a couple questions. They've
been asked to some degree already.
But I just wanted to ask again about this Orderly Liquidation Authority slide. First of all, thanks for including it. But I
understand that there aren't very many details available.
But how are you guys thinking about whether – two things – it's GAAP or risk-weighted assets? What do you think
makes sense? And whether it's Tier 1 common or whether it's, obviously, debt plus equity? Those ratios that you
provided here, obviously, if you change the numerator and denominator, can change pretty aggressively, depending
upon how you put that together.
My second question is on the liquidity coverage ratio. These numbers that you show on slide 16 – I assume these are
consolidated. Do think that that's the way the LCR ratio is going to go, or are they going to split LCRs among regulated
entities and holding companies the way they're looking at bail-in-able debt?
And then I guess just a very quick question on bail-in-able debt going forward. Is your non-dollar issuance, if you do
any, depending upon jurisdiction of legal entity and market that it's issued in, expected to be bail-in-able at the
holding-company level?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: Louise, those are three substantive questions. Let me try each one of them. And then if you have
follow-ups, well, we'll take those as well.
First on OLA, I think as John said, we just don't know. And so we are doing several things to make sure that we stay
out ahead of this topic.
First, we're doing the calculation any way we can think of doing it. You and others in the publishing – in the credit
publishing community have come up with calculations. We've done GAAP. We've done risk weights in the
denominator. We've done different types of risk weights in the denominator.
In the numerator, we've done parent long-term debt. We've done total long-term debt. We've done sub debt. We've
added preferreds or common. And you see that. And I think the general approach that we're taking is let's consider all
the possibilities, and let's keep track of how we fare under those.
One of the tests of how we fare that we're keeping track of is how we score on those ratios relative to peers. Knowing
that the whole industry may need to adapt, but we want to be ahead of the game here. And I think in most of those
ratios, at least all the ones that we've calculated, we do quite well. And so we're keeping an eye on the relative
performance.

And then finally, we are in constant contact with our regulators. We've read all the published speeches. We talked to
our onsite teams, and we'll continue to do that. And as we hear more, we'll know more. But that's the approach we've
taken, given the uncertainty.
On the LCR question, I think the initial LCR rules will clearly be implemented and imposed on a full-firm basis. That's
the place rules typically start, and that's to be expected here.
You can also, though, I think, be assured it will be implemented over time on a legal-entity or a country basis. We see
that already explicitly mentioned in the Basel rules. We've had local regulators selectively ask about LCRs for
individual entities. And you can imagine, as a multinational firm and a multi-entity firm, we've done our calculations
for many entities. We're aware of our positions.
And as I've said before – and I think this was probably a year or two years back – we tend to run our liquidity from a
self-sufficiency standpoint by entity and by country. We've always had that approach. And as such, we feel we're pretty
prepared for the LCR, not only in aggregate, but also on an entity basis and/or a country basis.
<Q - Louise Pitt>: Okay. And on the FX [ph] debt (54:45) question?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: I think the bail-in rules still need to be written. And so we really don't know. I think we will
certainly be mindful of how international legal standards impact those, and we're going to stay current.
Primarily our issuances tend to be U.S.-dollar-denominated. We have some international issuance. I think we'll
continue that. But as we learn more, we can certainly adjust some of our issuance plans accordingly, if it's something
that's important to do.
<Q - Louise Pitt>: Okay, that's great. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of David Jiang with Prudential.
<Q - David Jiang>: Hi. I have a quick question and a follow-up.
On the liquidity resources, we saw that the dollar amount has gone down $51 billion from its peak, but up $16 billion
from year-end. I'm a little surprised at that. Is it just opportunistic issuance in the first quarter?
And I know you have some guidance around it going down to being flat in 2013. Is that versus 2012 numbers or versus
1Q ending numbers?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: Let me answer, I think, the two-part question you've asked there, David. It's Eric speaking.
Overall, we expect the liquidity resources to trend down from the end of 2011, which was the $400 billion level, into
the $360 billion, $370 billion, $350 billion, some area around that. And I think that's still pretty healthy, given that we
run well above the 100% level.
That said, we are going to see some period – end-of-quarter volatility. The LCR is calculated literally on one day. That
one day is at the end of the quarter, and clearly our balance sheet shifts a bit on any particular day.
If you look at the end of 2012 versus the first quarter of 2013, it's up $16 billion. Some of that was period-end deposit
growth, which is up $4 billion or $5 billion. Part of that is loans coming down. As loans come down, we generate cash;
that ends up in the cash account. And then there was a few billion dollars from the equity build. The three of those
factors are the main drivers of the quarterly changes.
And I think that's an example of the kind of quarter-end changes we may see in any particular quarter. And so clearly
we'll want to run within a band here.

<Q - David Jiang>: Got you, thanks. On page 14, on OLA, there is a Section E for other debt – that $61 billion. Now
that's not included in your calculations because that's intermediate company debt that may not qualify?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: That's correct. The early views of OLA – which are all supposition, right, because there are no
rules – are primarily focused on parent-company debt.
If you go back a page or two, you see that we had $234 billion of total debt in the company. $174 billion is parent
company, which is lines A, B, C, and D added together. And then there is $61 billion that is outside of the parent
company, primarily in the bank. There are some securitized borrowings there, there's a little FHLB borrowing and so
forth. And what we've done is just categorized it so that you can do the calculations either total or parent only, given
that we just don't know at this point how any calculation would actually get done.
<Q - David Jiang>: Could you have legal structure optimization there to re-cash that debt at the parent company if you
wanted to?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: At this point, that debt is pretty well separate. If you think about it, $61 billion out of the $234
billion is material, but it is primarily in the bank. So it's securitized issuances, it's FHLB. Those are really bank-level
funding structures and really couldn't be moved one way or the other. The bottom line though is when we do a
calculation on the core parent company, it actually is pretty healthy when you look at the percentages lower down on
the page and obviously compared to some of the others in the industry.
<Q - David Jiang>: Great, one last final one. On the Citi Holdings RWA, you've done a pretty good job of getting that
number down on a Basel III basis. I think you went from 28% to 23%. Is there a point where it just slows down unless
you continue to sell more assets? And then on the Citigroup side, which is what the 80% of RWA that's remaining on a
Basel III basis, are there any plans for active RWA mitigation there that you can guide to?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, hi. It's John. On the holding side of the RWA question, I'd say we were at that level
now that you were referring to as far as when things could begin to slow. Where we see the most leverage as far as the
ability to reduce risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings is really in the SAP [Special Asset Pool] portfolio, and that is
becoming an increasingly smaller segment then of Holdings. So you're going to see it slow except for those episodic
sales or reductions that we may get out of that portfolio.
As far as the overall – the balance of the risk-weighted assets, we'll always continue to attempt to make sure that we are
using risk-weighted assets in the most efficient means possible. But I don't envision any large-scale mitigations that
you could expect to see in our ongoing Citicorp risk-weighted assets structure.
<Q - David Jiang>: Great, thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.

The next question will come from the line of Don Jones with Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Don Jones>: Good morning, and this deck is very informative. Thanks for again hosting this call.
A couple things. I think you had said earlier in the discussion that preferreds will continue to play an increasing role
within the comp structure. And I'm curious how you'll think about that, given the focus on common Tier 1 ratio as well
as OLA debt measures and how everyone has been looking what again is bail-in-able. Is preferred useful in a
meaningful sense beyond the amounts that you've already issued?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: It's Eric here. I think the best page to really turn to is page 18, where we try to lay out the
current position under Basel III in the middle panel there and then the eventual position. Clearly, when Basel III is fully
phased in – now that's 2019, so that's more than half a decade from now, we need up to 1.5 points of preferreds, and
clearly we'll comply with this requirement. That said, to the extent that we continue to build some Tier 1 common and

it's above the 9.5%, that fills in that 1.5 percentage point bucket. So we could satisfy that 1.5 percentage point bucket at
the far right with a little bit of common plus preferreds. But this is really the guiding fact base. Right now, you see that
we have preferreds of about $3 billion, call it 0.3 percentage points. Over time we'll build that, but we've got some
time. We've got half a decade plus to go, and we'll clearly fill that out accordingly.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And obviously, this is John. There are a lot more rules yet to be written. So that's why, as
Eric said, we'll continue to look at it. We'll continue to do some level of issuance, but we're not rushing into anything at
this point in time.
<Q - Don Jones>: Sure, okay. Thank you. And then secondly, a question was asked earlier about the Moody's review
in a couple cases. And obviously, Citi did very well within this Global Securities division. But what sensitivity do think
there would be in terms of the ability to do business in the Securities division if Moody's were to, in fact, take down
implicit support a notch down for some reason or another?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: Don, it's Eric. We really don't see any material impact from a Moody's review in terms of our
ability to trade, write derivatives, interact with clients, hold their deposits, and so on and so forth. I think there was a lot
of interest on the topic last year. For example, last year I think there was a lot of speculation January and February, and
we just didn't have any changes in our client activity when the possibility of a multi-notch downgrade was put out. And
obviously, we actually didn't know how many notches would change. And we had quite a bit of an overhang in terms of
not knowing for what was five months. And I think if that five months didn't really create an impact on our business, I
just don't see that this current review is going to have any material impact that we can find.
<Q - Don Jones>: Okay, thanks again.

Our final question will come from the line of Michael Rogers with Conning Asset Management.
<Q - Michael J. Rogers>: Yes, good morning. Could you comment on the burgeoning debate about this apparent
Government Accountability Office study, which talks about trying to put a number on the size of the implicit regulatory
subsidy enjoyed by the too-big-to-fail banks, and how that could translate into fuel for the two senators who are clearly
trying to exact an even higher capital requirement from the big too-big-to-fail banks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, this is John. I think you've actually captured it as far as the fact that it is an ongoing
debate. You've also seen some commentary that came out last week from, I think, it was Mary Miller at Treasury
wondering whether or not there actually was any, in fact, subsidy. So I think you're going to continue to have some
elements say there is and some elements say there is not, and it's just a debate that we're tracking.
<Q - Michael J. Rogers>: Okay, if I could follow up with one more. On the sub debt issue, if Moody's indeed did
bring down your sub debt rating to let's say Ba1, isn't it maybe still – maybe isn't a little bit shortsighted to think that
with the universe of potential buyers of your sub debt narrowing possibly considerably if that were to happen that the
cost of your sub debt would not go up potentially rather meaningfully if it crossed the big divide from Baa3 to Ba1?
<A - Eric W. Aboaf>: Michael, it's Eric. I think there's always a possibility that a small negative event will push
spreads a touch wider. I think the full context though is that we and many other banks haven't been issuing debt in the
size that we used to pre-crisis. There's an enormous appetite every time we go out to issue, whether it's a senior or sub
debt. Books are three, four, five times oversubscribed.
And I also think we have a set of very interested investors who've done very well in investing in our senior debt over
the last few years. I think they are looking for the yield advantage that you get in sub debt, which right now is 40, 50,
60 basis points. So they've been asking us about when we'll issue. We've issued a little bit, as you saw this past quarter,
and we continue to see demands there. And then we see demands further down the capital structure with the preferreds,
which are wider still, but have come in quite a bit here over the last year. And so there is just such a significant demand
for those instruments relative to the supply. We just don't see material dislocation. Could there be a few basis points?
