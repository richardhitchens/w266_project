And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Hey. Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review
guidance for Q4, and then I'll turn the call over to Mark and then Larry. Just so you all know, we're not all in the same
place today, so we may all answer at once, so just give us a chance.
Clearly, we are delighted with our results, as software and cloud revenue was at the high end of my guidance and
earnings per share was $0.06 above the high end of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud is now clearly in full swing.
We continue to see outsized growth rates in our cloud business, especially when compared with our key competitors,
who are all seeing slowing growth. But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business has
overtaken new software license declines on an annual basis. Next year, I expect our cloud revenue will be larger than
our new software license revenue.
The investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud have been important to ensure that Oracle remains a
technology leader, and we're now beginning to see the benefits in our results. With cloud overtaking new software
license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade
as a license business. That is growing revenue with disciplined cost management that results in EPS and cash flows that
grow even faster. I expect EPS growth to ramp up throughout next year.
We continue to use constant dollar rates on our quarterly calls so that we can have some measure of consistency across
the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movement were
largely in line with my guidance of 1% currency headwind for revenue and $0.01 negative impact to EPS.
Cloud, SaaS and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 86% from last year. You can also see the continued
strength of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance
is now over $2 billion, up 75% in U.S. dollars, and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 111% in U.S. dollars this quarter.
We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.
When you add together cloud SaaS/PaaS revenues and new software license revenue together, we grew 11% in
constant currency. This is a significant milestone in our transformation, where the combination of our cloud and new
software license business added together are growing. As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the
growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flows following along.
As our SaaS/PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q3
gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 65%, up from 51% last year, and I expect it to be about the same – in the same
region in Q4. I expect that our total SaaS/PaaS gross margin will continue to trend toward 80% over time.
Cloud infrastructure as a service revenue was $178 million, up 19% from last year. The Q3 gross margin was 30% as
we continue to make the necessary investments to scale out this business. As we make additional investments, the
expenses hit immediately while the revenue is recognized over time so the gross margin in this part of the business
could decline to roughly about 20% over the next few quarters, after which I expect gross margins will climb to more
than 40% as the business scales.
Total cloud revenue in the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion with the growth modestly accelerating to 72% in
constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.2 billion with software updates and
product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year.
Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high level as our installed base of customers continue to grow. In fact,
they actually increased. New software license revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, down 15%, reflecting the continued
emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware including hardware support was down 9% with hardware system
product revenue of $520 million and hardware support revenue of $508 million, again, reflecting our focus on the move
to the cloud.

For the company, total revenues for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income
was $3.9 billion, up 4% from last year, and the operating margin was 43%, up from 42% last year. The non-GAAP tax
rate for the quarter was 21.6% as the rate was favorably impacted by some one-time benefits and some other factors,
including favorable geographic mix this quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69 in USD, up from $0.64, and up 8% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate
was 17% and the GAAP EPS was $0.53 in USD, up from $0.50 last year.
Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.5 billion, which is lower because of the rapid growth we are
seeing as we transition to cloud as having an impact on our working capital. Our operational metrics like DSO and days
payable are stable, so it's just largely an effect of growth on working capital and timing.
Capital expenditures for Q3 were $440 million with about a third of this from real estate, while most of the rest was
cloud build-out and internal use. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $11.8 billion. We now have
approximately $59 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $5 billion.
The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.5 billion, up 7% in constant-currency.
This quarter, we repurchased approximately 13 million shares for a total of $500 million. Over the last 12 months,
we've repurchased 124 million shares for a total of $5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the board of
directors increased the quarterly dividend 27% from $0.15 to $0.19 per share.
Now let me go to the guidance. Because we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates, we do also expect to
see significant currency headwinds. I'm going to give you constant-currency guidance, but if the current exchange rates
remain the same throughout the quarter as they are right now, we actually expect to see currency headwind of 2% on
revenue and $0.02 negative impact on EPS.
These currency headwinds are higher than last quarter, meaning that most of your Q4 estimates do not yet reflect the
incremental revenue and EPS headwinds of an additional negative impact of 1% and $0.01 to EPS.
All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that, my guidance is as follows: SaaS and PaaS revenue,
including NetSuite, is expected to grow 69% to 73%, effectively raising my full year guidance from 80% to 81% for
the year. We're beginning to see an increasing and favorable attach between our PaaS and IaaS orders, so I'm going to
provide guidance on IaaS as well this quarter.
IaaS is expected to grow 25% to 29%. Software and cloud revenue including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software
license and software support is expected to grow 1% to 3%. Total revenue is expected to grow from negative 1% to
positive 2%. EPS is expected to be between $0.78 and $0.82 in constant-currency. Now this assumes a non-GAAP tax
rate of 23.5%, but of course, the Q4 tax rate could end up being different.
With that, I'm going to turn this over to Mark, and then Larry follows him.
Mark V. Hurd
All right. Thanks, Safra. We thought Q3 would be strong going in, and as you can see, it turned out to be just that. I'm
going to give you a bunch of numbers here and try to give you a little bit more insight to the quarter.
First, in ARR, we booked $545 million in USD. Every number I'm going to give you is actually in CD unless I say
differently. $545 million in USD, $557 million in CD; that is up 73% and the second-best quarter we have ever had.
SaaS bookings were $322 million in USD and PaaS infrastructure bookings were $223 million in USD. Cloud revenue
was up 72%, and we are now at an annualized $5 billion run rate. SaaS/PaaS revenue was up 86%. We're the
fastest-growing scale cloud business in the world, and that is on top – that growth rate is on top of last year's 60%.
In ERP, we were up 280% organically, and with NetSuite, ERP is now our largest pillar. Fusion HCM was up 106%.
That's more than three times the growth rate of Workday. CX was up 16%, with marketing and service both over $100

million in quarterly revenue. Our verticals up were 109% and also over $100 million in quarterly revenue. Database as
a Service was up 427%. Our database business including all of our on-premise business is now growing.
PaaS was up 375% year-to-date, with middleware cloud services up 300%. As Safra mentioned, SaaS/PaaS billings
were up 111% in USD. SaaS/PaaS deferred revenue was up 75% in USD.
Now some customer metrics: 1,125 new SaaS customers in the quarter, 908 expansions, 210 customers who bought
SaaS also bought PaaS. CX, we had 480 new customers and 586 expansions. In HCM, we had 206 new customers and
217 expansions. In ERP, we had 564 new customers that does not include NetSuite. We got 120 expansions. 50% of
our new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before they bought this quarter.
Our active base of ERP customers is now approaching 3,700, 1,465 are live, 10x Workday. In total, we now have
13,103 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 with NetSuite. Two thirds of our new customer wins were for
Fusion, 283 go lives for Fusion, 2,444 customers are now live on Fusion. We have 2,380 new PaaS customers in the
quarter and 2,586 new customers buying standalone infrastructure as a service. As a point of clarity, PaaS and
infrastructure customers are counted for each service that they buy.
Lastly, this was an excellent quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue were all extremely solid. Now a few predictions.
Q3 bookings growth was strong. As I mentioned, 73%. We will book at least $2 billion in ARR this year. Q3 revenue
growth was impressive at 72% and with revenue now at an annualized run rate of $5 billion, we are clearly the fastest
growing cloud company at scale.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you, Mark. Let's see. Generation two of Oracle's infrastructure as a service cloud now has the ability to run our
customers' largest databases, something that is impossible to do using Amazon Web Services. Amazon can only run
relatively small Oracle databases in their cloud.
Gen2 of Oracle IaaS also delivered ultra-high database performance and fault-tolerant reliability in the cloud. Many
Oracle workloads now run 10 times faster in the Oracle cloud versus the Amazon cloud. It also costs less to run Oracle
workloads in the Oracle cloud than the Amazon cloud. As a result, some of our largest customers are negotiating huge
infrastructure-as-a-service contracts to move all their databases to the Oracle cloud. You can expect some of those big
deals to be announced in the coming weeks.
SaaS growth in the infrastructure as a service business is new for us. We have done well in SaaS and in PaaS over the
past few years. But this is the first time we've ever had a technology lead in infrastructure as a service. We are now in
position to help our hundreds of thousands of database customers move millions of Oracle databases to our
infrastructure as a service cloud.
SaaS and PaaS are large, rapidly growing businesses for us. Together, SaaS and PaaS grew 85% this past quarter. But
soon infrastructure-as-a-service will be growing even faster and before long, infrastructure-as-a-service will become
Oracle's largest cloud business. In summary, all of Oracle's cloud businesses are growing rapidly and IaaS will be
leading the way in the future. Thanks.
Kenneth Bond
Thank you, Larry. Holly, if we could prepare the audience for the Q&A portion of the call now?

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Thanks very much, and congrats on a very nice third quarter. My question is for Mark. Mark,
obviously a really nice quarter across the board but particularly from a cloud bookings perspective. Can you talk about
what changed, if anything, in the quarter versus the third quarter or the second quarter, either in terms of the macro
backdrop or better execution? And just relatedly would be interested in what you're seeing in the pipeline that gives you
further confidence in that $2 billion ARR target? Thanks.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Kirk, I felt good about Q1, I felt good about Q2, I feel good about Q3. I didn't feel any major
change. It's just really the timing of when bookings closed. We had a very strong set of quality wins. If you went into
HCM, just to give you some idea, Kirk, we closed America Movil in the quarter, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Ford,
Emerson, Hilton, Hyundai Motor, Jefferies, Rogers Communications. We had a very strong set of logos in the quarter.
In ERP, we closed Charter and Club Corp. Cummins, Lufthansa, DISH Network. It was just a – I could go on. I don't
have time to tell you all of these deals, but we saw it going in. We felt it would happen. It did and I think our team
executed well.
I would say, Kirk, that there was no – it wasn't geographically centered and it wasn't pillar centered. As I mentioned
earlier, we had incredible growth in ERP, 280% organically. We had 106% growth in HCM. We had strong growth in
our sales automation business. And it wasn't unique to one geography. So, we ended the quarter broad-based across
pillar, across geography.
In terms of going forward, our pipeline is big. I've said it before, I'll say it again, our pipeline's growth, if you looked at
it year-over-year resembles all the growth rates you've heard in terms of what you've seen in terms of our bookings
growth this quarter. And I think our execution just continues to get better.
So I would also add in the quarter that NetSuite's performance accelerated. So from their last reported quarter in terms
of bookings growth, their growth in the quarter, which for them was an odd thing because they're not used to having a
December/January/February quarter, but when you compare it apples-to-apples, they grew faster than their last reported
quarter in terms of bookings as well. So it was a very good quarter for us.
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Our next question is going to come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Hi. Thank you very much. Mark, you must be wearing a suit and Larry maybe you're wearing a
sweater because you're talking tech and Mark is talking applications. So I'm going to direct my applications question to
Mark, if you don't mind. Mark, can you talk about what's ahead for cloud SaaS? Obviously, there's manufacturing,
order entry, supply chain, those kinds of things that could go to the cloud. How should we think about the cycle ahead
in that regard? Thank you very much.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Well, in ERP, listen, there's a big change for us in ERP. This is not the world of two providers
and us talking about upgrade cycles. What's happened to us in ERP and I go back to the fact that 50% of our customers
in the quarter were just brand new to us. They never had bought ERP from us before. And what happened is our total
available market has just become incredibly large. If you looked at the persona of our customers that are in ERP cloud
today, they were not – or most of them, more than 50% of them today were not an Oracle ERP customer before they
bought from us.
So I don't think, Kash, it's really more of a cycle. I think it's really more of just an inflection point for us in terms of
we're now at a place where we have almost 4,000 customers in ERP SaaS. Many of our on-prem customers have not
moved, and yet we're in a position where we can go get a whole set of customers that we never had access to before.

Midmarket customers, we can do that globally, and we can go now for customers that want to move to a SaaS
application in the cloud and get all of those benefits. Frankly, our competitors' user bases have all opened up to us. And
so I don't see it quite as a cycle. As I see it as a big change in the opportunity for us in terms of the total available
market we can go after. Larry may have a comment or two he'd like to add as well.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: No. Again, I couldn't agree with Mark more. It would be our ability now to service much
smaller customers than we could service in the past is because the cloud allows you to deploy ERP at much, much
lower cost. You don't have to have [ph] feet, (23:43) you don't have to build the data center. Obviously, you don't have
to hire programmers. You don't have to hire a bunch of data operations people. We do all that for you, and therefore,
the available market is at least double what it used to be. And we're also beginning to see, as Mark said, SAP customers
moving over their ERP and some very, very large SAP customers looking very closely at our ERP systems. So we
expect to have some big wins in the SAP installed base that, again, we could announce in the coming months.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
And our next question is going to come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey. Thank you, and congrats from me as well. I had a question around 12c. So you have
12c now in the cloud for a good few months, and I saw last week, it's now available on-premise. Can you talk a little bit
about the early feedback from customers you saw on release two in the cloud? And what does it mean now that it's
available on-premise? Obviously, in the olden days, that kind of spiked a little bit of an uptick in the database license
growth. I'm just wondering how we have to think about it now in the new cloud world. Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay. For one thing, it's important to note that our cloud business, our license business for
database is growing. So our on-prem database business continues to grow. I'm not talking about support; I'm talking
about new licenses. That business is growing and grew to start Q3. An awful lot of our customers are planning to move
their database workloads to our cloud, but they're going to bring their own license. In other words, they own a bunch of
Oracle licenses and they're just going to move those licenses to our infrastructure-as-a-service.
So we expect our database license business to continue to grow, to continue to respond kind of as it has in the past. In
other words, as cool new features become available like faster in-memory processing, the ability to take an existing
single-tenant application and automatically turn it into a multi-tenant application could be very attractive to our
customers and our ISVs. They'll buy more licenses. They may then in turn bring those licenses to the cloud. So we
expect our on-premise, or better said, our database license business to continue to grow and accelerate because of 12.2.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect. Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Just as a follow up, because I know what Larry meant. It's our database business grew, support
plus license plus database-as-a-service. Those three categories together, our database business grew in the quarter. Next
question?
Operator
Our next question is going to come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Philip Winslow>: Hey. Thanks, guys, and congrats again on a great quarter. I really wanted to focus in, in
particular on the PaaS line, because, obviously, you guys put up a huge ARR quarter there. Safra, you mentioned
increasing attach of IaaS to PaaS. And part of our thesis has been, since you rolled out the new data center 2.0 model on
IaaS, that increasing attach there would then drive acceleration in the PaaS business. So the question to, I guess, all
three of you, the jump ball, is what are you seeing since the announcement at OpenWorld on ISI? And how is that
impacting? How do you expect it to impact the PaaS business?

<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Well, I mean, so there's a lot of questions you had in one question there. So I mean, I think
the point we continue to try to indicate is that we've seen a continual connect of first PaaS to SaaS. So we've had a
bunch of SaaS customers who typically buy an application and now we're starting to get up into where we see 20%,
25% connectivity of when somebody buys a SaaS application, they buy PaaS. I think part of what we're talking about
with attach with infrastructure is it becomes a bit hard to differentiate in some cases what is a pure infrastructure and
what is PaaS because the customer now buys the computer or buys the computing, buys the storage, et cetera, along
with PaaS.
And so you begin to get a blurring to a degree of the infrastructure business and the database business. But no question
about it, we continue to see the attach rate continue to [ph] incline (28:28) of PaaS, to our SaaS business, which I think
was your – at the core of your first question, Phil.
<Q - Philip Winslow>: Yes, sort of the attach of the two, yeah.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yeah. For our database customers, when they come in, they can order PaaS, or they can bring
their licenses, use IaaS, and as a general matter, when they're running a database workload, they've probably got
something else, too, and so they're going to need some IaaS to actually run their application when they're not our [ph]
PaaS (28:58) application. So we're seeing these together very often, and so I figured as we're moving to our more
advanced IaaS from what you used to have, I thought I would break it out for you so you'd see it.
<Q - Philip Winslow>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is going to come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies & Company.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Thank you. My question is for Safra. Safra, you've previously talked about double-digit constant
currency earnings growth for next year. You had meaningful outperformance this quarter and your guide was better
than where the Street is. I guess you also mentioned in your prepared remarks about EPS ramping through next year. I
guess just to clarify, do you expect to still achieve double-digit growth? And is that exiting the year it'll be double-digit
growth? Or are you talking about for the entire year?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: So I expect that when you look at the entire year, it will be double-digit growth, but it will start
smaller and get bigger as we get through the year. So Q1, I don't know right now. It's a little too early. We'll talk again.
As to what I'm going to see, things looks nice. But we'll talk again in June on Q1. And I think by the end of the year,
the only question is which quarter we switch right into double digits? And it's a little too early to tell, but I expect to see
it for the year.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Okay. Great. And just if I could a quick follow up on a related profitability note. The one thing in
the results this quarter was cash flow actually declined from a year ago I think this quarter. You mentioned in your
prepared remarks working capital and timing issues. Can you just provide a little more detail on what you mean by
that?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yeah. I mean, there's really nothing in it. It is pretty much just timing of when we paid stuff
and things like that. We'll be filing our Q. Our plan is to file it on Friday. You can spend the weekend digging through
it. We dug through it. There's nothing interesting going on whatsoever. We're growing and it's really just timing of
different working capital impacting accounts. Really nothing in particular.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Okay. Great. Looking forward to that weekend.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: With the Oracle Q, yes.

<Q - John DiFucci>: Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Thanks, John. Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is going to come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking my question and nice quarter. Maybe one for Larry just
to clarify sort of the positioning on infrastructure as a service. When we think about the Gen2 offering, is the
positioning a platform for your customers to run Oracle workloads primarily? Or is this more of a general purpose
platform that you expect to go head on with AWS and Azure for general purpose type workloads?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: It's absolutely a general purpose workload because with the Oracle database as a back end,
we have no idea what that application might be. It could be a banking application. It could be a DNA base pair
matching application. There are millions or tens of millions of Oracle applications running. They're going to have to
move infrastructure as a service, and the back end will probably run the database in PaaS. But we have to have a
completely generalized infrastructure as a service offering. That's what we built and we think we have performance and
cost advantages with our new Gen2 over both Amazon and Azure.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Excellent. Thank you.

And our next question is going to come from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.
<Q - Sarah Hindlian>: Great. Thank you so much and congratulations on the quarter. I would love, Safra, if you could
give us an early indication or any potential impact you expect on the business model from FASB and IASB initiating
new revenue recognition policies. Whatever you're seeing or thinking there that we should be starting to think about
would be helpful.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Sure. For us, it's no big deal, actually. It's really very much a non-event. I do hear one of our
competitors talking all sorts of stuff about it. No effect for us, de minimis. Maybe they're trying to talk about something
else. But in our case, we're not actually early adopting, but it doesn't make a difference, really. Zero impact whatsoever
on cash flows and no impact on what we disclose to you or any of those things that this other company is talking about.
For us, it's really nothing.
<Q - Sarah Hindlian>: All right. Thank you. That's very helpful.
Operator
Okay. And our final question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. This one is actually for Larry. I was
wondering if you could share with us, it does appear that the company is coming to an inflection point in regards to
your transition to the cloud. And given the results from today and your commentary about Q4 and the earnings growth
for next year, how long do you think this could run?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Well, we have a very, very large database business. We have hundreds of thousands of
database customers. And we have millions and millions of applications that run on the Oracle database. Most of those
databases and most of those customers will move most of those databases and most of those workloads to the cloud.
And we think our cloud will be – right now, we have a huge technology lead over both Amazon and Azure with our
new Generation 2 infrastructure-as-a-service. We can deliver ultra-high performance.

People have been buying these Exadata database machines and are getting used to running very large databases very,
very fast. And we can deliver comparable ultra-high performance at very, very low cost in our cloud. So we think, how
long does it take to migrate several hundred thousand customers and several million databases to the Oracle cloud? And
I think the rate of migration is going to accelerate over the years, but it's going to be at least a five-year run of very,
very rapid growth as our database business begins to move.
You've seen what it's like. Our application business began to move to the cloud several years ago. And – but that's a
little bit different. I mean, that was a – we built all-new applications, and they migrated from an old application, either
an old SAP application or an old PeopleSoft application or an E-Business Suite and they migrated to our new Fusion
ERP suite. That's very different than simply lifting up an Oracle database workload and moving it over to Oracle. The
application goes to infrastructure-as-a-service, and then the database goes to platform-as-a-service. That's a faster
process, but a much larger installed base. Again, my estimate is that business will move over the – the majority of it
will move over the next five years, and that's going to give us enormous growth rates over that five-year period.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Thank you.
