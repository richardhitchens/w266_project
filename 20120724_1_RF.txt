O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and your participation in our
second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Regions delivered another quarter of improved financial results, building
on our momentum from earlier this year. In short, the company reported prudent and profitable growth driven by solid
business performance and we continued to see broad-based improvements in our asset quality.
Second quarter pre-tax, pre-provision income was $503 million, 15% higher than in the first quarter, and earnings from
continuing operations were at an improved level of $0.20 per diluted share. As you are aware, earlier in the quarter, we
repaid the US Treasuries preferred stock investment and therefore incurred accelerated accretion charges. Excluding
these charges and the final preferred stock dividends, earnings from continuing operations would have been $0.25 per
diluted share.
While our results reflect some encouraging and positive trends, the US economy continues to improve at an uneven and
slow pace. The economy continues to work through structural headwinds, including deleveraging, high unemployment,
a weak housing market and fiscal consolidation at the local, state and national levels. Within Regions' markets, job
growth has been approximately on par with the US as a whole. Importantly, with respect to housing, we are seeing
modest and incremental improvements in most of our markets. In particular, the Florida metro markets. While housing
remains soft in many markets, there are signs of recovery. We are pleased that we are able to deliver solid business
results despite the challenging economic landscape.
Looking at several important metrics, our second quarter results demonstrate that we are executing well against our
business priorities. Despite the persistent challenge of a low interest rate environment, our margin expanded for the
third consecutive quarter. The improvement largely reflects lower deposit costs, declines in nonaccrual balances, and a
reduction in excess cash reserves at the Federal Reserve. There's still an opportunity for further improvements in
deposit costs, which will largely support a stable margin, even if market interest rates remain at these levels.
And while our long-term debt levels are low relative to our peers, we continue to evaluate liability management
opportunities. Although total outstanding loan balances were down less than 1%, total loan production increased a
healthy 15% linked quarter. We experienced improved growth in our commercial industrial portfolios, which helped to
offset the favorable decline in investor real estate portfolio. Our loan-to-deposit ratio remains conservative and provides
considerable flexibility to continue to take advantage of profitable lending opportunities that will benefit future revenue
growth.
Our mortgage loan production and related fee income improved significantly this quarter, as customers continue to take
advantage of historically low interest rates and HARP II opportunities. We experienced growth in both refinancing and
new home purchase. We continue to be disciplined and rigorous in our focus on improving operating efficiency. At the
same time we are continuing to invest in new technology and people where appropriate. In the second quarter, we
began the implementation of new technology in our banking offices that will enhance our cross-sell capabilities,
streamline and enhance our customers' experience and reduce our overall operating expenses.
We also posted another quarter of broad-based improvement in asset quality, exceeding our own internal expectations,
confirming what we believe was a pivotal turn in the first quarter. Importantly, improving asset quality is enabling us to
focus more of our resources and energy on executing strategies that profitably leverage our opportunity for revenue

growth.
With respect to capital, our improved ratios bolstered by recent capital actions position us well for the future. We are
still reviewing the latest notices for proposed rulemaking regarding capital, but expect to be fully compliant well before
the rules are officially phased in.
The first half of 2012 has been transformational for Regions and with several quarters of solid results and continued
successful execution against our plans, we believe Regions is better positioned for ultimate out-performance.
I will now turn the call over to David Turner, who will discuss second quarter's financial details. Afterward I will come
back and make a few closing comments. David.
David J. Turner
Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin on slide three, with a quick snapshot of our second
quarter 2012 financial results. We reported net income available to common shareholders of $284 million or $0.20 per
diluted share. Income from discontinued operations totaled $4 million, primarily related to the gain on the Morgan
Keegan sale. Early in the second quarter, we repaid the Series A preferred stock investment made by the US Treasury.
In conjunction with this repayment, earnings were impacted by the acceleration of the accretion of the discount and
along with preferred dividends, totaled $71 million or $0.05 per diluted share.
Pre-tax, pre-provision income from continuing operations or PPI was $503 million. Net interest income increased $11
million or 1% linked quarter, and the resulting net interest margin increased 7 basis points. Non-interest revenues
decreased 3% on a linked quarter basis, while non-interest expenses were down 8%. From a credit standpoint, net
charge-offs were down 20% and the total loan loss provision declined 78%.
Let's get into the details starting with the balance sheet. Average loans for the second quarter were down $498 million
or less than 1% linked quarter. Despite a low interest rate environment, our loan yields remain steady. Balances were
impacted by a decline of $664 million, or 7% in the investor real estate portfolio. At quarter end, balances stood at $9.4
billion, down almost $4 billion from one year ago. This portfolio now comprises only 12% of our total loan portfolio,
compared to 17% a year ago. We expect this portfolio to continue to decline at a moderate pace over the next few
quarters.
Commercial and industrial loan demand remain healthy in the second quarter, driven by our specialized lending groups.
On an ending base, commercial and industrial loans grew $892 million or 4% first to second quarter. The growth in this
portfolio is aiding to offset the decline in the investor real estate portfolio. While growth was broad based
geographically, we experienced particularly strong growth in health care, asset-based lending, and the real estate
corporate banking division, which provides REIT financing.
Pipelines remain solid and are slightly above the same level at this time last year as our clients fund capital
expenditures, working capital needs and increasingly M&A activity. Line utilization on commercial industrial loans
was up 130 basis points linked quarter to just over 44% and commitments have increased 11% over the last year.
Now moving on to consumer services, average mortgage balances declined 1% linked quarter, reflecting our continued
strategy to sell fixed rate conforming mortgages. The company also experienced additional loan declines in the home
equity portfolio, as consumers continued to refinance and/or deleverage.
At the end of the second quarter, we started our rollout of our new credit card product line and an enhanced
Relationship Rewards program. Additionally, we will convert these cards on to our system in the third quarter, which
will allow us to better control the customer experience and should enable us to increase sales production going forward.
Indirect auto continues to be an area of growth, as loan production in this portfolio increased 15% over last quarter and
average loan balances increased 6%. Notably, total consumer loan production totaled $2.8 billion in the second quarter,
up 24% linked quarter. Total loan balances for the remainder of the year are expected to remain relatively stable with
second quarter's balances.

Let's move on to deposits. As shown on slide five, deposit mix and cost continued to improve in the second quarter.
Average loan cost deposits increased $1.7 billion from last quarter and over $5 billion from one year ago. Average
higher cost CDs declined almost $2 billion linked quarter and $5.3 billion from last year. Total average deposits were
relatively steady linked quarter and year over year. Average time deposits fell to just 18% of total deposits, down from
23% a year ago as a result of our continued success in growing low cost deposits. This positive mix shift resulted in
deposit cost declining to 32 basis points for the quarter, down 5 basis points from first quarter and 21 basis points from
one year ago.
We expect to drive additional improvement in deposit cost. We have approximately $2.9 billion of CDs that are
scheduled to mature in the third quarter that carry an average interest rate of 1.2% and an additional $3 billion at 2.1%
that will mature in the fourth quarter. Now looking ahead to 2013, we currently have $6.5 billion of CDs that will
mature. Of that, $4.6 billion mature in the first half, with an average rate of 1.8% and $1.9 billion in the second half
with an average rate of 0.8%. Now this compares to our current average going on rates for new CDs of approximately
20 basis points.
Our total funding costs improved 5 basis points linked quarter to 60 basis points and we will continue to evaluate the
capital and liquidity benefits of our two outstanding trust preferred securities, as well as other liability management
opportunities.
Let's turn to net interest income on slide six. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income was up $11 million
or 1%. The resulting net interest margin was up 7 basis points to 3.16%. The net interest margin benefited from
reductions in overall deposit cost, reduction in nonaccrual balances and a decline in low yielding cash balances at the
Federal Reserve. Last quarter, we deployed some of our excess cash into higher yielding corporate and consumer
mortgage backed securities, thus decreasing the negative impact of the excess cash reserves by 5 basis points to 8 basis
points in the second quarter.
At the end of the quarter, cash at the Federal Reserve totaled approximately $1.8 billion, which is in line with our target
operating level. The negative impact of nonaccruals on the margin declined 3 basis points to 7 basis points in the
second quarter. Now currently our investment portfolio amounts to $27.2 billion or 25% of average earning assets. The
future size of the investment portfolio will largely depend on the dynamics of the rest of the balance sheet. Loan
demand remains somewhat soft relative to the availability of stable deposits and we expect to continue to sell
conforming mortgages to the agencies in favor of retaining that exposure within securities.
In the latter half of the second quarter, long-term rates declined to record lows, and should rates persist at these levels,
growing net interest income in 2012 will be challenging as fixed rate securities and loans are prepaid or mature and are
replaced by lower yielding assets. However as previously noted, the opportunity to continue to improve deposit costs
will be an important factor supporting net interest income and the resulting net interest margin. Consequently, we do
expect net interest income and the resulting net interest margin to remain at relatively stable levels.
Let us turn to non-interest revenue on slide seven. Second quarter non-interest revenues were down 3% linked quarter.
Mortgage banking revenue was particularly strong in the quarter, driven by new home purchases, and refinance activity
aided by the government's HARP II program which is serving to increase refinance volume. Mortgage revenue was up
$13 million or 17% over the first quarter. Mortgage loan production of $2.1 billion during the second quarter reflects an
increase of 28% from $1.6 billion in the first quarter, while we estimate that HARP II will add over $1 billion to our
full year 2012 mortgage refinance volume.
As we evaluate the mortgage refinancing opportunities, we believe our capacity to handle refinancing activity more
expeditiously is enabling us to take market share. In fact, almost half of our HARP II loan applications are new
mortgage customers. Account service fees and charges were down $21 million linked quarter, due to the establishment
of a reserve for certain customer fee refunds resulting from a change in our non-sufficient funds policy. Excluding this
item, total service charges would have been consistent with the first quarter.
Now moving to expenses on slide eight. Non-interest expenses were down 8% linked quarter and 12% year over year.
During the quarter, credit related expenses were down $31 million. Notably, other the real estate expenses declined

57% linked quarter and 73% year over year. Within held for sale, we incurred $26 million in net gains related to
property sales. Also staffing was down during the quarter, and over the past year we have experienced a decline of 544
positions or 2%.
Looking ahead, we expect overall 2012 expenses from continuing operations excluding goodwill impairment to be
down from the 2011 level as a result of our continued and disciplined focus on cost control.
Let's move to our credit metrics on slide nine. For the second quarter in a row, we experienced broad-based asset
quality improvement with virtually all credit metrics improving. Net charge-offs were down significantly, resulting in a
decline of $67 million linked quarter or 52% year over year and exceeded the loan loss provision by $239 million.
Inflows of non-performing loans declined to $315 million, or 17% from last quarter. This is down 81% from the peak,
which was in the second quarter of 2010. Inflows have now reached what we would characterize as a normal range,
somewhere between $250 million and $350 million. Non-performing loans excluding loans held for sale decreased
$236 million or 11% linked quarter. This is the first time since the first quarter of 2009 that our non-performing loans
have been below $2 billion, which is down 48% from the peak in the first quarter of 2010.
Total non-performing assets declined $1.3 billion or 35% from the prior year. Much of this improvement was driven by
resolutions rather than charge-offs, another favorable indicator of future trends. Notably, business services criticized
and classified loans continued to decline, with criticized loans down 9% or $543 billion from the first quarter and down
$3.4 billion or 38% from the fourth quarter of 2009, which was the high point. As a reminder, criticized and classified
loans are one of the best and earliest indicators of asset quality.
Our coverage ratios remain strong. At quarter end, our allowance for loan and lease losses to non-performing loans
stood at 120% or 1.2 times, up 2 basis points from last quarter. Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance to loans remained
strong at 3.01% at the end of the second quarter. In light of the backdrop of an uneven and slow economic recovery,
forecasting asset quality improvement with certainty is difficult. As Grayson previously noted, our improvement in
asset quality exceeded our own internal expectations and each quarter will have its own unique characteristics and
some volatility should be expected. However, our credit quality indicators continue to be encouraging.
Now let's look at our capital and liquidity on slide ten. Early in the second quarter, we repaid the US Treasury
Department's $3.5 billion preferred stock investment. This transaction followed the completion of the sale of Morgan
Keegan and a highly successful common equity offering. In connection with the repayment of the Series A preferred
stock, the company repurchased the outstanding warrant for $45 million. As a result of these capital actions and events,
our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter stood at 11% and our estimated Tier 1 common ratio increased 40
basis points to 10%, and we continue to review the capital NPRs that were published on June 7. The proposed
minimum capital levels and definitions of capital are largely in line with Regions' expectations. However we are
working to understand all the proposed changes to risk weightings and are collecting the data to quantify the impact.
Based on our interpretation of the NPRs, we estimate our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will be
approximately 8%. The NPR comment period ends in early September, and changes could be made, and those changes
could result in materially different capital ratios from what we have estimated. Liquidity at both the bank and the
holding company remain solid, with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 80%. Lastly, based on our interpretation, we are well
positioned with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio.
So overall this quarter's results demonstrate the continued progress that we have made on several important fronts. Our
operating results continued to improve, driven by solid business performance. We delivered another strong quarter of
substantial improvements with respect to asset quality, and we further strengthened our balance sheet from a capital
standpoint.
And with that, I will turn it back over to Grayson for his closing comments.

Overall, this quarter's results really demonstrate continued progress that we have made in entering the second half of
2012, with both positive and encouraging momentum. While there's still work to be done, we are successfully
executing our business plans, making substantial progress and taking actions that positions us to maximize our
opportunity for out-performance.
We continue to make progress even in the face of challenging markets. In the second quarter, we completed the sale of
Morgan Keegan, and, as a result, we are a simpler organization, focused on the fundamentals of serving our banking
customers. We are now able to offer our wealth management customer segment enhanced banking, trust and investment
products with outstanding customer service.
On the business services and consumer front, we have been taking steps that expand and enhance our product offerings,
as well as simplify and improve the delivery of customer services, as a customer focus is a central to our business
model. Our associates are working hard to ensure Regions is providing competitive products and services to satisfy
customers' individual needs. We have a competitive team that consistently provides award-winning customer service
which we believe is a differentiating factor in today's marketplace.
With this in mind, we are continuing to manage efficiency but selectively add to our team, for example, recently hiring
additional bankers for growing specialized industries. We continue to invest in people and technology to build the best
foundation for delivery and execution of our business plans and to take advantage of opportunities' presence in our
markets and in this economy. Although economic growth is expected to remain modest over the balance of the year,
Regions has the levers in place to continue to strengthen our financial performance and deliver improved returns for our
shareholders.
Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Ryan.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hey, good morning. How is it going? Just first on the Basel III NPR, I understand you're still
reviewing it. Can you give us a little bit more detail on some of the moving parts and maybe could you talk about some
of the areas that there could be further mitigation and how big those can be?
<A - David J. Turner>: Sure, Ryan, as I mentioned – this is David.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hi, David.
<A - David J. Turner>: The biggest change for us came in the form of risk-weighted asset changes and more
specifically within that, those consumer products that are tied to real estate, in particular, resi mortgage and our
HELOC book. And I will caution this is still an NPR. There are changes that can be made, I'm sure will be made that
we need to incorporate. That being said, we will look at starting to analyze our business and changes that we need to
think through in terms of how that would impact going forward. Clearly as is, you will be holding more capital for
those two products that I just mentioned. And those holding more capital clearly would have an impact in terms of
availability of that credit at the prices that we have today. And so we will look at restructuring those if we have to, to
minimize the capital impact to us.
I would also tell you that the changes in the risk weights don't take effect until 2015 as proposed. That too could
change, but we have time to overcome and we'll modify our business such that we have an appropriate amount of
capital at the date that is implemented.

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Ryan, as we look at the NPR and we are studying this very carefully to make our
comments and recommendations for change. It does, when you look at our balance sheet, the most material impact, as
David said is on the consumer segment and in particular the real estate-related products. Obviously as these rules are
passed in the form they are in today or in similar form, it will require some adjustments to our products, and we'll also,
we'll change somewhat in how we approach that market with those products. And so even though they won't be
implemented until 2015, as it stands today, I do believe that the industry and ourselves in particular will start making
business model adjustments as soon as we know what the definitive rules will be.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it. And then just on credit, it seems like the provision came in a lot lower than I think a lot
of us expected and with NPL migration now back in a more normal level, I recognize credit can be volatile from
quarter to quarter. But isn't your expectation that we could see the provision running at these levels for several quarters
as the reserve begins to come down? It seems like you had some positive comments on housing and it seems like
disposals of assets are coming in at better prices than I think we would have expected. So, can you give us a little bit
more color there on the provision and the reserve? Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think clearly when you look at our credit metrics, we are continuing to see favorable
trends. As a result of our conservative nature, we have clearly communicated that we think that recovery can be
uneven, although in the metrics, we continue to see our metrics perform really at levels better than we had internally
forecasted, but we continue to see an improving landscape from a credit standpoint. We have seen some recent
recovery in some of our markets that relate to housing. These have been modest recoveries but been more widespread
than we would have anticipated at this juncture. But I do think that when you specifically look at our provision, our
charge-offs remain elevated above normal levels, although continue to improve. But when you look at the provision,
the provision obviously will also normalize as our asset quality normalizes. And I will ask Barb Godin to make a few
comments, if you will, on this same subject.
<A - Barbara Godin>: Yes, if you look at the impact of our provisions, really both three factors. One is the reduction
in our overall charge-offs that came down quarter over quarter. The second would be in the number of resolutions that
we saw, and by that I mean we had a number of payoffs of substandard loans and even non-performing loans where the
entire loan was paid off. We were able to reduce or release the reserve on those loans. And lastly, the mix shift which is
as we are putting on much better quality loans, we need less reserves than those that we're taking off the back end. So
all in, that led to just a $26 million provision. I would not call that a normalized provision level. Clearly, it's going to be
somewhat above that, but again it will be in line with what happens with our charge-offs.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: If you look at it, clearly non-performing loans were down quarter over quarter 11%, 48%
from the peak. If you look at migration, migration was down 17% quarter over quarter and 81% from the peak. So
clearly improving numbers from what we had seen historically, but if you will, the migration is starting to fall at what
we'd categorized as a normalized rate.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Good morning and congratulations on getting the two handle on the operating and
reported numbers this quarter.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Thank you.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: A question on the deposit service charges. David, you were saying that if you take out the
reserve that you put in place for the customer refund, that that would put you back in line with the first quarter. But
typically first quarter is seasonally depressed and you would typically get about a $15 million to $20 million uptick. So

would we still expect to see a level that would be higher than the first quarter level as we move into the third and fourth
quarters?
<A - David J. Turner>: Marty, I think that what our guidance was there to try and give you information that would
guide you for the rest of the year, that we felt would be fairly consistent with that first quarter number or the
as-adjusted second quarter. Clearly from deposit rate policy changes that we have made, there will be some impact
going forward that's in the $3 million to $5 million per quarter. Not a big number, but we expect that to be fairly
consistent with what you see as adjusted.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then on the net interest margin, two things. One is we have the CD repricing that's
coming through, especially in the fourth quarter. Should there be – we had kind of been looking for a little bit of further
improvement. We got a little bit more this quarter than we expected, but maybe 1 basis point or 2 as you kind of went
through the end of the year. Is the bias maybe while you are saying stable still towards a little favorable move in net
interest margin?
<A - David J. Turner>: Marty, I will tell you, that we did have a little bit more of a favorable move in the quarter, due
to our improvement in our credit metrics. So here are 2 to 3 points there and we wanted to guide to the consistency or
stability of the margin from where we are right this minute because of that. We'll see if things of that nature, the
improvement in non-performers continue in the third and fourth quarter. You are right to point out that our repricing of
the second half is very strong from a deposit standpoint, but we also are looking at a historically low ten-year and the
reinvestment rates will serve to work against us. The question is how long will this remain. And so we have been a little
cautious and wanted to kind of guide towards the stability of where we are right now, and if it's higher than that, then
that will be a plus.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Marty we continue to see and as we said earlier, our loan yields appear to be stable and we
think that will continue, but we think there is also still room for improvement in the deposit cost or deposit pricing
itself. The question we have, as David just said is where to do reinvestment rates go on our investment portfolio. But
when we net all of that together, we still are indicating that we believe we will maintain a fairly stable margin.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: The last thing is, David, as you kind of move in the mix of deposits, is the CD runoff just
customers taking their money and shifting it into the lower costs? So it's really a transfer of deposit balances or is it an
influx of new balances into the lower cost deposits and an exit of the CDs going to try to find higher yields someplace
else? Or is it something that as soon as rates change, you will see it kind of shift back to the CD level once you can get
reasonable rates there?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Marty what we are seeing, is that when CDs renew, we are retaining about 70% of those
CDs in the CD product. The other 30% of the CDs, some of that is migrating into other depository accounts or
migrating outside our bank. But clearly we have seen a strong improvement in our low cost balances, deposit account
balances, and believe a healthy portion of that money is being retained by the company. And I would also point out that
a lot of our liquidity in deposit accounts is with business customers and we continue to see above normal levels of
liquidity in our business checking products.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Josh Levin of Citigroup.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Good morning. Some of your peers have suggested that over the last month or so, customers are
becoming a bit more reticent about investing in their businesses and borrowing, given all the macro uncertainty. Are
you hearing that or detecting that from your customers?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I would say that the numbers don't appear to support that. When you look at our numbers,

growing our commercial industrial loans, we saw a good growth in the second quarter. That being said, anecdotally I
would say you are correct. What we've heard from our customers as we meet with them, is that the risk appetite of our
commercial customers has softened. I think with some of the uncertainties that are in the marketplace today, and all are
well described and in the media each and every day, I think a number of our customers are taking a less aggressive risk
appetite position and anecdotally we are hearing that. Numerically, it hasn't quite shown up in our business yet.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Okay. Excuse me, and then also one of your peers said last week that it's going to close up to 5%
of its branches. As you think about navigating through this very challenging environment for banks, is closing
branches, is that on your radar screen?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: We were fairly aggressive early on in branch consolidation and branch rationalization. If
you recall, we closed 46 branches in 2011. That's embedded in our expense run rate today. We have consolidated seven
branches in 2012. But I would tell you in summary, when you look at it from the top of the bank, we were aggressive
early in branch rationalization and took some pretty strong steps over the last three years. We believe in large part our
branch franchise today is going to be fairly stable. We will make some minor changes, but you shouldn't expect
anything of a major level in that regard. It will only be making minor adjustments to our business model.
That being said, we are seeing transaction volumes of monetary transactions in our branches decline, but we continue to
see improvement in sales transactions. And we are trying to transition our offices with more of a focus on sales and
meeting customers' needs and realizing that monetary transaction volumes will continue to slowly decline through that
channel.
We are investing an awful lot of money in our other channels. We are seeing some remarkable growth in our mobile
channel, but also in our web-based product offerings. So we are trying to invest in those channels that the customers
want most. But quite frankly, our branches continue to be one of our most effective sales channels that we have.

Your next question comes from the line of Jefferson Harralson of KBW.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Hi, thanks. I want to ask a question about normalizing expenses. The explicit credit
related expenses have come down all the way when you think about OREO expenses. But I guess how can we, I guess
how can you kind of point us in the direction to think about the further benefit that can come and maybe in the
personnel line or the other line as the credit-related expenses, the environmental expenses come out. Can you do it in
number of employees or just types of things that are going to naturally shrink down over time?
<A - David J. Turner>: Jefferson, one of the things we tried to guide to is looking at 2012 expectation over 2011,
which we were confident that we would have lower – and this is excluding last year's goodwill impairment – that we
would be lower in 2012 than 2011. We clearly have improvements in our credit cost, our environmental type expenses
which are OREO and held for sale expenses and we reported the net gain that we had in held for sale. So you should
expect some unevenness relative to that. As our non-performing loans continue to come down and the number of loans
in our special asset group comes down, we certainly have cost saves that we get there. That being said, we also have
increasing an compliance environment where we have to shift and hire people to cover the compliance costs. We have a
new regulator in as well. And so I think our best guidance right now is to stick with really kind of global year over year,
where we are.
That being said, we focus on expenses intently and intense focus on expenses. We are down year over year about 544
positions. Salaries and benefits is our number one expense line item. We continue to watch that. We watch occupancy
costs and our furniture and fixtures expenses are the top three, very closely and when we have opportunities to tighten
up as credit improves, for instance, we will take advantage of that.

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: And Jefferson, this is a topic that we spend an awful lot of time on. Clearly, as we are
looking at what we believe our future earnings potential will be and a low rate, slow growth environment, we continue
to believe that we have to have a very rigorous and disciplined approach to expense management. We are doing a
number of things. There's a number of initiatives across the organization to improve efficiency. Part of that is people.
Clearly, a big part of our expenses is in salaries, but we really are trying to focus on processes that we can change and
improve that allow us to do things more effectively.
We've got new technologies rolling out into our branch systems that allow us to reduce a considerable amount of
overhead expenses in our operating environment. We don't necessarily have a named program like many of our peers
do. But don't misinterpret that. We have got a very distinct and clear focus on trying to reduce our expense base.
That being said, I would agree with David. Part of our expense savings are to fund headwinds that we are facing, as we
are having to add staffing and add technology to make sure that we are effectively managing all of our compliance
risks, and so there are some offsets to our savings.

Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: If I could just follow up on the service charge, just to be clear, as we think about the back
half of the year, we should look at the 1Q level, the $254 million and that would include the $3 million to $5 million
drag?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's right, Matt. We kind of guided to roughly even with that. Maybe slightly up from there,
but not a large change from that quarter.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And in the change that you made, did that relate to the sort order, the high to low?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: No, Matt, what we have done, is really we tried to focus on our funds availability policy as
well as our non-sufficient funds policy to ensure that, one, it is in concert with our focus on service quality. And as we
have looked at that, we continue to challenge ourselves every month as we analyze customer activity and customer
responses to make sure we are taking the appropriate steps. This particular adjustment we made to those, to our
processes are not around sort sequence but really around the way we handle customers who have come in and
pre-established overdraft protection lines, and how we handle transactions that come in that exceed the capacity of
those pre-established lines.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately on the reduction to capital, the Basel III under the NPR. I
don't know if you have a sense of how much of that 200 basis point reduction is from the undrawn lines. I guess I'm
hearing from some folks that there's a lot of confidence in mitigating the impact of the undrawn home equity lines and
commercial lines over time, and wondering if you had any of those numbers at this point.
<A - David J. Turner>: Matt, I don't have the precise numbers. I can tell you that the impact on unfunded
commitments is going to impact some of our peers a lot more severely than us. And it has to do with the proportion of
unfunded commitments that are 365 days and shorter versus longer. So there is an impact related to that, but it is not the
major mover. The major one is related to our risk-weighted assets on resi mortgage and the HELOCs.

Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Hey, good morning, guys. Just first starting out on the NIM, I'm just wondering if you
think about this mathematically, where your loan yields are stable, your securities yields have some depression, but
there's actually very significant depository pricing in the second half of this year. What is actually going hold the NIM
down and not allow it go up? Is this any swap runoff we should think about or maybe any large changes in the
securities or liquidity portfolio?
<A - David J. Turner>: No Craig, the primary driver is just the reinvestment risk that we have in this low rate
environment. Currently we have about $500 million rolling off of our, just cash off of our investment portfolio and
having to reinvest that at lower yields continue to drag that down. So we don't have anything that really sticks out other
than that. Again, we cautioned a little bit on the stability of the margin, because we had about 3 points that we picked
up in the quarter related to better than we had anticipated improvements on non-performing loans. If we get that kind of
improvement in the third and fourth quarter like we had, then those 3 points would be there. But we are trying to guide
to a little more stability there.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: David, your securities yield only declined by 3 bips in the second quarter. So it was
actually smaller than we thought. Any commentary there would be helpful. And then do you expect a much sharper
decline in the third quarter? And I wonder if you could share with us your new money yield for securities acquisitions.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yes, we do expect there to be some added pressure on the investment portfolio in the quarter.
Our going on yield today for securities is in that, right just below 2%, 1.70%, 1.75% for the mortgage backed security
products that we would be purchasing. So over time, you can see that that's going to put more pressure in the third and
fourth quarter.

probably around three years. Is that correct?
<A - David J. Turner>: A little shorter than that. It's closer to two years.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Closer to two years. And what type of – because we have seen different companies have had
different prepayment rate speeds across the board. What type of prepayments are you getting off that?
<A - David J. Turner>: About 20%, in the 20% range.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And your reinvesting, I guess. Are you investing at the two-year level or the three-year level?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yes, closer to the three-year level would be our reinvesting.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: So that's about like a 1.7%, 1.8% level?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's right. We said about 1.75%.

<Q - Paul J. Miller>: 1.75%. Yes, okay. And because just following up on the last question is, do you think your
deposits can reprice down? You do have some room in your deposits to offset that. So I'm guessing that where the rates
where they are and you are guiding to stabilized NIM, that you are depending on the deposit rates to reprice along with
this to offset that?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yes, we have a fairly significant amount of deposits repricing in the second half of the year
and that's a big part of how we are confident in the stability of our net interest margin. And one other follow-up in
terms of the investment portfolio. If we think of – we talked a couple of quarters ago about trying to invest in more
corporate securities. We have kind of isolated about 10% of our portfolio in those type non-agency mortgage backs and
those are going on the books in the 3.25% range, which also will help stabilize a little bit of the investment yield. But
our biggest benefit that we see in the back half is that the price, deposit repricing on the CD book.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And along with corporate securities, are you taking a look at munis? I know some banks are
looking at munis and increasing that portfolio also.
<A - David J. Turner>: No. We used to have a roughly 5% to 7% of our investment portfolio in munis before we got
into the economic environment we are in today. And so we divested of all of those and we have been reluctant to go
back into the muni market thus far.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Good morning. My first question is a follow up to Ryan's question in the provision. I recognize
that this dollar run rate is going to be quite lumpy as you continue to work through the credits. But I was wondering if
you could help us get a sense of as you look at your – most of the improvement is behind you and you look at where
your loan book is today, what a normal charge-off rate would look like for Regions in two or three years and how you
look at a normal provisioning rate. Do we look at reserve to loans? Do we look at reserve to average loans?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Erika, it's Barb Godin. Relative to what we look at for a normalized loss rate, we would target
somewhere around that 75 basis points of loss through a cycle, is what you can expect as we get down into that range.
In terms of what our reserve would be, it's not going to be the same as what it was pre-crisis. I don't think that was
normal either. And I just think we're going to have to hold more capital, so somewhere between 150 and 200.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Okay. And David, I appreciate all the color on the margin, but could you give us a sense of what
the loan yields would have been if you excluded the impact of the NPLs getting worked out of the balance sheet this
quarter?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yes, it would have been about 3 basis points on the loan yields.
<Q - Erika Penala>: That was on the loan yield, not on the total margin.
<A - David J. Turner>: Three or four. I mean those numbers are going to be fairly close. It was about 3%.

<Q - Michael Rose>: Hey, good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. But I wanted to get a sense for
where you stand in your mitigation efforts related to Durbin. Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I will just make a couple of comments. One is that we continue to look at our
consumer business model and see where we can enhance our products, but also expand products. As you are aware, we
entered the credit card business a little over a year ago, and we introduced a number of new products in that line in the
last few weeks. So we have tried to address our interchange revenue in terms of adding credit customers that will use
the credit card for purchases. But we have continued to push the debit card. We continue to see success in increasing
the penetration of the debit card product and our checking account base. We obviously have seen the revenue on a
per-transaction base decline there, but we are obviously trying to make up some of our loss through growth.
I would tell you we have introduced a number of new products in terms of prepaid cards that we hope enhance the view
of that customer segment. And as you are well aware, we have continued to migrate our checking accounts from really
a free checking environment to one where accounts are fee eligible. We continue to believe that we can mitigate the
impact of Durbin over time. We will not completely mitigate it in 2012, but we believe that we can mitigate it over time
and there we continue to be positive about the progress we have made thus far.

<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning.
<A - David J. Turner>: Hey John.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - John Pancari>: Can you talk a little bit about your thought process around the potential redemption of your $840
million in TruPS? I know you mentioned that you're evaluating it, but if you can just give us a little bit more color
around what you are looking at there and what the thought process is. Thanks.
<A - David J. Turner>: Sure. We have two issues in that $845 million. There's a $345 million that's priced at 8.875%
then there's $500 million that's 6.625%. The 6.625% clearly is losing its capital treatment as is the other one, but we
look at that as a reasonable long-term debt yield today. The other one, the 8.875% is one where we think we have
opportunity, as we think about liability and capital strategies via the NPR, that we could look at and perhaps call given
the regulatory event that occurred. So that is what we are trying to lead you to, is we are investigating that. We will be
putting together our thoughts on that and get back to the investors and the analysts regarding that.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. And then secondly, around the reserve level, can you talk about the pace in the
expected decline in the reserve level from your current 3% of loans to that 1.50% to 2% that Barb had indicated?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yes, I think that clearly the pace is what's harder to predict given that we think clearly the
economy is where it is. There is going to be unevenness relative to charge-offs. As we indicated earlier, our charge-offs
are higher than where we want them to be, although we have them reserved for. The biggest determinant of how that
3% comes down closer to that 1.5% to 2% that Barb mentioned is going to be the level of charge-offs. As so as we
continue to get clarity around that number, the pace of that change to get to the 1.5% to 2% will become clearer.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: As we said earlier, we looked at the migration of loans to non-performing status. You
know, we were at 3.15% this quarter. That exceeded our internal projections. It's actually less than our internal
projections. The pace of economic improvement in the country really drives that. That really is an indication of the
health of our customers, and we continue to ask ourselves that same question. It's a great question, is what is the pace of
that improvement going to be? We continue to believe it will be an uneven recovery, and but we would love to see it
faster. But predicting that pace of recovery is a very difficult thing to do at this juncture.

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Ketron of UBS.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Good morning/good afternoon, I guess now. Just a couple of questions around the loan
portfolio. You've had really good growth in commercial. Some of the consumer loan categories with continued runoff
in areas that you had noted previously. Do you have a sense, to the degree you can control the runoff, when we may see
the loan portfolio bottom out and you actually may start to see net growth come to the bottom line?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes I mean, what you have seen in the loan portfolio this time is good growth in
commercial industrial lending. We saw good growth in mortgage. We saw good growth in indirect auto. You know, we
did not, when you look at the balance sheet, we have elected not to place any of the fixed rate product on the resi
mortgage portfolio or out of that production on our balance sheet. And we have done that predominantly because of our
cautiousness around the duration of that asset, how long it might be on the balance sheet given the low rate
environment that we're in today. So the consumer portfolio continues to decline predominantly because of that
decision.
I would tell you the equity portfolio continues to decline about $100 million a month. That's consumer deleveraging,
and we continue to see that deleveraging. The ability for people to refinance continues I think to add to that issue. The
good news we saw on our mortgage production is about 60% of our production was refinance and 40% was purchase.
And so that purchase, the purchase part of that activity really encourages us from first to second quarter. We saw not
only refinancings go up, but purchases go up. So we have some strength that I think the housing market is starting to
show. It's slow and incremental but improvement nonetheless.
On the commercial side, I just think what you are seeing is that most of our activities in the higher end of commercial,
middle market, and the small business owner, the small commercial customer is still behaving an awful lot like the
consumer and is still deleveraging. And I think as we get more confidence in the economic outlook, you will start to see
that segment improve.
What we had said earlier is we thought that our loans outstanding would, by the end of the year, would be
approximately what they were at the beginning of this year. I would say we have less conviction in that today, although
we have seen our rate of decline slow. We have seen more production on commercial real estate than we saw this time
last year, and we're seeing that commercial real estate portfolio still declining, but at a slower pace. So we think we'll
be close by the end of the year, but I think that it's a great question.
<Q - Greg Wade Ketron>: Thank you. And then on other question, your loan yields have held up very well, really
going back over the last five quarters. And I know it looked like some of it is a mix issue as you put more indirect into

the portfolio. But is this something that you anticipate that you'll be able to maintain close to despite the rate
environment as we look forward into later this year and maybe even into 2013?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, Greg, this is David. I think Erika's question was really trying to get there too. So we had
3, call it maybe 4 points related to loan yield that we had related to the performance of non-performing loans this
quarter that hopefully they will repeat. But if they do, then that will benefit our margin outside of what we are telling
you. The persistently low rates from a loans standpoint, yes, we will continue to have some pressure, but it's really the
reinvestment risk on investment portfolio is probably the greatest impact to us from a NIM standpoint.
We are trying to change our mix of our loan portfolio to more to the consumer side. I had mentioned in my prepared
comments about the changes we were making to our credit card program that we purchased last year, about a year ago,
that we will be converting to our system in the third quarter. And we're rolling out new cards and rewards program,
purpose of which is to control that customer experience and assist us in increasing our sales production with credit
cards, and we think that will also bolster to the extent we can execute on that, bolster our loan yields.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning. A couple of quick follow ups. One is on the interest rate outlook. There's
some debate as to whether or not the Fed is going to keep paying rates on reserves. Obviously the EU stopped doing
that. What is your kind of game plan for if that were to happen here?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, I think to the extent that we're not getting 25 basis points any more, everybody will
move to going back to what we used to do. It will be more credit risk in the system. As we go overnight with other
counterparties, probably be compensated some for it. I don't know that the compensation will offset the risk relative to
having 25 basis points with the Fed, but today we've gotten that amount that we have on deposit with the Fed down to
about $1.8 billion, which is about the level where we want to be, maybe in the $2 billion range. And we will see if that
movement is going to happen. I'm not sure what the odds are on that right now.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So it would be a partial mix into more loans to the degree you could and then offset
whatever you couldn't do there, you would be doing with other financial institutions?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's right.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just second quickie is on HARP II, you mentioned that $1 billion in
mortgage fees you are expecting in 2012 due to HARP II. How much of that have you seen already in 1Q, 2Q?
<A - David J. Turner>: That was mortgage production of $1 billion.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sorry, not fees.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: If you recall, we did about $1.6 billion in total mortgage production in the first quarter and
$2.1 billion in the second quarter. The HARP II production is running about 24% of total production.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: And that's up significantly from first quarter. And, but we are still, we are pretty steady
right now at about $700 million in originations a month. We don't see that increasing a lot from this point. But we think
right now looking at our application pipelines that at least for the third quarter, that looks very sustainable.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So at least sustainable is what you are guiding to?

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fitzsimmons of Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Kevin P. Fitzsimmons>: Hi everybody. Just a quick question, I think this is still a ways out, but as far as the
CCAR process for 2013, when you all start to put your plan together in the fourth quarter, I know there's a lot of
uncertainty regarding risk weightings as far as Basel III. But what's your appetite and priority in terms of raising the
dividend, doing buybacks and is the trust preferred redemption you mentioned earlier, is that part of the plan that was
already put through the regulators or is that something you have to include in your 2013 submission? Thanks.
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, let me talk about kind of our capital plan and kind of stay away from the regulators.
From a capital plan standpoint, we will continue to evaluate all capital actions. Ask you asked specifically about
returning capital to shareholders. The way we view that is we generated the capital or raised the capital for what we
think our shareholders expect that we redeploy that in our business to grow our business, to invest where we can get the
best risk adjusted return back to the shareholders and so that's our first priority.
To the extent that that growth's not there, acquiring product lines, entities, those kinds of things would be what we
would go to second. And then to the extent we have capital and are generating, expect to generate capital, returning it to
the shareholders in the form of increased dividends and stock buybacks. That being said, we do acknowledge that our
dividend payout ratio is below our peers today. We just repaid TARP and so expectations would that we would put
together a capital plan that would include an appropriate use of that capital. And that, and we will submit that in
January.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But Kevin.
<A - David J. Turner>: I'll answer this.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Go ahead.
<A - David J. Turner>: And then the trust preferred, clearly the NPR provides an opportunity for the regulatory call
on the trust preferreds and as we have tried to guide through our prepared comments on liquidity and capital strategies,
that we would seek to do something with not only a trust preferred but other debt, subordinated debt instruments as
well.
<Q - Kevin P. Fitzsimmons>: Okay, thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron at Morningstar Equity.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Hi, good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Just had a quick question following up on economic conditions. I know you gentlemen spoke
a little bit about this already. But wondering if can take a quick moment just to give us some color on some of your key
markets, especially Florida. There has been some reports of the housing situation improving there but things seem a
little bit mixed and unsettled. I'm just kind of wondering what you are seeing on the ground or in Florida and other key
markets.

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think obviously when you look across the 16 states we operate in, there are some mixed
metrics around housing. But just generally what we have seen is some pretty steady improvement, although incremental
in most of our markets. I would tell you that generally speaking, inventory levels are down and in some markets,
inventory levels are down at levels we haven't seen in a number of years.
In Florida in particular, I would say most of the strength we have seen have been in the metro markets, and in
particular, we have seen the condominium segment improve faster than we had earlier forecasted. We are seeing some
strength in our business in Florida that have been exceeding our internal forecasts. And we think that while Florida was
probably one of the harder hit markets we have seen from a housing standpoint, and it's going to take some time for
recovery, that we continue to be encouraged by some of the signs.
When you look at our mortgage production, there's an awful lot more home purchase in Florida than in the other
markets. Use of refinance is not an option for a lot of homeowners in Florida, and so but you are seeing home purchase
there. And so I would say the strength is, at this point in time, seems predominantly located in the metro markets. Barb,
would you like to add?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Miami, as an example, seems to have rebounded clearly in terms of pricing. We are seeing
increases in the Panhandle area in Florida, and we have even seen increases now starting to happen in places like Fort
Myers. So clearly we are seeing the bottom has been hit generally across most of the markets in Florida and is on the
way up.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi, thanks everybody. Two questions: first of all just, David, following your earlier comments
about other liabilities, with deposits down at period end, you had some redemptions this quarter of some debt, I'm just
wondering with flat loan growth underneath it, are we still just going to see earning assets continue to shrink, and at
what point do you think the earning asset base will stabilize?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, we were trying to guide to in particular within earning assets, the loan portfolio being
stable from here on out. So we think we have had good growth. We have shown you in C&I, the decline in the investor
real estate portfolio slowed almost $500 million this quarter. And we see that continuing to attrite some but not as
rapidly as we have had. There will be deleveraging on the consumer side, and we aren't changing our resi mortgage
strategy. So we think we can have stability there related to our earning assets, in particular our construct of our loans.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: I was getting more at the total balance sheet size, right, because the right side of the balance
sheet continues to shrink. So if loans are flat and you are happy with where your cash deposits are now at the Fed, it
kind of implies that you will be just shrinking the investment portfolio. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't
misunderstanding that.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yes, no, from the deposit side, we did have declines on [ph] the end to end (75:07). Our
average deposits were flat, but they were down due to the repricing. But we think we can hold where we are with
earning assets to be fairly stable from here on out.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Got it. And my second question just relates to salaries, and you mentioned that you had a 500
person decline in head count year over year. The salaries line was still up 8% on relatively flat revenues. So I'm just
wondering if there's some moving parts inside the salaries line and what we could expect from that going forward?
<A - David J. Turner>: As we mentioned earlier, we continue to watch salaries and benefits expense. We did have our
merit increases, actually took effect at the beginning of the quarter, and that's probably the single biggest item. The
other is pension expense continues to be higher as a result of this extraordinarily low interest rate environment. So we'll
see those two things impact us. But we will continue to look at head count and that's really from a cost control

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning. Gerard?
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Yes, can you hear me? Thank you very much for extending the call. The question I had was
coming back to your comments about the net charge-off ratio through a full cycle of being about 75 basis points. Since
your net charge-off ratio was north of 300 basis points in 2010, does that imply that we should see a net charge-off ratio
then in the good years that might be coming up in 2014, 2015 in the 30 to 40 basis point range?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Well, it's going to move around a bit, as you can imagine. We are going to try to keep the
volatility as down as we can, as low as we can. But clearly if you are going to have 75 basis points through a cycle, you
are going to have to have some years that are below 75 and other years that are above 75. But I wouldn't want to give
you any kind of a range right now.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay. On the total classified and special mention loans that you guys reported this quarter at
$5.4 billion, is that considered a normalized level or is there still improvement here as well? I know your
non-performing assets are likely to continue to improve as you go forward, but how about the classified and the special
mentions?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Yes, we should still, we should continue to see those come down. If you look at our 90 day
past due levels, while they were up in business services by $34 million this quarter, that was one account that got
cleared in the last couple of weeks, just didn't make the quarter end. Consumer was down. We anticipate that those
levels will continue to move in the right direction. Our 30 to 59 day delinquency levels were also down for the quarter.
And again, depending on what happens in the economy, we're going to track to the economy, but those are my very
early indicators of what I would expect to see in special mentions and classified and criticized.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Is the 11.7%, should we think of a more normalized number -- instead of the 11.7% that you
reported here, is it something half of that or 6% or 7%? Is that considered to be more of a normal number that you
would see in a normal economy?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Yes, I hate to point to a specific number because we don't track it the way that you are talking
of the 11%. And if we're looking at my criticized loans and my criticized loans are not at that level. They are at 8.49%
for criticized, which includes the classified loans, and that includes my special mentions. So my 8.49% includes my
special mentions.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: And during a normal environment, is 8.49% normal or is it somewhere closer maybe to 5% or
6%?

<A - Barbara Godin>: Right now it's clearly it's elevated, and yes, it would be somewhat reduced. I'd give you a range
probably of 5% to 7%.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay. Thank you. And then in all of the non-performing asset results that you reported this
quarter, do these results reflect the shared national credit exam where you may have participated as a agent or a lead or
a participant?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Yes, they do.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: And then one final question, on the loan pricing for loans, C&I loans in particular, the Federal
Reserve data is indicating that it seems like pricing is holding up. Are you guys sensing that, that yes, it is competitive
but there isn't really any slash and burning pricing going on or is there really that type of pricing going on?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: No, I think that what we have seen is clearly there's pretty intense competition for loans,
obviously, in this environment. We saw pricing, we saw some pricing compression early on that -- I think part of that
was because pricing had, the spread had really expanded during the recessionary period and we saw some compression.
But still pricing is holding up above prerecession levels, but it seems to be steady at the moment. And I'm not saying
there isn't the odd transaction here and there where one gets priced at a level we don't understand, but I would say that
that is infrequent. The norm seems to be fairly stable.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: I know this may sound too optimistic, but with all the new challenges that the industry is
confronting, particularly with the higher regulatory costs, and certainly efficiency ratios for most banks are elevated, do
you think more rational pricing could enter the picture where it doesn't get so cut-throat and people realize that they
can't cut prices because expenses are just going to be permanently higher as we go forward?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes, I mean I think a couple of things. I think one is as this environment extends for a
prolonged period of time, there's going to be some rationalization on the part of competition, has to be. You can, there
can be some irrational behavior on the short term, but over the long term, it has to rationalize. I think the other issue too
is with the Basel III, I mean rules coming out. Obviously there's going to be, the entire industry is going to have to
revisit our pricing models with those capital allocations, and certainly we'll alter pricing on a number of different
lending products.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you.

Your final question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning or good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A quick question on your
deposit, your expectations for deposit growth. I'm just curious how you are thinking about the potential for the
guarantee of non-interest bearing deposits going away at the start of the year relative to your debt ratings. I know that
you got an upgrade from S&P in March, but just curious as to how you are thinking about what your trends in deposits
might be at the start of the year.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes, I mean we continue to deliver considerable improvement in our deposit cost without
demonstrating much of a decline in our outstanding deposits, and in fact other than the time deposit segment of our
deposit portfolio, we continue to grow that segment. We have gone through quite extensive analysis of the deposit
guarantee program. We believe that that would have a fairly nominal impact on our deposit base. We know which
customers – we're working with our customers closely that that might be an issue with. But I think given the capital
levels of the industry and where we are at today, that that's not as a material an issue as it was a couple of years ago.
And so we don't anticipate that being an issue for us at this juncture. We do not know how to handicap that event, and
would not speculate on that.

<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Grayson, you mentioned that anecdotally in some of your conversations with clients,
clients are getting a bit more risk averse given the headlines that we're all reading every day. I'm curious as to if you
combine that with your comments about the potential for pricing on loans going up post Basel III, do you get the sense
that your clients understand that that industry-wide pricing is very likely to change in the relatively near term for
commitments in other types of commercial loans?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I do not think that the anecdotal information we are hearing is as a result of perceived
pricing issues going forward at all. I think the average customer is seeing such a healthy level of competition between
financial institutions at this juncture, I think most of our customers continue to believe that they are going to have a
fairly robust level of competitors competing for their business and that pricing will be fair. I think most of the risk
aversion is really over economic uncertainty as opposed to any sort of implications from capital requirements.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Thank you very much.
