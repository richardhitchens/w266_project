Thank you, Lynne.
Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter 2011 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany
my comments and is available in the Investor Relations section of Emerson's corporate website at Emerson.com. A
replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three
months. I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page two of the conference call slide presentation.
Fourth quarter sales were up 12% to $6.5 billion, with double-digit increases in three segments. Underlying sales
growth was 9%, led by strength in emerging markets. Operating profit margin expanded 170 basis points from the
prior-year quarter to 19.1%, which reflected record quarterly profitability.
Net earnings per share of $1.01 was also a record. Earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.98 increased
31% from the prior-year quarter. Operating cash flow of $1.255 billion was strong, and free cash flow was just over $1
billion. Our free cash flow to net earnings conversion was 133%.
The balance sheet remained strong as operating cash flow to total debt was 62%. The pace of share repurchase
increased in Q4 to $444 million. Emerson's record profitability provides a strong foundation to continue investments in
key growth markets and technologies.
Moving to slide three, the P&L; again, sales increased 12%, with underlying sales up 9%. Currency added two points
and acquisitions added one point. Operating profit increased 23% to $1.251 billion or 19.1% of sales, as cost reduction
benefits and lower stock compensation expense were partially offset by material cost pressure and growth investments.
Earnings from continuing operations increased 29% to $735 million, which included a $19 million impairment charge
for the wind turbine pitch control systems business. We repurchased 9.4 million shares for $444 million in the quarter,
which leads to EPS from continuing operations of $0.98. Net earnings per share of $1.01 includes a $21 million gain
from the heating products business divestiture.
Next slide, underlying sales growth by geography; in the fourth quarter the U.S. was up 3%. Total international
increased 13%, with Europe up 10%, Asia up 13%, Latin America up 22%, Canada up 15%, and Middle East and
Africa up 13%. Again, total underlying sales were up 9%. Currency added two points and acquisitions added one point,
resulting in consolidated sales increasing 12%.
For fiscal year 2011, the U.S. was up 8%; Europe up 11%; Asia up 11%; Latin America and Canada both up 20%; and
Middle East and Africa up 16%. Total underlying sales increased 11% for the year. Currency and acquisitions added
two points each, leading to consolidated sales growth of 15% for fiscal year 2011. Emerging markets now represent
35% of total sales.
Moving to slide five, the income statement detail, gross profit dollars of $2.59 billion was 39.6% of sales, down 30
basis points from the prior-year quarter, as material inflation slightly exceeded price increases and cost reductions and
volume leverage more than offset unfavorable product mix.
SG&A expense of 20.5% of sales resulted in operating profit of $1.251 billion or 19.1% of sales, increasing 170 basis
points from the prior-year quarter. Other deductions net reflected lower acquisition cost of $20 million and favorable
currency transactions of $16 million, while amortization was higher by $14 million and the previously mentioned
impairment impact of $19 million. Interest expense of $49 million leads to pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion or 16.7% of
sales. The tax rate for the quarter was 31.6%.
Next slide, cash flow and balance sheet; operating cash flow of $1.255 billion was down 1% from the prior-year
quarter, with a favorable impact from working capital. Capital expenditures of $244 million resulted in free cash flow
of just over $1 billion. Emerson's balance sheet remains strong and working capital efficiency continues to improve,
with trade working capital as a percent of sales improving 50 basis points to 15.0%.

Moving to slide seven, business segment P&L, business segment EBIT of $1.168 billion or 17.4% of sales declined 20
basis points as material inflation, intangibles amortization, and growth investments exceeded benefits from cost
reductions, price increases, and volume leverage. Differences in accounting methods were $62 million. And corporate
and other of $88 million reflected lower stock compensation expense of $94 million and lower acquisition cost of $20
million. A lower debt balance resulted in interest expense of $49 million, leading to $1.1 billion of pre-tax earnings.
Next, we'll review the individual business segments, starting on slide eight with Process Management. Sales in the
quarter increased 18% to more than $2 billion as underlying sales grew 16% and currency added two points. By region,
the U.S. was up 9%, Asia up 27%, Europe up 19%, and Latin America up 13%. The measurement systems and valves
businesses all realized strong growth. EBIT dollars of $450 million or 22.3% of sales increased 39%, driven by strong
volume leverage and cost reduction benefits as well as favorable foreign currency transactions. This was an outstanding
quarter for Process Management with record sales, profitability, and backlog.
Slide nine, Industrial Automation; sales in the quarter of $1.385 billion increased 19% as underlying sales grew 15%,
currency added five points, and acquisitions deducted one point. By region, the U.S. was up 15%, Asia up 19%, Europe
up 11%, Latin America up 24%, and Middle East and Africa up 50%. The growth was led by the power generating
alternators and fluid automation businesses. EBIT dollars of $205 million or 14.7% of sales increased 7%. Total price
increases more than offset higher material costs, but the impact was dilutive to margin. Volume leverage and cost
reduction benefits were offset by restructuring expense and growth investments. Full-year 2011 segment margin
increased 190 basis points to 15.7%.
Moving to slide 10, Network Power; sales in the quarter of $1.843 billion increased 10% as underlying sales grew 4%.
Acquisitions added five points and currency added one point. By geography, the U.S. was down 5%, Asia up 6%,
Europe up 5%, the Middle East and Africa up 27%, and Latin America up 24%. Network Power Systems Asia and the
global UPS and precision cooling business were strong, while embedded computing and power sales were affected by
weak markets and aggressive pricing actions. Sales were down in the U.S. energy systems business.
EBIT dollars of $248 million or 13.5% of sales was down 3%, as cost reduction benefits were offset by China labor
related costs, acquisition dilution, price decreases, and unfavorable product mix. Chloride amortization increased $11
million and there was incremental investment in the Trellis program of $12 million. Despite these headwinds, segment
margin increased 310 basis points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.
Next, to slide 11, Climate Technologies; total sales for the quarter were essentially unchanged, with underlying sales
down 3%; and currency added two points and acquisitions added one point. By region, the U.S. was down 7%. Asia
was flat, Europe down 10%, and Latin America up 46%. The North American residential and commercial markets
remained weak on channel inventory reductions and a cautious economic outlook. And the China residential and
commercial air conditioning business softened as well. The global refrigeration and transport businesses were strong in
the quarter.
EBIT dollars of $170 million or 17% of sales decreased 12% as volume deleverage and unfavorable product mix
headwinds were partially offset by cost reduction benefits. Price increases offset material inflation. The geographic mix
of Climate Technologies continues to globalize, with international sales representing 48% of total sales in 2011.
Slide 12, Tools and Storage; sales in the quarter of $464 million increased 4% as underlying sales grew 8%. Currency
added 1% and divestitures deducted five points. By geography, the U.S. was up 8%, Asia up 16%, Europe up 12%, and
Latin America up 9%. Growth in non-residential construction related businesses offset U.S. residential market
weakness. EBIT dollars of $95 million or 20.6% of sales increased 3% as cost reduction and volume leverage benefits
offset unfavorable product mix and higher restructuring costs. Our repositioning of the Tools and Storage segment
continued with the completion of the heating products business divestiture in the quarter.
Moving to slide 13, an overview of the full-year results; 2011 was an outstanding year for Emerson. Record sales of
$24.2 billion increased 15%. Emerging markets grew to 35% of sales while total international sales increased to 59%.
Operating profit increased 21% to a record margin of 17.5% of sales. Earnings per share from continuing operations
increased 25%, and net earnings per share increased 15%.

Fiscal 2011 was our 55th consecutive year of increased dividends. And the Board of Directors voted to increase the
December dividend 16% to $0.40 per share. Cash generation remained solid, with $33.2 billion of operating cash flow
and $2.6 billion of free cash flow. Return on total capital for the business was 19.6% in 2011.
Finally on the next slide, our fiscal 2012 outlook; we have strong momentum heading into next fiscal year with stable
order trends, record backlog, accelerated investments in growth markets and technologies, and high emerging markets
participation. Based on current economic conditions, including a recession or no-growth economy in Europe, our initial
view of 2012 includes: underlying sales and orders up 5% to 7%; reported sales up 4% to 6%; and operating profit
margin of approximately 18%; and pre-tax margin of approximately 15.5%. We expect a tax rate of approximately
31%, a pension headwind of approximately $30 million, one minor divestiture, and earnings per share growth of 8% to
12%.
Two items to be aware of for the first quarter; first, there will be a one-time charge of approximately $20 million to
eliminate a post-age 65 Medicare supplement currently available to a limited number of employees. And the second is a
supply chain disruption due to flooding in Thailand that we are managing through.
With that, I will turn it over to David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much, Pat. I want to welcome everybody this afternoon.
First, I want to thank Lynne Maxeiner for three outstanding years of excellent Investor Relations. And I know she had a
lot of fun managing the CEO; i.e., me, the boss, and she learned a lot. And I'm sure she'll go on to her next job and do a
great job there. And the most important thing, though, as she finished out her three years is she brought a World Series
back to St. Louis. You have to understand, she was at game six with a rally squirrel, and she brought the win in. And
we appreciate that, so we had the chance to win game seven. So Lynne, we wish you the best and have fun with Scott
Barbour up in Network Power. You've done a great job, and he did a great job in front of the Board today.
Next, I want to thank the OCE, the business leaders, presidents, and global leadership for an excellent performance
throughout a very challenging and volatile where you had to be flexible global economy. There were a lot of dynamics.
As I looked at it, there were a lot of curve balls, change-ups, many high, tight fastballs under the chin. And the
organization did an outstanding job dealing with this very dynamic and changing environment. I was pleased to see
them rise to the occasion as the OCE and myself put a lot of attention and focus on certain areas as those areas started
changing.
We fundamentally delivered the numbers that we outlined in our February St. Louis investors meeting, from sales
growth to margins to EPS, the dividends, the restructuring, the ROTC, the acquisitions, the divestitures. The biggest
issue we were faced with this year that was a big challenge for us was the price/cost. It was something that we really
worked hard all year long. And in my opinion, we got it under control as we entered fiscal 2012. And our current plan
based on what Pat just read to you assumes that we stay green in our price/cost relationship in 2012. We also are
looking at a moderation of that inflation as some of the commodities have come back and moved back in cost over the
last couple months.
In my opinion, 2011 finished strong. We're moving into fiscal 2012 in a very strong position from a balance sheet
standpoint. Technology, new products and emerging markets, which received a significant increase in our incremental
investments last year, we will drive a solid 5% to 7% underlying sales growth and I believe another record operating
margin around 18%, even with an additional incremental advanced growth technology investments that we put forth
again here in 2012 based around our new products, our technology; based around global sales organization, technology
organization; based around our expanded service organization, some new solutions, technology organizations, and
some new business models.
We fundamentally believe from the OCE perspective and the business leader perspective that we need to take and
invest our record profitability into programs to drive growth. We are looking at what I would look as a moderate

growth environment in the mature markets, no different than I said back in February of 2011. We are looking at still
good emerging market growth in GFI, gross fixed investment, though it will be less in the next couple years than it has
been the last five years, but it will still be GFI growth in the 5%, 6%, 7% range, which we've been able to get a
multiplier effect, as you well know, over the last 10 years.
Our record profitability is driven by hard, difficult investments and restructuring and a commitment to technology and
innovation. And it's important that we take that profitability and put it back into the business: one, to allow us to grow
the business. And two, it will allow us to grow the profitable business and it will allow us to continue to expand our
incremental profitability over the next couple of years.
As we look at the final closing out of 2011, I want to make a call out to individuals that really had to rise up in some
very difficult environments, in particular Network Power. As you know, we had a very challenging first half of the
year. They improved in the third quarter and they improved again in the fourth quarter, and they're set up to improve
again as we move into fiscal 2012 on a total year basis. They are taking the tough actions necessary in a marketplace as
they integrate the Chloride and Avocent acquisitions. And I'm pleased to see these guys making the progress they're
making and the support that we're giving them again next year, incrementally higher restructuring, as they go forth and
continue to drive that business to be a global franchise for us and for our shareholders for many years to come.
We see a very dynamic global economy in 2012. We do not see a recession reoccurring in the United States. I see
moderate growth in the United States. I see non-residential construction still doing well in the United States.
Residential construction will challenge, I think, for the first six or twelve months – or first six to eight months of the
year. We may see some pickup in residential as we go forth into the second half of 2012, but we're not banking on that.
It's going to still be a very challenging market.
In Europe, the economy is very, very, very, very challenging. Basically, we're seeing no growth from the economy
standpoint. We're seeing basically a recession or basically no growth. Our businesses are well positioned both from a
technology and a cost structure standpoint. We had a very strong year in Europe. And I expect us to have another good
growth year next year, though not as good as we had this year. But we're well positioned from a technology,
infrastructure, and a cost structure to continue to do well in the European marketplace.
In emerging markets, the growth rate, yes, is slowing, but it's still good. It's still the highest growth rate we see in the
world. And at 35%, we have a strong position – 35% of our sales in emerging markets, we have a strong position. I still
believe that emerging markets will grow 6% – 7%. The key issue for us is we have made significant investments and
incremental investments the last 12 to 18 months. We're going to do it again in 2012, and it's going to allow us to
continue to grow and expand and drive towards emerging markets representing 45% of our total sales in the next four
or five years.
From the balance sheet and the cash flow, we have what we need to get the job done. We control our own destiny. We
generate the cash we need to pay out to our shareholders a significant dividend. We feel good about the company as we
go into 2012. We are paying out a dividend now in the 40% to 45% of our free cash flow basis. This year, we increased
it nearly 16% to on an annual basis $1.60, a significant increase. We believe quite strongly that we'll continue to
generate the cash: one, to pay back to our shareholders; and also to pay ourselves to invest for future growth and also
do acquisitions. We have the capability of generating enormous cash flow in this company, and we can invest it and
pay back to shareholders.
As I wrap it up, I look at this year and I told the Board today it was a good year. It was a challenging year. It was a
record year on many levels. It was not the easiest year of my 11 years as CEO, but it was a good year. I appreciate the
organization rising to the challenges that we faced all year long and executing. And we're going into 2012 with a very
strong hand, in my opinion, and we're ready to grow in a dynamic marketplace.
As I look at next year, the key issue for me is execution and flexibility. We don't know exactly what's going to come at
us from quarter to quarter, but we have the financial strength and the position globally to do well. And I feel we will do
well based on the initial forecast that we gave you this afternoon.

We will talk further in February when we come to New York and the investors conference. We'll talk about what we
see at that point in time. I would imagine the marketplace will look a little bit differently then. We'll have a little bit
more clarity. We'll give you insights into the various businesses. But as we leave this year, this company is in a very
strong position from top to bottom. We're executing and we know the issues we have to deal with, and we're dealing
with them. I feel good about the organization and where we're going.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to the floor to answer some questions. Thank you very much.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Thanks. Dave, I was wondering if you could comment on the phasing of China stimulus
between tightening and back to long-term plans, specifically in the low-income housing units. I think they have a $10
million a year target. It might have been half that this year; but that and also more broadly, if you could.
<A - David N. Farr>: From my perspective, China will grow next year. It's clearly slowing down, and they're trying to
manage certain parts of the economy. My expectation in the housing area, which does drive some of our Climate
Technology businesses, that I think you'll see from quarter to quarter that it could be up and down, quite bouncing,
quite volatile. So I feel that as you go into 2012, I believe that the Chinese government will stimulate the economy as
they move into the next generation leadership. So I feel reasonably good about the China economy, even though it will
be slower growth next year. But I feel that we will still have a very good growth year in China. We finished this year
around 14%, and I would expect us to be in that 12% to 15% again next year as we go into the fiscal year. And it will
bounce around from quarter to quarter, but I feel good about what's going on in China overall.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Thanks a lot. I guess the first question was following up on the outlook by geography
because I guess your global organic growth guidance is 5% to 7%. Europe, it doesn't sound like you're expecting much
at all. And I guess your emerging market growth comment of 6% to 7% for 2012, that's a GDP growth I guess.
<A - David N. Farr>: It's GFI.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Right, exactly, so your own end market – your own revenue growth will exceed that. So
what's your – I just wanted more clarity on I guess you assumption for the U.S. growth, whether GFI or your own
growth in the U.S. because I guess you've given Europe and the emerging markets out...
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, now what I give you is European economy growth. I believe next year in Europe we will
grow in the 5% to 7% range in Europe. Based on our mix of business and the export and the backlog that we have in
Europe right now, I still believe that our European businesses will grow in the 5% to 7% range. I gave you GDP growth
in Europe. I think the economy will be in a recession or no-growth environment.
In the U.S., I think that the U.S. growth next year for us will be in the low to medium size single digit. I think you're
going to have a moderate growth of GDP. We had very strong U.S. growth this year. And so I would say that we're
going to be growing, again, at the low end, the 4%, 5%, 6% range for the U.S. next year.

Our emerging market growth, if I see two times – we've been not doing quite two times GFI. We've been doing closer
to 1.7 – 1.8 times GFI. So that's the type of emerging market growth that I see next year at this point in time, and it will
vary. And so from my perspective, we're still going to have a pretty good year. The key issue for me is we're going to
need to be able to react very quickly to the changing market dynamics. If things happen to unfold in China and the
stimulus does not come forward and we see a slowdown in China, we'll have to react to that. The same thing in Europe;
if things get really messier than they are today, then we're going to have to react to that.
But we've gone into this year; we took our inventory down. But year end, we actually finished the inventory level at the
same level we had last year and we grew sales multibillion dollars this year. So we're going into next year being lean
from a manufacturing standpoint and an operations standpoint, knowing that we're going have to be flex and flex very
quickly given what's going to change. But the growth is out there. So I still feel that we can grow this company in the
5% to 7% underlying growth. We're just going to have to flex it very quickly this year.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Okay, thanks. And then just on a divisional basis in Network Power, as you say, things are
looking a lot better there sequentially; but I guess year on year, your earnings in that business still slightly down I guess
year on year in Q4. So when you're looking at 2012, what do you think really gets the earnings up a lot? Is there any
update say on what your decision was around the India and China telecom businesses? And also you called out U.S.
weakness on some telecom related stuff. Schneider and Eaton had mentioned something in data centers as well looking
a little bit weaker; if you could just update us on the data center demand outlook.
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm not going to talk about segment information from a sales or profitability standpoint. We'll do
that in February. From the market standpoint, we have corrections at our customer levels from time to time. I think the
market is slowing down in the data center around the world, just like the overall economy, though we're still seeing
reasonable orders, as you saw, the last month.
Again, I think it's going be a dynamic year, both from the telecom standpoint and the data center standpoint, though I
still believe there will be moderate growth, and we'll have to see how it unfolds here. The fourth calendar quarter for us
typically is a very volatile quarter because you don't know what companies are going to do from the pull-forward or
shutdown. Therefore, we won't get a good read from the business segments until we get into that January timeframe.
That's when I feel more comfortable giving you an update on that, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Okay, thanks a lot.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks. Good afternoon, Dave. I appreciate it.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Just first question around – very simply on the reduction in inventory, I think it was
around $250 million. What's the earnings impact of that? How should we think about that flowing through?
<A - David N. Farr>: It hurt us.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Just order of magnitude?
<A - David N. Farr>: It hurt us.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay.

<A - David N. Farr>: I know it hurt us. I can't sit here and quantify that. I do know from the standpoint it will hurt
your margin if you take it out within that type of time period. You're talking about a two or three-month time period. It
does hurt us. But from my perspective, it's the right thing to do. So typically, we will flow through on production
standpoint on that 20%, 25%, 30% range. You lose a little bit less than that as you take it out. But it definitely hurt us
from a margin standpoint. But I thought it was very, very appropriate given the uncertainty we see both around the
world, both in Europe and somewhat in the United States that you get your balance sheet in order going into that new
fiscal year. And why wait until the new fiscal year starts? Get it done, and so we did it.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: And was that mostly in Climate Tech or was it broad based Climate and Industrial? How
should we think about that?
<A - David N. Farr>: Network Power and Process were the big areas.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Network Power and Process, okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: Climate Technology has seen a slowdown for quite some time. Our customers – we
communicate very strongly with our customers every day and we adjust our factories every day. It's a little bit different
business model. So we've done a pretty good job of keeping that in line for the last three or four months. And I expect
that inventory to stay pretty weak both at our level in the channel and in Climate.
Network Power and Process and those areas are very, very important. The last market we really need to get our handles
around is Industrial Automation, and that usually takes a little longer as we get a feel for where the end customers are
going, and they still don't know themselves.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: I was going to say, do you feel like you're still chasing inventory destocking at this point,
or do you feel like you're well positioned?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think we got ahead of this curve. I fundamentally believe you've got to stay ahead of this
curve, and we did. And so I want to thank the operational people. It does hurt us. And I wasn't being cute with you,
Steve. It's very hard for me to magnify how much, but I do know it hurt us. And so I think that, from my perspective, it
was the right thing to do. We're sitting in a good position right now, and we'll selectively bring inventory back into
place as we see that market stabilize; which I feel, by the way, it is stabilizing in North America. I feel that things have
bottomed out, and now we're sitting at a place that I feel comfortable that we will not have an economic downturn in
the United States in the next 12 months.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And then I know you don't want to talk about 2012, but just if I talk about this
quarter's incremental margins for say Process, I think it was 37% sequentially; and Network Power, again, 44%
sequentially. Those are still very high numbers. If you think about – was there anything that was unique to the quarter
that helped you achieve that, or this was just this standard pricing cost, cost reduction actions, and leverage?
<A - David N. Farr>: From a Process standpoint, we had a very strong mix from a lot of what I would say MRO and
some of the good customer base, and obviously some better products that came through that. I would expect typically
what we see in Process, we are a very profitable business. We'll have a good month, a good quarter, and then we'll
slack off. It goes back and forth based on the mix. And I would expect us to have more large project business flowing
through on Process in total next year than we did this year based on the backlog.
Relative to Network Power, Network Power really worked hard to clean up some of the issues that we dealt with in the
middle of year. And so I would expect incrementally the margins will still be good, but I don't expect them to be at that
level. They really made tremendous headway in the last 45 days as we really focused hard on trying to get ahead of that
Power curve. I feel good where they are and they're going to have a very strong 2012. They just need to keep executing,
as we were talking about.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, outstanding baseball and I will hand it off from here.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much, Steve.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good afternoon, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hello, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hello, just a couple things. Could you give us some context on where you are on the gross
spending? You spent a little time in your opening remarks on the things that you're focused on. Do you think it
discernibly moved the top line in 2011, or is it a driver of your view on 2012? I think you said the actual spending level
is going up on 2012. Can you give us any more clarity on what's going on?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, the impact will be in 2012 that we spent this year. We invested – I think in the end where
did we end up, around $30-some odd million? $30 million, yes. So $37 million – $35 million, say around $35 million
last year. We're going spend probably next year in that $50 million range, so it will be a little bit more incremental, $35
million plus $15 million type incremental type. The way the spending works is going to be we're planting seeds in
investment growth. Last year we did it for 2012 and 2013. This year we're going to be doing it for 2013 and 2014. But
given the levels of profitability, of driving all the actions we've been taking across this company, we feel quite strongly
we need to invest for that growth because we're going to have to drive the growth.
So you're going to see the investments both from technology standpoint, a lot of innovation coming out. A lot of our
new service and solution type businesses, really the new business models we're working on are going to start paying
dividends for us and helping us grow next year. It's going to help us grow despite what I would say is the slowing
marketplace out there. We drive very hard to try to have an incremental improvement over that type of marketplace,
which we had the last couple years. And I believe that's where this focus point is, in particular in technology and in
particular – not only the emerging markets but also in the Unites States, where there's a lot of investments going on in
the oil and gas industry and some of the power industry, and we are making some investments to support that as that
goes forward here. So it's a very global thing that will help our 2012 and 2013 growth and obviously profitability.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And as you said, you don't want to get into the weeds on this segment. But if we think about
the fix in Network Power, obviously you did show some great progress in this quarter. In terms of resetting the base
there and other restructuring, how far along are you? Are you 90% through this now, or is there a lot of work to do in
the first half still?
<A - David N. Farr>: There's a lot of work to do. We're going to have around $30 million of restructuring in our
Network Power business, maybe a little bit more, in 2012. So the work has started. And incrementally, you're going to
start seeing some effort here relative to some significant restructuring in our European businesses, and that's going to
happen in 2012 and early 2013. As I said, it's a multiyear program, and we've had some progress in the last year. And
we're going to have even more progress, in my opinion, in 2012. But if you look at our restructuring, we're talking
about $100 million of restructuring next year. A big chunk of that restructuring is going to be in that Network Power
business.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great, and then just one follow-up to clean up. Pat in the script said there was a $60 million
transaction gain. Is that the gain that's referenced in the release on Process, or was that spread out throughout the
organization?
<A - David N. Farr>: What was your – the gain was -
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yes, the FX transaction...
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, $16 million?
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yes.
<A - Patrick Fitzgerald>: That included the Process.

Thank you. Our next question does come from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Hi, good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Steve.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Just a question on the free cash. You talked about how you guys are taking this inventory out. I
looked at the – just maybe I'm not getting all the detail because you guys don't break out inventories, receivables, and
the other inventory accounts. But it looked like this quarter's working capital performance was actually somewhat
seasonally weak going back to the last several quarters. Can you just maybe help me jibe those numbers, if there's
something else missing in those – within the working capital accounts that offset that inventory move?
<A - David N. Farr>: If you look at trade working capital as a percent to sales, it dropped. Last year, it was 15.5%;
this year it was 15%. We had strong growth in receivables. It's all driven by – Steve, that's the one area that you see
huge growth. Receivables went up about $500 million – $600 million because – or $500 million because of strong sales
in the last 45 days. We historically always have strong sales, and so that will pay out. But in total, trade working capital
actually had a pretty good improvement in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: The receivable dollars did go up significantly based on our strong sales in the last 45 days.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay, so that's the offset to the – because we can't obviously see the inventory number, we'll see it
in the K?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, you'll see it in the K.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: Exactly. Now when you saw the inventory number on the – we gave it out on the balance sheet.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Yes, the balance sheet, sure. Sure. Sure. Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: We did give it out on the sheet that Pat went through.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Sure, okay. On Industrial Automation, have you seen any destocking from Cat? I know that their
power shipments flowed pretty dramatically. Have you seen any change in behavior there?
<A - David N. Farr>: Cat doesn't stock our inventory. We build their order there, so the orders are still pretty good
because we're living off of backlog. Clearly, given off the high growth rates that we had last year at this time, Cat's
comparisons are going to be tougher and tougher and the growth rates are going to drop. But we haven't seen – it's not a
dramatic change. It's a normal cycle Cat goes through. They build up and then they come back down, and that's where
we are right now.
The biggest issue we had in Industrial Automation is with our contracts, we get the price increase coverage. And
obviously, it hurts our margin because we don't make margin on price increase relative to covering steel and copper.
But right now, our business at Caterpillar is still very strong, and they had a good quarter and we expect them to

continue to have a good quarter. And we're building the capacity and the product we need right now.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay, and then one last question. I guess you were talking about mid-single-digit growth in the
U.S. You did 3% in the fourth quarter. I guess that's just some of the negative comps normalizing in Climate. Is that an
aspect there of the acceleration that you're expecting into next year?
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't expect acceleration. I expect – Climate did hurt us in the fourth quarter because they had
a very strong – last year at this time they had a very strong quarter. I expect the Climate Technology, our HVAC
business in North America, to be very challenging in the first half of this year. And then we're expecting some
moderate recovery in second half, one because of easy comparisons and because of all the destocking going on. So
we're looking more for the HVAC North America, U.S. business to be I'd say weak in the first half, in particular
because our first quarter, I know this quarter is going be challenging. And then we're going into the second quarter,
which is the first calendar quarter, and I think we'll improve a little bit as we go on in the year. But that's where some of
that growth is coming from. But we also see a very still good Industrial Process; and we're also seeing a pretty good
growth in our – Pat's slide, Tools and Storage businesses. That business has stabilized and we've seen pretty good,
steady order pace there.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay, just one last quick one. The wind charge, is that the same business that you guys have
highlighted in Industrial Automation, or is this just a market issue? I know you guys have talked about the wind related
sales there, or is that a different business?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, it's the same business. We actually have multiple businesses in wind and also solar. But we
had done this acquisition, and there was a very strong forecast of growth expectations in China. That marketplace has
really taken a nosedive as government backed off in supporting it. So we felt as we look at the business, the growth
profile of that business is going be different going forward. And we thought it was very appropriate at the point in time
to say okay, let's deal with it now and get that behind us and take that value out based on what we saw going forward.
But we still had growth in our wind and solar businesses, and we expect to see growth next year. It's just not going be
at the same pace because the government support is definitely not there around the world right now.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Great, thanks for all the detail. I appreciate it.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much, Steve.
<A - Patrick Fitzgerald>: As we go on to the next caller, please try to limit it to two questions per caller.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Good afternoon, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: Just a question on M&A, how you're thinking about it now. I know earlier in the year, you
were indicating it was going to take a break there, and you were going to focus on share repurchases. Is that still the
thought here in fiscal 2012?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, from my perspective right now, I have some small what I call bolt-on deals. We're looking
at a forecast of acquisitions in 2012 most likely in the $300 million to $500 million range. We're going to look at more
small bolt-on deals. We want to digest the Network Power businesses that we've worked on, and that's our very strong
focus there, but we're working small bolt-ons.
From a share repurchase standpoint, we will modulate that back at this point in time. We're going to most likely be in
the $500 million – $600 million range next year in share repurchase, and obviously keep our balance sheet flexible at

this point in time if some big opportunity came along. And we're obviously going to pay back our shareholders this
year a significant increase in dividends to pay back the shareholders for their support of the company.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: And then just to follow up on that, any regional trends on the M&A market out there? Have
you seen anything more attractive, less attractive on a regional basis?
<A - David N. Farr>: Not really. I don't think anything has changed. I think the market right now is, in my opinion, in
a slow transaction mode right now because there are a lot of dynamic changes in the economies. I think you've got to
get through this economy forecast and steady-state a little bit better. There's a lot of uncertainty in Europe. There's not a
lot going on in Europe right now, which reflects on the uncertainty going on in Europe.
<Q - Richard M. Kwas>: All right, thanks so much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Hi, Dave. Obviously, great job on taking down inventories this quarter. You mentioned getting ahead
of the curve. Are you starting to see broader inventory reductions with some of your customers on maybe supplies?
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say the answer is no. I just felt that with the global economy slowing from – I look at
what we faced last year, Nigel, and where I thought we would be as we exited this year. I see slower growth in 2012
than I did say six months ago. And so therefore, I felt quite strongly we needed to leave this year with what I'd say a
leaner inventory balance sheet in a production standpoint. And then we'll adjust as we move into this different dynamic
in 2012. I still see growth, but it's definitely going be slower than just a few – six months ago. At one time, I felt – I
think I actually probably said to the outside world I thought that 2012 was going be more in the 7% or 8% type of
growth range. I don't think that's going to be the case now.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, and then on Power, obviously great job on the sequential improvements from Q2 up to around
now. Obviously, some of that is due to fixing some of the issues in China and India. But how much of that is also due
to Chloride accretion because you set some fairly, maybe ambitious targets for the accretion from Chloride. How are
we tracking towards those targets?
<A - David N. Farr>: We reviewed our plans with the Board where we stand relative to two significant acquisitions
both in Chloride and Avocent. And we are slightly better than our acquisition plan for this year. Now it's one year out
of the box basically. From my perspective, we are on track. We should see more acceleration as we go into 2012. And
Scott Barbour and the Network Power team know that I'm expecting that.
So I think the real mark from my perspective – yet we've made good headway. We've really made a mess of it in the
first half of the year. We've got some good recovery, but we've a long way to go here. I think the key milestone for me
and the key port of execution for me from my perspective that we'll see is how this team performs over the next 12
months, not necessarily quarter by quarter, but how they perform over the next 12 months because they have some
significant things they have to get done relative to restructuring and also profitability improvements. And I think that
we've got a good start. We've got to keep it going and get it done now. So I think the next 12 months from my
perspective, we're okay right now. We're contributing to the shareholders. Now we've got to really start contributing
next year.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks, Dave, and thanks, Lynne, for all your help.
<A - David N. Farr>: All the best to you, Nigel.

Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Hi, good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: I just wanted to dig in first on Transport and Refrigeration, called out as strong in the
script. Some of the OEMs seem to have changed their tone there recently. Just any update on what the incoming order
pace is there and a forward trajectory?
<A - David N. Farr>: I'll be very honest. I don't get the order pace by product line like that. But I can tell you that on a
global – we're a global business and our Global Refrigeration Transport business has held up. It's not equal across all
customer bases but it has held up. And I'm expecting again 2012 to have a good growth in our Transport and
Refrigeration business. And I just don't get a product line order number for every company that's in Emerson. If I did
that, my desk would be very full of documents.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: No, understood. I'm just trying to...
<A - David N. Farr>: I know and I wasn't being cute. I'm just saying I know what's going on. I can't tell you the
specific number. I know it's still good. But there are definitely some people that are weaker than others. But overall, we
are a global company in this area here, and it's holding up pretty nicely.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: All right, I read you loud and clear on that one. And then just shifting over to Network
Power, it seems like the new five-year plan for China entails a good amount of broadband growth and building out that
market. Any pull-through from that on the Embedded Power and Computing side, or I guess anywhere in Network
Power starting to see participation from the new five-year plan?
<A - David N. Farr>: The answer is yes, we will. We will see that because that is both from a telecom basis and also
an enterprise, which is the data center, more enterprise basis, and we'll see both of them. The big issue that will be is
that it will be over multiple years. We actually did see some pickup if you look at the improvement in the fourth
quarter. We saw some pretty good improvement in China in the Network Power basis as the orders picked back up. So
I would expect 2012 to have a pretty good growth rate.
We are still doing some pruning in Network Power. As I told the people as we started this process I think May and June
of last year, it would probably take us 12 to 14 months. So we're still not finished with that. So some of our growth rate
will be modulated, but that will help our profitability. But overall with the China strategy, China growth program, we're
going see to see pretty good growth in many of our businesses over the next four or five years.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Certainly. And just to make sure I'm clear, I guess to think of the volume growth helping
to accelerate maybe that pricing sticking a little bit better is the right way to think about it.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, that is the right way to think about it.
<Q - Joshua Pokrzywinski>: Thank you very much.

<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Eli.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: I get called a lot of things these days, right?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Just one clarification, the $19 million...
<A - David N. Farr>: I like that new nickname though. I'm thinking about using that.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Yes, okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: Just don't hit me when you see me, okay?
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: I'll get even, don't worry.
<A - David N. Farr>: That's good.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: The $19 million charge for wind, is that in the EBIT number of the Industrial Automation
business?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, it's not. It's in corporate.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: It's in corporate, okay. I just wanted to make sure of that. And can you talk about how you
ramp – planning to run inventory as we go into 2012? Are you going to take them, run them flat for the first half of the
year or down? And the same thing with the restructuring, with Europe being as difficult, not only as it looks but could
be for a while, are you planning or are you reexamining your restructuring efforts, particularly in Europe, at this point?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, relative to inventories, I would expect our inventories to build slightly in the first half of
the year, but we're going to build them in a little different places. So in total – you see the total, I would expect that
number to come up a little bit. I would say the whole year we are going to probably run based on what I see right now, I
would expect our inventories to build a little bit, but not nearly as much and probably move back down towards that
$2.1 billion to $2.15 billion range as we finish the year, but that's what's going to happen. We're going to be very
selective where we build inventory.
Relative to the restructuring, the restructuring can be very, very, very much – that's three verys, focused on Europe in
2012. These are programs, as you know, how difficult it is that we've been working now for a while. And we are teed
up ready to start executing those. And some of those have already started being executed in the first fiscal quarter, the
fourth calendar quarter. So of the $100 million, from my perspective, a majority of that money is going to be spent in
Europe. And then if we see sloppiness occurring, we will allocate more money for restructuring if necessary if things
get tougher out there.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Have you been hedging copper? With copper coming down as much as most of the materials,
shouldn't you have a tailwind for material costs in 2011? You said you were going to stay green, but shouldn't it be
more than that, assuming that hedges roll off and...
<A - David N. Farr>: We hedge our copper. We're out pretty far into 2012 already. The average price is obviously
higher right now than the current spot price, but that's what we do. We deal with that because you have to keep the
policy going. And from my standpoint, actual net material inflation will slow down next year. It will still be, obviously,
still a positive number and we're going have to get price increases. But right now it's better for us, both in our key
commodities. But we have hedged close to 80% of our copper for 2012 already.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Thank you very much.
<A - David N. Farr>: Take care, sir; all the best to you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Terry Darling from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Thanks. Dave, I'm wondering if you want to clarify some of the perspective on Q1. First, from
an organic basis, given your earlier comment on Climate, a very difficult comp in Industrial Automation and then some
of the Network Power de-sell and some of the order data there. Should we think about first quarter organic being below
this 5% to 7% organic range that you've talked about for the full year and then it builds as we move throughout the year
and comps get a little easier?
<A - David N. Farr>: First of all, as you know, I don't give quarterly numbers and I don't give quarterly guidance.
Secondly, one of the issues that I should comment and we'll obviously put out now that you touched the subject, I'm
going to say we'll put it out in the 8-K.
Given what's going on in Thailand right now, we are going to be impacted somewhere around $300 million to $400
million in the quarter in sales as we reallocate our production around in the Process world. We at this point in time, it's
our best guess. It's just something that has come together in the last couple days. We're working on it. There has been
massive disruption to our supply base and some of our assemblies. And so we're going to have an issue from a timing
standpoint. But for the whole year, we'll be okay but we're going get hit here in this first quarter. But I don't give
forecasts on a quarterly basis, but you should factor in the fact that we will have some impact from the Thailand
shipments because of our Process business which will hurt us. And we'll put that out so everyone knows that too. That's
my answer right now. I don't know exact – I could be wrong, I don't know, but that's our best guess as of this morning.
I asked the guys in case I had to get into it.
<Q - Terry Darling>: That's very helpful, and any sense, a company average margin type of impact as we think about
trying to draw that down to the EPS level?
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say that from my perspective, our Process business is very profitable, and you're taking
out some very profitable business in the company, so it's going to hurt us. It's going be above-average margin.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Overweight process there, okay. And then is the $20 million healthcare charge in the full-year
guidance?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, it is.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. And Dave, just going back to the Climate margin overall, the comment on mix, I think a
lot of us are seeing that effect on other HVAC companies as it relates to the move down to 13 SEER, which I think we
would all expect for you guys would be lower margin. Given the first half still tough, you're clearing out some
inventories and the mix down, are you thinking about Climate margins as flat to down next year within the scope of
you're up 50 basis points across the whole company?
<A - David N. Farr>: Again, I'll say that I'm not going give you individual business segment margins at this point in
time. But I would expect the profitability of the Climate margin next year will be – there will be a struggle this year
given the fact the first half of the year will be a challenge and we're expecting some recovery in the second half. But we
have some new products coming out and we have a lot of investments going on there. But I would say that will be one
of the more challenging margins as we look at it, and I'll give you more details again in February. But that clearly is
going to be one of the more challenging – they had record levels of profitability in 2010. The second half of the year
really struggled in 2011 as volumes dropped. And we've continued our investment with a lot of important technology
investments underway in Climate, and we're maintaining those for our long-term customer base and our growth profile.
<Q - Terry Darling>: That's very helpful; thanks much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from John Inch from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thanks. Hi, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hi, John. I just want to announce that I'm going to take John's question and one other question. I
do have another call I have to take in about five minutes. So I can take John's call and one other call. And I apologize
for that, but Pat and Lynne will be available. You can harass those two and ask Lynne about the World Series. It was a
pretty good World Series. I know the East Coast guys didn't watch it, but we did in the Midwest.
<Q - John G. Inch>: You've got to take your victories where you can get them, right?
<A - David N. Farr>: You're darn right, John, and I took one.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay, Industrial Automation. Was the sequential and year-over-year margin pressure, even
though you had 15% underlying sales growth, was that a function purely of the ROS [Return on Sales] that you called
out, or was there a mix issue or something else going on there?
<A - David N. Farr>: The fundamental issue there is the fact that with a massive amount of material inflation and the
price comes in and we run that through the sales line and the GP line, you get no margin on it. That truly hurt our
margin in Industrial Automation, and that's what hurt it. We had a great year, but that quarter in particular when all of a
sudden you get a big price increase like that, it just tears apart that margin. But overall, the margin and profit in
Industrial Automation is still running pretty good.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Dave, your five-year plan at the February meeting talked about margins 16% to 18% with a plus
sign on the 18%. And in a slower growth structural environment, you're calling out 18%, does that suggest the range
moves higher or that margins have capped themselves, and as growth resumes you're going, we should expect lower
margins for Emerson? It still drives your EPS, but I'm still trying to – I'm trying to understand how we should think
about the 18% in the context of slower growth, but obviously you're putting up the 5% to 7%.
<A - David N. Farr>: From my perspective, you're going to see in February this year, you're going to see my margin
target go up. As I review with the Board, we have the capability with what we're doing right now to grow the company
also and to increase our incremental investment and also continue to improve our profitability. And the key issue, as
we've talked about on conference calls before and also in conferences, is I'm trying to manage this from the standpoint
where that margin point is that also it's going to start hurting our incremental growth. Right now, we are not hurting our
incremental growth, and we're able to put higher levels of profitability in and also invest. So I would expect in February
to see a higher number at the top end of that cycle now and maybe 15% to 19% as we continue to mix this company.
<Q - John G. Inch>: No, that makes total sense. I'm assuming that would mean a higher potential gross margin, right,
Dave? I think you gave a range of 39.6% to 41%, and you've done these numbers at the 39.6% level. I'm assuming that
was a ROS issue as well versus expectations.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, from my perspective, the GP margin target still is in that low-40% range. Yes.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay, thank you much.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome, John.

question.

<A - David N. Farr>: Hello, Deane.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thank you, good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon. I hope you're doing well. Are you in the doghouse our out of the doghouse?
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: I'm completely out of the doghouse, thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: That's always good to hear.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: And I did pass on your e-mail, so it helped.
<A - David N. Farr>: It helped by two nanoseconds.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Just to clarify on Thailand, the supply disruptions, how does that compare to what you
went through in Japan?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think it's going to be more significant. The issue being there is that we could go out in
distribution and buy inventory. And relative to the component level, this is a lot more sub-assembly work for us being
done. And so I think you're going to find an industry, if you're sourcing, if you have suppliers coming out of Thailand,
in particular this part of Thailand, there is going to be a three, four month disruption. And so we have an aggressive
plan which we reviewed with the Board today. That's why I now know approximately what it's going to cost us. And
the key issue for me is we have a plan underway and we're taking action, but it's going take us three, four months to get
this under control again.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: That's helpful. And then just if you can clarify, if you replay the third quarter conference
call, you were decidedly unsettled about talking about 2012. And then today, you're far more constructive. And in fact,
if I had to guess, the GFI numbers you're picking are towards the upper end of what might have been the expected
range. So what has given you that confidence? It sounds like there's a lot of items that you can control your own
destiny. But what changed in the last couple of months that has given you a more constructive outlook?
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm three months older, and with age you get maturity. And sometimes, Deane, to be honest, I'm
a passionate individual, and sometimes my passion gets in the way. It's one of the good things that helps me be a CEO,
but it also hurts me from time to time. Cooler heads think about what's going on in this world and what we can do and
what we can control. And I believe as I look at this, this has unfolded on a global basis. I feel that growth opportunities
are still there for us. And I can see the way through, the stones through that from Emerson's standpoint, stepping
through this. And we're making those investments. And let's put it this way, maturity you learn from. Sometimes even
at 56 years old, you can be immature, and I was immature at 56. So I'm stronger now, if you understand that.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: I appreciate it. I certainly do. And just lastly, I know it's a welcome to Pat and it's best
wishes for Lynne, but how about congratulations for Dave getting into the Board of IBM?
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much. I don't know if they're ready for me though.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: That's what we're wondering, but best of luck.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much, Deane. I look forward to seeing you soon; all the best to you.
David N. Farr
And again, I want to thank Lynne. I want to welcome Pat on board and the whole OCE and the business leadership.
And we're looking forward to a fun and exciting and productive 2012, and again, trying to create value for our
shareholders across this company, around this world. And hopefully, our shareholder base is happy about the strong
dividend increase. Being a large shareholder myself, I'm very happy, let's put it that way. And with that, I say goodbye.
Thanks.
