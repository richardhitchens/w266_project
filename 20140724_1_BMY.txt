MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to today's second-quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Elicker, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Public
Affairs. Please go ahead, sir.
John E. Elicker
Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call to review our Q2 results. Before we get
started, let me take care of the Safe Harbor language. During the call, we will make statements about the company's
future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those
indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the
company's SEC filings.
These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today, and should not be relied upon as representing our
estimates as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements,
even if our estimates change. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted to exclude certain specified
items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at
our website.

With me this morning we have Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer; and Charlie Bancroft, our Chief
Financial Officer. Both Lamberto and Charlie will have prepared remarks, and then joining for Q&A, Francis Cuss, our
Chief Scientific Officer, and Giovanni Caforio, our Chief Operating Officer.
Lamberto?
Lamberto Andreotti
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Well, we just completed another good quarter for Bristol-Myers Squibb,
good in terms of financial performance and good in terms of clinical results and regulatory milestones. Overall,
revenues were $3.9 billion, a 7% increase over last year, excluding the diabetes business that we still had in the second
quarter of 2013.
We delivered strong growth of our key products, and in particular of Eliquis and Yervoy. For Eliquis, we continued to
execute against our strategy to clearly capitalize on its differentiated and unique profile, and we continued to see
improved prescription trends generated by the increased resources we and Pfizer have been devoting to
direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. and to sales force expansion and peer-to-peer medical education activities in
all countries. We also made good improvements in access.
And the label of Eliquis is expanding beyond atrial fibrillation. We just received a positive recommendation for
approval in Europe for the treatment of recurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism, and subject to approval, the final
registration should be formalized in August. The same indication is under regulatory review in the U.S.
Yervoy also had a very strong performance this quarter, its best quarter ever, with $321 million in sales, a 38% increase
over last year. We continue to see strong demand worldwide. As we advance and expand our immuno-oncology
leadership position, we continue to view Yervoy as an important component of our strategy both in monotherapy and in
combination regimens.
With respect to other regulatory developments, the big news this quarter was our recent Japanese approval of our
hepatitis C dual regimen, Daklinza and Sunvepra. This was a significant development for the 1.2 million hepatitis C
patients living in Japan, many of whom currently have no treatment options.
It was also significant for our company, for Bristol-Myers Squibb. We saw the first approval of our dual regimen
anywhere in the world, and this is the first time that the first approval of one of our products – and, in fact, two
products at the same time – occurred in Japan, something that underscores the global nature of our company. And while
the Japan approval was the first, we also expect important news in our key markets, starting with Europe, where the
CHMP has given daclatasvir a positive opinion for use with other agents.
This has also been a very important quarter for Opdivo, or nivolumab, with key data presentations, new regulatory
development, and new collaborations that enhance our global development portfolio. We presented important data at
ASCO regarding renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, and melanoma as monotherapy and in combination regimens. A
double-blind Phase III Opdivo study in melanoma was stopped for a very good reason. The data was too good to keep
patients on the treatment with the traditional chemotherapy to which it was compared.
In the U.S., we recently announced our plan to seek marketing approval for Opdivo in advanced melanoma, with a
filing with the FDA in the third quarter. This is in addition to the rolling submission in lung cancer that we had
previously initiated and that should be completed by the end of the year.
For Europe, we have just received confirmation this morning that the CHMP granted us accelerated assessment for
metastatic melanoma. We expect to complete our European metastatic melanoma submission in Q3. And yesterday we
completed a strategic collaboration agreement with Ono Pharmaceuticals to help address the unmet medical needs of
patients with cancer in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This follows the approval Ono received for Opdivo in Japan,
making it the first PD-1 approved anywhere.

We will have more important milestones for our immuno-oncology program over the coming months, including
regulatory submission and data readouts. We are definitely uniquely positioned and we believe we can realize the
potential of immuno-oncology with our deep and large portfolio and our experienced and committed people.
Taken together, this was a good quarter, one that reflected our balanced approach of delivering strong results today
while building a solid foundation for tomorrow. And now I will turn the floor to Charlie.
Charles A. Bancroft
Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a very good second quarter, with strong growth
across most of our key brands. Let me provide a few highlights.
Eliquis sales were $171 million. As Lamberto noted, our continued investments are building momentum for Eliquis
around the world. In the U.S., net sales for Eliquis were $94 million, up 54% from the first quarter. Our new-to-brand
share among cardiologists has grown nearly eight share points since the start of the year.
Outside the U.S., net sales were $77 million, up 71% from the first quarter. In addition to Germany, where Eliquis use
remains strong, we are seeing robust growth elsewhere in Europe, especially Italy and France following recent launches
there. We are also seeing very good growth in Japan.
We continue to make progress in broadening our label. We launched our ortho indication for deep vein thrombosis in
the U.S. in mid-April and expect regulatory decisions for VTE treatment in the U.S. by late August and in Europe by
the end of the year.
Yervoy sales grew 38%, to $321 million. U.S. sales were $173 million, Yervoy's best quarter since launch. Sales
outside the U.S. totaled $148 million, led by markets such as Germany, France, and just recently the U.K. where we
have reimbursement in the first-line setting. We also reported strong sales in Australia, Brazil, and Canada. Driven by
our execution in the markets, we are seeing increased awareness about immunotherapy and more community
oncologists prescribing Yervoy for the first time.
Orencia sales increased 14%, to $402 million. Orencia had a solid quarter due to higher demand in the U.S., Canada,
and South America. Orencia sub-Q has grown 60% worldwide since the same quarter last year and 18% sequentially
from the first quarter, as we continue to improve our performance in the first-line setting. Sub-Q now accounts for 40%
of all Orencia sales, even as the IV remains strong.
We did see softness in our virology business in the quarter. In our HIV franchise, we are seeing increased competitive
pressure for Reyataz and the continued impact of last year's loss of exclusivity for Sustiva in Europe. For Baraclude,
sales were down 1%. Strong sequential and year-over-year growth for Baraclude in the U.S. and Europe was offset by
lower demand in China and inventory work-down in Japan.
Abilify sales were $555 million during the quarter, including $97 million in Europe. Recall that our rights to Abilify in
Europe expired on June 11. As a result, we no longer have any commercial interest in or obligations to Abilify in
Europe, which has accounted for the majority of our Abilify sales outside the U.S.
Before moving to the rest of our P&L, let me remind everyone how we account for the diabetes transaction, as this is
the first full quarter since we divested our diabetes franchise in February. We record diabetes-related royalties in other
income. Due to the tiered structure of these royalties, we recorded the largest royalty income for 2014 in Q2. These
royalties are expected to decline as the year progresses.
Our Other Income line also includes transitional services income from AstraZeneca of over $30 million in the quarter.
We expect this income to taper off between now and the end of the year. We also expect to book diabetes product
supply revenues of about $30 million per quarter through year-end. For details about our diabetes royalty tiered
structure and other diabetes-related revenues and expenses, please see our SEC filings.

Now let me highlight a few items from our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 75.5% during the quarter, up 110 basis
points compared to the same period last year, mostly due to product mix following the divestiture of our diabetes
business. Marketing, selling, and admin expenses decreased 9% as our increased investments in Eliquis, Yervoy, and
our prelaunch assets in immuno-oncology and hepatitis C were offset by reduced expenses in diabetes.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.3% during the quarter, compared to 13.8% for the same period last year. The difference
is due to earnings mix plus the expiration of the R&D tax credit, which has not yet been extended.
I want to spend a few moments discussing business development. Our approach has not changed. We continue to view
business development as a top priority for capital allocation, and we will continue to explore opportunities to enhance
our commercial and R&D portfolios. These opportunities must meet three criteria. They must be aligned with our
diversified specialty biopharma strategy, they must have a strong scientific rationale, and they must have the potential
of providing a meaningful return to our shareholders.
Since last quarter, we have signed several agreements to strengthen our global I-O development portfolio. As Lamberto
mentioned, yesterday we announced an agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical to jointly develop and commercialize
Opdivo, Yervoy, and three of our early-stage I-O assets in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.
This agreement significantly enhances our ability to pursue combination regimens with Opdivo as the foundation, since
Ono previously owned exclusive rights to Opdivo in these markets. Similarly, our recently announced agreements with
Incyte and Celldex will expand the number of clinical trials involving Opdivo and other immunotherapies.
I will conclude my remarks on 2014 guidance. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.70 to $1.80 is unchanged.
Our guidance assumes that we retain exclusivity on Baraclude sales in the U.S. at least through the end of 2014. It also
assumes that the R&D tax credit will be extended this year.
Now we would be happy to address your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Thanks for taking the questions. Just had a little more on the business development priority
front, given the increasing competition in the I-O space and how leveraged you are to the story, could this change your
appetite or how you're thinking about doing deals within I-O versus diversifying into other therapeutic areas? Number
two, on Eliquis, congrats on the results this quarter. Could you just give us a little more color on what's going well,
where there's still room for improvement? And then, just finally, if you could just give me a bit more color on what we
should expect from you between now and year-end in terms of data readouts, and any color around ESMO and ASH
would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Okay, a few questions, so let me start with BD. I don't know, Charlie, if you want to add
something to what I'm going to say, but on BD, criteria that Charlie mentioned in his remarks apply to both
immuno-oncology and other areas. So, to answer your questions, we are looking at opportunities in both
immuno-oncology and other areas, and the goal is always to add things that make our overall portfolio stronger with the
selective integration of external R&D and internal R&D.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: The only thing I would add in regard to I-O, we are pioneers in the space, we have a lot of
assets, we have deep knowledge and great scientists, so we tend to be a strong partner of choice within the I-O space,
and we will continue to look for deals in that area that make sense that meet our criteria. And we continue to look at
ideas across the spectrum outside of I-O. As you know, we signed the iPierian deal earlier this year, which is one
indication of things that we're looking at.

<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: So let's move to Eliquis. We have always known that the strength of the Eliquis clinical
data is really unmatched among the novel anticoagulants, and we're glad that this strength is increasingly understood
and increasingly appreciated by physicians. And the data set we'll generate in A-fib is clearly very important, and will
bring the additional indications to the market. Giovanni, do want to say a few things about how we're doing with
Eliquis?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, and thank you and good morning. So we, indeed, had a good quarter with Eliquis in the
U.S. We had a very good quarter in key international markets, and I'll make a couple of comments about both areas. In
the U.S., we saw good progression and trends, with a 40% increase in NBRx volume and a 50% increase in TRx
volume versus the previous quarter. Notably, in cardiology, which is really our area of primary focus, our NBRx share
grew to 38%, but interestingly, we also started seeing really good trends and progression in primary care, where our
NBRx share grew significantly, to 28%, versus the previous quarter.
What's driving our performance in the U.S. is really, first, what Lamberto mentioned, the strength of our profile and our
clinical data; second, solid execution of our strategy. And I'll point to a few things. First, we clearly have set an
objective to continue to strengthen our access position, and in the second quarter we were able to continue to make
progress with formulary listing of Eliquis in now over 90% of our target hospitals. Second, on the access side, we were
able to add preferred status, with approximately 20 million incremental lives in the U.S.
We had good success with Caremark and WellPoint, and now we have very strong preferred access to the tune of about
60% on the commercial side and 80% on the Medicare side. And this obviously is a development that will continue to
generate growth going forward. We have very competitive investment levels in the U.S. and leading share of voice in
cardiology and primary care, and we continue to make investments in medical education and in DTC advertising.
Thinking about the U.S., as Lamberto mentioned, we have an ongoing file with the FDA for VTE treatment, and we
think that is a meaningful opportunity going forward. First, broadening of our label reinforces the strength of our
profile. It also continues to result in growing our prescriber base, and we consider that to be very important.
Just a couple of comments outside of the U.S., we have strong performance in Europe in those markets that were
reimbursed first, like Germany, we continue to make inroads against Pradaxa and Xarelto. In other markets, like
France, that launched recently enjoyed very strong initial uptake. Outside of Europe, in Japan, which is another one of
our priority markets, you will remember that at the beginning of the year, our initial reimbursement restriction was
lifted. Following that, we had a very rapid acceleration of our growth. And I'm really happy to report that in terms of
the dynamic segment, Eliquis is now the leading agent in terms of the ability to capture new and switch patients in the
market. We are leaders, with a 40% share, in the total dynamic segment. We are leading in terms of the switch share
and approaching Xarelto in terms of the new patient share, so very strong performance there as well.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Colin. We have an exciting second half to the year in terms of data flow. We
have the 063 results, third-line lung results, coming up at the Multidisciplinary Symposium in Thoracic Oncology in
October. We're very excited about our hematological malignancy data in both non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's
lymphoma, which we will be presenting at the ASH in December. We clearly have data coming in-house for 017 and
057, and during the next few months, 069. And as far as the CheckMate 037 and CheckMate 066 in melanoma, we are
talking at the moment to our investigators to determine exactly our presentation and publication strategy, but we're very
excited about the data, and we're looking forward to sharing that with the medical community over the next few
months.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Aaron, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, sir. We'll go next to Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you, a couple questions, please. Last quarter, when you announced the plans for
rolling submission with nivo in lung, there were a lot of questions about additional data FDA might want to see and that

sort of thing. And it felt like there wasn't much that you could say at that point. But here we are, three months later. I'm
wondering if you have any new information you can share.
And then a separate question is going back to M&A, in terms of target sizes that Bristol is considering, I'm wondering
if you can bracket those for us. Some companies have said that they'll only be pursuing small bolt-on targets. I don't
think Bristol has ever really used that language. And related to this topic, is tax inversion a realistic possibility for
something that you may be seeking in any potential acquisition?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Tim. Let me reiterate, we've started the rolling submission; we expect to
complete it by the year's end. The basis of the submission is 063 data, but as you appreciate, there's substantial data that
will mature during the second half of the year that would be available to the FDA. But beyond saying that we've had
regular and productive discussions with the FDA, I won't comment further on the regulatory timing or our strategy.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: So, about size of M&As, we have never made statements about small size being our
target, and we are not going to make it today. So we'll continue to use the criteria that Charlie described and looking at
different sizes of opportunities. And going back again to the criteria that Charlie described, the financial criteria,
including the tax criteria is important, but for us, technology, products are important, and therefore tax inversion per se
is not an individual target that we are going after.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Yeah, I would just add that while we do understand the rationale for a tax inversion
strategy, including the potential tax rate improvement and increased balance sheet flexibility, there are several things
from our perspective that we would consider, and one is our tax rate is already low on a relative basis. Two, future
legislation is unclear and hard to predict in this area. And, three, as Lamberto mentioned, tax is not the primary driver
of our M&A strategy. I mentioned our criteria in my remarks, and I would say that only transactions that fit all three we
would pursue.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks. Aaron, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
We'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Francis, just a couple of questions – your plan to file nivolumab this quarter for
previously treated advanced melanoma, is there an opportunity to seek a broader melanoma label? In other words, do
you have additional data from your earlier Phase I trials that could support a broader label?
And secondly, on CheckMate 069, which I think you briefly mentioned, that's the combination Phase II study, my
understanding is that that trial is expected to end this month and that you'll have access to that data. Is there an
opportunity to use that data to supplement your Phase III melanoma trial to include the combination? Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Okay. You asked the question to Francis, and Francis will answer the question. I just
want to ask Francis also to speak about European submission, because, Jami, you were referring to the U.S. submission,
but the news of the morning is that we are filing this quarter also in Europe, and the CHMP gave us accelerated review
status for our submission. Francis?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Jami. Good morning. So, first of all, let me talk about our submission in
previously treated melanoma both in the U.S. and in Europe. In the United States, the basis of our submission is the
CheckMate 037 data. And while the 066 data we believe is very important, as you appreciate, this was a study that was
characterized and designed together with the CHMP. It was conducted in Europe and Canada, where the comparator
was first-line therapy. It is very striking that it shows a survival benefit against the comparator, and of course we will
be sharing it with regulatory authorities because we do believe it's important.
As far as Europe, the basis of that submission in the third quarter will be the CheckMate 037 and the CheckMate 066.
And then you mentioned about CheckMate 069. We don't have the data. As I said, we'll be getting the data in-house in
the next few months. I think it's premature for me to speculate what we will do with that data until we have it and we

see what it is. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Aaron, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
We'll go next to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks for the question. So, actually, I have a couple of quick questions. First off, can
you update us on trends in the HIV market and what's happening specifically with Reyataz? We're seeing some fairly
precipitous declines in Reyataz sales, and just wanted to get an update on what your thoughts are on the market there,
particularly considering that that product runs out to 2018. And then, separately, as we think about the – I just wanted
to clarify a couple of things. CheckMate 057, the non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer study, Francis, I believe
you said that 057 could have data in-house towards the end of this year. Is that an interim look at 057? And I know that
it's event-driven but that is that an interim look at 057, or is this actually the final look? And could that be something
that actually occurs next year?
And then my last question is, we just noticed, on ClinicalTrials.gov, you did initiate an expanded access or a program
with the combination of Yervoy plus Opdivo in melanoma, just wondering how that expanded access program works
into your long-term strategy in melanoma. Is this designed to really educate more physicians, or is it going to be rolling
out with the same clinical trial sites? Thanks so much.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Seamus, this is Giovanni. Let me just take the question on HIV first. Obviously, this is a
market where we have a strong presence. We have over 35% of the market through our regimens, and it is a very
competitive market where we've seen the entry of a number of new competitors that are impacting the dynamics and
trends there. With respect to Reyataz, we have seen a decrease in our volume, and TRx's in the U.S. are down 8% in the
quarter versus previous years.
That's driven really by two factors. It's driven by the launch of new STRs and the increased penetration of STRs in
early lines in the naïve setting, where the share of Reyataz traditionally has been quite strong, and also it's been driven
by an acceleration of the growth of integrase inhibitors. We obviously have a number of programs in place to continue
to support our product. I would just point to the U.S. filing for our FDC of Reyataz and cobicistat. We think that's a
meaningful opportunity. It's under review at the FDA, and obviously we're very focused on that.
Outside of the U.S., we see some similar trends in Europe, but also I would say that year-to-year comparison for the
international business, which is down 16% versus prior year, are really impacted by timing of significant tenders in our
business in Brazil that are impacting both the Q2 to Q1 comparison and substantially the comparison to previous year.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Seamus. Let me just say that the 057 non-squamous study, it is, as you say, an
event-driven study, the timing of which is around about the end of the year. Of course, it does depend a lot on the
events, and as you appreciate, as patients go longer and hopefully get more survival benefit, the exact timing of that
depends a bit on what's happening in the study. But it is an interim analysis. As far as the EAP for the combination is
concerned, as you noted, that is now open, it's CheckMate 218, and it is the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in
untreated melanoma patients. And that, of course, is to try and meet the need of patients following the excitement
around the CheckMate 004 data that was presented at ASCO and the unprecedented prolongation of survival in that
exploratory study.
I do want to add, however, that in addition to the last question about 069, there's also we have 067, CheckMate 067,
which is a Phase III study in combination. There's a big focus for us in the combination because we think it has the
potential to offer unprecedented – not just duration, but increase the number of patients that might have benefit. That is
a Phase III study comparing Yervoy, Opdivo, and the combination, with a primary endpoint of overall survival, but like
most of our Phase III studies, has the optionality to look at shorter endpoints. So the EAP program is part of just a
broader approach to both monotherapy and – we think, importantly – combination therapy. Thank you.

<A - John E. Elicker>: Aaron, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, sir. We'll go next to Steve Scala with Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. I have three questions. First, Bristol typically announces NDA acceptances and not
filings. So, assuming that it is ultimately accepted, do you anticipate telling us that the NDA for nivolumab in
previously treated advanced melanoma has been accepted in Q3, implying the filing is very near-term, given the 60-day
spread between acceptance and filing? So that's the first question. Second – sorry if I missed it – but is Bristol still on
track to initiate the Phase III trial of nivo plus ipi [ipilimumab] by year-end in lung? And then, thirdly, when we think
about the 017 trial and the severity of patients enrolled, how should we think about the survival in the docetaxel arm?
Recent trials with less sick people have shown docetaxel delivering overall survival of nine months, yet the label says
four to eight. Any perspective or color would be appreciated. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Hey, Steve, it's John. I'll take the first question. We usually do let you know when we are
planning our submissions, but our formal communication with a press release, you're correct, is – when we issue a
press release is when those filings are accepted. So the next you'll hear from us on the U.S. filing is when that filing is
accepted.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Steve. So, first of all, at me say that the CheckMate 012 study is ongoing, and
it's informing us with in-house data about the design for a potential upcoming study in lung in the combination of
Opdivo and Yervoy. And I will say it's informative, and we are still on track to initiate that study before the end of the
year. As far as the 017 study, I think you have to be careful – we all have to be careful – about comparing different
patient populations in different studies because it can often be misleading. So, for instance, you brought up the example
of the REVEL study, and I think in the REVEL study, the patient population that is normally contraindicated for
angiogenesis therapy was actually not included in that study.
That was about – we believe about 25% of the lung cancer population has a lower functional ability, and might well
explain, if that's excluded, why docetaxel actually looked better in that study. But I think the general message is we are
comfortable with the population we have in the 017 study. We think it's a good population to represent the potential we
believe Opdivo has for prolonging survival and showing overall survival in lung cancer. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Great. Aaron, can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, sir. We'll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys, thank you very much for accepting my questions. The first one, Gilead and
AbbVie tend to get all the attention in hep C, but it looks like you'll be a major player in the U.S. market within a year
or so, so I was just wondering if you could, in some kind of a general sense, talk about your philosophy on using price
to compete in the hepatitis C market, if that's possible. My second question, please, if I may, is I believe you've talked a
little bit publicly now about the statistical techniques being used in the squamous second-line nivolumab trial that may
increase the probability of detecting a signal in that trial that is increasing the probability of success. Perhaps you could
explain that to us, what that statistical technique is and why it might enhance your ability to detect a late tail. And the
third one is just very simple. You mentioned non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at ASH this year. I was just wondering if you
could tell us – obviously, without revealing details of the data, but if you could tell us whether or not you think you've
seen a convincing signal in NHL or not, that would be interesting. Thank you.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: So Giovanni will – this is Lamberto. Giovanni will tell you a few things about our plans
for hep C, but one thing for sure that we'll not tell you is anything about prices, Mark. And it is clear that we will not
disclose anything about prices until we reach the market, and there is a lot of attention we're giving to that subject

internally before we reach a final decision.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yeah, Mark, just a couple of comments on – this is Giovanni – just a couple of comments on
hep C. So, as we've discussed before, we have clearly a global strategy in hep C that's centered around daclatasvir as an
ideal component of multiple regimens, but we also have, in that context, specific regional strategies, and we've made
progress across the board during the quarter. So, obviously, Japan is the number-one priority for us because of the
approval of the dual and the significant unmet medical need in genotype 1b patients in Japan. We are conducting, as we
speak, pricing negotiations in Japan, and we are confident that we will be ready to launch at the beginning of
September, and that clearly we see as a very significant opportunity for us.
We received CHMP positive opinion for the use of daclatasvir in Europe in combination with multiple other agents.
And we believe there are opportunities in Europe with daclatasvir because of the existence of segments of the
population of high unmet medical need that are particularly well-suited to the use of daclatasvir in combination with
sofosbuvir and potentially other agents, and obviously we're getting ready to launch in Europe. And as you know, we
do have an ongoing filing with the FDA for our dual regimen, and we see that as an important event as well.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Mark. I think there are two elements to the analysis question, and both of
which have been much informed by our long experience with Yervoy. The first one is the timing of the analysis, and
the other, as you say, is the analytical model. Let me take the analytical model first of all. Traditionally, median overall
survival has been used to measure the effects on the Kaplan-Meier curve. As we've shown with Yervoy and we're
beginning to see now with our Opdivo, much of the benefit, if you're looking for durable responses and overall
survival, is seen in the bottom part of the curve later on in the clinical trial. So we use the proportional hazard ratio to
make sure we capture that survival benefit.
Now, the other issue, of course, is if you don't wait long enough for patients in the study, you run the risk of missing
that benefit because you've analyzed it too soon. So, again, our experience here is very important, both to understand
the model and [indiscernible] (41:10) the right time to the study. And of course that was why we moved back the
indication of the timing, because we're able to shift our model and understand how to do that.
As far as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at ASH, let me make the general comment that we're getting increasingly excited
about our portfolio in hematological malignancies. Certainly, in terms of Opdivo, you will be seeing data at ASH for
non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma. I think you'll be able to make your own judgments about that. But what I will
say is we were interested enough and excited enough by that data to start up mid-stage studies, which I will say are
recruiting very well. But we also have a combination study ongoing with Sprycel in CML, and of course we have our
elotuzumab, which again – in multiple myeloma, that gives us a real opportunity. So we're very excited overall about
the expansion of our position in hematological malignancies. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Next question please, Aaron.
Operator
We'll go next to Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah, thanks for taking the questions, so a couple just on the nivo. You mentioned interim
looks for 017 and 057. My question is, are there futility analyses incorporated into those interim looks, or can they only
be stopped if there are clear signs of superiority for the active agents? And then the second one just on hep C, congrats
there again on the Japan news you mentioned. You talk a lot about the near-term opportunity, but just longer-term, if
you can touch on what you see as the longevity of the market and do you see yourself being a player over the long term
in that space? And if so, do you need to do further investment in terms of maybe acquiring a nuke or some other assets
beyond what you have in your control right now? Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: So, do you want to start with the hep C? We consider virology as one area of focus for us
because of our presence in HIV, our presence in hepatitis B, and our presence now in hepatitis C. And it is clear that we
continue to look at opportunities also of investing in that area. And again, I don't want to repeat again, but I will, that

we have the criteria that Charlie mentioned before that we keep in mind, and they apply also to virology. Virology
remains an area of focus for us.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Vamil. All our large studies have data monitoring committees in them, who would
obviously look at the safety of the product, and of course, in the case of 066, they were looking at that, and it turned out
to be stopped because Opdivo was actually superior. What I would say – and I think it's a very important point – is
even though this in ClinTrials.gov says it's an open study, we are keeping blind to this, so we do not see what is going
on in the study, and I think that's an important point. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thank you very much for the questions. The first one is, as we think up to the
Opdivo launch next year in melanoma and lung, can you just help us think a little bit and frame this comparing and
contrasting how you see this launch and its dynamics relative to what we saw with Yervoy in melanoma back in 2001?
I'm just trying to understand how you're seeing those two launches comparing to one another.
The second question was maybe just if you can elaborate on some of your earlier comments regarding increased usage
of Yervoy with community oncologists. Can you just update us a little bit in terms of the mix of usage you're seeing
here in terms of community versus the centers, maybe also a breakdown of front-line and second-line?
And then, finally, just a third quick one, 2015 expenses, is there any factors we should keep in mind as we're thinking
about our model here? I guess, specifically, should we think about a lot more in the way of SG&A as you prepare for
the Opdivo rollout? I'm trying to get my hands around how you're thinking about the spend going forward. Thanks very
much.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, this is Giovanni. Let me must just start on Yervoy and Opdivo launches. So maybe I'll
start from your second question regarding the performance of Yervoy. The community business, in the U.S.
specifically, now represents approximately 60% of our sales. It is continuing to grow significantly, and it actually
accounts for a meaningful part of the growth we've experienced in the quarter. As Lamberto and Charlie mentioned in
the introductory remarks, we had a very strong quarter in the U.S., the strongest quarter since launch, with very good
growth versus last year but also versus Q1.
With respect to the use of Yervoy today, I would say that we have approximately a 40% share of the market when you
look at the totality of the market. Our share is significantly higher in the BRAF wild-type segment of the market, with
virtually all of our uses in first-line. And obviously our share is lower in the BRAF-mutant segment of the market,
where we see more Yervoy being used in second-line.
Thinking about the launch of Opdivo next year in lung and melanoma, I think there are a number of parallels to the
launch of Yervoy, because we have developed a really good understanding of how to effectively educate physicians in
the community setting and in the academic institutions about the use of immuno-oncology agents. We've been very
successful in doing that with Yervoy, and clearly have developed the ability to do that when we launch Opdivo as well.
There obviously will be some differences, because the prescribing population for lung, for example, is broader. It's a
larger number of physicians. They tend to be based more in the community versus melanoma, and they have not had as
much experience with immuno-oncology agents.
So we obviously will do the same thing we did in 2011 when we launched Yervoy. We will begin to educate physicians
on the value of immunotherapy options, the long-term survival opportunity, and we will follow the same model. Within
melanoma, obviously, prescribing physicians are very knowledgeable. They are prescribers of Yervoy, believers in
Yervoy. We have a good organization in place that can begin to promote Opdivo when that is approved. I would just
mention that obviously we are making all of the right investment, we've increased the size of our teams, and we are

preparing actively for launch for Opdivo.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Just quickly on 2015 expenses, as you know, we don't give out forward guidance. I would
say, though, that we are committed to making all the right investments as we think about our business moving forward,
particularly as you think about I-O and hepatitis C, both on the R&D side and, as Giovanni just mentioned, on the
commercial side. We also always are looking at where can we find savings across our P&L that really aren't directly
focused on the areas that we think are going to drive long-term growth.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
We'll go next to Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So the first one is just around 2015 earnings, and you'll
see that consensus is looking for EPS around $1.71 next year; this is at $1.78 this year in consensus. Now, given the
repeated comments you've been making regarding SG&A and what you've already cut from behind Abilify, do you
think consensus has fully appreciated these, given the sell-side models that you see? And then, secondly, I just wanted
to also ask – because I haven't really heard you specifically talk about it – we think Roche might be moving forward
quite rapidly in the triple-negative breast cancer segment with immuno-oncology with their PD-L1. Is this an indication
that you've looked at and you think could be interesting for ipilimumab? Thank you.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: 2015, it's a bit too early to speak about it, and we will issue guidance as usual at the right
time. So, apologies, but we'll not address your question on 2015.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: And I think in terms of our ongoing studies, Jeff, we have a lot of studies early on,
triple-negative breast, but also in gastric, hepatocellular, pancreatic, so on and so forth. So we acknowledge there's a lot
of medical need and a great opportunity to go broad here. So we're looking at all of these, and obviously we'll move
stuff forward, as we already have in the last few months, if we feel there's a real opportunity there. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: I think, Aaron, we have time for two more questions.
Operator
We'll go next to Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Same kind of question a little differently. When you think about R&D and investing in R&D
over the next couple of years, obviously we're going to have the sales line starting to ramp up with I-O and hep C, so
are you going to take advantage of that opportunity and increase R&D more, or do you kind of feel like that
mid-single-digit growth for the next couple years is probably appropriate? Second question is can you help us on the
tax rate and how we should think about third quarter versus fourth quarter, and the dramatic difference to get to your
18% guidance?
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: I don't know if Francis asked you to ask this question about his R&D budget for the next
few years, but for sure, we will continue to invest in all opportunities we find worth investing in. We have done it over
the last few years and we continue to do it. So our idea is not to decide on R&D expenses based on the percentage of
sales that we can afford, but on the value of our programs. Do you want to speak about tax?
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Yeah, I'll just briefly, Marc, regarding the tax rate. Our tax rate is primarily a function of
earnings mix, but I would say, for 2014, a big component is the R&D tax credit, which hasn't been extended yet by
Congress, so that's why you'll see some fluctuation. So, through the first two quarters, it doesn't reflect the benefit of
the R&D tax credit; it will only reflect that once that legislation is passed.
<A - John E. Elicker>: And our last question, Aaron, please.

We'll take our final question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, just a couple of quick follow-ups. Have you
picked a dose for the Yervoy/nivo combo in the Phase II non-small cell lung cancer? You mentioned that you're
following CheckMate 012, but I'm just wondering if you're closer to finding the right dose there. And could you
comment – or elaborate a little bit more on the hep C opportunity in Japan with some more specifics? It looks like
you'll have the market to yourself for about a year. If I recall, it's a more advanced cohort of patients with a greater
unmet need, so if you could give us more color on how we should think about that opportunity in the near term, it'd be
great. Thank you.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Alex, thank you very much. Basically, as I said, the CheckMate 012 is very informative. We
are designing the study, we're on track, and I think you'll get to read about the study design and the dose in
ClinTrials.gov when it's actually published. Thank you.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: And with respect – this is Giovanni – with respect to the hep C opportunity in Japan, yes, we
are very focused on it. It is a meaningful opportunity. We are first in the market. The unmet medical need is very high,
approximately 1.2 million patients in Japan, 70% of them with genotype 1b, a population that is disproportionately
elderly and intolerant to interferon in Japan. We are launching the dual starting from a very strong position because of
our leadership position in hepatitis in Japan and the very high market share we have with Baraclude. That's one of the
largest markets around the world for us for that brand. And we've made the right investments in order to have the right
organization in place to launch.
We believe that our dual is particularly well-suited to address the unmet medical need of patients in Japan. As I said,
we are negotiating pricing. Obviously, we will be targeting at the beginning those patients that have already been
diagnosed that are already actively seeking treatment. There is approximately 150,000 patients that are currently seeing
physicians and are seeking a treatment option. There is a second segment of the population of approximately the same
size which is also diagnosed but not actively being seen by physicians. That's an opportunity for us as well. And
obviously, in the medium-term, the full population represents a significant opportunity for us as well, but we will be
really thinking about the different stages of the launch in very rapid sequence there.
Lamberto Andreotti
Thank you, Giovanni. Well, again, we had a good second quarter, good in terms of financial performance as well as
clinical results and regulatory milestones. We thank you for participating to this call and wish you a good day. Thank
you.
John E. Elicker
Thanks, Lamberto, Giovanni, for answers, and Charlie, and everybody for joining the call. As always, if you have any
follow-up questions, please give me a call or Ranya [Dajani] or Ryan [Asay]. Have a good day.
