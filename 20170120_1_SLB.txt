Simon Ayat
Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings
per share excluding charges and credits was $0.27. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of
$0.38 when compared to the same quarter of last year.
During the quarter, we recorded $536 million of restructuring charges, $76 million of Cameron-related merger and
integration charges and the $63 million charge relating to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. The restructuring
charges largely relate to workforce reduction and facility closure plus as we continue to rationalize our support
structure and reduce our facility footprint.
All of these charges are described in our earnings press release. Our fourth quarter revenue of $7.1 billion increased 1%
sequentially, primarily driven by the Production Group. Pre-tax operating margins only declined by 21 basis points
sequentially to 11.4%. This was largely due to the revenue mix. Margins also benefited from the continued cost
management actions across the entire organization.
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.7
billion was essentially flat sequentially as increases in Testing & Process and SIS were offset by declines in Wireline
and WesternGeco. Pre-tax operating margins decreased 49 basis points to 18.6% as increased contribution from
software sales were more than offset by the decrease in high-margin Wireline activity.
Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion was also flat sequentially, although margin increased 81 basis points to 11.6%.
The margin improvement was primarily driven by the revenue mix and the strong cost control. Production Group
revenue of $2.2 billion increased 5%, while margin increased 134 basis points to 6%. These increases were driven by
stronger well services activity both in the Middle East and in U.S. land. Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion was
essentially flat as increases in OneSubsea and Surface were offset by lower and Valves & Measurement activity.
Margins decreased 207 basis points due to the drop in drilling projects. Cameron was accretive to both Schlumberger
pre-tax operating margin as well as earnings per share in 2016.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 15.8% in the fourth
quarter, essentially the same as Q3. Looking forward, the ETR will be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings
between North America and the rest of the world. We anticipate that the ETR will gradually increase over the course of
2017, as a result of the expected improvement in activity in North America.
Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During all of 2016, we generated $6.3 billion of cash flow from
operations. During the fourth quarter, we generated $2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite paying
severance payment of approximately $150 million during the fourth quarter and making $950 million of severance and
transaction related payments associated with the acquisition of Cameron during 2016.
Although receivable collection improved in Q4, we continue to experience payment delays from some of our
customers. Our net debt improved by $46 million on a sequential basis to $10.1 billion. During 2016, we returned $3.4
billion of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We have also increased our dividend in
seven of the last 10 years. As you know, every January, we review the dividends with our board. Given the current
situation and our level of the payout ratio, we have decided to maintain our dividend at $0.50 per quarter. This will
provide us with the flexibility to continue to invest in the business and take advantage of several opportunities as they
present themselves. We will continue to return excess cash that we generate through our buyback program.
During the fourth quarter, we spent $116 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $78.21. For the
full year of 2016, we spent $778 million to repurchase 11 million shares at an average price of $70.8 per share. As a
reminder, last year our board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program, which will take effect once our
current program is exhausted this year.

Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $654 million on CapEx and invested approximately $160
million in SPM projects, $130 million in multiclient projects. Full year 2017 CapEx excluding multiclient and SPM
investments is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion.
And now, I turn the conference over to Scott.
R. Scott Rowe
Thank you, Simon. The Cameron Group had another good quarter under Schlumberger. And I'm pleased to report that
we continue to exceed expectations with the integration. I will give you a brief update on the fourth quarter and the full
year, as well as provide some comments as to how we are thinking about 2017.
We delivered $1.3 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter, which was flat sequentially despite the reduced backlog.
EBIT margins were a healthy 14%, but lower than Q3 by 200 basis points, which is consistent with our prior thinking
and communication on the last earnings call. The lower margin is driven by reduced volumes in our higher-margin
drilling business, coupled with reduced pricing throughout the downturn that is now fully flowing through the system.
OneSubsea however, continued to have outstanding margins, which exceeded 20% for the second straight quarter. Our
persistent focus on cost control and the acceleration of the integration program has allowed us to deliver high relative
margins throughout 2016.
While the Cameron Group backlog declined again in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill ratio remained flat sequentially
at 0.8. Additionally, we had several major awards in the quarter that demonstrate market-leading positions and our
ability to capitalize on the limited opportunity set in the marketplace.
In our drilling business, we received two different long-term service contracts totaling more than $350 million from
Transocean. Schlumberger will be providing comprehensive services to ensure maximum uptime and reliability of the
Cameron pressure control systems on their rigs. The structure of these contracts best align the incentives of service
provider, drilling contractor and operator.
Additionally, we will be employing the latest technology on sensors, diagnostics and condition-based monitoring to
drive further reliability and uptime in deepwater drilling. This type of collaboration will systematically help to drive
down the cost of deepwater developments and potentially unlock future projects. While secured in the fourth quarter,
this award was not booked in the fourth quarter and will be booked over the life of the 10-year contract. The reduction
in the drilling backlog of $258 million was primarily driven by the removal of five of seven [indiscernible] (10:31)
Brazil blowout preventer orders in the amount of $128 million, which we believe are unlikely to progress given the
current issues in Brazil.
OneSubsea received two significant awards in the quarter as well. One award was for the industry's first deepwater
integrated subsea engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning of a multiphase boosting
system for the Dalmatian field in the Gulf of Mexico from Murphy Oil Company. Working with Subsea 7, we will
deploy, install and commission a 35 kilometer tieback multiphase boosting system to augment natural production for
the Dalmatian field.
OneSubsea also booked our first Subsea trees for Statoil. While they've had a long relationship with Statoil, we had
previously not participated in their Subsea production systems project. The award of the two well Utgard project was a
result of a multiyear effort to prove our technology and execution capability to Statoil. We are very happy to be
working with Statoil on this project and we expect to continue working with Statoil to drive cost reduction and improve
productivity on their future projects.
Our V&M and Surface business responded to the increased activity in North America last quarter and we predict that
these two businesses will outperform in the second half of 2017 given their strong market positions coupled with their
broad international reach. The integration of Cameron into Schlumberger has been an enormous task. Most of the
heavy lifting of the integration is now complete. We achieved our year one target of $300 million of synergies in the
first 10 months of the acquisition and we fully expect to exceed the $600 million target for the second year. The

transaction was again accretive in the fourth quarter, as well as accretive to the full year results for Schlumberger.
We booked $180 million of synergy-related business in the fourth quarter, with the majority of it coming from the
Middle East. We will continue to have an integration team in 2017 and our focus will shift from cost synergies to
growth synergies. Several technologies will be commercialized in 2017 that will drive incremental revenue and
margins. Finally, we continue to find opportunities around the world when we leverage the expansive footprint of
Schlumberger.
The first quarter will be a low for the Cameron Group in both revenue and margins due to the reduced backlogs in the
normal cyclical nature of our business. However, I expect the Cameron Group to grow continually from the second
quarter onwards as we leverage our North American position and capitalize on the growth from our expanded
international presence under Schlumberger.
In summary, 2016 was a challenging year for the Cameron Group as we worked through the downturn and integrated
into Schlumberger. However, I could not be more pleased with the approach by Schlumberger throughout this
integration and with the performance of the Cameron people and organization. Despite the challenges, we delivered
strong results throughout the year and we're positioned better than any of our peers to fully capitalize on the growing
opportunity set in 2017.
I'll now turn it over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 1% sequentially to
reach $7.1 billion as growth in North America land and robust activity in the Middle East largely offset continued
weakness in Latin America and seasonal declines in other parts of the world.
Our overall activity and financial performance led to a second successive quarter with a small but positive increase in
earnings per share. In parallel with this operational stabilization, we have completed the restructuring of the company,
which in the fourth quarter included a further reduction of our global support structure to reflect current activity, peak
capacity and customer pricing levels.
These latest actions followed a well-established playbook we have used to navigate the unprecedented industry
challenges faced over the past two years. In this, our focus has been on proactively streamlining our cost and support
structure and continuing to drive the underlying efficiency and quality of all our business workflows.
In parallel, we have also significantly expanded our offering through consistent investments in R&E and a strategic
M&A program. And through these actions, we have further strengthened our market position compared to when we
entered the downturn two years ago.
Next, I will review the fourth quarter business trends from our global operations, and I will focus my comments on the
results and activities for the Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups as Scott has already covered the
performance of the Cameron Group.
In North America, overall revenue increased 4% sequentially, driven by an improving land business in the U.S. and
Western Canada as drilling and completions activity increased and service pricing started to recover. In terms of
technology, we saw the strongest growth on land and pressure pumping followed by directional drilling, drill bit and
drilling fluids as well as our ESP, TCP and rod lift product line.
Offshore, revenue declined again sequentially as the rig count dropped further and pricing remained under pressure, in
spite of the significant technical and operational challenges in this market. The resulting business environment is
potentially becoming unsustainable for us, and will either lead to a recovering service pricing or a narrowing of our
service offering with redeployment of resources to markets that offer more adequate returns.

Internationally, revenue was up 1% sequentially, as strong activity in the Middle East was partially able to offset the
combination of continued weakness in Latin America and seasonal slowdowns in other parts of the world. In Latin
America, revenue declined 4% sequentially driven by Mexico, where further budget constraints impacted activity and
by Argentina, where unfavorable weather conditions and continued union actions led to significant activity disruption.
On the positive side, our integrated project activity in Ecuador remained strong. And we saw, as expected, stronger
conventional land drilling activity in Colombia as WTI oil prices climbed above $50. Revenue in Europe, CIS and
Africa decreased 2% sequentially, due to the seasonal slowdown in activity in Norway and Sakhalin, while activity in
the rest of Russia and Europe as well as in North Africa was essentially flat.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, revenue was marginally down due to anticipated project completions. But we are now seeing a
floor in activity and expect the recovery process to start in the coming quarters.
In the Middle East and Asia, revenue increased 5% sequentially, driven by strong drilling and completions activity on
land in the Gulf region. At the same time, activity in Asia weakened further in the fourth quarter, but now appears to
have bottomed out. And we, therefore, expect a slow recovery to start also here in the coming quarters.
As we now move into the recovery part of the cycle, I would like to turn to the developing macro environment and
what this means for our business. First of all, we maintain our constructive view of the oil market, as supply and
demand continued to tighten in the fourth quarter as demonstrated by the OECD oil stocks, which declined for the
fourth month in a row in November. This tightening is partly driven by strong demand where the reporting agencies
revised their global demand growth figures upwards in the fourth quarter now stand at around 1.5 million barrels per
day in 2016 and between 1.3 million and 1.6 million barrels per day in 2017.
On the supply side, non-OPEC production remains under pressure, deemed by the large year-over-year drop in North
American production, which as of December had fallen by more than 600,000 barrels per day versus 2015. Over the
same period, new production from the completion of long-term large projects in Brazil, Kazakhstan and Russia was
offset by falling production from Mexico, China and Colombia to result in a year-over-year reduction of 900,000
barrels per day for non-OPEC production.
In terms of OPEC supply, production surged to record levels in the fourth quarter to meet the increase in demand and to
offset the falling non-OPEC production. This lowered spare capacity down to 2 million barrels per day in November,
which at barely 2% of global production represents a 12-year low.
The OPEC agreement to reduce production by a significant volume of 1.6 million to 1.8 million barrels per day has
now established a floor to the oil prices and should accelerate the tightening of the oil market going forward. These
supply reductions will take a few months to work their way through the distribution system, but we expect to see an
acceleration of global stock gross towards the end of the first quarter. Meanwhile over the next several months, oil
prices are expected to fluctuate around current levels until a steady reduction in crude inventories is fully established.
As the upcycle begins, growth in E&P investments will be led by the North America land operators who appear to
remain unconstrained by years of negative free cash flow as external funding seems more readily available and the
pursuit of shorter term equity value takes precedence over full cycle return.
E&P spending surveys currently indicate that 2017 North America E&P investments will increase by around 30% led
by the Permian basin, which should lead to both higher activity and a long overdue recovery in service industry pricing.
In the international markets, the recovery will start up slower, driven by the constraints of the international E&P
industry where the various operating groups determine their investment levels based on full cycle returns and their
available free cash flow. At current oil price levels, this will result in a third successive year of lower CapEx spend,
which will further weaken the state of the international production base.
Over the past two years, there has been very few FID approvals of new sizable oil development. And outside of the
Gulf countries, most of the international production is today depleting producible reserves with little or no reserves
replacement. It is equivalent to borrowing barrels from the future. As a result, the activity in CapEx required going
forward to replenish reserves in order to uphold production for the medium to long-term will be much higher than the

current decline rates may suggest.
This concerning plan cannot be reversed or mitigated by North America unconventional resources alone, which
currently represents only around 5% of global crude production. The future supply challenges of the industry can only
be addressed by a broad increase in global investment. Therefore, as international E&P cash flow improves in the
coming quarters, we expect to see E&P investments accelerate in all main producing regions leading into 2018.
So, what does this macro tapping mean for Schlumberger? First, we are very excited about our global opportunities
there. Following nine consecutive quarters of relentless workforce reduction, cost cutting and restructuring efforts, we
are looking forward to restoring focus on the pursuit of growth and improved returns for our shareholders. And as
outlined earlier, we will launch our pursuit from a competitive platform that is even stronger than what it was two years
ago.
In North America, our strategy during this downturn has been to preserve our infrastructure footprint on land while
reducing and stacking operating capacity to minimize financial losses during the trough of the cycle at the expense of
market share. This has served us well in the past year.
In parallel with this, we have continued to invest in the underlying efficiency of our operations as well as the new
technologies and further vertical integration. As the market now starts to recover, we will aggressively redeploy our
idle capacity in any product line and any basin that shows a clear path towards profitability. This, together with the
strong market position of the Cameron product lines, will allow us to further extend the North America leadership
position we've held in recent years in terms of both margins and pre-tax operating income.
Next, our international business is currently like a highly compressed coiled spring. Activity levels in key market
segments such as expiration and deepwater are at record lows; and although we do not expect a dramatic short-term
recovery, the trends can only be positive from this point on.
In terms of geography, it is worthwhile to note that the earnings contributions from key international markets like
Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, Sub-Saharan Africa, China and Russia land have collectively dropped by more than 70%
from Q4 of 2014 to Q4 of 2016, which by itself represents a huge upside as the international recovery starts to unfold.
In terms of our international operating capacity, the only way we have been able to protect cash flow and profitability
in the international market has been to stack equipment and delay major maintenance and repairs until the equipment is
again needed. This means that we do not currently have any significant spare capacity available.
Furthermore, given the major pricing concessions we have been forced to give, we have also had to reduce the
technical support levels that we normally provide beyond our contractual obligations and export our operating assets
and technical support towards customers who allow us to make a reasonable return.
Going forward, however, we can reactivate our equipment capacity and expand our support structure relatively quickly,
but we will only do so where it makes financial sense. In addition, we are now requesting increases on contracts where
the efforts we have made have helped bridge the trough of the cycle for our customers but where the contract hold no
promise of delivering the returns we would expect in the current improving business environment.
Over the past two years, we have also expanded our addressable market by more than 50% through a series of
acquisitions combined with internal R&E investment. Our offering now includes pressure control, drilling equipment,
land rigs, subsea infrastructure and surface processing facility. In addition, we have closed a number of new [ph]
FTMDs (25:24) and we continue to see a broadening of this opportunity set given our integration capabilities, balance
sheet strength and cash flow position. All of these new markets carry significant growth potential with unique
technology, business models and integration opportunities that will facilitate both market share gains and improving
returns for Schlumberger in the coming years.
Furthermore, we are consistently able to convert our international market leadership into superior earnings generation
as seen by our share of the top four service companies operating income, which increased from 60% in 2014 to over
80% in the three first quarters of 2016.

Another way to look at this is that for every dollar we actually spent in the international market, we generate around
four times the operating income of our closest competitor. This is due to our presence, offering, scale and executional
capabilities, which together with our leverage towards the international market demonstrates the upside we have in
terms of earnings per share going forward.
While earnings growth is a very important part of our financial performance, full cycle cash generation is even more
critical and here we continue to stand out in the wider industry. Over the past two years of this downturn, we have
generated $7.5 billion in free cash flow, which is more than the rest of our competitors combined. Furthermore, we
have returned this entire amount to our shareholders through dividends and share buyback.
Finally, the breadth of our technology and integration offering, together with our unmatched size and global footprint,
gives us an operating platform that enables us to support our customers in every corner of the room and through this
capture more growth opportunities than any of our competitors. With this focus and ambition in mind, our management
team and wider organization entered a new phase of the cycle with renewed energy and the spring in our step fully
restored.
Thank you.

Greg, we'll now open up for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go
ahead.
<Q - James West>: Hey. Good morning, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Morning, James.
<Q - James West>: I thought you made some pretty compelling comments around the international side of your
business, the coiled spring and also the reductions that you've seen in some major oil markets, which I was actually
surprised at how big the reductions were. It seems to me now though that you have better visibility at least on the
international recovery and while some markets may not be up year-over-year, they'll be up 4Q to 4Q 2017. Could you
perhaps touch on the visibility? When you expect certain markets to improve? And if you have any views on the kind
of the slope of the improvement that'd be helpful as well.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, I mean, I can give some general comments. Obviously, visibility for the full year of
2017 is still not all the way where we would like it to be, but what is clear is that the recovery is on its way in all
markets. All markets have now reached the bottom, including Sub-Sahara Africa and Asia. So, I would say excluding
the seasonal slowdown in Q1, it should be up from here in basically all markets, but the pace and the timing is still
somewhat uncertain.
Now I think the key here is that we look at 2017 as the starting point of a new multiyear cycle, where the main
challenge is actually going to be to reverse the effect of several years of global E&P underinvestment and then try to
mitigate the pending supply shortage that we see unfolding. So, the only way to achieve this is through a broad-based
increase in global E&P investments as North America on conventional production is not going to be able to address this
pending supply issue by itself.
So, in terms of how each of the markets are going to develop, the main thing we're doing now is, we are preparing for a
global recovery. And we are really aiming at, at being ready to support our customers in every market around the world

as these start to recover and at varying points in time and then at varying pace. So, it'll be hard to say exactly what's
going to happen in each one of them, but we are preparing and we are aiming to be ready as they kick in each one of
them.
I think the main thing I would commit though is that we are basically aiming to drive earnings growth faster than our
competitors in every market that we're in. E&P spend and revenue is very important, but what ultimately matters in the
next phase is the ability to generate earnings and here we are very confident that we should be able to outperform our
surroundings in every market that we participate in, including North America.
<Q - James West>: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe a follow-up for Simon. The level of share repurchases has
been lower than I would have expected here given the improving visibility, improving oil prices. Could you maybe
comment on what level we should expect in the future, if you'll be ramping that up, or if there's other investments that
are more attractive like SPM or perhaps an M&A pipeline?
<A - Simon Ayat>: So, James, you're right. We did take a bit of a break on the buyback during the last few months.
However, if you look at our payout ratio including dividend, we are at a very high level. And we look at the situation
by looking at our free cash flow generation and the opportunities ahead of us. I know that everyone thinks that we have
some excess cash, and we do, as compared to historically, but we have a lot of opportunities that we see coming our
way in terms of projects, businesses and some strategic transactions. So, 2017, in our opinion, is going to provide a lot
of these opportunities and we want to be ready to participate into them.
As far as buyback, we will always use the excess to do buyback. And yes, when the opportunity presents itself, we will
accelerate it. But you can count on us continue to return to our shareholders a very significant part of the free cash flow
and the operating cash flow. But we will, when the opportunity presents itself, accelerate the buyback.

Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: So, Paal, maybe you could start off with SPM, and you highlighted it in your comments and
maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the opportunities you see in the market as far as the type of
opportunities and regions of the world that you're seeing some opportunities. And just your long-term thoughts about
the importance of SPM to Schlumberger.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think this is an opportunity set that is continuing to expand. And we've been in this
market or been operating around these type of business models now for over a decade. We started off very slowly, and
we have accelerated in recent years as our capabilities have grown and as the opportunity set has also widened.
Today, we are basically engaged in discussions and negotiations all around the world. We have around 20 countries
that we are discussing SPM opportunities. There is a range of the type of opportunities in terms of both size and
resources, but I would say the general focus we have on SPM is the mature field oil on land. That's the main focus area.
And if you look at the size of SPM today, it is a size of an average product line within the company. And what we have
said, I will repeat is, that I think over a reasonable amount of time, I would say three to five years, the growth potential
is significant for SPM. And I think it has the potential to grow from being a product line to becoming a size of the
group. So, a significant growth opportunity, but it is going to be something that will complement the rest of the
company. Our base business, in terms of the individual product lines for individual services and products, is still going

to be the lion's share of what we provide to our customers.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. Great. Great. Thanks. Very helpful. And then, you made some comments on U.S.
pricing, so maybe talk a little bit about what you're thinking on the outlook for pricing for frac in the U.S.? And is there
any other pricing opportunities in the U.S. particularly directional drilling?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. I would say where we probably have had the most pricing traction is on directional
drilling, actually. So, as I mentioned on the Q3 call, we were already sold out on PowerDrive Orbit, our rotary steerable
system that we are deploying in U.S. land. And the trend of increasing lateral length is just further accelerating the
uptake of this technology. So, we were sold out at the end of Q3. We've added fairly significant capacity in Q4, and
we're still sold out. So, the system market segment that we actually see the biggest price increase. And following on
from that we're also seeing very good growth in both our drill bits business and the drilling fluids business. So that part
we are already performing quite well in. So, I'm pleased with that.
On the fracking side, yes, pricing is moving now. We need significantly more pricing before we are getting into, I
would say, a sustainable operating environment, but that trend has been kicked off. We are actively high grading our
contracts portfolio. And we have active pricing discussions, I would say, with all customers at this stage. So that
process has started and will continue in the coming quarters.

Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for the color on 2017. But, I wonder whether it will be possible to help
me a little bit on the bridge from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. There are some tricky seasonalities in Russia
North Sea. And you also have positive seasonality in Canada and the pricing momentum in North America land. So,
how should we think about the move from the fourth quarter to the first quarter? Also are they taking into account the
multiclient seismic seasonality and product sales?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. It's a fair question, Ole. I think you hit on the main points that I would highlight as well.
I mean, the Q1 visibility is actually still somewhat limited. There are lot of moving parts, including the main impact of
the normal seasonal drop in activity, right. Now with that you also have some positives, which is not the growth in
North America.
So, I'm not going to give you a specific number, but I would say that there is going to be the normal seasonal drop, but
there are more offsetting factors as well, which is strong North America performance as well as probably less of a Q1
impact when it comes to the year-end sales that we've seen in previous years. And so, not ready to give you a number,
but we are generally optimistic about the outlook for the coming year.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. So, consensus isn't entirely unreasonable?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: As I said, I'm not going to give you a specific number.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay. Scott, I wonder if you could fill us in a little bit more on what you talked about and
congrats with the first contract with Statoil. Just coming back from Europe, having met with the last of the larger oil
companies over there, it sort of struck me to what extent the cost structure seem to be changing around at the moment.
So, can you give us a little bit of overview on what you think the cost structures, let's say, in the Barents Sea, we heard
$40? And the well costs have dropped meaningfully as a result of head count reduction on the rigs because of
automation and the remote drilling decision. So, how should we think about the cost structures? And what are you
hearing from your customers now? We also get a sense, by the way, that the cost structures have come down at least
from a cyclical standpoint to a point where there's little room to squeeze more pricing out?
<A - R. Scott Rowe>: Yeah. No, I think everybody knows that there is massive cost inflation in deepwater projects all
through, let's say, from 2009 through 2013. And the industry became incredibly challenged in 2013 and 2014. So, even

before oil prices collapsed, there is a massive cost issue. And I think operators across the world in both small and large,
really started to attack this problem in late 2013. And what I've seen in our discussions with our customers is that
there's been substantial movement here.
So, obviously, it starts with the drilling rigs and the drilling contractors. I think everybody knows that the status there
and the oversupply, which has driven costs down substantially. But then on the infrastructure, as the production
systems and the installation of those, the serve side, we've been able to, through cost reductions standardization and
simplification, we've been able to get our pricing now back down to levels that we saw back in 2003 and 2004.
And so, I really feel comfortable that the price of developing deepwater projects is down substantially. And I think
every basin and every reservoir is slightly different. So I'm not going to go into break-even prices, but what we're
seeing on a regular basis is the ability to unlock developments that weren't there before.
Now in that context, what I'll say is, mega-projects of 60-plus wells that we saw before and billions and billions of
dollars of capital on those projects, I'm not super optimistic that we're going to have lots of those as we look forward.
But what I do feel is that by coming down into a more meaningful size, call it between 10 and 20 wells, I think
operators are going to be able to do just fine there.
And then the other market that we didn't mention was the tieback market, and so we're seeing lots of activity on the
brownfield side where we're adding two wells and potentially a boosting system to that, and really driving more
production out of that existing field. So I'm most optimistic about the brownfield side, but what I would say is we're
seeing – we're tracking a nice list of projects in that kind of 10 to 20-well development and we'll see probably two – at
least two times the growth that we had in 2016.

trend that you've seen over the last few quarters will probably on the top line continue into Q1. And like I said, in my

prepared comments that we do think that is the level, and our shorter cycle businesses of Valves & Measurement and
Surface really start to capitalize on the increased activity in North America, but also internationally. And we feel very
good about driving growth, both top line and bottom line from that point forward.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Got it. And then I want to come back to the international line of questioning that James began
with. Paal, I realize that the 2017 visibility is not perfect, but at a $55 Brent price and some momentum building over
the course of the year, is it unreasonable to assume that we could see double-digit year-on-year growth for the legacy
Schlumberger product lines on the international front?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I again would go back to what I said earlier. I think it's too early to commit to numbers. I
think the current prices, and building on what Scott was saying in terms of several projects having seen I would say
significant cost reductions now, I think there is a basis for investing in the international market. And I think it's going to
be highly necessary in order to address the pending supply issues.
The main reason for the slower startup of international is just purely that investments are governed by free cash flow.
So I would say that as soon as free cash flow starts to improve for the international operators, we lose the higher
investment. Exactly how fast that's going to happen, I think that's the thing that's a bit difficult for us to predict, but the
fact that there are good investment opportunities and that there is a need to invest I think is both there. It's just a matter
of how quickly cash flow generation is going to allow this to happen.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Got it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Good morning. Hey Scott, can you talk about the margin roadmap for 2017 for Cameron?
You referenced that top line would bottom in Q1, but what is a reasonable expectation for a margin trough for
Cameron?
<A - R. Scott Rowe>: Yes. And again, we are not providing specific guidance on any of the groups there on where it
goes. But I'll give some color in terms of...
<Q - William A. Herbert>: When?
<A - R. Scott Rowe>: ...what are the dynamics there and impacting it. So obviously we've been able to expand margins
in the higher backlog businesses, right. So that was drilling and we saw a lot of those high margins come through in the
first half of 2016. But now as that backlog has fallen off, we're still able to keep nice margins, because we have the
service business, right. So we're getting parts in there and services, which has historically been a higher margin. And so
as the drilling business shifts from projects to more services, we should be able to preserve nice margins.
OneSubsea, throughout the cycle we've been able to expand our margins, and mostly that's the pricing from 2012 and
2013 that's coming through the system while we are driving cost down. And so OneSubsea margins will start to
decline, just because the pricing now is not what it was over the last three years. But we also believe that we can
enhance bookings and do some things more creatively with the cost structure that keep relatively high margins in the
OneSubsea business. And then for Valves & Measurements and Surface, we should after Q1 start to see nice growth,
both on the top line and at the margins.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Right. So I wasn't actually asking for a level of margin, but basically wondering over the
course of the year when should we expect to see sequentially improving margins for Cameron?
<A - R. Scott Rowe>: You'll see improvements from Q1 to Q2.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: In margins?
<A - R. Scott Rowe>: Yes.

<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then Simon, a quick question with regard to the ETR.
You're guiding for sort of a bleeding higher of tax rates over the course of 2017. Does that encompass the prospect of
the bending lower of the U.S. corporate tax rate?
<A - Simon Ayat>: Well, to be honest we are not clear what will happen in the future for the corporate tax rate in
North America. We hear what you hear, that there will be a business-friendly tax rate and we are looking forward to it.
But no, it does not include that kind of details. But our comment more relates to the mix of revenue. North America, as
you know it's higher tax rate than international. So once the business shifts to slightly better in North America, we will
experience higher tax rate. And that's the comment that we made.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Edward Muztafago from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward Charles Muztafago>: Hey, guys. Thanks. A question for Scott. Just wondering maybe if we could delve
a little bit more into the Q4 margin in Cam. And specifically, the downtick was pretty material. Historically, we have
seen where large project shipments in Q4 can kind of cause some mix effect. So maybe I will just ask directly, if there
were any mix effects in the quarter, I would've expected maybe that given where margins are at with Subsea, and the
fact that North America is improving, that maybe that would've been a little stronger in Q4?
<A - R. Scott Rowe>: Yes. I would say mix was a big driver, and you see that with the drilling backlog. So drilling has
always been one of our highest margin segments. And as that backlog comes down, it definitely has a major impact.
And the backlog has deteriorated pretty substantially there in the back half of 2016. So that was the biggest movement.
I will also say in Q3, OneSubsea had its highest margins ever, which we knew were not necessarily sustainable from
that very lofty peak, and so that's now come down. Still in the very high levels, but it did come off the peak. And then
on the Surface and the V&M businesses where we've been able to maintain the margins throughout 2016, and now as
we start to grow, we need to leverage the revenue growth. But at the same time in the growing environments, we're
starting to add people and resources and we're very focused on the profitability as we go forward.
<Q - Edward Charles Muztafago>: Okay. That's helpful. So we had some atypically high margins in 3Q that came
down, plus the mix and a little bit of perhaps lag in the margin improvement in some of the shorter cycle businesses.
<A - R. Scott Rowe>: I think that's a good summary.
<Q - Edward Charles Muztafago>: Okay. Great. Great. And then, Paal, I really like the spring comment in the
international markets, so perhaps we could focus on maybe just one spring in the watch and that's Latin America. You
have a couple of markets there, Ecuador, Argentina, Colombia really operating at very depressed levels. And
historically, if we looked back at least at the peak anyway, I won't say historically, Latin America was probably 30% of
global land rig count. Can you talk about the evolution perhaps of the Latin American land rig market, or the land
markets over the next say 12 months to 24 months?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I'd just generally say that if you look at current activity levels, it will come up from
where we are today. I think the best example to illustrate this is probably Colombia, where we've always maintained
[ph] at a WTI breaks (50:51) $50 in a positive direction, that should yield a significant increase in land rigs – or in
overall rig activities. So actually in the fourth quarter when this oil price event occurred, we almost immediately saw a
significant uptick in rig activity in Colombia and we've seen actually a dramatic surge in activity in the country over the
past three months. So I think if this is an early indication then you would see similar things happening potentially in
Mexico and in Argentina as well.

Ecuador for us has been strong throughout the downturn driven by the activity on our integrated projects. And
Venezuela in terms of activity, obviously there is very significant potential activity there. The reactivation of the
business there is clearly going to come down to the ability of getting paid. So I would say that we are at the trough.
There is an early indication of what potentially will occur coming from Colombia and then some of the other land
markets I think will follow suit as soon as there's more cash flow available.
<Q - Edward Charles Muztafago>: So could you see Latin America being or a scenario where Latin America is
perhaps the surprise market for 2017 or is that perhaps a little bit longer term in your mind?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Actually, I think all parts of the international market has the potential to surprise. I think it is
indeed a highly compressed coiled spring, where it's going to break out first, I think is still kind of up for discussion,
right. We have a very, very solid baseline business coming out of Russia, as well as the DCC part of the Middle East.
But I think all other businesses are extremely depressed in terms of activity levels and we expect several of them to
show growth and come out of this environment during the course of 2017 leading into 2018. But exactly which point is
going to come first I think it's too early to say.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Sanchez>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Bill Sanchez>: So, Paal, your comments with regard to kind of international capacity here and the fact effectively
you have no spare capacity. If I look at the CapEx guide for this year, it would suggest that relatively flat with 2016.
You don't have much any expectation I'm guessing in activating currently stacked capacity internationally I guess,
number one. And number two, what would be the trigger point on your comment for redeploying assets out of North
America if it returns, ultimately didn't work suitable for you? And what markets most likely will we see those assets
venture to?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think if you look at the CapEx guidance, it's more or less flat with 2016 and this is still
only around 50% of D&A, right. So it's still low as you indicate. Now, we have through the transformation program a
continued to focus on driving asset utilization from the existing capacity that we have, and actually the costs of
reactivating the international capacity is not significant, we're just saying that we aren't going to incur the cost unless
there is an adequate financial return. But we can do it pretty fast. It is not very accepted in terms of CapEx investments,
and a fair bit of this is built into the number that we are guiding to for 2017. So in terms of capturing upside growth, I
think we can capture quite a lot of upside growth even within this CapEx number that we are guiding to.
And when it comes to the potential redeployment of capacity, there's nothing unique about North America offshore or
anything. The only thing we're saying is that we will constantly look at what kind of returns we are getting in the
context that we operate in, and some of the high-end assets they are quite expensive and they are in potentially high
demand, and we will continue to look at deploying them where we can get the best return. So the redeployment
comment was around the offshore business which we have, I would say, quite limited spare capacity of some of the
high-end technologies, and if we aren't getting the adequate returns in any part of world, we will look to shift it around
to where we can get the returns.
<Q - Bill Sanchez>: Okay. I appreciate the clarification there. I know there's been a lot of questions around top line
and thoughts on international. Just curious on prior thoughts around the incremental margins. Paal, you've talked about
65% I think ex-Cameron as being a reasonable incremental assumption. As you see now being able to enter the
conversations with your customers on claw backs with these pricing concessions and I think just the overall outlook, is
that still a fair type of incremental margin we should be thinking about 2017 versus 2016?

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, we stand on that number that we've given. I think in order for that number to be
achieved, I think we need to get into a kind of steady line of growth, which I think will happen during the course of
2017, it might not be for the full year of 2017. And in addition to that, we will need some pricing contribution to that,
right. So the 65% incrementals we stand behind, and we need to get kind of through the trough which we are basically
done with now, and then it's just a matter of how we manage this going forward, but we are committed to the number
and that's what we're going to aim to do going forward.

And we have time for one last question. Your final question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of
America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Yeah. Hey, happy Friday, everyone.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Hey. Good morning.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: I just had a quick follow up with some comments that Simon made earlier. I wanted to
know, given that you were making comments about having hit the trough and on an upturn in general for businesses
including international, how do we think about any further cost cutting? Is it – it's been a big positive for the company
having been able to contain margins very well and better than peers, but should we consider to continue to model
further cost cutting measures or should we consider ourselves in final innings there?
<A - Simon Ayat>: Well, you've seen that we have taken some charges here for further rationalization of our support
structure. This obviously will have a full year effect, and some of the cost cutting measures that we have taken,
including our transformation program, will have a full year effect in 2017. We will continue to see the management of
costs and the cost control that will be ongoing in the company. But as far as, we are concerned, there is no further
actions beyond what we have taken, but it will have a full year effect.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Okay. So no further large cost cutting measures that we should anticipate at current
marketing conditions?
<A - Simon Ayat>: No.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Okay.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Not as far as we are concerned now. And based on what we have seen, we've taken a charge to
further rationalize which will be implemented in the first quarter, and it's already underway, but there will be no further
cuts.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Got you. And then finally on the follow-up to the commentary about considering exiting
contracts or regions that failed to provide an adequate return. I was just curious, can you characterize how some of your
competitors' behaviors are in those same markets, and talk to us about what timeframe you might need to make a
decision on whether or not you'll continue in less competitive markets?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think all parts of the business, North America land, all of international North America
offshore, it's as usual very competitive. Now they are shifting trends in where pricing is going, and generally I would
say that there is more focus now I think generally in the industry to try to raise prices, but this is highly competitive.
And it's kind of – we take this from bid to bid in terms of how we play this right. But the behavior from our
competitors, there's nothing special around that. I think they are challenged similar to us in terms of pricing and
profitability levels. And we're coming off the face of the cycle which has been extremely demanding for all players. I
think the direction that we all wanted to go is that we need to recover some of the pricing concessions that we've given.

Paal Kibsgaard
All right. So before we close this morning, I'd like to summarize the key points that we've discussed. First, the market
recovery is clearly on its way, and we look at 2017 as a starting point of a new multiyear cycle that will require a
broad-based increase in E&P investments in order to reverse the effects of several years of global underinvestment and
mitigate the pending supply shortage. The growth cycle will initially be led by North America land, but followed by the
international markets later in 2017 and leading into 2018.
And while E&P spend and revenue is very important, what ultimately matters in the next phase is the ability to drive
earnings growth and we commit to delivering faster earnings growth than our competitors in all of the markets we
compete in, including North America. We have a proven track record of doing just that, and our 600 business units
spanning the globe are all ready, able and incentivized to deliver on this promise. So after nine quarters of cost-cutting
and restructuring, we are very excited about resuming focus on growth and improving returns for our shareholders.
Thank you for participating.
