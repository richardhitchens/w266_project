MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a
listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Before we get started, I'd like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical
information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
federal securities laws including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results in the
businesses and the products of the company and its subsidiaries.
MetLife's actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of
risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any
obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future
developments, or otherwise.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar
Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2014 earnings call. We will be
discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP
measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com, in our earnings release and our quarterly

financial supplements.
A reconciliation of forward-looking information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible
because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and
losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
Joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John
Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to
participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve
Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. During
the Q&A session, in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian
Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2014.
Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2013, and operating earnings per share were
$1.38, a 1% increase over the prior-year period. Full-year 2014 operating earnings were $6.6 billion, a 5% increase
over 2013, and operating earnings per share were up 2% from the prior-year period. Operating return on equity was
12% for the full-year 2014. Intangible operating ROE was 15.2%. We believe tangible ROE is a better measure of the
business returns for MetLife because it excludes purchase accounting adjustments, primarily goodwill.
Our strong 2014 operating earnings came on top of above plan results for 2013 and we once again achieved an
operating ROE at the low end of our 2016 target of 12% to 14%. I'm even more pleased with MetLife's multiyear
performance, which is a better measure of success in a long-term business. MetLife's operating earnings increased at a
compound annual rate of 12.1% from 2011 to 2014. Over the same period, operating EPS grew at a compound annual
rate of 9.6%.
Operating return on equity averaged 11.8% from 2012 through 2014, only slightly below the low end of the 2016 target
range. Close to double digit operating EPS growth and 12% operating ROE during the past three years are noteworthy
accomplishments given the 10-year treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since the summer of 2011, and our capital
management actions have been conservative due to regulatory uncertainty.
With a 10-year treasury yield now at 2% the low interest rate environment remains a challenge for a life insurance
business. Over the long-term, we believe the 10-year treasury yield should be for 4% to 4.5% based on the Federal
Reserve's 2% inflation target and expectations for long-term economic growth. However, if interest rates remain low
indefinitely, there would likely be a downward reset in return expectations across asset classes. Because equity returns
are measured against the risk-free rate, the spread between MetLife's operating ROE and the 10-year treasury yield is a
key metric. From 2012 to 2014, the spread between MetLife's ROE and the 10-year treasury yield has averaged 9.6%.
This compares favorably to an average spread of 6.9% from 2000, the year of MetLife's initial public offering, to 2011.
I would now like to comment on capital management. We repurchased $557 million of stock in the fourth quarter.
Completing the $1 billion share repurchase program we announced in June. For the year to date, we have taken
advantage of share price weakness and repurchased $693 million under of the $1 billion-dollar program we announced
in December. Given where the stock is trading today, it is likely that we will complete this $1 billion-dollar program
soon. While we continue to believe that MetLife is well capitalized, uncertainty surrounding potential capital rules
makes us cautious about share repurchases in excess of $1 billion in 2015.
Turning to strategy, in 2014 we achieved two key elements of the strategy that we announced in May of 2012. We have
de-risked the retail business, which was a large part of our refocus the U.S. business cornerstone of our strategy, and we
achieved net expense savings of $600 million pre-tax. Our retail business has undergone a transformation during the
past few years as we have worked to reduce risk, create a more efficient operation, and improve the productivity of our
distribution force. De-risking meant pulling back from variable annuity market and exiting the lifetime secondary

guarantee universal life market both of these initiatives had a material negative impact on sales. We believe that 2014
will prove to be an inflection point for annuity sales and anticipate profitable growth in 2015 and beyond.
In variable annuities, I am pleased to announce that we will launched a new guaranteed lifetime minimum withdrawal
benefit product, Flex Choice, on February 17. The income benefit for this product meets the current expectations of the
marketplace. As we communicated on our December outlook call, we anticipate more than a 50% increase in total
annuity sales in 2015. However, a projected rebound in annuity sales does not mean we are changing our overall
strategy, which is to emphasize growth in less capital-intensive, protection-oriented product lines. First, the projected
sales increase is from a low base. Variable annuity sales were $6.3 billion in 2014 down dramatically from $28.4
billion in 2011. Second, we estimate that retail annuities will account for a smaller percentage of enterprise capital over
time.
Another key strategy milestone in 2014 was achieving our net expense savings targets of $600 million pre-tax. Our
gross expense savings were $910 million last year, close to the $1 billion strategy target. We are highly confident that
we will realize the $1 billion gross savings target in 2015. The difference between gross and net savings in 2014 was a
combination of one-time costs in reinvestment in the business. One-time costs will fade, but there will be a substantial
increase in the reinvestment spend, which is largely technology-related. Expenditures that represent an investment in
the future, including much of the work we are doing to update our technology, may reduce current period earnings that
are necessary to drive profitable growth over time.
Turning to regulatory issues, as you know, MetLife has filed a legal challenge to its designation as a systemically
important financial institution by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. As I said when we filed the challenge last
month, MetLife had hoped to avoid litigation in light of the substantial and compelling evidence we presented to FSOC
demonstrating the company is not systemically important. The Dodd-Frank Act is clear that size alone does not make a
company systemic, and we believe FSOC erred in designating MetLife. We believe we have a strong legal case to
present to the court and look forward to its eventual decision.
As a former regulator, I want to emphasize that MetLife has always supported robust regulation of the life insurance
industry. It has operated under a stringent state regulatory system for decades. However, adding a new Federal standard
for just the largest life insurers while retaining a different standard for everyone else will harm competition. This will
drive up the cost of financial protection for consumers without making the financial system safer. We believe the
government should preserve a level playing field in the life insurance industry. If additional regulation is necessary, the
government has a superior tool at its disposal, an approach that focuses on potentially systemic activities regardless of
the size of the firm. FSOC has already embraced this activities-based approach for the asset management industry.
Litigation takes time to resolve. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is now one of MetLife's regulators. We are
cooperating fully with representatives from the New York Fed as they carry out their supervisory duties. At the same
time, we continue to discuss with regulators and lawmakers in Washington the need for capital rules that reflect the
business of insurance. With the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December, the
Federal Reserve now has the flexibility it needs to properly tailor capital rules for life insurers.
In closing, let me reiterate MetLife's commitment to creating long-term value for shareholders. We are focused on
maintaining the appropriate risk profile, selling business at attractive rates of return relative to our cost of capital and
most important, improving free cash flow so MetLife can return additional capital to shareholders.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance
margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and
capital.

Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the prior year period, and operating earnings per
share were $1.38, up 1%. This quarter included four notable items, which were disclosed by business segment in the
appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS. First, consistent with the guidance from our December outlook
call, we have strengthened our asbestos legal reserves in the quarter to reflect higher frequency and severity of claims.
This resulted in an after-tax charge of $117 million, or $0.10 per share. Second, we had favorable one-time tax
adjustments in Latin America and EMEA, which increased operating earnings by $27 million, or $0.02 per share.
Third, we had lower than budgeted catastrophe experience and favorable prior-year development, which increased
operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share. Finally, we had three actuarial related items that increased
operating earnings by a net $5 million or less than $0.01 per share. The first actuarial related item, a $66 million
reduction in operating earnings, was related to interest on unclaimed funds from life policies where we cannot locate
the beneficiaries. These unclaimed funds are held by state governments, and a multistate audit determined that MetLife
owed interest on these policies. The impact was $57 million in Retail Life & Other and $9 million in Group, Voluntary
& Worksite benefit.
The second, a $48 million benefit to operating earnings, was a reserve adjustment to correct the treatment of the
disability premium waiver rider in a number of term life contracts in Retail Life & Other. You may recall we had a
positive adjustment for this item in the second quarter of 2014 as well.
The third, a $23 million benefit to operating earnings in Asia, was an unlocking of deferred acquisition cost or DAC.
This unlocking resulted from a lower expense assumption for certain life products in Japan. Adjusting for notable items
in both periods, operating earnings were up 5% year-over-year and 9% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers on
a constant currency basis were underwriting improvement, business growth, and lower taxes, which were partially
offset by less favorable equity market performance.
Turning to our bottom line results, fourth quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $1.30 per share. Net income was $93
million below operating earnings in the quarter. Four items that explain most of this difference are, number one,
charges of $140 million after tax associated with asymmetrical accounting treatment for insurance contracts and other
market value adjustments. Number two, derivative net losses of $40 million after tax, which reflects changes in foreign
currencies partially offset by gains from lower interest rates in the quarter.
Number three, a loss of $25 million after tax related to certain variable annuity guarantees where the hedge assets are
more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guaranteed liabilities. And these were partially
offset by number four, investment portfolio net gains of $129 million after tax, as credit related losses continued to be
modest in the portfolio.
Book value per share, excluding a AOCI other than FCTA was $49.53 as of December 30, up 5% year-over-year.
Tangible book value per share was $40.36 at yearend, up 9% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, operating ROE was
11.3% and tangible operating ROE was 14.1%. As Steve noted, we believe tangible operating ROE provides a better
measure of the underlying business returns for MetLife.
Turning to fourth quarter margins, underwriting results improved sequentially and year-over-year by approximately
$0.06 after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Year-over-year highlights include improvement in mortality and
morbidity experienced in the U.S. as well as strong results in property and casualty. Retail Life's interest adjusted
benefit ratio was 53.9% in the fourth quarter and 53.0% after adjusting for the net impact of the notable items discussed
earlier.
This result compared favorably to the prior-year quarter of 54.2% and within our targeted range of 50% to 55%. This
marks the second consecutive quarter of normal claim activity for Retail Life after four volatile quarters.
The mortality ratio in Group Life was 88.4% and 87.4% after adjusting for the interest in unclaimed funds. The
adjusted ratio was favorable to 87.9% in the prior-year quarter and well within the targeted range of 85% to 90%. The
Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 77.4%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 80.9% and the low
end of the targeted range of 77% to 82%.

Disability underwriting improved while dental margins were favorable to the prior-year as utilization returned to a
normal level. In our P&C business the combined ratio including catastrophes was 85.8% in retail and 92.3% in group.
The combined ratios excluding catastrophes were 81.5% in retail and 90.8% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting
results are favorable versus the prior year due to lower non-cat losses and expenses as well as favorable prior year
reserve development.
Moving to fourth quarter investment margins, the average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 215 basis
points down 26 basis points year-over-year and 21 basis points sequentially. Product spreads excluding variable
investment income were 186 basis points down 13 basis points versus the prior-year and 4 basis points sequentially.
The sequential decline in spreads can be attributed to three primary factors. First, pre-tax variable investment income
was $325 million, at the top end of our 2014 quarterly guidance range. After taxes and impact of DAC, VII was $211
million down $62 million sequentially due to weaker private equity and hedge fund returns.
Second, core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate involvement. Average new money yields are running
roughly at 100 basis points to 150 basis points below the average roll off yield on the portfolio. And third, there was a
transfer of cash into retail annuity upon the completion of the four-way merger in November, which accounts for the
majority of the 20 basis point decline in deferred annuity spreads in the quarter. We would expect to reinvest this cash
in longer-dated securities over time.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 25.0% in the fourth quarter as compared to 25.3% in the year
ago quarter. Adjusting for asbestos and other legal reserves in both quarters, the operating expense ratio was 23.7% in
the fourth quarter of 2014 and 23.6% in the prior-year period. Gross expense saves were $259 million in the fourth
quarter and net saves were $163 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million and one-time costs of $63
million.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $683 million up 4% versus the
prior-year quarter and up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in retail was driven by life and
other with reported operating earnings of $321 million up 13% versus the prior-year quarter and 14% after adjusting for
notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expenses and favorable underwriting. Life and other
PFOs ere $2.2 billion up 2% year-over-year primarily due to growth in the open block and P&C partially offset by the
runoff of the closed block.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $362 million down 3% versus the prior-year quarter and essentially flat after
adjusting for excess variable investment in the prior year. Annuities PFOs were $1.2 billion up 7% year-over-year
primarily due to higher income annuity sales. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating
earnings of $235 million, up 2% versus the prior-year quarter and 9% after adjusting for notable items in both periods.
Underwriting was the key driver with improved results in Disability, Dental, Group Life and P&C. GVWB PFOs were
$4.2 billion up 3% year-over-year and sales increased to 17% due to strong growth across all products.
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $374 million up 5% versus the prior-year quarter and 10%
after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and business growth. CBF PFOs were
$1.5 billion down 5% year-over-year due to lower income annuities and pension closeouts. On closeouts we remain
active but disciplined and continue to see a good pipeline of small to midsize cases.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $187 million up 8% from the prior-year quarter and 26% on a
constant-currency basis. Adjusting for the notable tax item in the quarter, operating earnings were up 17% on a
constant-currency basis driven by business growth across the region, partially offset by higher expenses. Overall, Latin
American taxes were unusually low in the quarter even after adjusting for the notable tax item. Latin America PFOs
were $1 billion, down 5% from the prior year quarter and up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across
the region.
Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $335 million, up 3% from the prior year quarter and 9% on a constant
currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both quarters, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant
currency basis.

Improvement in investment margins and business growth in the region were the primary drivers. Asia PFOs were $2.3
billion, down 3% from the prior year quarter but up 6% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to growth in Japan,
Korea and Australia. Asia sales were down 30% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline was expected, as the prior
year quarter had a large group employee benefit sale in Australia and elevated yen life sales in Japan in advance of
pricing changes. Adjusting for these items, Asia sales were up 1%.
In Japan, total A&H sales were up 21% year-over-year and 52% sequentially. We have seen good traction from our two
new medical products launched in September, which we announced during the 2014 Asia Investor Day.
In EMEA, operating earnings were $85 million, down 4% but up 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.
Adjusting for notable tax items in both periods, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant currency basis due to
business growth in the Middle East and a $7 million from the conversions of certain operations the calendar year
reporting.
EMEA PFOs were $671 million, down 4% from the prior year period but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Total
sales increased 22% with 40% growth in emerging market, including strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East
and A&H across the region.
Finally, the operating loss in Corporate & Other was $316 million as compared to an operating loss of $278 million in
the prior year quarter. Adjusting for the increase in asbestos legal reserves this quarter, the operating loss was $199
million, which was within the $175 million to $225 million operating loss range that we guided to during our third
quarter earnings call.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately
$6.1 billion at December 31. In addition, our 2014 free cash flow ratio was 44%, better than our updated December
estimate of approximately 40%.
Next I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not yet completed our
risk-based capital calculations for 2014, we estimate our combined RBC ratio will be in a range of 400% to 420%. Our
Japan solvency margin ratio, which we file quarterly, was 1003% as of the third quarter and we estimate that our fourth
quarter ratio will be comparable.
For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary fourth quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.4
billion and statutory net income was approximately $1.7 billion. For the full year of 2014, statutory operating earnings
were approximately $5.2 billion and U.S. statutory net income was approximately $3.8 billion. U.S. statutory operating
earnings on a comparable basis were down $1.2 billion versus the prior year, primarily due to less favorable equity
markets and reserve strengthening.
We said in our December outlook call that we thought statutory insurance reserve increases at our New York subsidiary
would be $400 million to $600 million more than we had initially contemplated. Although we are still finalizing
yearend statutory statements, we anticipate the increase in reserves will be in line with this revised expectation, even
though the assumptions for cash flow testing reflected the lower interest rate environment since the December outlook
call.
The yearend financials will also show capital contributed to our life insurance captives driven by low interest rates.
This increasing capital will be funded by $670 million of cash from the holding company, with a $225 million
contribution last year and a planned $445 million contribution in 2015.
Despite these cash contributions from the holding company, free cash flow was better than our forecast in 2014 and we
still believe a 45% to 55% ratio is a reasonable expectation for 2015. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted
capital was approximately $28 billion as of December 31, up 13% on a comparable basis to the prior year.
In conclusion, MetLife had a good fourth quarter to close out a strong year. Investment margins remain healthy despite
pressure from low rates, expenses are well controlled and underwriting improved for the second consecutive quarter. In
addition, our cash and capital position remained strong and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we

seek to maximize shareholder value.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.
<Q - Ryan J. Krueger>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. MetLife is unique among the public U.S. life insurers in that
your largest subsidiary is domiciled in New York and subject to some more conservative reserving standards. And
we've seen a lot of life companies over the last couple years take statutory charges in New York that they did not have
to take in their other subsidiaries.
So I guess given that this seems like your 400% to 420% RBC ratio might not be directly comparable to the other
companies. So I was hoping can you give us any sense of how much more statutory reserves you hold at this point
because you're domiciled in New York. Is there anything you can help us quantify there?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Ryan. This is John. Well as we have mentioned I think on prior calls, New York, we
believe is more conservative than other states and we have added reserves over the years. We haven't exactly quantified
that for the market. But suffice to say that our 400% to 420% we believe is quite strong.
<Q - Ryan J. Krueger>: Okay. All right. I guess second one on the variable annuity hedging strategy, so now that you
got rid of the captive and you have to use traditional statutory VACARVM rather than the modified GAAP, I think, that
you used in the captive. Have you changed your hedging strategy at all because of that?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Ryan. This is John again. We've changed it slightly sort of to optimize for the VACARVM
and how it moves but much of it remains the same with some regular delta hedging as well as some tail type hedging
going on, on an ongoing basis. The overall cost of the program has not materially changed, we fine-tuned it as we have
done continuously since the start of the program.
<Q - Ryan J. Krueger>: Okay. and is it accurate to say – to think about it as the traditional statutory rules are less
sensitive to interest-rate movements than kind of a fair value GAAP approach?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yes, that is true.
<Q - Ryan J. Krueger>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question will come from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Hey. Good morning. John, you discussed the capital ratios in the subs, can you
comment on the holding company cash liquidity position capital that sits there right now?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Tom. As I said we've got approximately $6.1 billion of cash at our holding companies and
this is the amount that's free and clear. We've not given what is capital or required capital or excess capital because we
really don't know what the binding capital rules will be on us. And so our strategy has been to be conservative when it
comes to overall capital management and to have a good balance in cash at the holding companies.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: When you say that $6.1 billion, that's free and clear, just remind us what your – the
buffer that you typically hold given interest coverage and debt considerations?

<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, prior to MetLife being considered to being a SIFI and now being a SIFI, I believe some
time ago MetLife did give some numbers. But since we've been under review and now that we've been picked, we've
not given a target number because we really don't know what the binding constraints will be. We don't understand the
capital rules. We of course do our own internal stress testing and we have some numbers in mind. But to give you
guidance on it would be misleading because we just don't know where it's going to be.
So with regard to that we have just been conservative in how much we hold both thinking through a strong capitalized
positions within all of our insurance entities as well as having a strong cash position at the holding companies.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Okay. And just one follow up for Steve. I guess the way you described the fact that
you're going to complete the $1 billion dollar buyback program soon but that you're cautious of doing more in lieu of
uncertain regulation, it's a bit of a change in tone and maybe it's just that. But is there something new that's occurred?
And obviously the lawsuit is out there, but is there anything else going on behind the scenes that we should be thinking
about of why there's more caution now? Because I think the last couple of times you've described capital management,
it's been somewhat more constructive.
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Tom, I think I've been pretty cautious right along. We didn't engage in share repurchases
for some time. Then, given how long it took for the capital rules to come forward, which they haven't come forward
yet, we decided to do a relatively conservative share repurchase program in 2014 of $1 billion dollars and we
announced another $1 billion for 2015. The completion of that program will probably occur faster than we had
anticipated when we put that program in place, because our share price has dropped in the marketplace with a drop in
the 10-year treasury. And that accelerated our purchases because our purchases are based upon our view of value in the
marketplace of our stock. So, I think it's really consistent what we've been saying to you. I think it's pretty consistent
right along.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Okay. And lastly, is there any formality right now – since the Fed is your regulator
now but you have this other issue going on, is there any formality that is required to execute on your capital return
programs? Or you just share information with them at this point?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, we share – this is John – with our federal regulator now all capital management actions
we are planning to do and we're in active discussions with them at all times. So if we were to, at some point, consider
doing capital management actions, we would be informing them.
<Q - Thomas George Gallagher>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Thanks. A quick follow-up to Ryan's question on the RBC. First of all, so what is now in
that RBC? Is it basically everything that you have in the U.S. ex the XXX and AXXX captives? That is my first
question.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yes. It would be everything in the U.S. with the exception of the XXX or AXXX Life captives
and – well everything material there may be, some immaterial little sub out there, but it's everything that is the material
U.S. business.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. And then the 400% to 420%, just based on your comments about the conservatism in
New York, should we assume that, that's a level that you're comfortable running with? I know a lot of companies talk
about a 400% minimum but they tend to hold more than that. But should we expect you to run at 400% to 420%?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: We do try to target about 400%, so that's where we are. But we do also think about the
strength of the overall balance sheets that we have, in particular having the New York company.

<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. And then I guess for Steve. I just want to get a sense of where you were going with
your commentary in your prepared remarks about ROE versus 10-year treasury. You kind of gave us two numbers, the
2012 to 2014 and then the 2000 to 2011 and there is obviously a delta between those. So I'm not sure if you're trying to
suggest that we should be thinking about the 2000 to 2011 range relative to the 10-year, or the 12% to 14% range? Just
want to get a sense of where you were going with that.
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Suneet, my comments really were not MetLife specific. They were really more in terms
of what investors should be thinking about in terms of return expectations by any asset class right now. I think people
have kind of locked into certain numbers of ROE expectations for equities that may have made sense in a different
environment than the one we're in today. If you have low interest rates for a long period of time, those expectation
should come down. That was really my comment.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. But not reflective of your ROE? I guess that was my mistake.
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: No, it'd be reflective I think of everyone's ROE. In all asset classes. That's my point.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. I mean, I guess – so if we are in a 4% to 4.5% 10-year treasury world, then using
your guidance I guess we should expect 14% to 14.5% kind of returns?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: We said 12% to 14% in a normal 10-year treasury environment. In a 4%, 4.5% treasury
yield, when there's 2% inflation, which is the Fed's target, let's say roughly 2.5% underlying real GDP growth would
result in that kind of a level of a treasury. And then you expect something like 12% to 14% for MetLife, a large life
insurance company with a diversified group of businesses but still a large business in the United States, which is a
moderately growing market.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: All right. Thanks.

And we do have a question from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Hi. Thank you. Just wanted to come back to the interest rate disclosure you'd given in your
outlook presentation where you show the potential present value GAAP interest rate charge of $3 billion if rates stay at
2% forever. Just had two questions there. I guess first, how narrowly do you define interest rate impact, and is it just the
direct impact of low rates on reserves, or do you also include DAC and second derivative impacts like policy holder
behavior? And then secondly, how sensitive is that number to a drop in interest rates below 2%?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Erik. It's John. So that number is total GAAP impact. It would include DAC, it would
include any GAAP reserve strengthening that might be required. Policy holder behavior is – I don't know how people
annuitize more or less or enact their rights more or less depending on where the 10-year treasury is. We haven't seen
any indication of that so far in our experience. So that's something that we would just have to see how things develop
on that. And we haven't given more sensitivities to this than the two. It's highly complex to do these calculations and
get all this done. We think this is pretty good disclosure given U.S. sensitivity.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Okay. Appreciate that. And then I guess just the one follow-up is how do movements in interest
rates affect your expected free cash flow generation in 2015? And I know you reiterated the 45% to 55% target range,
but I believe in the past there has been some fluctuation based on kind of derivative marks and other things that have
had an impact. So just how should we think about that?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, clearly, a big piece of our free cash flow comes in particular from our U.S. statutory
entities and the statutory accounting, the operating earnings, is more sensitive to movements in interest rates due to
derivative movements than, say, GAAP is. So that does impact it. It impacts it the following year, though, because our
dividend capacity is based on your earnings in a year and that's how much you can take of the next year, so it's kind of
a bit of a delayed item.

So, in any one year, interest rate moves would have an impact on the following year. That's why we give you a range
around this. But in over a two- or three-year period we believe these things average out. Once you have the derivative
gain or loss, if rates stay the same then you don't have that repeating. But as we've seen rates have gone up and gone
down in the past few years so there'll always be some fluctuation with regard to this and that's why we give you a
range.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Got it. But the 45% to 55% is still a pretty comfortable range for 2015?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Right. As I said, we are even with the reserve strengthening that we've taken due to low rates,
we are still at the 45% to 55% for 2015.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Great. Thank you.

And we do have a question from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions on your group business. First, if you
could just discuss your comfort with your GAAP and stat reserves for the long-term care block; we've seen a number of
companies take actions recently. And then second on the disability business, it seems like your non-medical claims
margins are actually pretty good so maybe if you could talk about claims incidents and recovery trends in that market –
in the disability business?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi. This is John. I'll do reserves and turn it to Bill for the claims. We have a close block of
long-term care and in stat the reserves are significantly higher than the GAAP reserves due to conservatism typically
from the New York accounting and now we have to abide for this. The stat reserves do not assume future rate increases
other than what have been already proved in the states.
The GAAP assume a best estimate where we do expect to get some rate increases but it's not really a material amount
compared to the in-force reserves from the rate increases and we have reserve adequacy in both the stat and GAAP
reserves as of yearend 2014.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: And the interest rate assumptions embedded in those, are you assuming a pickup in
rates over the next few years?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Our GAAP reserves do assume a mean reversion and the stat reserves of course are subject to
cash flow testing that have a range of interest rates.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Jimmy, it's Bill Wheeler. With regard to kind of what's going on in long-term disability,
group disability, the number itself is quite good this quarter, it's much better than we've had for really any quarter in the
last – over a year. And I guess I would describe the pieces of it are; incidents is stable, claims resolution is much
improved, as you would hope given the changes we've put in place regarding our claims operations which I think I
talked about a couple quarters ago. And, so that's good news. It's somewhat offset by – Social Security offsets are soft
and they've been soft for a while now and I think that has a lot to do with what's going on with the Social Security
Administration more than it does with MetLife. So that's kind of are the, I would say the big pieces that are moving
around but the net result is it was a good number this quarter.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: And pricing in that market as you've gone through the renewal season for the
beginning of the year how – like are overall pricing trends?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Very favorable. We asked for significant renewals obviously based on our experience, we
thought that was appropriate and I would say our achievement of those renewal rate increases was very successful with
very modest lapse rates.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Okay. Thank you.

And we do have a question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: Good morning. I have a follow-up question for Steve on the interest rate environment and kind
of thoughts on ROE. I think in the past you had said that in the low ROE – in a low interest rate environment there's a
12% to 14% long-term target, it really moves down to 11% to 13%. Is that sort of the way we should be thinking about
it? Hello?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Oh, hi. This is John. I'll just answer that. We had – John gave you some guidance that if rates
stayed low for a long period of time that it would be slightly lower by 2016.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: All right. Can you quantify that?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: It was about 100 basis points.

And we do have a question from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nigel P. Dally>: Great, thanks. On annuities, can you provide some more details on your new Flex Choice
product. With the high guarantees, is it fair to say that it has a lower return than your previous product? And if that is
true if you can discuss where those anticipated returns come out?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Nigel, I'm sorry. Can you just do that one more time?
<Q - Nigel P. Dally>: Sure. With your new Flex Choice product with the high guarantee, is it fair to say that it has a
lower return and if that is true can you discuss where those anticipated returns come out?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, Nigel, so we are raising the underlying rollup rate from 4% to 5%. Obviously the 4%
was our old GMIB and this is a withdrawal benefit. It does not – we have not compromised the return on our variable
annuity products. This product, as you would hope, meets our return expectations because there are a bunch of other
features in the product which allow us to lower the capital charge. And, so, we're excited about it.
With the GMIB, as you know, the policyholder has more choices about what he wants to do, and of course we have to
make assumptions about policyholder behavior and hedge accordingly. And that's really not the case with the GMWB.
There's less optionality in the product and therefore the hedging is much more straightforward. And so that contributes
I think to the improvement in the return to lower capital allocation of the product.
<Q - Nigel P. Dally>: Great. Thanks.

And we do have a question from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Hi. Good morning. Question on the asset adequacy testing you mentioned in line with
expectations. Could you give us any color by products, how that asset adequacy testing looks?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Seth. I'm sure our actuaries would love to give you all sorts of details on this, but for the
sake of time, New York requires us to do cash flow testing separately for long-term care because it's a closed block,
and that's driving some of the numbers that I mentioned at our December outlook call, having to raise reserves due to
the asset adequacy – the reserve testing. But we do this across all of our businesses. We use the New York seven
scenarios not only in all non-New York companies but even our life insurance captives. And that again, I mentioned

some more capital that we are putting up there for lower interest rates.
We did use rates that were actually lower than where we saw yearend 10-year treasuries. But it's a little more complex
than that, because it's not just a 10-year treasury. It's the shape of the yield curve and the reinvestment curve, and
actually compared to a few years ago, we actually have a flatter curve and the 30-year treasury is actually lower than
we saw even a couple years ago when we saw low interest rates prior.
So that has impacted the asset testing because of these long dated contracts. It's a very long reinvestment fund, so it
does have an impact. So as we mentioned, the testing that we've now just completed for yearend does reflect some
more recent conditions, and it's within the range that we had talked about in December.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Okay, great. And to clarify the $400 million to $600 million, that is on top of the $200 million
that you expected, right? So $600 million to $800 million is the range we should think about?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yes. Exactly.

And we do have a question from the line of Eric Berg with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Thanks. I just wanted to return to an earlier question and clarify the response on share repurchase.
Is the point, Steve, that you have announced two share repurchases each for $1 billion and that it is your intention at
this point to complete both but that with respect to the second it would be unrealistic to expect sort of an increase on
top of that second share repurchase? Is that what I heard?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Hi, Eric. What we said is that we're going to remain cautious, given the capital rules have
not been drafted yet or issued by the Fed. So we have not completed the second $1 billion repurchase program. So we
haven't made a final determination. We'll see when that program concludes. We'll know more about the capital rules at
that point in time, but I was signaling that we're going to remain quite cautious here until the capital rules come out,
and my best guess is those rules will not be out before the second program concludes.
