Comparable sales grew 7.3% in the first quarter, exceeding our expectations, driven by comp transaction growth of
5.1% and a 2.2% increase in average ticket. I'd like to thank our employees for their continued efforts in serving
customers, which enabled our strong transaction growth. The team's project expertise and commitment to customer
service allowed us to capitalize on the strong home improvement demand in the quarter. Healthy macro fundamentals,
favorable weather, and our compelling offers drove demand, resulting in strength in indoor as well as outdoor projects.
In fact, we recorded positive comps in all 13 product categories, with particular strength in Lumber & Building
Materials, Millwork, Paint, Lawn & Garden, and Tools & Hardware, which all posted comps above the company
average. Our emphasis on providing better omni-channel experiences positioned us well, enabling us to connect with
customers and provide the advice and assistance they count on when completing their home improvement projects,
whether they choose to connect in the store, online, in their home, or through our contact centers.
We're also pleased with the investments we've made to build deeper relationships with the Pro, as our Pro business
performed well above the company average. The work we've done to enhance our product and service offering is
allowing us to better serve this important customer segment and we will continue to deepen those relationships.
From a geographic perspective, our U.S. home improvement business achieved 7.5% comps for the quarter with all 14
regions delivering positive comps. And we continued our strong performance in international markets, including
double-digit comps in Canada in local currency.
For the quarter, we generated 170 basis points of operating margin expansion. Included in the quarter's results is a $160
million unrealized gain on a foreign currency hedge entered into in advance of our pending RONA acquisition.
Including this benefit, we delivered earnings per share of $0.98, a 40% increase over last year's first quarter.
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1.2 billion of
stock under our share repurchase program and paid $255 million in dividends.
I'm also pleased with the progress of our previously announced acquisition of RONA. The transaction was approved by
RONA's common shareholders in March and, last week, we received authorization from the Canadian regulatory
agencies clearing the way for closing of the transaction this Friday. The time is right to fortify our Canadian market
presence to take advantage of the significant long-term potential we see. We expect to build on the recent progress our
team in Canada has made and the positive results RONA has achieved over recent years as a result of their restructuring
efforts.
Turning to the economic landscape for the balance of the year, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains
positive. Persistent gains in the job market as well as disposable income growth is expected to outpace growth in the
economy should contribute to solid growth in consumer spending. And housing remains a bright spot, with home sales
and construction activity posting healthy gains to start the year while home prices continue their steady upward trend.
As a result, the home improvement industry should continue to benefit from the solid consumer and housing backdrop
even as the benefit of favorable weather at the start of the year normalizes.
And as we survey the consumer, we're seeing similar trends. Our most recent consumer sentiment survey revealed that
favorable views around personal finances and home improvement spending are holding steady. Rising home prices are
motivating homeowners to invest in their homes, and many believe that this trend will continue as the survey revealed a
significant increase in future home value expectations. Likewise, we continue to see home improvement spending
outpace overall spending as well as positive home improvement project intentions.
We will continue to focus on improving our product and service offering for the Pro customer and differentiate
ourselves through better omni-channel customer experiences that make us the project authority in order to leverage the
favorable home improvement backdrop. Our strategic framework along with efforts to improve our productivity and
profitability give us confidence in our business outlook for 2016.
Thanks again for your interest. And with that, let me turn the call over to Rick.

Ricky D. Damron
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone.
We executed well in the first quarter, growing both average ticket and transactions. In addition to our successful Spring
Black Friday events, we drove traffic through compelling offers designed to take advantage of early spring project
demand, leveraging enhanced digital capabilities and improved marketing speed and flexibility to reach the spring
customer earlier in the season.
And as Robert shared with you, we delivered positive comps across all regions and product categories as we continue
to capitalize on a favorable macro backdrop and consumers' increasing desires to invest in their homes. These favorable
trends in home improvement coupled with our compelling product offering and strength in the omni-channel retailing
contributed to a particularly strong performance in categories such as Lumber & Building Materials, Millwork, Paint,
Lawn & Garden, and Tools & Hardware.
We achieved double-digit comps in Lumber & Building Materials, driven by a continued surge in outdoor construction
projects, coupled with strong demand from the Pro customer. Millwork also benefited from this dynamic as outdoor
projects drove strong performance in windows and doors.
And as customers look to improve and enjoy their outdoor living space, the outdoor living experience we introduced in
2014 continue to pay dividends, delivering high-single-digit comps in patio and outdoor fashions for yet another year.
We also continue to see robust attachment of accessories as the showroom field and curated style helped customers
envision and create their outdoor space. Our targeted offers in advanced design to capitalize on early spring drove
demand at higher single-digit comps in Lawn & Garden category with particular strength and garden hardlines, live
goods, soil and mulch.
Our landscape lighting experience was also a success, helping customers visualize their outdoor lighting projects and
making selection and installation easy while offering innovative technologies like LED. This project strength extended
to the inside of home as well as we also saw strong performance in interior project categories.
Within Fashion Fixtures, we leveraged our customer experience design capabilities to optimize our recent lighting
resets, showcasing an expanded collection of lighting styles, finishes and brands available both in-store and online,
including the introduction of Kichler and Quoizel lighting, both home channel exclusives. Along with Progress
Lighting, we now offer the top three lighting brands in the industry, providing our customers with an exceptional range
of options and styles.
We combined our extended product offering with a simplified presentation, designs with the needs of the customer in
mind, grouping lighting fixtures by style and collection to provide a cohesive decorating solution and simplify
selection. Customers have responded well, driving double-digit comps in interior decor lighting and chandeliers, and
we're now extending this approach to ceiling fans to leverage our relationship with Hunter Fans as well as our private
label brand and sourcing capabilities.
We saw mid-single-digit comps in Appliances, Flooring, and Kitchens, further demonstrating the consumers' continued
willingness to engage in interior projects.
Paint performed above the company average, driven by strength in both interior and exterior projects. Our Paint lineup,
which showcases Valspar, Sherwin-Williams and PPG Olympic, provides customers with a full suite of top brands they
trust for their paint projects.
Tools & Hardware also benefited from the increased project activity from both DIY and Pro customers. We were able
to capitalize on this demand by improving our tool brand assortment with exclusives like Hitachi and Bostitch, the
number one and number two brands in pneumatics, and the extension of brands like Vaughan, along with our extensive
private label line of Kobalt Tools. Whether working on indoor or outdoor projects, our omni-channel capabilities
helped customer achieve great results.

Customers can engage with our associates in store for expert advice, our content on Lowes.com for inspiration, our
contact center for ongoing support, or our project specialists who work with them in their homes. On Lowes.com, we
have upgraded our online shopping experience with enhanced product content and search functionality, improved
digital tools such as 360-degree product views, improved video content and the continued expansion of click to chat
capabilities to better support the customer's digital experience.
As a result, we continue to see positive customer response and very strong growth in our online channel. Our exterior
and interior project specialists who meet with customers in their homes to design, plan and complete their home
improvement project represent another critical element of our omni-channel strategy. Our exterior project specialists
are available across all U.S. home improvement stores and we are expanding our interior project specialists program
reaching all U.S. stores by the end of this year.
Our in-home sales program continues to outperform with above-average comp growth again this quarter. Our expertise
in project inspiration, project design, and project execution are setting us apart as the project authority in home
improvement at a time when the consumer continues to demonstrate a willingness to take on home improvement
projects.
We continue to strengthen our Pro business, driving comps well above the company average by further advancing our
product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer. Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also
strengthened our portfolio of Pro-focused brands with the addition of GAF roofing, Owens Corning insulation, Lennox
HVAC, and Masonite entry and interior doors. We continue to collect feedback from Pro customers, our outside sales
team, and store employees while working closely with our field-based merchandising managers to identify local market
opportunities and brands to further optimize our offering for the Pro.
We have also advanced our omni-channel resources for the Pro. We continue to utilize feedback from our Pro
customers and Pro services team to enhance the features and functionality of our LowesForPros.com site that we
relaunched last year, making it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly purchase items nationwide.
Thus far, we have been pleased with the program rollout, given the positive customer response and the early results,
which have exceeded our expectations.
Another critical element of our omni-channel offering for the Pro customer is our Account Executive Pro services or
AEPs. AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple
geographies and locations. Our AEPs are a key component of our strategy to grow our business with larger Pro
customers. We currently have over 180 Pro outside representatives in the field and have experienced great success with
the program, with continued strong growth in AEP comp sales.
Building on this success, we will continue to grow the program, adding additional AEPs to continue capturing market
opportunity with large Pro customers. We're also reaching out to the Pro through targeted marketing and special events
such as Credit Events, Bonus Days, and Spring Pro Appreciation Days to drive awareness and generate new business.
We have been pleased with these results and driving both incremental purchases with existing Pro customers and
building relationships with new customers.
Our work to strengthen our portfolio of brands as well as expand our omni-channel offering through our growing Pro
services team and our relaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of a broader commitment to build on a strong foundation
with the Pro. This foundation includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory depth aligned with the needs of the
Pro, jobsite delivery, and our value proposition, including a 5% off everyday loyalty program for Pros using Lowes
proprietary credit, as well as reduced delivery rates. In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to
focus on driving productivity and profitability.
For the quarter, gross margin contracted, as strong performance in lower-margin categories such as Lumber & Building
Materials led to a negative mix impact. And while we planned targeted promotions to capitalize on strong spring
demand, the participation rate in those offers exceeded our expectations which, together with markdowns associated
with reset activity, led to a negative rate impact. Our stores once again effectively managed payroll hours on very
strong comp sales growth, driving payroll expense leverage. They drove this leverage while achieving continued strong

Robert F. Hull
Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone.
Sales for the first quarter were $15.2 billion, an increase of 7.8%. Total transaction count increased 5.5% and average
ticket increased 2.2% to $68.08. Comp sales increased 7.3%, driven by a comp transaction increase of 5.1% and
average ticket growth of 2.2%. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 8.3% in February, 9.1% in March, and 4.9% in
April. Comps were stronger earlier in the quarter as we capitalized on favorable weather to drive above-plan comps.
April sales were consistent with our plan coming into the quarter.
Gross margin for the first quarter was 35.04% of sales, a decrease of 43 basis points from last year. The decrease in
gross margin as a percent of sales was due to rate pressure as well as the mix of products sold. The rate pressure related
to targeted promotions and markdowns associated with reset activity.
SG&A was 22.28% to sales, which leveraged 188 basis points. In anticipation of the RONA acquisition, we entered
into a foreign currency hedge to lock in the purchase price in U.S. dollars. In the quarter, we recorded a $160 million
unrealized gain, driving 105 basis points of expense leverage. Also, store payroll leveraged 13 basis points, as we
continue to optimize our staffing model. Utilities leveraged 11 basis points as a result of warmer weather relative to last
year. Lastly, there were numerous other expenses that leveraged between five and 10 basis points in Q1.
Depreciation for the quarter was $357 million, which was 2.34% of sales and leveraged 25 basis points compared to
last year's first quarter, as a result of higher sales and assets becoming fully depreciated.
Earnings before interest and taxes increased 170 basis points to 10.42% of sales. The unrealized gain on the FX hedge
accounts for 105 basis points of the increase versus last year.
Interest expense at $156 million for the quarter deleveraged 8 basis points to last year as total debt increased $4.1
billion versus the first quarter of 2015. We issued $3.3 billion of unsecured bonds in April. The transaction consisted of
three-year, 10-year, and 30-year issuances with a weighted average interest rate of 2.72%. The proceeds will fund the
RONA acquisition as well as refinance current year maturities.
Effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.2%. Earnings per share of $0.98 for the quarter represents a 40% increase over
last year's $0.70. The $0.98 includes $0.11 related to the FX hedge gain. We exceeded our earnings plan for the quarter,
even without the gain.
Now to a few items in the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were
$4.6 billion. The higher cash balance is a result of the April bond deal. Our first quarter inventory balance of $11.1
billion increased $441 million or 4.2% over the same period last year. Inventory turnover was 3.83 times, an increase of
5 basis points over Q1 2015.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet, accounts payable of $8.8 billion increased $798 million or 10%
over Q1 last year. Increase in accounts payable is due to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year and a
three-day improvement in days payable outstanding. At the end of the first quarter, we suggested debt to EBITDAR
was 2.45 times. The higher the target leverage was the result of the April bond deal. We expect to be back in line with
our 2.25 times target within one year of the RONA transaction closing.

Return on invested capital increased 64 basis points for the quarter to 14.98%. The net impact of the non-cash
impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter related to the exit of our joint venture in Australia and FX hedge
gain this quarter reduced ROIC by 145 basis points.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $208
million, resulting in free cash flow of $3 billion. Free cash flow was $766 million, or 34.1% over the same period last
year.
In February, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. We expect to receive
approximately 6.8 billion shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon the completion of the
program in the second quarter. We also repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares for $700 million through the
open market. In total, we repurchased $1.2 billion within the quarter. We have approximately $2.4 billion remaining on
our share repurchase authorization. The remaining $53 million of share repurchase as shown on the statement of cash
flows relates to the shares withheld from employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. First, as a reminder, fiscal
2016 will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. We estimate
that the 53rd week will aid total sales by approximately 1.5% and earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.06. Second, while
we have received shareholder approval and authorization from regulatory agencies, we have not closed on the RONA
acquisition. As a result, our outlook excludes the impact of this transaction.
Finally, while we did outperform our Q1 sales and earnings plan, we continue to think about strength within the context
of the first half of the year. We're confident in our plans and hope to sustain the momentum, but we are in the middle of
the spring season and believe it's prudent to maintain our previously provided outlook.
Now, let's get into that outlook. As Robert noted, the forecast for home improvement industry remains positive. For
2016, we expect total sales increase of approximately 6%, driven by a comp sales increase of 4%, the impact of the
53rd week, and the opening of approximately 45 stores which includes 20 Orchard locations and 12 stores in Canada.
For ease of modeling, the EBIT growth rate excludes the impact of last year's Australian joint venture impairment
charge and this year's FX hedge gain. We are anticipating an EBIT increase of 80 basis points to 90 basis points. The
effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%.
For the year, on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $4.11 with the incremental $0.11 from
our prior guide coming from the FX hedge gains. We are forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately
$5.4 billion. Our capital plan for 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $3.9
billion for 2016. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchases for 2016. The share repurchase
assumption is not expected to be affected by the RONA acquisition.
Regina, we're now ready for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Good morning, Scot.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: I hate to kind of lead with a short-term factor like weather, but Bob, is there any estimate you
guys have in terms of what kind of impact the weather had on the comp in the quarter in total? And by any chance,
would you have, let's call it, a monthly cadence, kind of on a weather-adjusted basis month-by-month?

<A - Robert F. Hull>: Scot, so we estimated that weather impacted Q1 performance by roughly 150 basis points. As I
mentioned in my comments, that impact was more pronounced first part of the quarter. I don't have the 150 basis points
dissected by month at this time.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay, I appreciate that. And then just on the margin, you mentioned a couple different things
impacting it from the promotions to mix. Can you give us any color regarding the relative size of the impact of each of
those factors?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Scot, the three factors that we mentioned, the mix of products sold, the recent activity, targeted
promotions, each had roughly 15 basis points impact.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: So roughly even. All right, thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass the torch.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. So first I guess a follow-up to Scot's first question regarding the 150 basis points.
Bob, you answered on the seasonal impact. Can you talk about how much – or the weather impact, how much that
could have been from projects that started earlier versus outdoor seasonal products that sold through?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: As I mentioned in my comments, Simeon, we think about spring as more of a first half event.
We don't spend a lot of time trying to dissect what might've slashed between quarters. So certainly the mild winter
weather enabled exterior projects. We saw that show up in some of the categories that Rick mentioned that
outperformed, but the ultimate impact will be determined at the completion of second quarter when we review our
spring results.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Got it, okay. And then thinking through gross margin, are you able to share with us the
difference in product margin in some of those categories, seasonal, Lumber & Building Materials, and should we see
the gross margin bounce back to some extent in the second quarter reflecting the product mix?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So what I would say is that the lion's share of the mix impact related to Lumber & Building
Materials. So if the demand for those categories remained strong, we could have additional mix pressure in the second
– or the remainder of the year. Now however, we would also generate additional sales from that demand. In addition,
the other two items, the targeted promotions and the reset activity are largely Q1 events, and we don't expect a lot of
residual impact beyond Q1 for those items.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: Hi, thanks, two questions. One is about the guidance and the fact that it was a good strong
start for the year and if we keep that 4% comp guidance on my math, it implies that the rest of the year we're going to
be running like 3% or 3.5%. Is that what you're seeing now especially given – if I remember correctly, May is actually
an easier comp than April was a year ago? Then I had a follow up.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Greg, this is Robert. I'll start, then I'll turn it over to Bob. I think just as we've done the past
few years, generally coming out of the first quarter, we've not changed our guidance for the year. So we're following a
cadence very similar to what was done in the past. We think it's too early in the year to be changing our guidance. I
think this is very consistent with what you've seen the past few years, whether we've started off with a robust first

quarter, our first quarter that was, let's say, weather challenged as we had a couple of years ago. But, Bob, if you'd like
to...
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Greg, a couple of things I'll reiterate my comments. First, we felt good about April. April
was on plan. Second, we hope to sustain the momentum that we're seeing. So, we're excited about our plans and remain
confident in our ability to execute. There's nothing to suggest that we're not able to execute the guidance we put
forward.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: Okay. So, if April was on plan, so presumably May is on plan?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: As we talked about, we guide annually. We feel good about the opportunity to deliver our
results. We're not going to get into the short-term nuances of this quarter versus that quarter, but we are confident in our
ability to execute.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: Okay, great. And I guess the follow-up was about the margin progression in the first quarter
and more on the gross margin side. You talked about targeted promotions unrelated to reset. Are there other categories
that you're going to be resetting and doing this with that we should expect in the second quarter and third quarter for the
rest of the year? Or was that something more specific to the first quarter as we think about the rest of the year and how
it plays out?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Greg, it's more specific to the first quarter and normalizes throughout the balance of the
year.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: Got it, thanks. I'll let someone else have a chance.

<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks, good morning. So following up on the margin, so was gross margin in
line with your plan? And then, the other side of it, the SG&A came in much better even if you back out the foreign
currency hedge gain. So, that was very strong. So, was that also in your plan? And as you think about putting up a 7%
comp in the first quarter, which is fantastic, the flow through, I guess, wasn't very large. And I know that you talked
about that, that 1Q was going to be light, but you were also, I think, embedding more of like a 5% comp. So I guess
those extra two points didn't drive as much flow-through as one would've thought.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So the gross margin came in a little bit below our plan for a couple reasons. First, as Rick talked
about, we had greater take rate in the targeted promotions. So we had an estimate of the impact. The customer
receptivity was stronger than we anticipated, which is certainly a good thing, and kudos to the team for identifying the
items that resonate with customers. Second, we expected the impact from the reset to be a little more balanced Q1 and
Q2. We had good sell-through on the recent activity, therefore the impact was more pronounced in the first quarter. As
I mentioned, that clears the deck Q2 going forward. And then lastly, the mix pressure was a little bit higher than we
anticipated based on the strong demand of Lumber & Building Materials.
As it relates to the flow-through, so the lower than anticipated flow-through is almost entirely attributable to the decline
in gross margin versus plan, again, based on the factors I just described.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Understood. Understood. So the SG&A came in where you thought it would be.
And there was no up and down because of – like you talked about in the fourth quarter, a switch between financing
offers versus promotional offers?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: No, there was a subtle nuance within credit as it relates to our partner, and they made a change
that impacted us last year regarding the loan loss reserve. The trailing impact of that hit Q1. That was modest pressure

in Q1. That's largely done, so that's a pressure in Q1 that we won't see Q2 going forward, but not otherwise, Chris,
nothing out of the norm.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Understood, thank you. And then as a follow-up, there are a lot of companies
who are talking negatively about the consumer, Target, for example, this morning; following other companies'
department stores last week, Costco being a little bit light. So is there anything as you peel back demand, whether it's
regionally, California is, ticket versus traffic, deceleration in the quarter, is there anything that you're seeing that would
suggest a deteriorating consumer backdrop?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Chris, this is Robert. As I outlined in my comments, as we've seen the consumers, we look
through our consumer sentiment survey with what their intentions are around spending, with what their intentions are
around investing in the home as we're seeing continued improvement in the job market. We're seeing continual
improvement in wages. We're seeing continued improvement in home values. It's driving continued improvement in
their intentions for discretionary spending, which I think the best evidence of that is in the 5.1% increase that we saw in
comp transactions during the quarter.
And nothing that we've seen in our sentiment surveys has led us to believe that the consumer, when we asked them how
do you feel six months out with regard to purchases, nothing shows any change in their intentions as we survey them
today. So that I think is why, as Bob took you through our strong first quarter, we're aware of what others are saying
out there with regard to the consumer. But when we take our strong first quarter performance and what we're hearing
from the consumer when we survey them gives us confidence in reiterating our guidance for the year that Bob has
taken you through.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks, guys.

Your next question will come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. So this is the second quarter in a
row where you were a little bit more promotional. It seemed to have maybe a greater impact this quarter. Can you talk
about the influence that some of the increased promotional activity that you engaged in had on the comp? And what are
you learning about consumer price elasticity across various categories? I know it's a three-part question, I apologize. Is
promotional activity more pronounced in store or online? Thank you.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Good morning, Michael. I can take that. First, let me just talk about where we focused our
promotions and a little bit about how we went about it first quarter. We were more focused on Lawn & Garden,
Seasonal Living, Tools & Hardware, Major Appliances, and Interior Projects because we thought those would be the
types of products and projects the consumers' mindset would be geared towards. We leveraged our sales and operation
planning process. And what's important about this process is it allows us to have a better sense on the micro-seasons
that apply to the consumers' mindset so that we hit the consumer with the right promotion at the right time. We're much
faster in being able to flex our promotions and our digital assets because of some of the investments that we made in
our additional capabilities, and what we saw was a higher take rate. And as Bob said earlier, that's certainly a good
thing.
Our flexible supply chain allows us to make adjustments to where the consumer is making purchases and ensure that
we don't disappoint them by not having product. But I wouldn't say that the intensity and depth of promotion was
greater. What I would say is that our execution around promotions continues to get better. So we're doing a much better
job of getting the right promotions in front of the customer at the right time, leveraging our digital capabilities as well
as some of the processes that we put in place.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: And are you learning anything about price elasticity? It seemed like last quarter it was
more focused on Appliances. Maybe this quarter was more on Seasonal and Tools. And so maybe the construct of the
home improvement industry, which conventional wisdom says that the elasticity isn't as great here as in other

categories, may not be true. And you can push that a little, work harder to drive more capacity. Is that the right way
you're – or is that the way you're thinking about it?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Michael, we've got tools that allow us to understand the effectiveness of promotions and
price elasticity of items. That's the magic is to have the right level of promotions that resonate with customers, not too
much because too much promotion creates some leakage in the system and less than ideal flow-through. So we do have
some tools in place to allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of the promotion, of drawing customers in, trying to get a
sense of the close rate as well as the elasticity of the items. So we are continuing to turn knobs and pull levers to
maximize the effectiveness there.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: And, Bob, you mentioned that you think promotions will be less of an impact on the
gross margin in the second quarter. Is that because you're going to pull back on the promotions, or do you think this
will be more effective and less dilutive? And then I'm done. Thank you.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So as Mike said, one of the key areas that was our focus in Q1 was Lawn & Garden. And some
of the higher take rate, higher effective promotions were around that category. Those are not things we expect to repeat
in the second quarter, or beyond for that matter, regarding Lawn & Garden, which allows us to be comfortable that the
impact was largely contained in the first quarter.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay, good luck with the spring. Thank you.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Thanks, Michael.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot and good morning, a couple of quick ones here. I know you gave the monthly
cadence as reported. Did the Easter calendar shift impact the monthly cadence at all?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: It did, Matt. As we think about Easter impact, with the change, Easter would have impacted
March. March would have been 9.7%. April would have been 3.4%.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it, that's very helpful. Second question, can you talk about what you saw directionally
for online growth this quarter and any changes in how the customer DIY and/or Pro is using Lowes.com?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Matt, Lowes.com and e-commerce grew 23.5% for the quarter, and we saw strong growth in
traffic as well as conversion to the site. So we feel good about the investments that we've made over the past year in
really beginning to drive increased shopability of the site. I think the key aspects there is when we go back and we talk
about the things we've done to the site to really make it more customer friendly; like I said in my comments, the
enhanced video content that we're adding to the site, the improved product descriptions as well as increased content
there is also resonating well with the customer.
So those aspects of it, I think, continue to help us drive the incremental growth from the dotcom platform.
LowesForPros from an e-commerce perspective is performing extremely well, as we said, exceeding our expectations.
And we're extremely pleased with what we're hearing and the feedback we're getting from consumers as well as our
AEPs in the field about the usability of the site, the functions the site enables to make the ability for the Pro to shop
much more easily with us. So we're really proud of those two things as we continue to move forward.
We have not seen a shift in the mix of business regarding the in-store pickup. We still see that as roughly 60% of all
e-commerce transactions that are picked up. That's even heavier as it relates to LowesForPros. Delivery still continues
to grow as a component of that, and parcel is about 30% of our dot-com sales.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks so much for that thorough answer, I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Thanks, good morning, so one follow-up question on the gross margin. In the past, you guys
have talked about some offsets in either product cost deflation or value Improvement, which I don't think was called
out in the quarter. Can you speak to those items and if you see those as bigger opportunities as we move through the
year?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Seth, those items continue to be in play. We did see some modest benefit from both those
items in the quarter, but they were offset by the three negative factors that were mentioned.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Got it, okay. And then just a specific question on the Appliance category. I think that category
saw one of the biggest swings in the quarter; went from outperforming in the past to below the company average. And I
think that's just optics, to some extent, as I think you said the category was still up mid-single-digits. But is there
anything else to read into that as we try to understand both where we are in the cycle and also perhaps how the
competitive landscape may be changing in that category, specifically? Thanks.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: No, we don't think there's anything else to read into it. If you look at our Appliance business,
it's outperformed for the last five quarters. It's cycling over a double-digit comp. The two-year stack is well above the
company average. We continue have one of the best assortments with all of the national brands. We continue to take
advantage of next-day delivery, haul-away, in-house facilitation, repairs and maintenance. We're really proud of the
fact that we control the last three feet of the appliance experience. We don't outsource that.
J.D. Power has just recognized us as the best in appliance retail satisfaction. The investment that we made in floor
space gives us one of the largest floor space in the industry. And the reason why we think that's important is that if you
consider our floor space in Appliances coupled with our floor space in cabinets, it positions us well to take advantage
of the cycle as it continues to play through.
And the last thing I'd say is that in Kitchens in particular, if you look at the high-ticket items in Kitchen, things like
cabinets and countertops, we saw strength there. So that suggests to us that the cycle is still well intact.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Okay, makes sense. Thanks very much.

Your next question will come from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Thanks. One follow-up question to an earlier one. How much did the greater uptake on the
promotional activity impact the comps?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: It certainly had some impact, Michael, as Lawn & Garden was one of the best-performing
categories so it was certainly a driver of the quarter. But as the team described, there's many actions impacting the Pro,
impacting the Paint category, impacting a variety of things that helped drive the totality of the performance in the
quarter.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay, I think the four product categories I think it was Mike Jones mentioned it as where you
focused the promotions. Two were above, two were below company average. So I was looking for more color on that,
but, okay, understood.
Another question, you did keep the 80-basis-point to 90-basis-point guidance for the year on the margins, which means
for every comp point above 1%, you're going to look for between 27 basis points and 30 basis points of improvement.
You're obviously below that here. So is the reason that you didn't change that, is it what you said earlier about not
changing the comp outlook, just too early in the year? Or are there specific reasons to believe the flow-through will be
not only better than it was in the first quarter, but better than that 27 basis points to 30 basis points typical rule of

thumb?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So I would say, Michael, we think there's potential upside on the sales line. Again, we feel good
about the momentum we saw in Q1. We hope to sustain the momentum. However, we feel it's way too early to start
thinking about changing outlook for the year. So we do think there is some upside in the top-line. We talked about
some gross margin pressure in the first quarter that won't continue, so we've certainly taken that into account. However,
we do feel even better than we did 90 days ago about our ability to continue to drive expense productivity and leverage,
which gives us confidence in the outlook.
To the extent sales are better, and some of that's driven by the Lumber & Building Materials category and the
flow-through might be closer to 25 basis points. But again, it's too early to start changing pieces of the outlook.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay, thanks. Understood.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Thank you, Mike.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Two things. First of all, from a bigger-picture perspective, I just wonder, Bob, if you could
comment on how we should be thinking about gross margin. Understand the moving parts in the first quarter, but as we
think about this year or the next couple of years, strategically, how are you thinking about balancing promotions and
sales relative to gross margin, and what path does that suggest for gross margin?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So two things. One that ties back to a previous answer, and then secondly, long-term gross
margin performance. So as I mentioned earlier, we do have tools that allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of
promotions. As we think about promotions, some are specific to drive sales, some are specific to grow the basket and
some are just general awareness around the brand and the categories we carry. So we continue to turn knobs and pull
levers to maximize the effectiveness there.
Taking a step back, Eric, as we think about gross margin, we do expect some modest gross margin improvement
annually. As we think about gross margin, it's probably not going to be 2017 until we actually eclipse the gross margin
rate we had in 2010. So it's not like we're forging new ground and looking for gross margin peaks that have never
occurred before. So roughly over that eight-year period, let's call it flattish gross margin over a long period of time.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Okay. And then secondly, I understand the influence of weather and your desire to not talk
about the very near term, but the difference in performance in April and May relative to February and March, anything
that you learn in looking through that? Can you isolate the weather? Is there anything else different that's going on that
explains the magnitude of the step-down?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Two things regarding weather. So I mentioned the 150 basis point impact for the quarter. If you
exclude the weather, we would have still beaten our sales plan. So the underlying demand for our category is from the
macro fundamentals that drive our business, housing and incomes, continue to be constructive. Beyond that, no other
nuances impacting the quarterly – excuse me, the monthly cadence.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Okay. I guess your commentary within April being on plan would suggest that's where you
expect it to be despite whatever happened with weather. Is that the proper way to read that?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: That is correct.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Thanks a lot and good morning.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Morning, Seth.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: My first question just around Pro and specifically LowesForPros. You've had that in place
now for a couple quarters. Can you give us an update on the effectiveness and the traction you're gaining from that
initiative?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Sure. As I stated earlier, we've been very pleased with the receptivity from the consumer and
the Pro customer regarding LowesForPros. We continue to see strong growth quarter-over-quarter as the customers
become aware of the site. If you want to look at Q1, we saw significant growth in new registered pros on the site as
well as conversion and growth as a percent of total dot-com business. So we feel great about what we're seeing. We
continue to improve the functionality of the site through feedback from our customers and our sales teams to make it
more conducive and easier for the customers to navigate.
The other thing I would say as we continue to look at the site is to keep in mind the functionalities that it did provide
that we did not have the capabilities of before. So the Pros, for example, were not capable of using their in-house credit.
They can now. Pros did not receive their 5% value prop usage on prior Lowes.com. They can today. Tax-exempt
accounts weren't available to them prior usage. They are today. So all of those things are resonating extremely well,
and we continue to work on making the site more effective, more efficient. But to date, we've been extremely pleased
with what we've seen both from a registered user content as well as sales performance.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Great, that's helpful. And then secondly on cost control, great performance this quarter. As
you look through the balance of the year, Bob, when you think about labor optimization, marketing, indirect cost, can
you give us some order of magnitude of the benefits you expect from each of those?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Sure, I'll give you some high-level perspective. For the year, we continue to think indirect spend
is going to pay dividends for us. That's in the 50 basis point or so range, bonuses are 10 basis points. Like we talked
about the analysis around promotions, we continue to do the same thing regarding resets and things of that nature. We
think we'll get about 10 basis points of leverage on that spend this year. Risk insurance is going to be less of a drag;
that's about five basis points. Employee insurance is also less of a drag. Advertising, about five basis points. And a
couple of indirect fixed cost leverage, 10 or so basis points, and then the impact of the 53rd week gives us about five
basis points. So a lot of good items drive expense leverage for 2016.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: That's helpful detail, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citi Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. One area that I just wanted to make sure I address
today is just about the supply chain. I know it's something that has been discussed by both you and your biggest
competitor in the home improvement channel as a competitive advantage and as a way not to get disrupted. Can you
walk us through any efficiencies achieved in the supply chain this quarter and what opportunities you're working on
over the next six to 12 months?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Sure, the aspect of supply chain has been a significant advantage for us for years as we talk
about how we build out supply chain and the avenues that we have. I think as we look at the omni-channel
environment, over the last several years we've enabled several new functions to the supply chain to allow us to continue

to meet that demand. Flexible fulfillment, which allows us to ship from a store group as well as RDCs, so we're able to
meet 94% of our customer demand with next-day shipping rates. By utilizing that flexibility within the system, we
continue to maximize the productivity of the supply chain through new initiatives such as Project Rhythm, which we
work with vendors in smoothing out orders and order flow to make sure that we're as effective as possible.
We continue to drive labor efficiency in the supply chain through utilization of Lean Six Sigma practices and processes
and making sure that we're able to get the effective use of tubing out the trailers and the trucks to move forward. Fleet
and fuel cost continues to be an advantage and a tailwind currently. So we continue to see those avenues paying
significant dividends for us over the next several months and quite frankly the next couple of years. As we look into the
construction of possibly the Internet Fulfillment Center or DFC, Direct-to-Customer Fulfillment Center, which we have
currently plans underway and being built out for a forecasted opening in the 2018 time horizon.

Okay. Our final question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking one more here, so a couple questions. First, the comment about
Pro being well above the company average, I know it was above average in the fourth quarter, but it sounded obviously
the tone to that comment was a lot stronger. Any way to quantify that – this gap relative to maybe historical trend? Is
this about as strong a gap as you've seen? I was just trying to get a flavor for just how strong that momentum is right
now.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So the Pro performance, Pete, in first quarter was approaching double digits.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, good. That's helpful, Bob. Thank you. And then on the online business, what are the
largest categories that you guys are selling online right now? And then what are the fastest growing? Are there certain
categories that are coming on strong? Just curious how that looks.
<A - Michael A. Jones>: A couple of things. I'd say for the most part, where you see simple replace items, they tend to
do better online, like Appliances, as an example. But one of the differences in our strategy is that we help customers put
together projects. And that tends to lend itself more towards omni as the best tool to serve those customers' needs. But
our incursion of online is moderated by the fact that we tend to be more project-oriented than simple replace, thus we
talk about being the project authority and not talk to just product.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: I would add to that, as we continue to look at overall traffic to the site, as I said earlier,
we've been extremely pleased with receptivity to the new functionality of the site from the consumer, and I think that's
representative in the results over the last couple quarters as well as the investments that we're making to make content
more effective for the customers from an aggregation of data perspective as well as product information. As such,
we've been extremely pleased with the sales from the site. The visits to the site have continued to grow as well as
improvements in conversion and average ticket.
So as Mike talked about, we continue to see those core fundamental categories continue to do well. The single product
categories, particularly in Appliances and those categories, and again I think it's important to highlight that the store
still plays a critical role in the omni-channel world where our customers are choosing to either pick up or have
delivered 70% of all of our transactions from Lowes.com, from the store, with 30% still being parceled. So we feel
good with where we are. We feel good with the traction we're making in making the site much more effective and
user-friendly.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Very helpful. Last point would be on Lawn & Garden. Obviously strong in the quarter, but
curious about the spread North versus South. Certainly a lot stronger in the South, I think, than in the North. How large
was that gap and what kind of opportunity do you see in Lawn & Garden in, call it, the North, Northeast, over the

balance of the second quarter? Thank you.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: We think spring is still to come in the Northeast certainly, so we think there's still some lawn
and garden business to go get. But I do want to just say one thing. If you think about our business, we had some strong
promotions in Lawn & Garden. The rest of our business continues to do extremely well. So if you look at Paint as an
example where we had really high comps above the company average, applicators, exterior stains, exterior paint, spray
paint, caulk, interior stains, all double digit. So we feel good about some of the spring that's ahead of us. We think that's
going to drive our Lawn & Garden business. We feel even better about some of our big initiatives that are also driving
our business.
