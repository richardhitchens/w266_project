Donald Thompson
Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Despite mixed first quarter performance, McDonald's remains a daily
destination for our 69 million customers around the world. The talented teams leading our business in 119 markets
around the world continue to leverage their deep experience in a variety of operating environments. Our strong System
alignment has enabled us to remain focused on serving great tasting food and beverages in contemporary restaurants
and at an affordable price, because that's what matters most to our customers. These strengths, combined with our
diverse portfolio in terms of geography, menu and across day parts enable us to build for the future, while we remain
focused on delivering in the short-term.
The challenging economic environment in which we're operating impacted our first quarter results. While there are
mixed signs of a slow recovery in the U.S., significant headwinds persist, as consumer confidence continues to waver.
Persistently high unemployment rates and ongoing austerity measures in Europe and soft macroeconomic conditions in
APMEA, are pressuring consumer purchasing power, as well. And the informal eating out industry is either flat or
declining in many markets around the world. Year-to-date March, our global comparable sales were down 1%. This
reflects comparisons against strong prior year results that include an additional day, due to leap year and last year's
favorable weather.
Operating income was flat in constant currencies and EPS was $1.26, a 3% increase in constant currencies. While not
unexpected, we are not satisfied with our first quarter results. Even though our top-line comparables will ease through
the remainder of the year, macroeconomic pressures will continue. And we've also seen new challenges emerge in the
marketplace, like softer retail sales in the U.S. and the avian influenza outbreak in Asia.
So as we begin the second quarter, April global comparable sales are expected to be slightly negative. However, I am
confident that we have the right plans in place to strengthen our business momentum for the long-term. We know we
can't control the external environment in which we're operating, but we can leverage our scale and strength to
aggressively pursue opportunities within our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the
customer experience and broaden accessibility to brand McDonald's around the world.
As I share an update on our performance by geography, I'll provide examples that illustrate how local markets are
executing their plans within the framework of our Plan to Win, and these three global growth priorities. You'll also see,
in some cases, that we've continued to make adjustments to generate the greatest impact in the current environment and
drive long-term growth.
Let's start with the U.S., where comparable sales for the quarter were down 1.2% amidst the challenging eating out
environment and operating income declined 3%. While our comparable sales were negative, we out-performed the
competitive set and increased market share. This reflects our ability to continue differentiating our brand, despite
declines in the IEO category.
We continue to complement Dollar Menu value news with a focus on core favorites and innovative new products. In
addition to our annual focus on Filet-O-Fish during the Lenten season, we expanded the McBites platform to include
Fish McBites. Throughout the year, we will feature even more compelling new products in the United States, especially
in our four key growth categories of chicken, premium beef, breakfast and beverages. For example, Premium
McWraps, a great innovation from Europe that we've begun to scale globally; Egg White Delight, a tasty lower-calorie
addition to our breakfast line-up; and Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothies, which originated in Canada, are three

delicious new additions that position us to continue growing sales and market share in the second quarter.
In Europe, comparable sales were down 1.1% for the quarter and operating income was up 1% in constant currencies.
Results in Germany and France remain soft, while the U.K. and Russia continue to deliver. Across the region, we're
focused on building market share by reinforcing our value platform to offer compelling affordable products across all
day parts and multiple price tiers. We build on that foundation by featuring premium products and promotions that
encourage trade-up and higher average check.
France launched the Casse Croute sandwich and drink combo for €4.50. It drove strong performance during the lunch
day part, by enabling us to compete with local bakeries through an appealing offer below the €5.00 price point. In
Germany, the €1.00 Beef or Chicken Western Burgers complemented the [Houton-Goudie] and Stars of America
promotional food events to contribute to results. Germany continues to refine its value offers across day parts in an
effort to strengthen value perceptions for consumers who remain price-sensitive in this challenging economic
environment.
And in the U.K., successful food events featuring premium products continue to resonate with our customers in this
largely reimaged marketplace. This past quarter, promotions include the Limited Edition Deli Choices, featuring the
Cajun Crispy Chicken sandwich. We also launched Chicken McBites in January as part of the U.K. Tasters Menu. This
limited-time offer further validates the global appeal of this great product outside of Australia and the United States.
Russia also continues to deliver solid results, with its focus on breakfast and seasonal menu offerings that emphasize
local taste, including spicy wraps and spicy rolls. While both the U.K. and Russia posted positive comparable sales for
the first quarter and continued to grow market share, momentum in both markets has slowed relative to strong results in
2012. This is the effect of weakened consumer confidence in the U.K. and lower levels of inflation in Russia that limit
our pricing power.
Now, let's shift over to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, where comparable sales were down 3.3% for the quarter,
while operating income increased 2% in constant currencies. We remain focused on aggressively driving top-line
performance and growing market share through continued emphasis on our value platforms by accelerating growth at
breakfast and by enhancing service and convenience initiatives. Breakfast remains a significant growth opportunity for
us in APMEA. Today, a large percentage of the Asian population eats breakfast away from home, but our breakfast
sales as a percentage of full-day sales are only 11%. That's less than half the U.S. average of 25%, which tells us that
breakfast represents a significant growth opportunity in this region.
As part of a year-long focus to get more consumers to think of McDonald's as a morning destination, 30 countries
across APMEA participated in a National Breakfast Day promotion on March 18. 5,000 restaurants gave away 5
million of our great-tasting and nutritious Egg McMuffins, and we significantly increased awareness and trial for our
breakfast products.
Let's turn to APMEA's big three markets, starting with Australia. Our focused efforts to balance value initiatives with
promotional activities that encourage trade-up positively contributed to first quarter results. Monopoly, which returned
to Australia after a 13 year hiatus, drove Extra Value Meal sales and encouraged add-on purchases, with game pieces
strategically placed on drinks, fries and desserts.
Japan's performance for the quarter was negatively impacted by the difficult economy, a declining IEO industry, and
ongoing consumer sensitivity to prices and promotions. Japan continues to evaluate and adjust its plans to complement
existing value initiatives with new product news that drives long-term profitable sales and guest counts. For example,
January's national Big Mac campaign resonated well with customers and was another step in our journey to rebalance
our core menu pricing and promotion strategies.
In China, comparable sales decreased 4.6% for the quarter, in part due to the residual effects of consumer sensitivity
around the supply chain issue in the chicken industry, even though our supply chain was not implicated. A diverse
menu across multiple day parts, menu offerings and price tiers enables us to offer a broad variety of affordable choices,
which is especially critical in the current environment across Asia.

During the quarter, limited-time offers, including the Mashed Potato Beef Burger and the Sausage Double Beef Burger
positively contributed to performance. We're also complementing our new menu news in China with meaningful efforts
to make McDonald's even more accessible to our customers. We continue to strategically add new restaurants, with a
focus on Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, where we're best able to effectively leverage our scale and our marketing strength.
Throughout APMEA, we're expanding our presence by building on the potential that exists in our brand extensions,
especially delivery, kiosk, McCafé and drive-thru. As of March, about 50% of our restaurants are open 24 hours and
almost 20% offer delivery service to our customers.
As we continue to build on our firm foundation in every area of the world, our commitment to financial discipline has
not wavered. We have a healthy balance sheet, the highest credit rating in the industry and a robust business that
generated $7 billion in cash from operations last year.
Our philosophy regarding the use of cash remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business to
capitalize on our long-term growth opportunities. These include strategically developing new restaurants in certain
markets, modernizing our restaurants so they're more relevant and appealing to our customers and investing in
initiatives, like multiple order points or mobile ordering, that increase the capacity and the convenience of our existing
restaurants. After reinvesting in the business, our second use of cash is our dividend. Our third and final use of cash is
share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases.
In closing, we recognize the challenges inherent in the macroeconomic environment and do not expect to see any
significant improvements in the short term. And while comparisons will ease as we move through the year, it is not
likely that the global IEO industry will improve dramatically. This will continue to pressure our performance. Now
more than ever, we remain focused on those areas within our control to grow market share and drive future
performance. We know what we need to do and we're determined to keep getting better at sharing ideas, scaling proven
successes and moving even more quickly to bring winning solutions to markets around the world. I remain confident in
our business. Our System alignment, our strategies, the actions we're taking, position us well to successfully navigate
this environment in the near-term, while profitably managing the business for the long-term.
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Pete.
Peter J. Bensen
Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. The pursuit of long-term profitable growth permeates the McDonald's System and
guides our actions: from the way we staff our restaurants; to the investments we make in infrastructure and technology
to build capacity; to the strategic decisions we make around menu offerings, pricing and promotions.
We entered the year aware of the challenges we faced growing comparable sales and margins, the steep first quarter
lap, flatter declining IEO categories in many of our major markets and cost pressures throughout our P&L. Our
business model is built around growing comparable sales to a level where we can realize margin leverage. When we
don't do that, as in the first quarter, our margins are significantly impacted. The good news is that we have competed
effectively in environments like this before. For now, it is a market share battle and we are determined to continue
making the necessary adjustments to maintain and grow our share, because that is how we will win over the long-term.
There is no single solution for driving sustained growth and value creation. Rather, we are pushing forward on multiple
fronts, guided by the three global growth priorities under our Plan to Win. The adjustments are beginning to take hold.
In first quarter, we out-performed the IEO industry in several key markets, including the U.S., as Don noted earlier.
With 81% of our global restaurants franchised, our profitability is driven primarily by top-line sales. Though total
System-wide sales increased 2% in constant currencies, persistent expense pressures and negative comparable sales
contributed to a 50 basis point decline in first quarter combined operating margin to 29.5%.

The largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which rose $25 million to nearly $1.8
billion, a 2% constant currency increase. Consolidated franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points to 81.7%, due
to higher costs and negative comparable sales.
Global company operated margin dollars declined $58 million to $719 million for the quarter, a 7% decrease in
constant currencies. The margin percent decreased 130 basis points to 16.2%, as average check growth was more than
offset by higher labor, occupancy and other operating costs. We expect margins to continue to be pressured throughout
2013, though margin declines should be less pronounced as sales comparisons ease in upcoming quarters.
In the U.S., company operated margins declined 140 basis points to 17.4%, primarily due to higher labor and other
operating expenses. First quarter commodity costs were relatively flat. We expect increased cost pressure the rest of the
year, with the full year increase in the U.S. grocery basket expected to be 1.5% to 2.5%. In terms of pricing, the U.S.
entered the first quarter at about 1.5%. During the quarter, we replaced about half of the 120 basis points of prior year
price increases that rolled off. We will continue to closely manage our pricing decisions to maintain our value
proposition as we strive to grow traffic and market share.
For the full year, Food Away From Home is projected to increase 2.5% to 3.5%, while Food At Home inflation is
projected to be about 50 basis points higher. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, Food Away From Home was
up 2.3%, while Food At Home was up only 1%.
Turning to Europe, company operated margins decreased 80 basis points to 16.7%, due to higher labor and commodity
costs and increased depreciation related to reimaging. The U.K. and Russia together account for almost half of Europe's
total company operated margin dollars.
Europe's grocery bill was up about 2.5% in the quarter. We expect a similar increase in second quarter, with the full
year increase now projected to be 2.5% to 3.5%, slightly lower than our estimate in January. Across Europe, the
average price increase at the end of first quarter, excluding Russia, was about 1.5%. The sluggish macroeconomic
environment, coupled with the soft IEO market, will limit our pricing power for the balance of the year.
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company operated margins declined 230 basis points to 14.6%, due to the
acceleration of new restaurant openings, mainly in China, along with higher labor, occupancy and other costs
throughout the segment. There is a heightened scrutiny around the quality of new store openings, ensuring that we are
doing everything we can to optimize new store margins in this key growth segment.
G&A for the quarter increased modestly and was in line with our expectations. We are on track for full year G&A to
increase about 2% to 3% in constant currencies, though there will be some variability between quarters. As indicated in
January, the first quarter included a nonrecurring tax benefit of nearly $50 million, resulting in a tax rate of 30%. Our
full year guidance remains at 31% to 33%, which implies the effective tax rates will likely be at the higher end of this
range in subsequent quarters.
We remain committed to generating strong returns and enhancing long-term shareholder value through a balanced
approach to growth, driving sales increases at existing restaurants and adding profitable new units. We continue to
exercise discipline as we allocate capital and make steady progress toward our global growth priority of modernizing
the customer experience through our reimaging efforts. We expect to reimage more than 1,600 restaurants this year,
including about 800 in the U.S., 450 in Europe and 225 in APMEA. Through first quarter, we have completed about
250 reimages globally. In addition, we expect to complete about 200 rebuilds in the U.S. this year.
Opening new units is part of our global growth priority to broaden accessibility to our brand. We focus on strategically
growing a select number of markets that have significant potential and can generate attractive returns over the
long-term. We are on track to open between 1,500 and 1,600 new restaurants this year, including about 500 in affiliated
and developmental license markets.
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted first quarter results by $0.01. At current
rates, which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we expect second quarter EPS to be minimally
impacted, with a full year negative impact of $0.01 to $0.02. As you know, this is directional guidance only, because

rates will change as we move throughout 2013.
The external challenges we face in 2013 are in many ways similar to last year, low consumer confidence and shrinking
disposable income negatively impacting consumer demand, coupled with continued pressure across many expense
categories. We believe we have made the appropriate adjustments to fortify our near-term performance and we remain
diligent about monitoring the environment and making further adjustments as we move throughout the year.
I am confident in the future of our great brand. McDonald's has increasingly modern restaurants in outstanding
locations around the world, best-in-class franchisees and suppliers and dedicated company employees, all aligned to
drive long-term, enduring, profitable growth for our System and shareholders.
Thanks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.
Chris Stent
Thanks, Pete. I will now open the call for analyst and investor questions.
Q&A
<A - Chris Stent>: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from David Palmer of UBS.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Good morning, guys. A two-part question on Europe, what – you described there was a
slowing going on in that market. How are you – can you just generally describe how your marketing plans are this
year? How are you going to adjust to this sluggish environment? I recall, last summer you were tinkering with Value
Menus, particularly in mainland Europe markets. And secondly, as you're getting closer to the end of this reimaging
curve, at least on the interiors in Europe, would you consider or are you thinking about re-franchising that market
further to be maybe more like the U.S.? Thanks very much.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, David, and good morning to you. There are several different points, I guess, in your
question there. First of all, what have we done in Europe? Last year, we began to talk about a couple of the markets that
we felt we needed to have additional focus on, those markets being France and Germany. We talked about the fact that
the Southern division of Europe was really going through tough macro economies and that remains the same today.
However, what we have done is in the market of France, we have changed and fortified our value offerings. We talked
about Casse Croute this morning. They've solidified Petit Plaisirs. They've done several things and that's why we're
gaining share in France. If you look at the Southern division, the Southern division as a market, which includes Spain
and Italy and Portugal, those markets are also gaining share. So we have been performing – we're performing well
relative to the overall marketplace. However, it is very soft consumer confidence there.
Relative to re-franchising, what we have continued to do, as we always do, is look at our overall company operated
portfolio and determine whether or not we have opportunities to continue to improve that first, or if we have
opportunities in terms of leveraging G&A, leveraging scale, improving overall operational efficiency by re-franchising.
We have one market we continue to look at some of that in, which is the U.K., but the other markets we feel fairly good
about the way that the portfolio is stacked up at this point in time.
<A - Chris Stent>: Okay, next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Joe Buckley>: Hi. Thank you. Can you talk about your comments about gaining share in the first quarter,
particular the U.S.? What you think the gap between your comp number and the QSR sector might have been? And
then extend that into April, I guess the April sales commentary is a little bit more surprising, given the easier
comparison. So could you just talk about factors that you think are influencing the April sales number?
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, Joe. I think we're talking probably a couple different things. One, it will be from a U.S.
perspective and the other is really a global perspective. In the U.S., if you look at our comparisons to the overall
competitive set, we've outperformed the competition by about 1.4%. That's the comp gap. And so we – and that's the

overall competitive set, so we feel again that the things that we have begun to do to bring energy to the marketplace in
both food and value, they are solidified. They are in place. Having said that, and we normally don't talk about weather
at all, but we know in the month of April, last quarter – or the first quarter of last year, we saw very favorable weather.
Matter of fact, it was the best weather that we had seen in 118 years, the first quarter through March of last year. This
year, what we're seeing in the month of – or the first quarter, was some tougher weather. We also in April, clearly,
we're seeing some differences in weather. So we have to be cognizant of that. We won't use weather as an excuse,
because next year we don't want to use it. We're going to be comping up against it, but the reality of it is we have seen
some things in weather that are there. We still feel like, from a competitive set, we're going to perform well and our
marketing plans and our food promotions actually are really solid. We have brought better food news and stronger
value to the marketplace.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Keith Siegner of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Keith Siegner>: Thanks. Just to follow-up on that question a little bit, thinking through the headline global April
outlook and how some of these issues in China and other parts of Asia might be factoring in. There's a big information
vacuum right now about what's actually going on in China with chicken and other countries that might be influencing
that. If you could talk a little bit about what might you actually be seeing there and how that plays into the preliminary
global April outlook, that'd be very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Donald Thompson>: All right, Keith. I'm going to ask Tim Fenton to talk a little bit about China, because as we
talk about global, our overall global sales, in terms of April, there are some things that have been emerging pieces that
we've seen that we had not seen before. One of those is avian influenza and I'll ask Tim to give a little update on that
and maybe even talk just a little bit about we're coming out of one thing, which was the chicken industry issues around
antibiotics, and now we have a different piece, which is broader in impact, which is the avian influenza. And so, that
does bear on our global sales as we look forward into April, so, Tim, if you would?
<A - Tim Fenton>: Sure. And, Keith, good morning. Yeah, on China, as we've stated, we had a sales decline of 4.6%
in the first quarter. Going up against a tough first quarter last year as far as high comp, but definitely we saw a switch
out of chicken consumption. Fortunately, we do have other proteins that we were able to shift people into. But as we
were coming out of that and gaining some traction, obviously, came the avian influenza, which we've been there before
unfortunately, and it not only has it had an impact on China, it does have a potential impact on a lot of APMEA, not
just China. But again, we continue to move on the different proteins that we have, with beef and fish, and, of course,
breakfast in McCafé. But we're moving with it. We're doing what we have. We're continuing to look at the – what we
do in the restaurants from a food safety and with our suppliers. And we've been there before and we'll continue to move
forward with our plan.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question, Matt DiFrisco of Lazard.
<Q - Matthew DiFrisco>: Thank you. I guess, just touching on some of those food promotions that, Don, you were
talking about earlier, relative to prior years, I guess a lot of people have looked at in the success of your beverage
product, it had multiple years in sustainability, and the impressiveness of lapping big comps and putting up big comps
on top of that. Are you seeing the same, I guess, in this environment of more food promotional, it seems like it – they're
a little bit more of an LTO-ish type environment, or a sense that you're not maybe holding the comp as much. Are they
– are you happy with that, as far as how long you're holding the lift from those new introductions, such as the Fish
Bites and some of the Premium Chicken Wraps?
<A - Donald Thompson>: Matt, great question. I think, two different parts here, one is the LTO strategy, and the other
is those things that might become platforms and continue to be part of our core. So if you look at McWraps, McWraps
for us is not a limited-time offer promotion. It is one of those things that will be a platform for McDonald's as we move
forward. It's been that way in Europe and performed well. We are – we feel that the performance at these early stages in
the U.S. has met the expectations that we have. And so, we're feeling fairly good about that.
I continue to say, and I hedge a little bit on my comments about, we continue to feel great about it, because let's keep in
mind, we're still facing a slow recovery in the United States from an overall economic perspective. And as we look

across Europe, we still have high unemployment rates and higher austerity measures. But in the U.S., that is a platform,
something a little different, Fish McBites, that's a limited-time offer. So we'll have that come in and go out. When you
talk about beverages, we will continue to pulse in beverage products that remind our customers of the overall beverage
line-up. So when we say Blueberry Pomegranate as a smoothie flavor, we're also saying that we're going to remind
customers of Pineapple Mango and Strawberry Banana. So we'll continue to do that and do it more aggressively this
year than we did last year.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Kelter>: So your restaurant level margins now appear to be on pace for their third straight year of
declines in all three divisions, in the U.S., in Europe and in Asia. And so, I guess there are two parts to my question on
that point. The first is, what are the specific things you're doing to turn that around or is it really just waiting for
same-store sales to get better? And second, how have the franchisees reacted to declining profit margins at their
restaurants?
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Michael, it's Pete. As we've always talked, that for us, margins are much more of a top-line
game, so driving comps is critical to driving those margins. And in this environment, where you continue to have the
cost pressures, so commodities will be up, labor rates are going up, et cetera, and yet you have soft economics,
declining to flat eating out markets, that battle for market share becomes so critical to the long-term health of the
business, that we're willing to sacrifice a little bit of margin to maintain that traffic and grow the market share. So in
this environment, that's how we're going to continue to go after that.
And around the world, we're generally aligned with our franchisees around that. They understand the importance of
driving traffic in this environment and taking market share, because, again, if the industry isn't growing, taking market
share means we're taking guests from other restaurants. And in that environment, that is what we have to do to continue
to win. Would we love higher margin? Yes. Would they love higher cash flow? Yes. But in this environment, guest
count growth and market share growth are critical.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from John Glass at Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thanks. Pete, just – as you think about last year and this year, to the point there's a tougher
environment, earnings growth is slower, margins are under pressure, one of the things you have is a balance sheet that's
historically been very strong in the cash flow which you're using. But can you just re-examine, what are the likelihood
of you using this very low-rate environment to increase leverage, maybe without even changing your credit metrics? In
other words, maybe the rates are just low enough that you can add to debt without changing your interest expense.
And secondarily, can you talk about maybe just rethinking what the credit metrics you look at and are they appropriate
given this environment? And maybe you'd like to extend them. If you could just maybe help us understand, what is the
credit metric you look at and you manage to? And then secondarily, if you're willing to re-examine that.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: John, that's a great question. One of the things we've always talked about is the importance of
maintaining our single-A credit rating, so not going to get into the specific measures that underlie that. But as we look
at our role as the franchisor, that financial strength is critical for us. And you're aware of our business model. Being
co-invested with our franchisees and part of that three legged stool is a critical piece for us. So that credit rating is
important. And we feel the alignment created by maintaining that strong credit rating and our financial health is more
valuable to shareholders than some kind of one-time leverage event would be.
That being said, as you've noticed each of the last few years, we continue to augment our free cash flow return to
shareholders by increasing the debt on our balance sheet. And we will continue to do that again this year, but my guess
is it will probably be at a level below what we added last year.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good morning. Just to follow-up on all the margin commentary and the pressures that
you're seeing, Pete, could you give us an idea of what type of comp would be needed to hold onto either the restaurant
margins or at the EBIT, company-wide EBIT margin, for this year and maybe talk a little bit about how the greater

emphasis on value is maybe changing or not changing that equation?
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Yeah, David, we've historically said 2% to 3% comp would allow us to hold margin. And
we've kind of said that's in a normal environment and we've defined that as being commodity costs in that 2% to 3%
range, but also getting half of that growth from average check and half of that growth from guest count. So, when
you're in an environment today where we're going from more of the sales growth is coming from guest counts than it is
from check growth, that puts pressure on that equation. And we're seeing other cost increases in the labor line,
additional depreciation, et cetera, that are – that weren't in our normal environment kind of calculation, which
obviously points to a higher than 2% to 3% comp in this environment to maintain or grow the margins.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hey, David, just another point, keep in mind please, too, also, that the value aspect of our
menu is still in the range of 10% to 15%. So we haven't seen some huge upsurge relative to the mix of value-based
products. The reason that you've heard us talk so much about product mix and new food news is because one of the
things that we are doing around the world is ensuring that we have promotional food and new food that also is accretive
to overall cash flow in the restaurants. And that also helps us quite a bit and that helps us to move average check.
A challenge that we have, and we talked about it in our earlier comments, is the fact that if inflation is not as high, we
don't have as much pricing power. And so when you think about the overall margin, clearly, it's still demand which we
focus on that demand base. It's still the average check components. Pricing is a little softer in terms of what we can take
and it's then the trade-up aspects, which is why we focus on the new menu aspects in our core and those larger
sandwiches. So we're managing all of that and Tim is ensuring that around the world those things are part of our plans.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.
<Q - Will E. Slabaugh>: Yeah, thanks, guys. I had a question on the product pipeline and you mentioned a couple of
items that you rolled out recently, but wondered just more broadly, how you describe your pipeline now in terms of
breadth of products and then also in the length of the timeline for rolling them out, versus last year and then also maybe
versus historically, if you would. Thank you.
<A - Donald Thompson>: I would, and I'll ask Tim to also comment about some of the things that he's seeing in some
of the product pipelines around the world. I would tell you today, our product pipeline is more robust from a global
perspective. And the other aspect of this is we are moving products around the world at a much quicker pace, which is
also evidenced in one of the questions earlier about limited-time offers. It may appear that we have more of those, only
because you're seeing some of the new food news that's been coming from different markets around the world. But
there's several products and platforms and product areas that we have felt – we feel like we're in a pretty strong place
with, continue to develop, but, Tim, maybe some of the things you've seen across Europe and now in the U.S.
<A - Tim Fenton>: Sure. One of the strategies we had, it's really all the new products coming in in 2013, to have at
least 40% to 50% of them coming from our existing new product pipeline. Great products travel well across different
borders and I think a good example is the McWraps right now, that are going in in the U.S., of course, to go in in
Canada shortly. You compare second quarter this year in the U.S. to last year, we've got a very robust product line with
the McWraps, the Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothie coming in. But we're also seeing smoothies travel across the
System, and test in many countries in APMEA, as well as in Europe. So I think overall, our overall product
development, we're doing more with existing products we had in different countries and really scaling those and we're
finding out that great products travel real easily across different country borders.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.
<Q - Michael Tamas>: Thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. Just had a follow-up on an earlier question, can you
just talk about the food margin going forward? Should we expect the same kind of leverage that we saw this quarter or
since inflation is going to pick up a little bit in the out quarters versus 1Q, would that actually look like a little
deleverage here? Thanks.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Hey, Mike, it's Pete. In my remarks, I addressed that. We don't typically give margin forecasts.
But we think the decline of 130 basis points in this first quarter is about as bad as it's going to get this year and that

subsequent quarters we should see declines that aren't that severe.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein at Barclays.
<Q - Jeff Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you very much. Just two actual follow-ups on answers you previously
gave, one, I was just wondering, Pete, you talked about the balance sheet and taking on incremental debt over the past
couple of years. I'm just wondering how you think about the balance of the dividend versus the share repo, it seems like
dividend is higher up on the hierarchy. So I'm wondering why – whether that's considered to boost that significantly.
And then the other follow-up was just the market share comment you guys made in terms of the U.S., I'm wondering if
you can lay that in terms of how it looks in Europe. It sounds like U.K. and Russia might be slowing a little bit. We
know Germany and France was already softer. So I'm just wondering whether your peers are suffering more than you
or how you look at the gap between yourselves and them. Thanks.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Jeff, regarding the use of cash, nothing's changed in our philosophy, so after we invest in the
business, we commence to returning all free cash flow to shareholders over time. And the dividend is our first priority
and continues to be. And when you look at, we talked – going back to my earlier comment when you talk about our
credit metrics, one of the rating agencies looks at that dividend as a fixed commitment. So as we continue to increase
that dividend, that's kind of added to our existing credit on our balance sheet, which is one of the things that they limit
to our rating in one of the agency's models.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hey, Jeff, and relative to market share, if you looked at our top set of markets, we are flat to
growing share in six of the seven. So, and this is something that we feel – and again, I hesitate to use the word
comfortable, because we're not comfortable with our results, but we feel that the plans are appropriate that our markets
have put in place. And so we have actually been trending positively relative to gaining market share around the world.
And we know our plans are stronger in 2013.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Jeff Omohundro of Davenport.
<Q - Jeff Floyd Omohundro>: Thanks. Just wondering if you could discuss the domestic reimaging program, both in
terms of results versus expectations and the pacing of the reimage program. Does this macro environment impact
franchisees' receptivity to it? How do you think about that through the balance of the year?
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Yeah, Jeff, we think we're going to do about another 800 reimages this year in the U.S. That'll
– as of the end of the year or as of the end of the quarter here, we've got about roughly 40% of the U.S. done, interiors
and exteriors. And that 800 that we have in the pipeline this year, those are committed, signed up, deals that we have in
the pipeline. So we have a pretty good line of visibility into that. And while, again, to my earlier comments, we'd love
to see margins growing and sales growing at a faster rate, but these reimage decisions are longer-term, longer-term
business building decisions and not an individual quarter or two type decision. So we can't turn them on and turn them
off on a dime and I think it's important that we continue to make progress on those.
<A - Tim Fenton>: Jeff, this is Tim. Four weeks ago, the U.S. just had their combined manager and operator rally.
They have in every other year out in Vegas, where you have – you bring together over 18,000 Owner/Operators and
managers and staff. I attended one of those and I can tell you that the interest and the energy on reimaging is as high as
it's ever been, a lot of positive comments, a lot of momentum going into it, so nothing has – the energy has not waned
off at all. If anything, it's moving forward.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Jason West of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jason T. West>: Yeah, thank you, guys. Just going back to the question around the IEO markets around the
world, I just want to understand the comments there. Are you guys saying that you've seen another leg down in sort of
the overall macro in certain places, like the U.K. and Russia or is it just sort of stabilized at a low level, if you could
talk a bit more about the trend there? And when do we lap kind of the slowdown that we saw last year? Does that – has
that happened yet in some of your core markets or is that really something that we haven't lapped yet and we could get
to that maybe May, June timeframe?

<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, Jason. Just a couple pieces on the IEO, so if you're looking at overall IEO projections in
terms of 2013, of those same seven markets that I talked about, four out of those seven markets are contracting. When
you expand that outside of the top seven markets into, say, the top 20 markets, you have another host of markets that
are flat or contracting. So we've got quite a few markets that where we see the IEO not growing at what we would
consider to be an aggressive pace or a more healthy pace. Even those that are growing typically are growing maybe in
the one percentile range.
And so IEO has been soft in terms of growth. Having said that, we realize that our growth is going to come from taking
market share and our plans, whether they be value-based, whether they be new product-based, the operational
execution, satisfying the needs of customers each and every day, opening up our operating hours and windows, all of
those things are fashioned at us capturing more market share.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Andy Barish of Jefferies.
<Q - Andy M. Barish>: Hey, guys. A quick question, just trying to get a sense of recent trends, it seems as if mix was
negative and then if you kind of look at the first quarter numbers where you talked about negative traffic and pricing of
roughly 1.5 points or maybe a little bit more, it seems like mix was flat to maybe even a little bit positive, even with the
re-emphasized value focus. Is there something that's changed here or something additional that I'm missing?
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Andy, it's Pete. The mix across kind of all of the three major geographies was down slightly as
– in the first quarter. So we had, as you indicated, we had the price, which was positive. We had a slight drag from mix
and the slight drag from the guest counts.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Mitch Speiser of Buckingham Research.
<Q - Mitch J. Speiser>: Great. Thanks very much. And just want to ask a question about the global IEO market,
whether it's the top 10 markets that you're in or the top 20. When we think about it, is it just purely cyclical as the
reason why it's flat to declining? Could you maybe talk about if there's any structural issues, as well? It just seems like
eating out is – seems to be what people do as economies improve, yet the economies are soft, but if there's any
competitive issues or any structural issues that are limiting the global eating out market from growing. Thanks.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, Mitch. I don't know if I would call them structural. I would call them basically just
human behavior and consumer behavior. Consumer confidence is down in many of the markets around the world and,
as a result, when consumer confidence is down, clearly, then discretionary spending is typically down. And so when we
look at: whether it be, again, the U.S., with slower recovery; if we look at the last retail sales reports that we had, those
being softer; GDP revisions around the world across Europe; still high unemployment rates across Europe, particularly
teen unemployment rates; many of these things are the reasons that as we went through last year, we talked about trying
to solidify our value messages last year, so that as we came into this year we would not see further erosion, to Pete's
point earlier.
Having said that, we still need top-line, basically to help us deliver in terms of the margin, as Pete pointed out earlier,
but there's nothing structural, I would say. It's just consumer confidence is softer. The only thing that is outside of that
is when you look across APMEA and you look at 60% to 70% of our consumers in that geography favor chicken as a
protein, particularly in markets like China and Japan, some of those Asian markets. And you have scares like avian
influenza or antibiotic issues and food safety issues, then, clearly, that impacts our business. But those are shorter-term
impacts. They're not structural, as well. So I think what we're faced with is whether or not overall local economies and
macro economies will start to trend better. When that begins to happen, we're in a good position to benefit from it.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeff D. Farmer>: Great. Thanks. Sorry to do this, but I did want to take another crack at margins. It looks like the
U.S. has seen something like three consecutive quarters of, I guess, roughly 140 basis points of pressure. I'm just
curious what color you can provide on the pressure resulting from things like the heightened focus on promoting value,
softer same-store sales, even the commodity and labor pressure. And I guess the ultimate question here is which of
those three have had the greatest influence on that margin pressure?

<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Jeff, as Don alluded to this earlier, the value component of our sales in the U.S. continues to be
at a relatively similar position. So it's not as if our Dollar Menu percentage has gone from 13% to 14% to 20%. It's
remained relatively stable. What you do see sometimes in these softer economic environments is a little bit in the mix.
So I mentioned the product mix was slightly negative to the sales. But we do have a fixed cost base in there and if you
aren't generating the comparable sales, the fixed costs from our management labor, from our depreciation, from our
third-party rent, that obviously is impacted. And if you look through the categories, there's not one of those expense
categories that particularly jumps out as being so much more significantly larger than any of the others. So across all of
those kind of categories I mentioned, 10 to 20 basis point impact when they're all going the same direction, because
you can't leverage the comps, that's where you get the larger pressure.
<A - Donald Thompson>: And Jeff, if you – going back to Pete's comments earlier, relative to price, he mentioned
that one of the price increases from last year at about 120 basis points came off. We replaced that with about a 60 basis
point. The reason for that is because consumers are very sensitive to price. And so we don't have the inflationary
environment or the consumer sentiment environment to go out and take the same kind of price increases that
historically we did. We do believe that this is not a structural kind of a change. We think that it is based upon the
economy at this point.
The second point I'd make is when we think about trade-ups, things like McWraps, products like McWrap, thus far, in
the month of April, and as we've launched this product, we've been driving awareness. So you are seeing a lot of things
in the marketplace with $2.00 McWraps and different things to try to get those in the hands and mouths of customers.
As we move forward, it goes to the full price, which is in the $4.00 range. So while we may not get the same unit
movement, we will have and see a little bit better margin on that product. So these are all of the things that go in the
hopper as we continue to manage both margins and also sales success without having guest count erosion.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Hi. Thank you. Just a – I think a slightly different take on what's been a pretty consistent
theme overall on margins, there's a really interesting sentence in – actually in basically the front of your press release
that says the U.S. is focused on menu and convenience initiatives to drive sales and restaurant profitability. And it's that
restaurant profitability piece that I think is interesting, because it almost suggests that you plan on growing restaurant
profitability in 2013 in the U.S., while increasing attention on the Dollar Menu and especially increasing attention on
the Dollar Menu with some of your competitors have by definition backed off. So that's something I want to get a sense
of is, did franchisees push back on you saying that the 2012 store level cash flow is something that they don't want to
see go down any more? That's kind of the first point. And then secondly, I was just thinking about from a company
store perspective, from a McOpCo perspective, do you think 2013 is a year of investment on the consumer to allow
margins to go down willingly or should we expect at the end of the year that restaurant profitability can actually be up?
<A - Donald Thompson>: I'll ask Pete to touch base on both points relative to cash flows and also just the overall
notion on restaurant profitability.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Yeah, John, actually, in 2012, Owner/Operator cash flow was up in the U.S. So this is not –
what we tried to convey with that comment was the fact that while, yes, it is a market share battle out there and we
know that growing traffic in that environment is very important and we know that price sensitivity is a little greater, at
the end of the day, we've got a line-up of products over the summer and the rest of the year that have the potential to
improve where we are relative to the first quarter.
So, again, in my remarks, I said that, while the margin declined 130 basis points in the first quarter, we expect as we
move throughout the year that the decline should be less severe. That, in part, is driven by the expectation also that the
sales comparisons get easier.
So implying that we expect, because of the sales comparisons easing, we'll get a little bit more of that top-line leverage
and we're not at a point where we're going to say that we're going to get enough leverage that's actually going to grow
the margins. But it's still going to continue to be a market share battle and we feel good, as Don said, about our product
line-up and our ability to drive some more sales.

<A - Tim Fenton>: And, John, this is Tim. Just to add, with the new products coming with wraps and beverage and
breakfast, all higher margins for us, as well as focus on beef going on for the second half of the year, all higher-margin
products.
<A - Chris Stent>: Next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you. Just two follow-ups, if I may, one is on the top-line, and it was something I think
that Pete just said about the idea that improving trends against easier comparisons. We didn't really see that in April,
even though comparisons, I think, got substantially easier than in March, and I guess I wanted to talk about when you –
framing that in that context. So I guess what I'm hearing is that comparisons get easier, we wouldn't expect to see a
symmetrical bounce back versus last year, but maybe just some incremental improvement sequentially. I just wanted to
clarify that outlook.
And then the second follow-up was on China. Some of the margin pressure in APMEA, obviously, is coming from new
unit growth in China. I would have thought, with the push towards more developmental license and franchising, that we
would – that that would diminish. Is that a reasonable expectation going forward or is that drag going to persist for a
while?
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, Sara. I'll take a shot at the first part and than Pete will answer the second part of your
question. So relative to April, here's the things that we're seeing out there. We understand the existing issues that have
been there. We understand that the slower recoveries I mentioned earlier. We understand some of the more consistent
macroeconomic pressures that pressure consumer confidence. So as we have rolled through the first quarter and as we
move into April, we expect some of the high comps that we have, we're rolling across those. So on that hand, we feel
better about the overall environment moving forward. Having said that, those macroeconomic pressures still persist and
we're seeing emerging issues that pop up, things like, again we mentioned, avian influenza. We're continuing to see
some of the unemployment levels that have continued to increase. Some of the economies are worsening a bit, i.e.,
France. I mean, they're seeing the worst economy since World War II.
So we're seeing certain aspects that are worsening a little bit. What does it mean for us? It simply means that the exact
plans that we have today, we have to focus on those and focus even harder, and we've got those inherent in the plans
that we have around the world. So we see some positives that are occurring. We see some potential negatives that are
occurring and ours is just to continue to emphasize the plans that we have in place to be able to continue to drive
consumers – or bring consumers in the restaurant and drive business performance forward.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: And, Sara, regarding the new store margins and our franchisees, we only have 151 of our
restaurants franchised in China. So compared to our base of over 1,700, so it's less than 10% of our restaurants are
franchised there. So, while, yes, directionally that is a positive, it's still, relative to the base, not going to be a significant
driver. But as I mentioned, there is a lot of work going on around what is the optimal cost to operate those new
restaurants.
So as we look at the investment levels, making sure that we're sizing the investment for the current sales opportunity,
yet leaving the flexibility there to build for future demand as those trade areas grow. So that's – it's getting a lot of focus
and attention. And as we – as you know, with comps being negative in the quarter, that it's a continued drag, not only
on the new stores, but on all the stores there.
<A - Chris Stent>: We have time for one more question, which will be from R.J. Hottovy of Morningstar.
<Q - R. J. Hottovy>: Thanks, guys. Just wanted to ask a quick question about APMEA, and specifically, Japan, really,
in your mind, what will it take to get that market turned around, especially now that we're lapping about two years of
negative results in the territory, as well as some reports of some price increases in the region? Just wanted to get a sense
of your outlook for Japan, in particular.
<A - Tim Fenton>: Yeah, this is Tim, R.J. First of all, as you know, Japan has been one of our most difficult IEO
markets, as far as negative IEO. We took it on as a special project, just going in and really evaluating and segmenting
our business. We have revamped our value campaigns, our product lines, and actually have seen a good trending for us.

It's trending up in the last couple months, as you'll read soon. As far as the pricing, I think what you may have read and
that was a little bit taken out of context, we are adjusting some prices on our value menu, if you will, bringing up a
hamburger and a cheeseburger, at the same time, balancing out and bringing down the price of regular fry and some
other products. I think the overall price increase, and we haven't taken a price increase since 2008, was just a little over
1%, blended, but a very difficult market. We are encouraged what we're seeing, as of late, on changing some of the
trajectory of the business.

All right. We're about out of time, so I'll turn it over to Don, who has a few closing comments.
Donald Thompson
Well, thanks, everyone, again, for participating with us this morning. And as we wrap up the call, again, really want to
appreciate the questions and your thoughts in support of the business. We remain committed to our long-term
strategies, as we make thoughtful and strategic decisions to mitigate what we hopefully have informed you of, relative
to short-term pressures in these challenging times.
Notwithstanding these pressures we're experiencing today, we remain very confident in our future. We have defensible
competitive advantages, a resilient business model, and the alignment across our Owner/Operators, suppliers and the
company teams, to drive enduring and profitable growth for the long-term for our System and our shareholders, despite
some of the challenges that are being represented and we see around the world.
So we remain confident and, again, thanks for your participation this morning and have a great day, everyone.
