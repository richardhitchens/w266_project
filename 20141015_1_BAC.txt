Good morning. Thanks, everybody, on the phone as well as the webcast for joining us this morning for our third quarter
results. Hopefully you've had a chance to review the earnings release documents available on our website.
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you we may make some forward-looking statements
today. For further information on those, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our other
SEC filings.
So with that, let me turn it over to Brian Moynihan, our CEO, for some opening comments before Bruce goes through

Thanks, Lee, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to review our third quarter results.
As you know, our bottom line results were heavily impacted by a previously announced settlement with Department of
Justice. But given that, I'm still encouraged by what we accomplished this quarter. Our businesses generated enough
earnings to absorb the $5.3 billion charge and still reported positive net income before preferred dividends.
Now, the themes we see are consistent with the past several quarters. You can see in our numbers a prudent balance
sheet management. You can see in the numbers good core expense control. You can see in the numbers continued
credit improvement. And you can see in the numbers solid business activity.
Before Bruce takes you through the details of the quarter, I thought I'd focus quickly on the profitability of our business
segments and some of the key statistics that give rise thereto. If you look, we've included in the appendix to the
materials on pages 18 and 20 some information on net income, PPNR and business statistics.
So we step back and look at that, you can see from our release the company reported $2.9 billion in year-to-date pre-tax
net income. That includes and overcomes $15.6 billion in pre-tax litigation costs to resolve primarily legacy mortgage
issues. Now we're not suggesting we want to incur litigation costs going forward, but what this demonstrates is how
much progress we've made behind the noise of significant legal settlements.
So as you step back and think about the businesses, you can see on appendix slide 18 a graphic showing year-to-date
net income comparative performance by the businesses. Let's first focus on our Consumer & Business Banking
segment. Year-to-date net income was $5.3 billion in 2014. That compares to $4.6 billion after-tax in 2013. The return
on average allocated capital in Consumer & Business Banking was 24%. It is our largest business and has had a good
year.
Our Global Wealth & Investment Management business had net income of year-to-date of $2.3 billion in 2014. That's
up 3% from 2013. Now this business, our GWIM business, has a pre-tax margin of 26% and its returns on allocated
capital are 25%.
As we move to our Global Banking business – that's a business that provides lending, treasury services, investment
banking activities to middle market and large corporate clients around the world – that business earned $4 billion
after-tax so far this year, up 8% from 2013, and generated returns on allocated capital of 17%.
Those three businesses together have great annuity streams and hold us in good stead as we look forward.
Our Global Markets business, which obviously was more affected by what's going on in the market on a given quarter,
has earned $2.9 billion after-tax for the first nine months versus $2.7 billion in 2013 when you adjust for DVA and in
2013 you exclude the U.K. tax changes.
So in total, these four businesses generated $14.5 billion net income after-tax for the first nine months of 2014. That
$14.5 billion is up 10% from last year.
You can look on slide 19 and you can see on a pre-tax, pre-provision basis – which some of you also focus on – we're
up 4% year-over-year and you can see on pages 20 and 21 the business statistics over the last couple years which give
rise to these results.
We made real progress in the core businesses and have continued to work on the Consumer Real Estate segment and
losses therein. But that real progress shows in the operating leverage and profitability of these businesses, and we
expect that momentum to continue as we move to other side of the mortgage issues.
With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce R. Thompson
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. This quarter does reflect what we believe is very solid execution and a lot
of what we've been consistently talking with all of you about. We maintained a strong balance sheet as a foundation to

operate from. We continued to rationalize our balance sheet for liquidity, profitability, as well as evolving regulatory
changes. Our revenue has shown relative stability and our non-litigation expenses continued to be reduced. Charge-offs
have continued to come down and we resolved significant legacy mortgage exposures during the quarter.
Let's start on slide 2 and go through the details. We recorded $168 million of earnings in the third quarter, and after
preferred dividends that resulted in a loss of $0.01 per share. Earnings included the $5.3 billion pre-tax impact of the
settlement with the Department of Justice and various state attorneys general that we announced in August. On an EPS
basis, the impact was $0.43 a share as a portion of this charge was not tax-deductible.
As you can see on the right-hand side of slide 2, the $5.3 billion impact was split between $4.9 billion in litigation
expense and $400 million in provision expense that relate to additional reserves that are associated with the consumer
relief portion of the settlement.
Revenue during the quarter on an FTE basis was $21.4 billion versus $21.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. If we
exclude the DVA impact from both periods as well as the $1.2 billion of equity investment income that we recorded
during the third quarter of 2013 that was driven by gains from our CCB investment, adjusted revenue of $21.2 billion
was up slightly from the third quarter of 2013. On a segment view, revenue was stable to modestly up in four of our
five businesses from last year, with CRES being the exception.
Relative to the second quarter of 2014, revenue was 3% lower driven by the lack of equity investment gains, seasonally
lower investment banking fees and lower mortgage banking revenue.
Total non-interest expense was $19.7 billion, which included $5.6 billion in total litigation expense. If we back out
litigation expense, compared to the second quarter of 2014 expenses declined roughly $400 million from both our New
BAC and our LAS cost initiatives as well as lower revenue-related incentives. On the same basis, looking back to the
third quarter of 2013, expenses improved by $1.1 billion, or 7%, which were driven by reduced LAS costs and, to a
lesser degree, our New BAC cost savings.
Provision for credit losses during the quarter was $636 million and included $400 million, as I mentioned, for the DOJ
settlement, while our net charge-offs were $1 billion.
Our results during the quarter did benefit from roughly $200 million in DVA, or about $0.01 per share, as our debt
spread widened during the end of the quarter. There was also approximately $0.04 of benefit to earnings that relate to
certain discrete tax items.
Lastly, the quarter also benefited by about $0.01 as our weighted average share count excluded the impact of diluted
shares given the financial performance.
On slide three, we show you all of the usual balance sheet highlights that we do each quarter, but we did want to focus
you specifically on our efforts to rationalize the balance sheet as our actions led to a $47 billion decrease from the
second quarter of 2014. We took prudent actions to increase liquidity as well as to reduce both credit and market risk.
We shifted the mix of some of our discretionary assets out of less liquid loans into more liquid debt securities.
For example, we converted $6.5 billion of residential mortgage loans that benefited from standby insurance agreements
into agency securities. We also sold $2.5 billion of non-performing and delinquent loans during the quarter and had $4
billion of net paydowns in our legacy Consumer Real Estate loans. We reduced our Global Markets balance sheet and
associated funding by $11.7 billion from the second quarter of 2014, and that included low-margin prime brokerage
loans of approximately $3.3 billion.
Our decline in quarter-end deposits was primarily driven by optimization efforts that included the reduction of
approximately $15 billion of deposits that had little to no benefit to our LCR ratio.
From a capital perspective, I'll remind you that we did issue $3.1 billion of preferred stock during the quarter that
improved our Basel III Tier 1 regulatory capital ratio. And lastly, as a reminder, we increased our quarterly common
dividend to $0.05 a share during the quarter.

If we move to slide four, where we show our capital ratios under Basel III, under the transition rules, our CET1 ratio
was stable at 12%. If we look at our Basel III regulatory capital ratios on a fully phased-in basis, you can see CET1
capital declined $1.6 billion. That was driven by a $1 billion decline in OCI. Our operational risk-weighted assets did
increase. That negatively impacted our advanced levels but not the standard levels. Other RWA balance sheet
improvement benefited both approaches, and that partially offset the increase in RWA under the advanced approach.
If we look at the ratios under the standardized approach, CET1 improved slightly to 9.6% during the third quarter of
2014. And under the advanced approach, the CET1 ratio was also at 9.6%, both well above our 8.5% 2019 proposed
minimum requirements. If you look at our operational risk-weighted assets under the advanced approach, they now
represent approximately 30% of our overall risk-weighted assets.
If we move to supplementary leverage, this is the first quarter that we've actually disclosed the actual ratios from a
supplementary leverage perspective. The bank holding company during the third quarter was at 5.5%. And if we look at
our primary banking subsidy, BANA, its ratio was 6.8%, which is pro forma for September 30 as we merged FIA, our
card services unit, into BANA on October 1.
We're obviously very pleased with the capital and supplementary leverage ratios in the context of the resolution of the
DOJ matter during the quarter.
If we turn to slide five, we feel very good about the work that the funding team did during the quarter. In addition to the
$3.1 billion preferred stock issuance, we issued $3 billion of Tier 2 subordinated debt, which also adds to our total
capital metrics. Lastly, we issued $4.5 billion of straight debt at the parent.
Our goal was not only to build the Basel III non-CET1 component of the capital stack that we thought were levels that
were appropriate, but also to build liquidity in advance of the payments that we'll make during the month of October for
the DOJ and the state AG settlement.
Total long-term debt for the quarter ended at $250 billion, which was down $7 billion from the end of the second
quarter of 2014. If we look at the cost of our debt, our long-term debt yields improved 10 basis points from the second
quarter of 2014, due primarily to maturities of higher-yielding debt as well as issuances at more favorable levels.
Global excess liquidity sources remained very strong at $429 billion, and our time to required funding was stable at 38
months.
If we turn to slide 6, net interest income on a reported FTE basis was $10.4 billion, up from the second quarter of 2014,
as we had a less negative impact from market-related adjustments, and that was coupled with modest improvements in
our adjusted net interest income. The market-related adjustments during the quarter were a negative $55 million in the
third quarter of 2014. That compares to a negative $175 million in the second quarter of 2014.
Net interest income of $10.5 billion, excluding the market-related adjustment, improved modestly as lower long-term
debt balances and yield as well as an extra day of interest accruals were partially offset by lower loan balances as well
as lower loan yields.
The net interest yield improved four basis points on an adjusted basis and seven basis points on an actual basis. We
continue to remain positioned to benefit as interest rates move higher, particularly from the short end of the curve.
Since we're largely done at this point with our debt footprint reductions, the direction as well as the trajectory of our net
interest income and net interest yield will be more dependent on rates as well as balance sheet movements going
forward. And given the volatility of the rates, should the opportunity present itself, we could decide to take actions to
reduce OCI risk in preparation for what we will be in an eventual rising rate environment. Those actions could have a
relatively small near-term impact to net interest income but reduce our duration risk as well as to provide additional
liquidity to reinvest in a higher rate environment.
Non-interest expense on slide seven was $19.7 billion in the third quarter of 2014 and included $5.6 billion of litigation
expense. As I previously mentioned, $4.9 million (sic) [$4.9 billion] of the expense related to the DOJ settlement, while
the remainder was associated with a number of smaller pre-existing cases, one of which caused us to book

approximately $200 million in our Global Markets business.
If we exclude litigation, total expenses were $14.2 billion this quarter, which declined $400 million from the second
quarter of 2014 on both our New BAC as well as our LAS initiatives as well as lower revenue-related incentive cost.
Compared to the third quarter of 2013, expenses are $1.1 billion lower, driven by LAS cost savings.
Our Legacy Assets & Servicing costs, once again ex-litigation, reduced by approximately $100 million in the quarter
and remain on track to hit $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2015.
In the third quarter, we've now reached our New BAC savings initiatives, with a targeted goal of $2 billion a quarter or
$8 billion on an annualized basis. So as we move forward, we believe that expenses apart from litigation as well as the
continued reductions in Legacy Assets & Servicing expenses should move more directionally with the revenue streams
that we see in the businesses.
Asset quality on slide eight, you can see credit quality continued to improve. Net charge-offs declined slightly from the
second quarter of 2014 to $1 billion, or a 46 basis point net loss ratio, a new decade low.
NPL sales, which I mentioned, produced modest recoveries in both the second quarter of 2014 as well as the third
quarter of 2014. And if we normalize for those benefits, net charge-offs would have been $1.3 billion in the second
quarter of 2014 and $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2014, with the third quarter being about 8% lower.
Delinquencies, a leading indicator of net charge-offs, remain very low. Our third quarter provision expense was $636
million. And we released $407 million of reserves, given the continued pace of asset quality improvement. If we
exclude the reserve that was associated with the DOJ settlement, we released $807 million from our reserves.
Let's now focus on the businesses, starting on slide nine with Consumer & Business Banking. Results again this quarter
showed year-over-year improvement, as our net income grew 4% to $1.9 billion and increased 3% from the second
quarter of 2014. This business generated a 25% return on allocated capital during the third quarter.
Revenue was relatively stable at $7.5 billion compared to the third quarter of 2013 and up from the second quarter of
2014, led by higher card income and service charges for both comparative periods.
As you can see on the slide, Q3 provision expense was lower than the third quarter of 2013, as net charge-offs
improved and we also released less reserves. Expenses of $4 billion were stable compared to both periods, as the
benefits from our network delivery optimization were offset by investments that we made in our specialist sales force.
With regard to the specialist sales force, over the course of the last year we've added nearly 500 financial solutions
advisors and small business bankers.
Growth in mobile as well as other self-service customer touch points has allowed us to continue to reduce our banking
centers, where we went below 5,000 units during the quarter, while at the same time our customer satisfaction scores
continued to improve and customer activity continues to build.
If we look at customer activity during the quarter, we had good deposit growth and our rates paid remain very low. We
experienced modest improvement in average loans on a linked-quarter basis, driven by activity that we saw within the
U.S. consumer credit card business.
Brokerage assets were up 21% year over year, as we benefited from both improved account flows and market
valuation. Our mobile banking customers reached over 16 million during the quarter, and 11% of all of our customer
deposit transactions are now done through mobile devices.
Card issuance remained strong at 1.2 million new accounts in the third quarter of 2014, with 64% of those cards going
to existing customers of our company. And lastly, credit quality continued to improve, as our U.S. credit card loss rate
fell below 3% and where we continue to see north of a 9% risk-adjusted margin.
If we move to Consumer Real Estate Services, as I mentioned, the loss in the quarter was driven by the DOJ settlement
which impacted expense, provision as well as income tax.

Revenue was down about $300 million from the second quarter of 2014. The servicing income component of revenue
was driven by an approximate $100 million charge to adjust our MSR for cost to service assumptions in a smaller
amount as our level of servicing assets did decline. Our production revenue decline was driven by an approximate $80
million increase in rep and warrant expense.
First mortgage retail originations of $11.7 billion were up 6% from the second quarter of 2014. If we look at the
pipeline at the end of the quarter, our first-lien origination pipeline was down 12% from the second quarter of 2014. On
the home equity front, we continue to see very good demand, where originations during the quarter were $3.2 billion,
which were up nicely on both a linked-quarter and a year-over-year basis.
Expenses, once again, included $5.3 billion of litigation cost during the quarter versus $3.8 billion in the second quarter
of 2014. If we exclude that $1.5 billion increase in litigation cost, expenses declined $117 million.
Our LAS expense for the quarter was just over $1.3 billion and, once again, remains on-track to hit $1.1 billion in the
first quarter of 2015.
Our number of 60-plus days delinquent loans of 221,000 that are serviced by LAS dropped 42,000, or 16%, from the
end of the second quarter of 2014.
In addition, we continue to reduce our production staffing levels in line with the market opportunity as we continued to
lower our fulfillment costs.
On slide 11, Global Wealth & Investment Management delivered another strong quarter, where we saw both record
revenues as well as record earnings. Pre-tax margins remained strong, north of 25% for the seventh consecutive quarter.
Record asset management fees drove revenue higher but were offset by some softness in transactional activity,
although I do want to mention that we did see transactional activities picked up during the month of September.
Net income of $813 million was up 12% on a linked-quarter basis as the business continued to focus on operating
leverage and drop the revenue growth to the bottom line. We increased the number of financial advisors, and
year-to-date the retention of our more experienced advisors remains at record levels.
Client balances were nearly $2.5 trillion, with negative market valuation mostly offset by positive flows that we saw
during the quarter. Long-term AUM flows were $11.2 billion during the quarter, the 21st consecutive quarter of
positive flows.
Ending client loan balances also increased to a record level from the second quarter of 2014 as we see good activity in
both securities-based and residential mortgage lending. And return on allocated capital in this segment was 27% during
the quarter.
If we turn to slide 12, Global Banking, earnings were $1.4 billion, which is up 24% from the third quarter of 2013 on
lower credit costs and, to a lesser degree, higher revenue. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, earnings were up on
lower credit costs, which were slightly offset by seasonally lower investment banking fees. Return on allocated capital
during the quarter was strong at 18%.
Within the revenue line item, investment banking fees for the company this quarter were $1.4 billion, which is up 4%
from the year-ago quarter but down seasonally from the second quarter of
2014. Our overall investment banking pipeline does remain very strong, but I do want to note that our fourth quarter of
2013 was a record quarter from an investment banking fee perspective.
Provision during the quarter was a slight benefit, which reflected continued low loss rates and a small reserve release.
If we look at the balance sheet, average loans were $267 billion, which is up 3% compared to the year-ago period but –
which has slowed over the past couple of quarters as we continue to focus on client profitability. We've also seen some
significant prepayments from some of our larger corporate banking clients during the last couple quarters.

Although our average deposits during the quarter did increase, our end-of-period balances declined, and that's due, as I
mentioned earlier, that we intentionally managed down certain deposits which have little LCR benefit.
If we move to Global Markets on slide 13, we earned $769 million during the third quarter of 2014. To put the third
quarter of 2014 on a like basis to the third quarter of 2013, you should exclude a $1.1 billion impact from the UK tax
rate change that we saw in the third quarter of 2013 as well as adjust the impact of DVA for both periods. Once again,
DVA this quarter was a benefit of $205 million versus a detriment of $444 million last year.
If we make those adjustments, we saw very strong growth in earnings of 21% on a year-over-year basis. Earnings are
down from the second quarter of 2014 as result of the typical seasonal declines in sales and trading as well as higher
litigation expense during the third quarter of 2014 within this segment.
If we back out DVA, revenue is up 7% from the year-ago period, driven by strong sales and trading results.
We're pleased to report both FICC and equity sales and trading revenues were up versus the year-ago period. FICC
revenues were up 11%. The improvement was driven by results in currencies given the increased volatility that we saw
during the month of September, as well as improved performance in both our mortgages and our commodities areas.
Equity sales and trading was up as well, up 6% from the third quarter of 2013, driven by a higher client financing
revenues.
On the expense front, they were up 2% year-over-year driven by higher revenue related incentives. Relative to the
second quarter, expenses were up $70 million from the second quarter due to higher litigation expense. If we backed
out the $200 million litigation expense during the quarter, expenses declined by about $130 million, in-line with the
lower revenue levels on a linked-quarter basis.
Average trading related assets were down about $13 billion from the second quarter of 2014, and our overall VAR
remains very low. Return on allocated capital during the quarter was 9%.
On slide 14, we show All Other. Our non-interest revenue during the quarter was down on a year-over-year basis as we
had $1.1 billion of equity investment gains in the third quarter of 2013 and during the third quarter of 2014 we had a
$300 million charge for UK payment protection insurance.
Expenses on a year-over-year basis are down about $400 million due to lower litigation expense in All Other, as well as
lower personnel costs.
Income tax expense is included within All Other as the benefits related to discrete items that I mentioned earlier are
largely reflected in this segment. As we look at the fourth quarter of this year, we expect the tax rate to be roughly 31%,
absent any unusual items during the quarter.
So before we open it up for questions, I'd like to summarize the quarter. We feel we made, once again, very good
progress during the quarter. We saw good business activity across the customer footprint. This led to year-over-year
earnings improvements in four out of the five businesses. And in our mortgage business, we're taking costs out of the
Legacy Assets & Servicing side and have taken costs out of the fulfillment side as well.
We generated enough earnings during the quarter from the businesses to offset a significant charge to settle our RMBS
issues with the DOJ and RMBS Working Group and, at the same time, maintained a very strong capital position.
Asset quality continued its trend of improvement, and we did take some deliberate balance sheet actions to improve
liquidity, manage OCI risk, and reduce both credit and market risk.
And we'll go ahead now and open it up for questions.

[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So, just wanted to touch on a couple of things that you mentioned during your prepared
remarks here. One is on the NII actions that you were talking about you might take with the securities portfolio as a
way to protect the OCI but might have a hit on the top line when you do that. Could you just talk through what kind of
size you're thinking about; what the triggers for that action might be?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure, a couple things, Betsy. I think the first thing, if you look at the balance sheet from
the second quarter to the third quarter and you look at the securities portfolio, you can see that virtually the entire
increase in the securities portfolio related to treasury securities that tend to have a maturity in the four- to five-year life
perspective as opposed to longer-dated agency securities.
The second thing that I mentioned is just in reference is what we would look to do with respect to our buy ticket during
the fourth quarter, and I think at this point we're being very cautious at looking at that buy ticket given the overall rate
environment that we see that's 30 basis points to 35 basis points lower than what we saw during the second quarter of
2014. And there's also a little bit of roll to spot risk that you have as we look out. And I'd say if we aggregate those two
items and put it in the context of NII risk for the quarter, those two items could be roughly $100 million of risk relative
to what we saw during the third quarter.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then, obviously a question that a lot of people have is the current rate
environment and what that impact is. So this is in addition to the typical negative impacts on NII from the long-end of
the curve, I would assume?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The $100 million risk that I referenced is relative to the actual net interest income in the
third quarter once we back out for market-related items.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it, got it. Okay. And then, the other comment was on expenses, where you indicated that
you are obviously done with the New BAC, which is fantastic, and LAS is on-track. So outside of the LAS expense
reduction, more directionally expenses would move in line with revenues. Could you give us a sense as to what you
think you could do on expenses in the event that the long-end of the curve stays where it is right now, hovering at like
two spot to one?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. I think the biggest thing I'd point to, Betsy, is if you look at what we've done, if you
look at the number of FTEs that we have which tends to drive a lot of the expense, we're down 7% year-over-year and
down 2% on a linked-quarter basis, and you see a flow-through of those benefits through a number of line items.
One of the most important things to look is if you go to our supplemental materials and flip to page 4, we show you
nine different expense items. And if you look at those line items, it excludes the other category which includes
litigation expense. All these line items are down both on a linked-quarter and a year-over-year basis. So as we continue
to be efficient and continue to manage down overall head count as a result of the various programs we've talked about
as well as just generally, you do continue to see it grind down expenses across all categories across the company.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And, Betsy, just put it in a broader perspective, how would you manage a company if the
low rate environment continues is a lot like we've been managing now; continuing to be careful in every expense item,
every head count, but at the same time investing in the business. And so, if you think over the last year, we've added
small business bankers and financial service advisors, the people who work in the branches for Merrill Lynch and the
Merrill Lynch teams. We've added mortgage loan officers in the retail segment while we reduced the overall numbers.
And so, we've been able to accomplish a reduction in expenses, at the same time we're making investments; $3.5 billion
in technology last year, probably $3.3 billion or so this year. So, we'll continue to make those investments.

So that means that the New BAC left to implement helps offset any kinds of sort of inflationary growth you get. And
then on top of that, we continue to work on initiatives to continue to simplify the company and eliminate non-core
products, et cetera, to continue to keep the expenses where they are.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Great. So just to rephrase, you still have expense reductions coming through from the work
that you've done so far, you're just not going to name it something new?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: No, we were just doing the daily work that we need to do. And remember, we're offsetting
all the inflation in healthcare costs and wages and everything that goes on a normal day, but we've made the raw
reduction we talked about. Now, it's just business as usual and go to work.

And we'll go next to Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi. Thanks very much. On slide eight is this tiny uptick in consumer 30-day past due. It's a
small number, but it's the first time I've seen it go up in a long time. Credit outlook is great. I'm just curious if that
denotes like a bottoming and what you're seeing. And then in conjunction with that, how you feel about your what
appears to be very large loan allowance as a percentage of charge-offs?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. No, we went back and noticed the same thing, Glenn. There were a few items that
were 10 days, 20 days and 30 days that rounded. But as we go out and look at it, as we freshened up and look forward, I
would say that the forward look on credit as we look forward relative to when we looked at it last quarter, we do
continue to see continued improvements, albeit at a slower pace from a charge-off perspective once you adjust for the
non-performing loan sales.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: That's good, that's comforting. You mentioned the $3 billion of sub debt that you issued
during the quarter. Just curious if there's any thought process of is that getting ahead of OLA. And do you feel that
there's going to be a sub debt component, or is that just you being cautious from having some diversification in the debt
structure?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I think as we looked out and as you look to fill up the various non-CET1 buckets,
you can see that we obviously had the bucket series T in May and we've issued about $4.6 billion to get where we
largely filled on the preferred bucket, and the sub debt issue of $3 billion was relative to approximately $5 billion to fill
up that bucket from an overall capital perspective. And at this point, I would say from an OLA perspective we continue
to read what you do. We feel like we've been very prudent in building up a significant debt stack at the parent, and we'll
just have to see where the regulation goes from here and we're obviously waiting to see exactly what that is.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Last one on mortgage. Just curious what percentage of current originations you're
keeping on balance sheet. And then a related part two would be how much is the unfinished question around repurchase
risk constraining? Any mortgage lending or is it really still a function of demand at this point?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The first, as it relates to the balance sheet, I believe it was roughly two-thirds of the
production from a first lien perspective would've gone on the balance sheet during the quarter.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: In terms of just origination quality, we continue to focus as we have for quite a long time
here on originating high-quality prime mortgages while still fulfilling our duties to give customers credit for home
purchases. The originations continue to rise. The purchase component obviously is rising too. So we feel good about
where we and we see that the repurchase requests from the agencies and stuff have come down dramatically. So we're
not going to change course, at the end of the day, because we feel good about the credit quality we're taking on,
producing for ourselves and for investors.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, thanks both.

And we'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Two questions. First on governance, can you just talk through the reasoning on the board's
perspective to change the chairmanship and, with a lead director, how you think the dynamic may change, good or bad?
And I guess secondly, is this a vote of confidence in you, Brian, in terms of the leadership and current strategy?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think we have a strong board as a team, with various people with various skills and
background, and that diversity really helps us. And so I think the board's decision, as we put out a few weeks ago in the
announcements made, it was just continued great governance – commitment to good governance. Jack Bovender, Lead
Director, takes over from Chad Holliday, who served as Chair for about 4.5 years and did a great job for us. And the
board is very committed to continue to have the strong governance, especially in the heightened expectations from the
regulators and the enhanced supervisor prudential standards from the Fed.
And so we feel good about the governance, but it's a team effort in how the board works together. And I think the
points Chad made in the announcement are that the board feels very good about the accomplishments of the
management team, and this is part of the progression in that regard.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: And does the Fed take part in reviewing this decision in any way?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: It's the board's decision, but we consult with regulators on all our major decisions in the
company. But I think the key is how we operate as a board and how we govern the company. And I think it will be for
benefit of shareholders, as it has been.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay, great, and then second question on the balance sheet. With the $47 billion reduction,
clearly it helps the LCR. But can you give us a sense on how it benefited – I'm sorry, the SLR. But can you give us
some sense on how it might have improved your LCR, number one, and if there are any additional benefits beyond
leverage that helps the stress test?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: A couple questions there. The first thing as we focus on the deposits, I wouldn't say it
benefited LCR, but what it enabled us to do was to continue to rationalize the balance sheet without hurting LCR. That
relates to the deposit optimization.
With respect to the mortgage loans, the $6.5 billion that we referenced where we converted mortgage loans into agency
securities, that's basically taking $6.5 billion of non-LCR benefit asset and converting them to $6.5 billion of LCR
benefit. So that would have been the one pickup of the activities that we mentioned, as well as just the reinvestment of
repayment of legacy loan proceeds into securities once again helps LCR. So the actions with respect to bullet one under
the key balance sheet benefited LCR. The $15 billion of deposits just enabled us to rationalize the overall size of the
balance sheet.
As it relates to CCAR and the actions that are taken, as we look to manage the company, we continue to look to
manage out the higher risk categories of loans. And if you look at what we did in the second quarter with just over $2
billion of non-performing loan sales and $2.5 billion this quarter, we would clearly expect that as you look at those
from a CCAR perspective, they would be higher-loss content loans relative to the rest of the portfolio. But the rationale
and the goal to move those out was to reduce the risk in a market environment that was very favorable, and we feel
good about those actions that we took.

<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: So is it fair to assume that you guys are near or at the 100% LCR threshold? And I guess
secondarily, should we expect balance sheet growth to start – loan deposit growth, balance sheet growth start to pick up
from here, or do you still have a lot more to do?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: So from an overall LCR perspective at the parent, we're at approximately 110% at the
parent, so we're well in excess of where we need to ultimately be in 2017. Within the bank level, we're well above the
80% level and would look to drive that to be north of 100% during the first half of 2015, well in advance of the 2017
implementation.
And as we move forward and we look at the balance sheet, the goal is we go forward, and you saw a little bit – it's
interesting. If you compare the loans in the three principal businesses where we make loans in the segments that we've
laid out here – and that would be in our Consumer business, in our Wealth Management business, as well as in our
Global Banking business – that average loans within those segments are up about 2% on a year-over-year basis.
And we're clearly very focused on looking to drive out and push out and grow loans. We're obviously focused on
growing deposits with our core customers, which will benefit LCR as well. And I think as it relates to the overall size
of the balance sheet, we want to continue to be more efficient, but I don't think you're going to see the magnitude of
move in the balance sheet going forward that you saw during this quarter.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay, great. That's helpful, thanks.

And we'll go next to John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, Bruce. I wanted to follow up on the NII outlook and the potential strategic actions.
Is the potential $100 million headwind on the core NII, does that reflect the possible strategic actions, or is that just
reflecting the fact that reinvestment rates for the maturing cash flows are lower today than they were in the second
quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It would reflect two things, John. It's both the roll to spot risk as well as the buy ticket
during the fourth quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And this buy ticket or these kind of actions that you might take, how might
they impact your projections of rate sensitivity to rising short and long rates?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: To the extent that we don't reinvest and build up cash, it will increase our asset sensitivity
and the benefit to rising rates when that occurs.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. So you're not talking about a major restructuring of the bond portfolio? It's just
being patient in terms of investing? I think I might have misunderstood the actions.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: This is much more, John, I think just realizing what we've seen during the quarter and
being cautious on buy ticket during the fourth quarter to manage net interest income risk with OCI risk, but we're not
talking about any kind of material shift. We're just flagging something for you given the magnitude of the rate move
that we've seen so far this quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it, okay, totally understood, thank you. And, Bruce, just in terms of the FAS 91 or
the premium amortization charges that move around with the 10-year, is that pretty proportional to how the 10-year
moves up and down, or are there levels where it stops being a straight line impact?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I would say that it tends to move – the FAS 91 moves most and is most correlated to the
10-year. And I would say that as you look at OCI risk, it tends to be more correlated to long-term mortgage rates.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And just to follow up on the provision, just wondering how we should think
about the jumping off point for the provision relative to the $600 million reported or the $200 million ex-DOJ this

quarter? How should we think about where to start off with that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think, John, I would look at the charge-offs adjusted for the portfolio of sales that we
said came down from $1.3 billion to $1.2 billion. And assuming the overall economic environment doesn't change, we
have continued to see improvements in the credit portfolios. And I think practically speaking, if you look at the reserve
release during the quarter, once you adjust for the DOJ amount of $400 million that you're not going to see reserve
releases. I think clearly they will be a fair bit below the $800 million that we would have seen this quarter on an
adjusted basis.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on capital builds, Bruce, it seems like you're still
able to grow the Tier 1 common at a multiple of the GAAP earnings. Is that primarily DTA? Could you remind us what
the status of the DTA balance is and how much is disallowed currently?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. The disallowed amount continues to be in the $15 billion to $16 billion type area.
And as we look out between now and the end of 2015, we would expect that the CET1 should build generally
consistent with pre-tax earnings all the way through the end of 2015.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Thank you, John.

And we'll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi, good morning. Were there any gains in the $2.5 billion of NPA sales?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I believe between what came through in the charge-off line and the net, I think the NPAs
were roughly $150 million, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: $150 million gain?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Correct.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And as far as the outlook for rates, have you changed your rate assumption for next year
given what the 10-year has done?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: As we look at rate assumptions, what we do is when we go through our internal
forecasting process, we snap and manage the business just based on the forward curve of what the market is telling us.
And clearly, I think if we look out at and look at the rate movement that we've seen over the course of the last couple
weeks, people are obviously, I think, more cautious that rates may not be moving up at the level that they have had, but
it's clearly been very volatile over the last 30 days.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And is that changing the way you're managing the portfolio or the company? In other words, at
what point do you look at the low rate environment and say, our prior assumptions might have been off a little bit, we
need to revise the approach?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think as we look forward, Mike, I think it's a little bit of why we said what we did about
a little bit of caution during the fourth quarter; that at this point as we look out and given the impact that OCI has to
capital, until we see where rates settle out as they continue to move around, we continue to be very cautious with the
buy ticket. And when we do it, we're investing clearly a little bit shorter than longer at this point given the risk that OCI
has to capital and being mindful of that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Sure, I know it's tough figuring out the rate environment right now. Revisiting the comment you
made, you said expenses should move more directionally with revenues. And if I look at the first nine months, I guess
revenues are down but expenses are down more. Do you mean that instead of having positive operating leverage, it

might be flat operating leverage looking ahead?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No. I think it's a couple of things, Mike. The first that I want to make sure that we
emphasize is that we still have a couple of hundred million dollars of expenses to get out in the LAS area between now
and the first quarter of 2015. And clearly, $1.1 billion of LAS expenses that we've set to get to in the first quarter of
2015 is not where we would expect to operate on a longer-term basis and there's additional work that we need to do
there.
The second area just broadly speaking is that we highlighted that clearly we'd expect, given what litigation has been,
that that over time is going to come down.
And then the third thing in when I said directionally expenses moving with revenues is just if we look at some of the
areas, particularly within the Wealth Management area that we've seen, there is a component of compensation and
incentives that's very clearly tied to revenues, not unlike what you see within the Global Banking and the Global
Markets space.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then, two questions for Brian or perhaps for you, Bruce. I know I asked this before,
but if rates do not go higher in 2015, what is Bank of America's ROE target?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think if rates don't go higher, what you see in terms of earnings is what we got a drive to
this quarter. So, Mike, when you look at the charts Bruce showed you and I showed you, you can see that the core
businesses have earned several billion dollars after-tax this quarter, the CRES business took it away. And as that comes
down, you'll see those earnings flow through. And so, you can compute the ROE based on that.
But basically, we're earning – you can see on page 18 the net income level across the businesses each quarter, and our
job is to take the Commercial Real Estate business, which you see for the year-to-date -take the Commercial Real
Estate business, which has lost money, and get that back to break-even. And that's the work we'll do. In absence of rates
rising, it's not a lot different than it is right now.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, just following up from the other question relating to the separation of the CEO
and the Chairman role, when you consult with regulators, do they care one way or another if the CEO and Chair
position is split? Now, there's several corporate governance experts who say that it's better to have those two roles split
and others say it doesn't matter. Do you know what the regulator view is on that? Because you're going from what some
consider a preferred corporate governance approach, splitting the CEO and Chair role, to now combining them.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think that what they've been clear about in the published documents published by the
OCC in their heightened standards, their enhanced standards, and put recently in the Fed, they care about the
engagement of the board and the diversity of the board and the experience of the board. And we have a good board and
it's experienced and has all the diversity and the incredible challenge and all the words that are used to describe that,
and that's the core of the governance point that they make.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.

And we'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning. If I could just follow up on some of the capital commentary you
provided, especially in the deck here. It seems like there's a number of adjustments that were made this quarter and just
right after the quarter you consolidated the bank sub. There's some increase in operational risk RWA. You commented
on OCI, managing through that. So as we think kind of big picture on managing capital, what's left and is there
opportunity to bring down some of the off balance sheet exposures now that you have kind of more final rules on the
SLR?

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. I think I would start in just reiterate as we look at capital on a go-forward basis, you
basically have three items that are going to affect things. The first is your level of profitability, and I just want to
reiterate that we would expect, once again, on a go-forward basis to accrete capital on a pre-tax basis.
The second is the impact that OCI has to those capital ratios. We obviously saw during the quarter rates went up on the
mortgage side. I believe it was about 5 basis points during the quarter, and there were some security gains as well. That
was what has led to the change in overall OCI. And as I said before, given the environment we're in where rates are
down about 30 basis points so far quarter-to-date, that would have a benefit today to capital and we're just mindful of
re-investing so that we don't take on any greater OCI risk on a go-forward basis.
As it relates to what we're looking through and as you look at the overall risk-weighted asset work that's been done, I
would say that clearly, as we continue to work through the legacy home equity as well as the first mortgage portfolios
that do not benefit from the stand-by agreement, as we continue to work those assets down, that should enable us to
grow the core and still keep risk-weighted assets generally constant.
And I think more specific to your point, the other two things are that we continue to look to work through and we have
the runoff of some of the structured credit and other portfolios that we're trying to accelerate, that come off between
now and 2017.
And then, the last piece that we continue to work hard on and you saw it in the op risk, that is we updated the models
for the time series. You do have the increase to risk-weighted assets and we're working hard to get to where we need to
be from that model perspective as we would hope in 2015, if we're successful, to go ahead and exit parallel run at that
point.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And as you think about I guess the adjustment on the operational risk RWA
side, do you think that's about done or is it an ongoing process until you hopefully exit the parallel run?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think it's obviously, as others have noted, it's an ongoing process. I think the important
thing is if you compare our operational risk number relative to our peers, we're at roughly 30%. And if you do the math
against the risk-weighted assets, we're at the, if not the top, the upper-end of where others are from that. But we
obviously have work to do to get that finalized to be in a position to exit.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, within the C&I lending book you talked about
pricing pressure as well as some paydowns. But I guess specifically on the pricing pressure, what are you seeing now
versus a quarter or two ago when you were still trying to grow or growing the book in terms of – not just the magnitude
of pricing but what types of products?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. I would say that the most competitive area that we continue to see is within the
commercial banking space of our Global Banking segment, which are those middle-market type companies, that tend to
be loans that have one or two banks provide all of the credit. And clearly, the remaining services that go along with
servicing those customers tends to go to those that provide the credit, and that's where you've seen the most
competition.
I think it's interesting if you look at and go back to our table on the international side, as we've continued to shape the
balance sheet and look for return, you've actually seen a step-up in the yields in our international lending activity. And
within the large corporate space of our Global Banking space, we have seen some stability in yields within that. So I'd
really focus – most importantly, it's within the middle-market commercial space where we're seeing the most pressure
on yields.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Sorry, just to add a little color there. Our view was, the team, two dimensions. One, on the
international side, we had strong loan growth a couple of years ago into last year, and now we have to materialize that
treasury management and other revenue streams under – increasing our credit exposure, and Tom and the team growing
the business. So there's sort of – there was a growth of loans that then had to be a follow through of growth of
transactional revenue, et cetera.

And on the middle-market, I think the team went for optimization, and we are going to continue to stress that they need
to be able to manage both the optimization and the growth of the portfolio. So we're pushing on them to get the balance
probably back a little bit more on skew then they had in the last couple quarters.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, all right. Thank you very much.
Operator
And we'll go next to Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. This is Guy. Question on, first
of all, the optimization that you talked about with respect to commercial deposits around $15 billion and the, I think,
roughly $12 billion in securities financing transactions. Should we look at those two things as directly related to each
other?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think they're related to each other that we think it's prudent balance sheet management,
but they're independent actions that are part of prudent balance sheet management.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So, Guy, I'd say thematically but not necessarily directly.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. So the $15 billion isn't all essentially prime brokerage related as well like the asset
reduction that you're talking about?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, it's not.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that's helpful. Another question is with respect to the provision related to the DOJ
settlements, should we look at this $400 million, which as you said, offset what would've been an $800 million reserve
release, should we look at that as essentially now a one-time true-up and going forward you now feel that you have the
provision that you'll need for multiple years to fulfill the settlement terms, or is the settlement going to essentially be a
pay-as-you-go thing through the provision?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: So to be clear, when we set up the $5 billion reserve – or the $5.3 billion hit this quarter,
that was to cover cash payments as well as all expected costs associated with implementing our $7 billion of consumer
relief. And the part of it that flows into the provision line item that's $400 million, that is a reserve to take care of the
what would have been the P&L impact from the modifications that would happen within the different loans that we're
modifying.
So on a go-forward basis, assuming that we've got this set up the way that we do, there should not be any future P&L
impact from DOJ. The only impact will be on the balance sheet as you see the reserve number come down as we
implement the consumer relief programs.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. That's a very helpful explanation, thanks. And finally, cyber security issues.
Obviously, you were not the bank that's been in the cross hairs here and yet I would imagine that this is something that
has caused some consternation internally and some spending. JPMorgan has talked about a $250 million budget for
cyber security issues, which is expected to double. Can you give us a sense for what you're spending there and how you
would expect it to increase?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Obviously, it's the matter that we take very seriously from the board engagement and the
talents we have on the board, to help us with this as the way through management, Cathy Bessant and her team in tech
and ops. And we spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the year and it's been growing and we expect it to continue to
grow. It's the key to keep our customers and our teammates secure, and we continue to work on it.
So this is nothing but hard work, and we continue to work with both the law enforcement authorities, the various
government agencies and among our industry through the various trade groups and formal engagements to try to drive
our competencies in the industry up. So we're spending a lot of money on it, several hundreds of millions of dollars,

and we expect that to continue to increase.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks. I actually do have one more if that's all right and it's with respect to the rep and
warranty RPL, which in the footnote you say it's the same as it was last quarter at about $4 billion. Can you update us
on where you are with any lawsuits related to the non-country-wide originations, which add up to around $420 billion
of UPB?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: So if you recall, Guy, what we've done and what we continue to refine each quarter is
that, as we continue to see rep and warrant claims, there was a reserve set up back in the second quarter of 2011. A
piece of it was for Gibbs & Bruns. There was a piece of it that was for bank-issued rep and warrant and then there was
a piece that was for third-party. And we obviously look at those reserves each quarter and adjust those reserves for the
activity. In those cases where we have enough activity to have a reserve, we obviously have those. Into those areas that
are still uncertain, we provide the range of possible loss. And as you referenced, the range of possible loss with respect
of rep and warrant activity continues to be up to $4 billion.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. So, no movement there obviously this quarter.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, thanks very much.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Thank you.

And we'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Yeah, good morning, guys. A quick one on loan growth. So at first glance, it looked kind of
weak. It was seemed to be driven by Consumer. I just want to make sure I've got sort of the right adjustments here that
I think you guys have laid out. In mortgage, $12.5 billion decline sequentially, but should we be backing out the $2.5
billion of NPL sales and then the $6.5 billion of agency conversion from that decline, so you get kind of a normalized
decline rate sequentially of more like $3.5 billion on the mortgage side?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I think the – it's a good question. So the decision to move the $6.5 billion from loan
to securities form was based on LCR. It doesn't change the fact that when you move that, that you still have the asset on
the balance sheet. So I think that $6.5 billion is a fair adjustment to make, and I would agree that the $2.5 billion where
we sold the non-performing loans – and can quite frankly, there's not much left there to attack – is a fair adjustment,
which gets you to the $9 billion.
The other thing when you look at those loans that I do think is important is that on the home equity side, with those
legacy home equity portfolios which we want to get repaid, that repayments within those were roughly $3.5 billion,
which were greater than the funded amount that came on from a new home equity origination perspective.
So I come back to that the – within those more discretionary portfolios, what's happening there is what we want to
happen there that they're repaying and we're converting them to more liquid instruments. And I think as we look at
actual business activity and how we're doing, we'd focus you back within the segment and as we talked about within the
Consumer business, where average loans were up a little bit linked-quarter on a card basis, where we saw very strong
continued growth within the home equity space, go back to the Wealth Management area where loans reached a record
level. And then, I think we've already addressed the work that we need to do in the commercial front.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure, sure. And maybe if you could, is it possible to give us an idea about the runoff
portfolio, what's left in that at this stage, and what your guys expectations are for like a runoff headwind, just so we can
think about it for modeling purposes?

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. I think I would look at as you go forward, given that we're not buying whole loans
from third parties, that you're probably looking at a high-single digit continued reduction for the next couple quarters
with respect to whole loans that we hold for others.
The second thing that I'd say that you have is you've got roughly $3 billion a quarter in home equity payoffs, a portion
of which will be mitigated by new originations, but you are looking at roughly $3 billion there. And then, you have
some other kind of less than $1 billion type items.
But I think it's fair to say that as you go forward, outside of what we think as core, you're probably looking at in the
Consumer businesses in the ZIP code of $10 billion to $12 billion that will go away and we'll either have the ability to
reinvest and make new loans or otherwise reinvest.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, and that's on a quarterly headwind basis?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Correct.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, terrific. And then thinking about Wealth Management, could you break down the
expansion in the margins there this quarter? How much of it came from reduced spending? I know you guys have been
investing there, and so maybe could you help us understand how much of a contributing factor that was here this
quarter and how much investment is left to wind down here.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I'm sorry, when you referenced margin, margin in what area?
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sorry, Wealth Management pre-tax.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, if you look at it and you go through the different areas, you tend to have 40%-type
payouts with respect to the revenue piece. So when you look at the margin improvement of a couple hundred basis
points, I would put it more in the context of just good core expense management. I do think there was a little bit less
litigation within the quarter that benefited us, but it tends to be just across-the-board, whether it'd be a little bit lower
support cost, a little bit lower licensing fee number, a little bit less litigation. There was no one number that was
particularly dominant in driving the margin.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And last quarter, we had some startup costs for the Merrill One product that you can see
has had strong success in terms of that AUM. So, that was sort of in the second quarter technology expenses, start to
roll that out, but it comes back off here.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So that technology spend also rolled off too, which probably helped, right? Is that – am I...
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes, exactly...
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: ...if you remember last quarter when we talked about it, they had a decline. It was because
some of this stuff was going in and this quarter you saw it revert back to more where they've pretty consistently been
over the last many quarters.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Cool, cool. And I seem to remember that being somewhere in the ballpark of like $50
million to $100 million. Is that right?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think it was all in that much. But whether it was all in that one quarter or not, I don't
remember.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. So, a decline from that might less so?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Cool. And then last one, I know you guys have talked about here the repositioning that you
guys want to take as far as AOCI risk and such. When we think about the AOCI hit that you guys lay out versus other

money centers in the interest rate shock, it's a little bit higher than where some of the other folks are. And so, hoping to
maybe get a little bit of color on where the current duration is, where you expect the duration to go based upon the
actions that you take, and then maybe help us also to square the circle of understanding the larger AOCI hit and
whether that's a result of a barbelling with the portfolio or what.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. First thing, I just want to clear up that there's – in the quarter, the only comment
with respect to the quarter that we're referencing is just some caution on the buy ticket given where interest rates are at
this point during the quarter. I think if you go back and you look at over the last couple of quarters, it's been a very
consistent message in that we've said that we're going to direct more of the buy ticket to shorter-dated treasuries, and
you can see that there's been a buildup of those treasuries over the course of the last three to four quarters. So, this
quarter was a continuation of that. We were just calling out a note of caution given the rate environment.
I think as it relates to overall OCI sensitivity, if you look at what we've typically said, in 100 basis point parallel move
up in rates, how long does it take back or take to earn back that OCI, we've said consistently it's been around three
years. It peaked at about three-and-a-half years and at the end of September it would have been less than three years. So
we have, kind of in a consistent trend line, continued to look to move down the overall OCI risk as it presents itself to
capital.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. So is it right then to assume that duration on the FS portfolio is a little under three
years, or is that not a correct inference?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, that's the period of time that it takes to earn it back. You're looking at the overall. I
think the overall duration is going to be in the five-plus years.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, thanks a lot.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Thank you.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi. Thanks. Just a question just on the trading business. Obviously, you guys and the other
companies did well amidst the volatility in September. And I'm just wondering with regard to these balance sheet
changes you guys have been making and the optimization of RWAs, and given what's happening in the environment
right now, any changes in terms of how Tom's running that business as far as being able to capture the revenue
opportunity out there? Or any inhibition given by your views around risk-taking and these capital and balance sheet
changes that you guys have talked about today?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I'd refer you to page 21 in the appendix in the lower-left-hand corner and you can see this
is the third quarter of 2012, 2013 and 2014 laid out side-by-side. And so, I don't think this is a change in position if you
look at it. The average trading-related assets of $460 billion to $440 billion, the VAR is $55 million, $56 million, $50
million. And you can see the revenues.
What Tom and his team have done a good job is building a relatively stable – this business is going to fluctuate. The
market's got a relatively stable core amount of activity that comes through this. And if you look at it over several
quarters – with the exception of the seasonality in the first quarter that typically occurs each year, but we laid this out
for you – the second quarter of 2012, 2013, 2014, last quarter, the third quarter, you see it's a relatively consistent $3
billion revenue-type of number, and we've maintained it.
So adjustments we made in the business on expenses, scope of activity and stuff, we actually made in 2010 and 2011 to
bring the business in line. So we're very comfortable where they are now. They're always moving around and impairing
risk and continuing to manage carefully the overall return to the business. It's a relative size to our company. We think
we've gotten a good place. We simplified it. And so, there's no change in strategy here. And in fact, you can see there's
a fairly consistent result from that activity. And what's different this quarter versus last quarter, obviously, about the

U.K. tax that you've seen in the bottom line come through in the third quarter. But we made $700-odd million after-tax
and that's good performance.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thanks, Brian. And to follow just on the mortgage business, the servicing line has continued to
just trickle out. I'm just wondering, have we've seen the bottoming of the former sales and the related revenues moving
away from that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think if you look at the servicing revenue, as I said, the biggest reason for the decline
was the adjustment in the cost to serve. If you saw the actual servicing fee line that came through linked-quarter, it was
only down about $25 million on a linked-quarter basis. And so, what you're going see on a go-forward basis is not so
much the impact on the sale of MSRs but just the servicing revenue that's derived based on the size of the MSR assets.
So given that there aren't any more large-scale sales of that MSRs, you're going to see that more vary on a core basis as
opposed to in a step function.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: [ph] Got it (01:18:14).
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And the [ph] bigger change (01:18:14) you'll see is that the number of 60-plus delinquents
continues to normalize now, and we have to continue to push that. That's where we think that we get the additional
expense leverage in LAS going forward. And so, it's $100 million this quarter and a couple of hundred million dollars
the quarter forward just grinding through and working those loans with the customers and modifying or short-selling
and going through the closure.
So, that number's still elevated as a percentage. You can see it. And if you look at our delinquency off of the things we
produced, really, since after the crisis, the numbers are much smaller than implied. Delinquency level ultimately is half
that amount that you see now. So that's where the real work will come, in unit reduction. The overall 3.9 million units
is fluctuating around a little bit, but we're kind of getting to equilibrium where our production is nearly what runs off
absent sales in the 60-plus bucket.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: And my last follow-up just on that point, you had talked about $1.1 billion by 1Q 2015. You had
previously talked about getting it down to about $500 million a year out from that. Is that still a reasonable expectation
given that backdrop you just laid out?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: 2015, the first thing that we're focused on is getting it down to $1.1 billion. And then
longer term I think if you look at any metric with where we would see from a number of loans serviced as well as the
number of delinquent loans in the portfolio, we still have some significant work to do to drive that $1.1 billion down,
because given the size of the portfolio it's way too high.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And we'll go next to Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah, I just wanted – on a follow-up on that, you talked about 60-day delinquent loans down
42,000 to 221,000. I don't think there's any sales of that. Is that just working through the portfolio? And that seems like
a very high pace. Can we expect that type of pace, or what type of pace of loans do you think you can work on a
quarterly or annualized basis?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, there were some servicing transfers during the quarter. My recollection is it was
between 20,000 and 25,000 units that were actually transferred during the quarter. So, it was a very good quarter for us
as far as MSR sales and driving that number down. But I think you're right, that on a go-forward basis it's not going to
be at that level, although we do think though we'll make some significant progress between now and the end of 2015.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Outside of the servicing trends, I get it's 20,000 to 25,000, so it was down roughly about 15,000
give or take 1,000 loans. Is that a pace that we can model going forward?

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: There are obviously a lot of factors that can go into that that are going to have
[indiscernible] (1:21:09). But I don't think – if you believe that with what we're seeing from the quality of the portfolio
and you believe the foreclosure process continues along the same trends, you're probably looking at plus or minus
20,000 units a quarter on an organic basis, on a net basis.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. And then relative to the big Department of Justice settlement, where do you think you are
on legal costs? I know it's hard to sit down and say, but we've seen a couple of other competitors get the Department of
Justice behind them but there still tends to be this nagging $1 billion here and there of legal costs that just won't go
away. Where do you think we are? Is Bank of America, since they've paid probably the most out than anybody, are you
more through that than most other people?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Some of that stuff that people are experiencing are pieces that we already taken care of in
prior quarters, and some of it relates to completely different – as it relates to mortgage matters, some of it relates to
other matters. And we'll always have litigation expense in this company. But in terms of the mortgage, we've talked to
you in many quarters that if you think just the last three quarters, three major pieces fell behind it, and we're still
waiting for the ultimate approval of the Gibbs & Bruns settlement, 95% of the RMBS by principal amount we had
settlements at this point and awaiting final approval.
So a lot of the pieces we had settled up, FHA and things like that, along the way. So we've got in the monolines, four
out of the five are settled. So we've been picking away at them. So without knowing all the ins and outs of the other
competitors, from our standpoint a lot of the smaller stuff was getting done. As a lot of you focused on the largest
things, a lot of the smaller stuff was coming in and out every quarter underneath that, and we should see less of that
going forward.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much.

And we'll go next to Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Hi, Brian. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just a question in terms of the
investment banking product rankings on page 32. Obviously, most of the numbers are in the top three, particularly in
the more important categories. I guess just looking at the global rankings in terms of some of the numbers that aren't in
the top three, are there further investments you all plan to make in that business that would have any effect on the
operating expense ratios in Global Banking, or is that pretty much steady state in terms of the investments you all are
putting into those businesses?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think as a broad construct, and I think you're asking at more a strategic level, Christian
Meissner and the team with Tom have done a good job of adding people in the markets where we needed to build our
capabilities. And while we're always looking to add more and more talent and more and more capabilities, I don't think
there's any huge change in expenses or numbers. It's more of continuously upgrading our talent and adding incremental
talent. But in the grand scheme of things, it's a pretty small expense base in the context of our company with the level
of expenses.
But your point is exactly right. The global – the U.S. competitiveness of our franchise is obviously demonstrably
stronger, as you can see in the U.S. rankings versus the global. The global have picked up honestly. And as activity
picked up in Europe and Asia, we continue to drive forward. But we still are working hard to improve our positioning
in it across the board, but we've made a lot of investments already.

<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: And then if I could just ask a follow-up on the non-U.S. commercial loans, a couple of
competitors have mentioned that there has been some weakness in trade finance lending, and I'm just curious how
much, if any, that has affected the loan growth within the non-U.S. commercial side of the balance sheet.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It has affected it in two ways. So when you look at the declines that we saw within the
loans outside of the U.S., a chunk of that decline was a decline in trade finance. But I think what's also notable is that
trade finance tends to have the lowest spreads. So when you look at the yields within the international loan portfolio,
they're up, and that's because you've got more corporate-type loans that have higher spreads than trade finance, which
tends to have lower spreads.

And we'll go next to Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning. Bruce, first question regards capital and profitability targets. I know at
the recent investor conference, you alluded to the fact that you believe that CCAR currently represents the binding
capital constraint for the bank, which I guess presumably you'll need to manage to a higher core Tier 1, which I guess
from my perspective could put at risk the 14% ROTE goal that you guys had established in the early part of this year.
And I suppose it's really a two-parter; first, what core Tier 1 target you believe you'll need to manage over the cycle?
And then as a follow-up to that, how does that inform your outlook for meeting that goal?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: A couple things. I'd go back to the first comment, which is that you have to break out a
little bit what's going to happen for our company over the next five quarters between the growth in tangible common
equity versus the growth in regulatory capital that flows into the capital ratio because, as I said before, over the next
five quarters we'll accrete capital on a pre-tax basis absent any other changes. That's the first thing I'd keep in mind.
The second thing is that as we look out, we do believe at this point that CCAR is the governor, and we're obviously
getting ready to go into the 2015 CCAR process. And without instructions or assumptions or scenarios, I think it's
premature to look at that.
The third thing is as you look at return targets, and Mike touched on this a little bit in his earlier question, I think that
the thing that as we look to getting to those 12% – 14% type targets, the thing I would encourage you to do because I
do think that you start to get a bridge to that, if you take the earnings that we announced today and normalize them for
the things that I touched on in my comments, you tend to be starting at a point that's in the 10%-plus type return during
the quarter from a tangible common equity perspective. And you've got really four things that are going to change that
on a go-forward basis; the continued reduction within our LAS expenses. We would expect obviously longer-term
litigation expenses to go down. You have the benefit of rates. And then you've got what we do within the core
businesses. So those are the four things that we're focused on.
And the last point I would say as it relates to just CCAR, we feel like getting ready for CCAR during this quarter and
quite frankly throughout the year that we've made a lot of work between moving out of the company those assets that
tend to have high loss contents in stress. We've augmented our CET1 ratios as we've gone forward. And we think we've

taken a lot of tail risk out.
So a long-winded way of saying you can look at the bridge to more normalized returns. When you adjust what we saw
this quarter, we feel very good about the progress that we've made as we prepare for CCAR. We'll look to see what the
instructions are and we'll have to see if our assumption about that being the governor, given the evolving regulatory
landscape, continues to be the case or if we need to update that assessment.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right, thanks for that, Bruce. That's really helpful. And then just switching gears to the
liquidity side of the equation, one measure which hasn't garnered very much attention is the net stable funding ratio.
And my understanding is that Basel's at least intended goal was to have the NSFR calibration completed by the end of
this year. And I was hoping you could disclose where you currently stand on this metric.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We do not have an exact number to disclose at this point. What I would say is we've
worked through and we've done the work to get to where we need to be from an LCR perspective. But at this point
there's not anything that gives us any concern that we're going to have to change in any material way what we're doing
to satisfy NSFR.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right, thanks, and maybe just one more quick modeling question. I was hoping you could
clarify, given all the preferred issuance that's been done, assuming nothing incremental is completed going forward in
terms of issuance, what the preferred coupon should be on an annualized basis next year.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think I've got an exact number for you, bear with me one second. You should see during
next year a preferred number of 1.262%.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right, perfect. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Thank you.
