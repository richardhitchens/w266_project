Thanks, Dane.
Appreciate all of you dialing in today. Liz and I will walk you through the presentation.
Turning to the first slide, as you can see, reported 2012 net revenues of $34.2 billion, net earnings of $7.5 billion,
earnings per diluted share of $14.13, and a return on common equity of 10.7%. A few major trends defined the
operating environment in 2012: substantial central bank activity, improved economic data in the United States, and
continued political uncertainty. For example, actions and commentary by the European Central Bank played a
significant role in moderating concerns about a European linked tail event.
At the end of 2011, the ECB announced that it would enhancement its long-term refinancing operations to provide term
liquidity. The ECB further demonstrated its commitment during 2012 by affirming its support for the euro and its
willingness to make outright purchases in the secondary bond market. In the United States, the Federal Reserve also
took steps to support markets and economic growth, announcing further increases in monetary stimulus during the year.
In 2012, the U.S. economy posted stable to improving economic data, particularly with developments in unemployment
and housing. Over the course of the year, the U.S. economy added nearly 2 million jobs and the housing price index
increased by 4% over the past 12 months. Despite the systemic benefits of central bank activity and improved U.S.
economic data, our clients continued to struggle with a complex set of issues facing the global economy and the
political backdrop.
The most obvious recent example was the debate in the United States surrounding the fiscal cliff. These factors
translated into mixed activity levels for corporate client base. For example, global debt issuance increased by 11%
year-over-year with high-yield issuance increasing 38%. In contrast, global equity underwriting volumes were only up
1% and completed global M&A volumes actually decreased 18% in 2012 and remained very low as a percentage of
market capitalization.
We experienced lower activity levels in most of our businesses and general risk aversion by our investing clients. This
was offset by improving asset prices and lower volatility which created a more favorable market-making environment.
Although equity and fixed income asset prices trended up over the course of the year, volumes generally declined,
given the previously mentioned factors.
For example, U.S. listed equity volumes declined 18% in 2012. And as we all know, the S&P 500 climbed by 13%.
While macroeconomic challenges persist, our leadership teams remain focused on enhancing our returns. Drivers of our
long-term success include focusing on our clients, prudently managing our risk profile, and being disciplined about
capital and expenses.
Turning to slide 2, you can see that we ended the year with our balance sheet at $939 billion, relatively consistent over
the past few years. There's been less demand for balance sheet, given lowered client activity levels and reduced risk
appetite. In terms of the composition of the balance sheet, 91% remains fairly liquid. Excess liquidity and other cash
represents 19% of total assets. Secured client financing, which captures lower risk collateralized activities like margin
loans and match book activities, represents 26%.
Turning to slide 3, you can see the evolution of our balance sheet, selected risk metrics, liquidity and capital. Since
2007, the balance sheet is down 16% and both level 3 assets and VaR have come down meaningfully. This reflects both
an active risk management approach and changes in the broader market. An important lesson from the 2008 crisis is
that the firm ended up with more illiquid risk than were comfortable with in retrospect. As a result, level 3 assets are
down roughly one-third and represent only 5% of our assets.
VaR has also come down significantly over the last few years and is currently at levels we have not seen since 2005.
The decline has been driven by the previously mentioned balance sheet reductions and lower levels of market volatility.
You should not expect our levels to remain this low in the future. As the macro environment normalizes and client risk
appetite improves, our VaR may increase. In addition to balance sheet and risk, our GCE has grown threefold since

2007. Common equity has increased 75% while leverage has been more than cut in half. We remain committed to
extending risk capital to meet client needs and at the same time making sure that we generate strong risk-adjusted
returns and manage our risk prudently.
On slide 4, let's discuss how we're approaching capital targets under Basel 3. In addition to increased capital charges
under the new requirements, global regulators have introduced a series of surcharges reflecting size and complexity.
These charges effectively raise the barriers to entry for scale players in the industry. Based on the FSB's proposed
capital charges, we would need to manage our Tier 1 common ratio to a 7% minimum level and add a SIFI buffer of
1.5%.
We intend to manage our Basel 3 Tier 1 common ratio with an additional management imposed buffer which will
approximate 100 basis points, making our target roughly 9.5%. While Basel 3 capital rules are not final and will not be
fully phased in until 2019, our Tier 1 common ratio estimate at the end of 2012 is nearly 9%.
With that, I'll turn it to Liz, who will provide an update on our liquidity and funding strategy.
Liz Beshel Robinson
Thanks, Harvey.
On slide five, liquidity remains the single most important risk management discipline for the firm. As we discussed
during our previous call, we hold cash and cash equivalents to pre-fund the potential for stressed liquidity needs and
also structure our balance sheet with high liquidity, high velocity liquid assets that are also funded by term liabilities.
Our liquidity pool continues to be a significant portion of the balance sheet at $175 billion at the end of the year.
On average for last year, more than 40% of our liquidity was made up of U.S. government obligations and more than
25% was UK, German, French, or Japanese government bonds. High-grade collateral is largely managed through
reverse repurchase agreements or unencumbered inventory. Approximately 30% of our average global core excess was
in the form of deposits that are largely held at the Federal Reserve.
In addition to maintaining a conservative liquidity composition, we ensure that our global core excess is appropriately
distributed on a global basis, and we also manage it at the entity level to meet internal and external liquidity risk
requirements. On average for 2012, our global broker dealers held 45% of our liquidity pool, our major bank
subsidiaries had 33% and the holding company and all other subsidiaries had 22%.
While the firm will continue to measure and monitor contingent and contractual liquidity outflows based on our
internal risk model, called the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, regulators and the market are focusing on the liquidity
coverage ratio. In concept, the LCR is a similar approach to our internal framework, although the definition of the asset
[indiscernible] (09:37) and calibrations for individual risk factors are different. Based on recent Basel guidance, we
believe that our current GCE level leaves us well-positioned for the new rule set.
Moving to slide 6, let's turn to secured funding. Our total secured funding of approximately $218 billion is primarily
driven by liquid governments and federal agency obligations in our interest-rate business. The funding portion of our
book is approximately $90 billion of non-GCE eligible assets in our principal broker/dealer entities. We apply the same
conservative liquidity risk management approach to our collateralized financing and we focus on asset liability
management and excess liquidity capacity.
From an asset liability perspective, we raise secured funding with the terms that is appropriate for the liquidity risk
associated the type of accents that are being financed. For example, we aim to achieve a maturity target of at least three
months for highly liquid equities. For less liquid assets, like high-yield corporates, we believe that a longer-term
one-year target is more prudent when considering the potential lower liquidity and price transparency of that collateral
in a market stressed scenario.
Given the current mix of our inventory and our conservative approach, 75% of our secured financing for non-global
core excess assets is executed for tenors of three months or greater, and more than 30% is funded with an initial term of

one year and longer. If you look at the mix of our secured funding book and the target tenors for the assets that we
have, we're comfortable running with a weighted average maturity of our non-GCE secured funding that is greater than
100 days at the end of 2012, as it has been since 2008.
In addition to terming out our books, we have incremental protection against maturing trades or increased funding
requirements through our secured funding access or SFE. We raise secured funding capacity in an amount that exceeds
our existing inventory requirements. That funding is deployed in GCE eligible asset classes like U.S. treasuries, but is
available to finance non-GCE inventory if our balance sheet grows or if other funding rolls off. Over the past three
years, our SFE has doubled as a proportion of our secured funding book.
Turning to slide 7, given the importance of an effective asset liability management strategy, we've spent a lot of time
assessing and measuring the risks associated with our secured funding book. To analyze secured funding risk, many
market participants tend to focus solely on individual considerations, including tenor, maturity diversification,
counterparty diversification or inventory composition relative to repo capacity. These metrics are all important by
themselves, but looking at each one in isolation does have shortcomings.
Therefore, we developed a concept of funding at risk, or FaR, which is a measure of liquidity risk for secured funding
that comprehensively aggregates each of the previously mentioned risk measures. The FaR metric is capable of
stressing multiple factors including counterparty rollover behavior, balance sheet, financing haircuts, time periods, and
the resulting forward liquidity changes. The calculations take into account trade tenors, counterparty concentrations,
bespoke collateral schedules and roll probabilities.
In addition, to the extent we buy excess funding capacity or SFE relative to our current balance sheet needs, the FaR
calculation will show the funding benefit on a forward basis. We mitigate our FaR by terming out trades with staggered
maturities, pre-rolling and negotiating tenor extensions with clients, raising excess secured funding, and accounting for
one month stress funding at risk in our MLO to capture that risk in our GCE. Due to our conservative secured funding
profile and the excess funding capacity that we hold, we're comfortable with the estimates of funding that we could lose
under various stress scenarios.
Moving on to deposits on slide 8. They have continued to grow and ended 2012 at $70 billion. Much of this growth
originated from GS Bank USA which held $66 billion of deposits at year end and has been actively increasing its
deposit base with a focus on longer-term CDs and deposit sweep contracts. In aggregate, these deposits are being used
to fund a significant portion of the roughly $120 billion of assets in our U.S. Bank, which is comprised of loans,
securities, and interest-rate derivatives, and also supporting the liquidity needs of those activities as well as our
unfunded corporate commitment portfolio totaling $64 billion.
Since 2009, GS Bank USA's balance sheet has been growing and evolving in terms of its composition with a focus on
growing lending to private and corporate clients and deposit taking while assets associated with interest-rate derivative
products have stayed relatively flat. The growth in deposits has enabled us to fund the U.S. Bank's balance sheet more
efficiently and at a lower cost than the group. As with most of our bank peers in the U.S., deposit growth has outpaced
asset growth in the past 12 months, allowing us to grow our liquidity pool to ensure that we're well positioned for
growth in the economy and ready for higher liquidity requirements under Basel 3. Substantially all of our excess cash is
held on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Slide 9 presents our long-term unsecured funding where we continue to focus on ensuring stability and reducing
refinancing requirements through appropriately long-dated and spaced maturities. Given our focus on term, our
long-term unsecured debt currently has a weighted average maturity of eight years and our weighted average maturity
has been in excess of seven years since 2004.
In 2012, we executed $20.3 billion of long-term vanilla unsecured funding which included our $2.25 billion
remarketing of APEX and $850 million of perpetual preferreds. That compared to approximately $24.5 billion of
vanilla long-term unsecured funding that came due during the year.
Throughout the year we saw three things: a continued focus on international diversification, increased retail issuance
and a greater share of transactions driven by reverse inquiry from our clients. Of the $20.3 billion of issuance, $15.6

billion was issued in U.S. dollars, $3.8 billion in Japanese yen, and just under $1 billion in other currencies like Aussie
dollars and Swiss francs.
During the year, we conducted our first Samurai offering since January of 2008 and our inaugural Swiss-franc
benchmark offering. We also noted a significant return of international investors to our U.S. dollar funding program,
which is valuable to the firm as our functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
On the retail side, we continued to seek diversified holders for our debt and issued $3.5 billion of funding globally to
retail purchasers, which was up nearly 50% relative to 2011 levels. Finally, we responded to institutional demand for
our debt with $3.9 billion of reverse inquiry issuances.
As we think about issuance for 2013, we will look to remain opportunistic in our issuance strategy and continue
focusing on the diversification of our funding program by utilizing domestic and foreign markets as well as a range of
distribution channels. Like 2012, we'll look to take advantage of reverse inquiry deals in retail issuance, as well.
In 2013, we have $17.4 billion of vanilla debt maturing, and we recently issued a multi-tranche $6 billion deal that was
significantly oversubscribed, as well as a $225 million Swiss-franc offering. Depending on markets, the environment,
and the size of our balance sheet, we may or may not choose to match new issuance with maturities. We are
comfortable that we have a number of levers to pull beyond incremental unsecured issuance, including raising more
deposits, reducing the GCE, or shrinking funding-intensive parts of the balance sheet if that trade-off is appropriate.
Finally, let me briefly discuss our current thoughts related to resolution authority. There's been much discussion about
orderly liquidation authority and its potential impact on financial institutions and creditors in particular. We are in
dialogue with our key regulators regarding how OLA might work in practice, and know that the regulatory community
has also been in contact with investors to help explain the process. Some have suggested that there be minimum
liability requirements so as to better facilitate an orderly resolution. Should regulators decide this is necessary, we are
well-positioned to meet any such requirements given our strong capital base and significant portfolio of long-dated
funding.
We share our regulators goal of ensuring that the resolution of any significant financial institution would not put
taxpayers at risk. We're investing significant time and effort into resolution planning to provide for an orderly process
in the unlikely event of our failure. We believe this is good for Goldman Sachs and our investments as well as the
system as a whole.
In closing, we continue to be well-positioned with a liquid balance sheet that is protected by strong capital, a high level
of liquidity, a conservative funding profile and a strong risk management infrastructure. While economic conditions
remain challenging, the strength of our business model and client franchise coupled with a focus on disciplined
resource management position the firm to grow and generate strong returns.

With that, Harvey and Liz want to thank you for participating. As you know, all of you will get an opportunity to get to
know Harvey more as the incoming CFO, and have had a lot of exposure already to Liz. So we all look forward to
doing that.
And we're happy to take your questions now, if anyone has any questions.

<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: [indiscernible] (20:00) Maybe some follow-up questions on GS Bank. One, I guess on slide
five, you showed that about a third of the GCE is in various bank subsidiaries. Is it fair to assume that most of that is
GS Bank USA?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Yes, Ryan, that is correct. The bulk of that is at Bank USA. I think we have about $70
billion in total deposits. At the moment, $66 billion of that is at the Bank, GS Bank.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Great. And then just to drill down a little bit more into the bank and maybe on the asset side,
the trading assets you've got there, could you provide some more color about that? How much is derivatives? How
much is securities?
And then I guess my other question is just in terms of the lending that you're pursuing in GS Bank, what sort of loans
you're targeting there?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Sure. Ryan, in terms of the securities business, the bulk of that is derivatives, largely our
interest rates derivatives business.
In terms of the lending book, it's a combination of things that includes both private bank for our private wealth
management clients. It also includes a book of corporate lending, which would include our unfunded commitments, so
CP backstop commitments are in there, as well, for the most part.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: And so on the private banking side, is that providing loans to people for margin loans? Or is it
more sort of mortgages?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: It's more mortgages and private loans, some of which are collateralized. But not our
traditional margin lending business, which is still conducted out of GS and Co. in the US.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Okay. So that still comes out of the broker-dealer. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Thank you, Ryan.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Ryan.

Your next question comes from [ph] David McCallum (21:54), Morgan Stanley.
<Q>: I appreciate the comments on OLA, and a follow up to that, maybe. Do you have a sense yet – either from your
conversations with regulators or have you started to hear from folks who provide your funding – whether either the
regulators or debt investors will express a preference around the composition of your funding program, away from
senior to more subordinated instruments? What color do you have there?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, we haven't heard anything specifically as you describe.
In the context of all the dialogue with the regulators, I think it's been pretty constructive. And on the surface, as you
would imagine, we're very supportive of something that reduces systemic risk, and in the long run, is the type of thing
that could mitigate panic, if you will, and just take that out of the system. But the specifics as you're asking about really
haven't been determined yet.
<Q>: Understood. On a related note, we're starting to – I shouldn't say starting – we're still hearing some comments
from certain of the rating agencies around the way they think about some of the support that is still embedded in the
ratings of the G-SIFIs, and how there's still potential for some of that support to change at different levels of the cap
structure and the organization.
How much thought have you given around that? And could you give us a little color on where you think either you
might be most impacted, if the agencies do decide to continue to rethink support in the rating structure?

<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Sure. Look, I think we think that if they were to act, it would certainly have a manageable
liquidity impact, given the strong positions that we're all in today.
As you can imagine, we prepare for ratings downgrades all the time, as part of our normal liquidity/stress scenarios –
our normal liquidity planning.
And we think in that sense about both the contractual outflows – which we do disclose in terms of the impact in our
derivatives book of having to post additional collateral – but we also think about potential client behavioral impacts that
might occur as a result of a downgrade as well. And when we think about those potential funding and franchise
implications, I think it would very much depend on the nature of the downgrade. So clearly, an industry-wide
reweighting would be easier to absorb than a GS specific change.
Similarly, I think my view would be a change that would be based on the agencies' view of government support would
be easier than a change that came as a result of a weakening in credit fundamentals, as you might imagine. But we
obviously think about and prepare for all of those scenarios and are very comfortable with where we're positioned
today.
<Q>: So no one business really more impacted than the other in response?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Don't think so, no.
<Q>: Okay. Appreciate the color folks. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from Robert Smalley with UBS.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Robert.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: First, to follow up on [ph] Dave's (25:07) question on OLA. In the discussions that you've had
with regulators so far, have they talked about the idea of uniformly applying metrics across the large bank peers?
Because if you look at you and Morgan Stanley, and if we're talking about a minimum amount of debt required coming
from the holding company, you do the overwhelming majority of your issuance from there. So you've got a leg up on
the competition. So I'm just wondering if they want to apply the rules uniformly and if you've heard anything about
that?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's too early to tell. It's really been all conceptual at this point.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay. Secondly, in terms – we've also seen discussions about foreign banks in the United
States having to be separately capitalized, have their own liquidity. Projecting in the future, I could envision and I'm
sure you could envision a similar type of response out of the UK.
Are you preparing to do some issuance out of your European operations? Or could you do that out of Goldman Sachs
International? How could you fit that bill if something like that should transpire?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Look, I think we obviously are watching those rules evolve and, as Harvey said in the
OLA comment, I think it's really too soon to tell on all of those regulations and where they will come out for us, as
well.
Again, I guess I'd just say we believe we are in a very conservative position today to deal with these rules, whatever
they are, as they become implemented, in terms of our ability to utilize the capital we have across a range of legal
entities, and I think the same with liquidity. But I think it would be too early for us to be making decisions about
changing our capital structure or our issuance vehicle given the uncertainty in that process still.

<Q - Robert Smalley>: And one last one, if I could. Just looking at excess liquidity. Listening to the equity call, the
view of the equity community may be that you're carrying too much excess liquidity at this point, and it's a drag on
earnings. For those of us in fixed income, we greatly appreciate the size and how that's managed.
As the environment changes or as your thinking changes, is there a sweet spot that you're looking at numerically or is
there a formula where you think you can make both the equity community and your fixed-income investors happy at
the same time?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Look, I'd – let me start. I would say first we would all argue here that liquidity, along
with our clients, is really the lifeblood of the firm. And so our first priority is always to make sure that we have enough
liquidity to keep us comfortable. That in the event that there is an issue, we would be prepared for that.
And again, we size that based on a model that takes into account a range of potential factors. Contractual, potential
behavioral impact, market-driven impact, any number of factors. And on top of that, there's a cushion that takes into
account our view the environment. And we think that that can serve both an offensive requirement, so if we need to
start to grow the business. It can also be very defensive.
So we're very comfortable with where we are today. We're also very carefully watching the changes in regulation
including the LCR. And so I think our inclination for the near term is to remain very conservatively positioned, again,
both given the primary use of that liquidity buffer to keep ourselves both offensively and defensively positioned, but
also as we watch the LCR rules become finalized, to make sure we're well-positioned for that. And I think on the back
of that, we'll continue to think about the optimal levels.
But again, I think we feel comfortable today, given the liquidity we're running, as we move into that LCR world. I don't
know if you'd add?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Only thing I would add is I guess I would say we're cognizant of all the constituents, but
the equity investors – they care a lot about the liquidity we're holding as well, both from an offense perspective and a
defensive perspective.
So I heard the same questions you did on the call. I wouldn't be viewing liquidity as the low-hanging fruit for operating
leverage in the business. And certainly, as Liz said, we have a long history of managing the firm with a conservative
profile. And with respect to being conservative, liquidity management is at the top of the list.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Satish Pulle with ECM Asset Management.
<Q - Satish Pulle>: Hi. Good afternoon. Just a quick question, please, about deposits. Have you seen any outflows this
year after the expiry of the FDIC's TAG program? Thank you.
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Thanks. No, we did not have any deposits that were subject to that program, so that has
not been an issue for us.
<Q - Satish Pulle>: All right. Thank you.

<Q>: [indiscernible] (30:20) hosting the call. This is good information. Really just two questions.
The first is you discussed, Liz, that you're going through your plans now for resolution authority or [ph] reliquidation
(30:33) authority, however it's called. And given – I think what Harvey said is right. Obviously these things are
conceptual at this point. But given what's been discussed to date, do you see that any major – I say major changes, but
really any changes in your funding profile going forward, as a result of what's been discussed?
And I understand that we have to wait until final rules come about, but I'm just trying to understand if you feel where
you're at today is sufficient or really isn't anything that really needs to change, or you really do anticipate there's going
to be some changes being driven by this rule?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's very, very difficult to say how these rules evolve. By the way, you could extend that
answer to lots of issues around regulatory reform. So there's nothing specific that we can plan for at the stage. I think
that the market broadly should take comfort from the fact that both, I think, as respect of something like OLA and
really all the rules, the regulators are trying to be very thoughtful about how they implement the rules. And so they're
very cognizant of giving people enough runway to respond.
Now having said that, we don't want to get – we don't want to take too much comfort from that, so you see us continue
to manage the balance sheet and liquidity quite conservatively.
<Q>: Okay. And the second question I had was just regarding this planning that Liz had mentioned. Are you planning
to discuss these plans at any point in the future with investors? It sounds kind of like the sort of material that would be
great to hear about at an investor day, but I was curious if you're planning to discuss this resolution framework at any
point in the future?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: I think we probably will at some point in the future. We're still in the process of working
with our regulators. It's a very iterative process, I'd say, and we have a lot of ongoing dialogue with our supervisors
about the strategies in our original sets of plans and the assumptions that we've made in those plans I think we've
learned a lot from creating our inaugural plan and we're working already on what we need to do this year.
So again I'd say, we believe, not surprisingly, that the risk management processes we have in place, our mark-to-market
discipline, the liquidity of our balance sheet capital, our strong funding and liquidity position, our capital strength, all of
those things that we keep talking about, position us very well in a resolution or a recovery type of scenario planning
process. I think it's probably too soon to start to discuss that publicly but I think at the right time we would be
comfortable doing so.
<Q>: Great.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We'd certainly consider it in the context of what the regulators allow us to do.
<Q>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Larry Vitale with Moore Capital.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Hi, Liz.
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Hi, Larry.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Larry.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: I wanted to ask you if you had any more clarity on the collateral grab that may result from
mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives? That date is coming ever closer and you've been very specific in the past that
the CFTC and ultimately the regulators aren't going to implement anything that disrupts the markets. But I'm just
wondering if you had any more clarity on, A, operationally how this is going go and, B, the quantity of collateral that

may be called upon?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we don't have any specifics on the quantity of collateral and we've all seen the same
estimates, which vary pretty significantly depending on the various local and international proposals. But I would say,
again, and with the risk of sounding redundant, is what you saw the CFTC do in terms of no-action letters in December
seemed like a very thoughtful way to approach implementation given the scope of what they're trying to achieve. And
even though, over time, I think we'd all feel great if we had a completed rule set because you can act against a
completed rule set, the reality is their judgment seemed quite thoughtful in delaying the rule of implementation across
the first half of this year. So we'll have to see as it evolves.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Okay. And as the rules stand now, or as you expect them to evolve and there's a little bit of art
involved in that I guess, do you foresee any changes in either the way Goldman Sachs funds or in the amount of
collateral that you're going to have to post against your counterparties?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We don't see anything today, but I wouldn't take that as a forward-looking statement. The
reality is, the key to how we adopt is really seeing what the rules – how they impact the market. And really most
importantly, how they impact our clients. Because at the end of the day, we have to adapt locally and globally to fulfill
our client needs. And the history has shown we've been good adapters, but we'll have to execute well.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Of course. And then last thing on this, do you guys – does Goldman Sachs expect to actually lose
any funding as result of having to post to clearinghouses on a gross basis as opposed to netting down client positions
before you post?
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: I mean, I think it's the same answer. I think we're certainly looking at that as it evolves,
but I think more to come on that.
<Q - Larry Vitale>: Okay. All right. Thanks very much.
<A - Liz Beshel Robinson>: Thanks, Larry.
Harvey M. Schwartz
And I think that's our last question. And so on behalf of Liz and myself, we just want to say thanks for dialing in. And
me personally, as I assume the role of CFO and I've been working through the transition, I certainly haven't had the
chance to meet with all of you. But I do look forward to spending more time with you in my new role and certainly as
the year progresses. So again, thanks, everyone, for dialing in. We really appreciate it.
