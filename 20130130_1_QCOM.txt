And now it is my pleasure to introduce QUALCOMM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Paul Jacobs.
Dr. Paul E. Jacobs
Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We're obviously off to an excellent start in fiscal 2013 and pleased to
report a record quarter driven by strong year-over-year growth in both our QCT and QTL businesses. Revenues were
up 29% and non-GAAP earnings per share were up 30% compared to a year ago.
In QCT, we delivered record chipset volumes, which included eliminating the constraint on 28-nanometer devices as
we had expected. In addition, QCT continues to drive technology and product leadership as we announced the new
QUALCOMM Snapdragon 800 and 600 processors featuring ultra-high definition video playback and capture and our
latest generation microarchitecture with clock speeds up to 2.3 gigahertz per core, the 800 processor is class leading,
and we continue to set the bar for the smartphone user experience.
Turning to QTL, our licensees reported stronger-than-expected total reported device sales as the broad-based adoption
of 3G and 3G/4G products continues driven by strength in smartphones. We continue to invest and innovate across a
broad set of technologies and believe that our patent portfolio applicable to 3G and 4G products is the most widely
licensed in the industry. In fact we have now over 225 CDMA licenses and licensees and more than 40 royalty bearing
single mode OFDMA licensees.
Now with respect to our display business we recently announced an expansion of our display arrangement with Sharp
in order to accelerate the commercialization of our Pixtronix MEMS displays utilizing Sharp's IGZO [Indium, Gallium,
Zinc Oxide] technology with the goal of driving high performance, lower power displays for a variety of devices
including smartphones and tablets.
Our Pixtronix technology uses a MEMS based shutter system to deliver color performance similar to OLED with wide
angle viewability and lower power consumption than LCD or OLED. As we previously indicated, we're increasing our
focus on licensing our display technologies including our next generation Mirasol display technology while at the same
time directly commercializing certain current generation Mirasol displays.
Looking forward we believe our long-term growth drivers remain intact. Smartphone demand remains strong. Gartner
estimates that approximately 169 million smartphones were shipped in the third calendar quarter of 2012 representing a
47% year-over-year growth.
In China alone Gartner estimates that approximately 47 million smartphones were shipped in the third calendar quarter
of 2012 representing greater than 115% year-over-year growth. In the U.S. both AT&T and Verizon Wireless recently
reported a healthy fourth calendar quarter smartphone sales with close to 20 million units between them. And in
emerging markets Wireless Intelligence estimates that there are now more than 1 billion 3G/4G connections
representing 34% year-over-year growth. In China in particular, Wireless Intelligence estimates that there were 325
million 3G connections, including [ph] 1X (5:35), at the end of 2012, which represents 49% year-over-year growth.
Now this brings 3G penetration to 29% in China, so excellent progress and still plenty of opportunity ahead.
China Mobile recently announced a pre-commercial trial for LTE TDD and QUALCOMM chipsets were in 14 out of
the 31 devices selected for the trial. In addition, I recently attended China Telecom's annual handset fair where they
discussed having 480 CDMA2000 ecosystem partners and their goal to have 200 million mobile subscribers by the end
of 2013 and there are currently over 0.5 billion CDMA2000 connections globally according to Wireless Intelligence.

With increased penetration of data centric devices and higher usage, we continue to see robust growth in wireless data.
In order to address this growing demand we remain focused on addressing what we call the 1000X data challenge.
We're working to expand wireless data capacity by 1,000 times from its current level.
We believe that small cells operating in a license spectrum band and using advanced interference management
techniques on a dynamic basis will be an important component in meeting the challenge. There was positive progress
on this initiative in December when the FCC proposed to convert the 3.5 gigahertz band into a dedicated license
spectrum band for small cells. Additionally, operators continue to use the advanced network technologies such as LTE
to help address growing demand for data.
Globally the number of LTE operators has now reached 145, according to the GSA, representing greater than 200%
year-over-year growth, and Wireless Intelligence estimates that global 4G LTE connections which run on multimode
3G/4G devices reached approximately 60 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, up more than 500% from the prior year.
Finally, we continue to see the opportunity for non-handset devices as positive for our business. In early December at
Dell World, Dell highlighted upcoming support for multimode 3G/4G in the XPS 10, their Windows RT based tablet,
as well as across their portfolio of business tablets and notebooks. In addition, auto manufacturers are now announcing
multimode 3G/4G connectivity in new models. And together with AT&T we announced a plug and play development
platform based on Gobi that will enable a wide range of applications and devices to connect to AT&T's network.
So to conclude, we've completed a record quarter at QUALCOMM and we're pleased to be increasing our fiscal 2013
guidance. We're continuing to execute against our strategic priorities, and we look forward to addressing the growing
set of opportunities ahead.
So thanks and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.
Steven M. Mollenkopf
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone.
Our QCT business had another great quarter with record MSM shipments, revenues and operating profit. Revenue and
operating profit were up 34% and 45% respectively versus a year ago. We shipped 182 million MSM Chipsets, above
our prior expectations, reflecting strong demand across our portfolio, including China emerging account shipments,
which more than doubled year-over-year, and multimode 3G LTE shipments up more than 90% sequentially.
We were pleased to see our chipsets driving many of the flagship smartphone models announced this holiday season,
including the Google Nexus 4, the LG Optimus G, the Nokia Lumia models and Samsung Galaxy S3 and ATIV S, the
HTC Droid DNA 8X and 8S, the Motorola RAZR M and the Sony Xperia T and TL. With our leading technologies,
broad product roadmap and relationships with all the top OEMs in the industry, our design pipeline continues to grow.
There have been more than 600 Snapdragon-based devices announced and another 170-plus devices announced based
on our QUALCOMM reference design solutions. Looking ahead, there are more than 450 Snapdragon-based designs in
development and over 100-plus designs based on our QRD solutions. As you know, our strategy is to set the
technology design point for our industry, and we have succeeded again with our recently announced Snapdragon 600
and 800 chipsets. Our new Snapdragon 600 processor builds on the momentum of our highly successful S4 Pro
Processor. The 600 includes our new quad-core Krait 300 CPU, running up to 1.9 gigahertz, and our Adreno 320 GPU.
Our new Snapdragon 800 processor includes our new quad-core Krait 400 CPU, running at up to 2.3 gigahertz, our new
Adreno 330 GPU with two times the compute performance of our Adreno 320, the third generation of our leading LTE
modem, which adds LTE Advanced and carrier aggregation support as well as integrated 802.11ac Wi-Fi. In addition,
the Snapdragon 800 is the first chip in the industry to use TSMC's 28-nanometer HPM advanced process technology.
We expect Snapdragon 600 and 800 chipsets to deliver up to 40% and 75% better performance respectively than our
previously industry-leading Snapdragon S4 Pro. There are already more than 90 designs in development using the 600
and 800 processors, and we expect commercial devices based on the 600 in the second calendar quarter of this year and

based on the 800 in the middle of this year.
We are also continuing to invest and grow our business in emerging regions and with our differentiated technologies
and products, we believe we are well positioned versus the competition in this segment as subscribers migrate from 2G
to 3G and multimode 3G LTE. Last week in China, we held our biannual QRD event with participation by 145 OEMs
and ODMs. We had multiple emerging accounts including Yulong and Tianyu announce handsets based on the
Snapdragon 8x25Q, making it the first quad-core chip for high volume 3G smartphones. There are now over 60 8x25Q
designs in the pipeline from over 25 OEMs.
Separately, we have also announced a reference design for our 8x30 chipset, which contains dual Krait CPUs,
integrated LTE TDD and TD-SCDMA and support for all operators in China. Also of note, the first TD-SCDMA
device based on a Snapdragon processor was launched by Nokia in the December quarter on time.
Our mobile connectivity design traction continues to grow with 400-plus devices based on our 28-nanometer S4 and
Snapdragon 600/800 products. We also announced our first NFC chipset with a new triband 802.11ac/ad reference
design and our StreamBoost technology to intelligently optimize home network performance.
We are off to a great start in fiscal 2013 with exciting growth opportunities ahead including continued global
smartphone and multimode 3G LTE demand. We continue to manage our business for long-term revenue and operating
profit growth, and we continue to see the year unfolding broadly in line with our initial expectations.
That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel.
William E. Keitel
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.
We had record quarterly results and we are pleased to be raising our estimates for fiscal 2013 revenue and earnings per
share. Our record first quarter revenues of $6 billion were up 29% year-over-year and at the high end of our prior
guidance. Non-GAAP operating income was a record $2.45 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per
share were a record $1.26 per share, up 30% year-over-year and $0.14 above the midpoint of our prior guidance.
QTL contributed $0.06 of gross margin improvement driven primarily by greater than expected 3G/4G device
shipments. QCT contributed $0.05 of gross margin improvement on the strength of higher MSM shipments and
favorable product costs. Lower operating expenses contributed $0.02 and higher returns on our cash and marketable
securities contributed $0.01.
Total reported device sales reported by our licensees for last September's quarter were a record $53.3 billion, above the
high end of our prior guidance. Greater than expected device shipments in both developed and emerging regions
particularly China. We estimate that total reported device sales were comprised of between 233 million to 237 million
3G/4G device shipments at an average selling price of $224 to $230 per unit.
QTL's operating margin was 87% and we shipped a record 182 million MSMs during the quarter exceeding the higher
end of our prior guidance and QCT's operating margin was 26%.
As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in November we are seeing more efficiency in the 3G/4G inventory channel as the
industry continues to move toward an open retail channel versus a carrier centric channel. Consistent with that trend
our MSM delivery interval has been shortening which introduces additional volatility in the timing of shipments and
therefore impacts our ability to accurately forecast quarterly MSM shipment timing.
Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were lower sequentially which was a bit better than our prior
expectations. Operating cash flow was a healthy $2 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 33% of revenues. During the
first quarter we returned $678 million to stockholders including cash dividends of $428 million and $250 million to
repurchase 4.3 million shares.

We are increasing our estimate for calendar 2012 3G/4G device shipments to between 915 million to 940 million units,
up approximately 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. The increase to our calendar 2012 estimate is driven by global
demand for 3G/4G devices, particularly in emerging regions including China and Latin America.
Turning to our guidance, given continued global macroeconomic uncertainties we are continuing to maintain a cautious
outlook for the year ahead. We are reaffirming our estimate for calendar 2013 3G/4G device shipments of between 1
billion and 1.07 billion units, up approximately 8% to 15% year-over-year.
We are raising fiscal 2013 revenue guidance by approximately $400 million and we now expect fiscal 2013 revenues to
be $23.4 billion to $24.4 billion, up approximately 25% year-over-year at the midpoint. We are raising our non-GAAP
earnings per share guidance by $0.13. We now anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.25 to $4.45, up
approximately 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. We are also raising our guidance for GAAP earnings per share by
$0.21 and we now expect GAAP earnings per share of $3.61 to $3.81, up approximately 6% year-over-year at the
midpoint.
We are reiterating our prior fiscal 2013 guidance estimates for QTL ASP, QCT and QTL operating margin percentages,
as well as non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense growth.
We estimate our non-GAAP annual tax rate to be approximately 17% to 18% for fiscal 2013, below our prior estimate,
reflecting the retroactive extension of the federal R&D tax credit among other factors. The R&D tax credit benefit
related to fiscal 2012 will be recorded in our fiscal second quarter and consistent with our prior guidance will be
excluded from non-GAAP results.
Now turning to the second fiscal quarter, we estimate revenues of $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion, up approximately 22%
year-over-year at the midpoint. And we estimate non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.18, up approximately
13% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect second fiscal quarter GAAP earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.06 per
share.
We expect total reported device sales by our licensees to be $57.5 billion to $62.5 billion, up approximately 16%
year-over-year and up approximately 13% sequentially at the midpoint, reflecting again strong 3G/4G base device
shipments in the busy December holiday quarter. We anticipate QCT shipments of 163 million to 173 million MSM
chips during the March quarter, down sequentially, which is typical coming off the busy holiday quarter, but up
approximately 11% year-over-year at the midpoint.
Our estimate for 3G/4G channel inventory through fiscal 2013 is consistent with our prior expectations remaining
within the 11 to 16 week range as we discussed at our analyst day. We anticipate second quarter non-GAAP R&D and
SG&A expenses combined will increase approximately 10% to 12% sequentially reflecting increased seasonal
expenses typical for this time of year, notably employer payroll taxes and increased marketing expenses.
We estimate our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 16%, lower than what we expect for the
full year because it will take account of two quarters of the retroactive R&D tax credit approved by Washington.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Paul Jacobs.
Dr. Paul E. Jacobs
Thanks, Bill. So before we go on to Q&A, I wanted to let you all know that Bill has decided to retire from
QUALCOMM effective March 11. Bill's been a great partner to me and an outstanding leader in his role as CFO for
QUALCOMM over the past 11 years. His financial leadership has played a critical role in establishing QUALCOMM
as a company known not only for leading edge technology but also for superb fiscal performance and rigorous financial
discipline. Over the years he's helped earn QUALCOMM, its finance and Investor Relations organization and himself
many distinguished awards for excellence in financial reporting. Under Bill's leadership the company has achieved
unprecedented financial growth and success, particularly through some very challenging economic environments. And
on behalf of the entire executive committee and all our employees worldwide I would like to thank Bill for his strong

financial leadership, partnership and incredible dedication to QUALCOMM.
So we wish you all the best. We're pleased that you've agreed to stay at QUALCOMM to ensure a smooth transition
and will continue throughout the year to serve in an advisory role in the company. So thanks again, Bill.
I'm also very pleased to announce that after careful consideration, George Davis will join QUALCOMM as Bill's
successor and our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. George currently serves as CFO for
Applied Materials and will join QUALCOMM on March 11. George is a seasoned financial executive and has been
CFO at Applied Materials since 2006. We look forward to George joining QUALCOMM's executive team and working
closely with him. His financial expertise and leadership will be instrumental as we continue to expand our business and
strive to deliver strong financial results.
So I'd like to thank Bill again for his many years of leadership and commitment to QUALCOMM and I look forward to
introducing all of you to George at our next quarter's earnings call, so I will now turn the call back over to Warren
Kneeshaw. Thanks, Bill.

Thank you, Paul. Operator, we are ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Mike Walkley from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike Walkley>: Bill, best wishes for a wonderful retirement. It was always great to work with you and my
question's really for Steve just on the competitive dynamics. Can you update us on how you're seeing your competitors:
one in the low end as there's a lot of talk about quad-core competition and then on the high end on the LTE side, are
you seeing any increased competition this year? Thank you.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Hi, Mike. It's Steve. I think there's two dynamics. On the high end it's all about
technology leadership and I think we've been able to keep ourselves in a pretty good position both on the modem side
as well as on the AP side. On the low end it's about scale and I think speed of execution. Both of those things I think
are benefits that we bring to the table as well.
We've come out with a number of products on the low end. The first one is the 8x25Q, which I think is being received
quite well. We also announced at our event last week in Shenzhen that we're going to come out with the first of what
will become many new low end optimized chipsets which is the 8x26. There'll be multiple chipsets like that coming out
over the years.
So I think we feel like we've got a pretty good roadmap on the high side and low side right now. In fact, I would say
we're probably biased positively now on share. We just feel like the roadmap and some of the investments are starting
to pay off.
<Q - Mike Walkley>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Yeah, another question for Steve. When you say you're positively biased for share, particularly
in China. Can you talk about how you see that playing out in terms of where you think you're at from a standpoint of

low end 3G share in that market and then overall share in that market?
And then another question. On the yield efficiencies with the foundries, our checks indicate [indiscernible] (26:06) sees
a 95% yield efficiency on 28-nanometer now. How do you see that playing out for you with regard to your margins for
this year? Do you see 28-nanometers being perhaps more cost effective than 45-nanometer this year? And what about
as you bring other foundries on like GlobalFoundries? Do you see that giving you some leverage on your margins in
the QCT side of the business? Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Brian, on the first question, I think – remind me again, that was related to – low...
<Q - Brian Modoff>: You noted earlier when you talked about China competition, you said on the low end you're
biased positively now on share. Can you kind of quantify that a little bit, particularly with regard to China? Where do
you see your market share on the low end and then overall in that market? Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Yeah, well, I think I'll try to stay away from any individual number, but what you're
seeing in terms of a dynamic is that there's a conversion of 2G to 3G at the same time you're getting a conversion to
smartphones. So for us we are picking up new customers and new geographies because those transitions are essentially
giving us access to what would be traditionally just 2G volume. So we've been ramping our ability to address those
customers, as you know, over the last several years and they're starting to play into our hands.
Also, there's been a push and I think you'll see a push over the next 12 months where technology will be turning over in
the large carriers in the world, in particular in China, and they'll start demanding some of the combination 3G/4G
technology that we have. And I think that's probably a reasonable setup for us. A technology change has actually
always been good for us on the chipset business.
Your second question was about yields I think. What's happening with us – we've actually been quite pleased actually
as to how 28-nanometer's ramped in terms of yield. I think Bill also mentioned in his remarks how we had some
positive product cost in the last quarter which was actually a result of that. We're starting to bring on multiple fabs with
more gusto now. You will see – however, at the end of the year, you will see us transition the portfolio into HPM. So I
don't know to the degree that those events sort of produce anything different than what Bill would have talked about in
terms of the margin profile, but pretty much according to plan I think at this point.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Thank you.
Operator
Tim Long from Bank of Montreal, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tim Long>: Thank you. Congratulations, Bill, on the retirement. Well deserved. You will be missed. I've got a
two-parter for you on the royalty side. First, on the calculated rate, I know it does move around but by my numbers it
went down about 10 basis points sequential. So just curious if there's anything abnormal in there other than just mix.
And then secondly, I just want to bring you back to something you had mentioned at the analyst day where there was
the potential for 25% unit growth in the fourth quarter. That's what you typically see. It looks like the midpoint of the
guidance is a good amount below that. Could you address why? Is that just because the September quarter was maybe
more than seasonal? Or was there some other reason why we're looking like mid high teens sequential in the fourth
quarter when we normally see more? Thank you.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Hey, Tim. This is Derek. Let me take your first question on the rate. I think we were finishing
the last quarter around 33.8, and you're right, we're coming in a bit lower this quarter at about 33. It's really a function
of the things that we've talked about in the past. But this quarter, probably the biggest driver is the fact that we had
record TRDS. And in fact, it came in higher than we expected and so that given the fixed licensing fees that roll
through and the infrastructure royalties that grow at a slower pace is going to have kind of a downward pressure on the
rate. So that's really the primary driver. We also had other fluctuations, including lower audit recoveries and mix in
there. But that's really the primary driver.

<A - William E. Keitel>: Tim, this is Bill. On the – that – taking us back to the analyst day and looking for upwards of
a 25% unit growth from the September to December quarter, the difference we see now, we're – our midpoint estimate
is about a 17% growth, third quarter to fourth quarter, and a bit lower than we were previously expecting, but it's the
result of a very strong September that came through in our licensee reports.

Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the retirement, Bill. So just first of
all I wanted to revisit the 28-nanometer situation. I think the numbers suggest anyway you guys cleared some backlog
in fiscal Q1 to December or maybe a good chunk of it. And I just wonder if you could comment on – maybe, Steve,
you could comment on the backlog status as we head into fiscal Q2. Is most of that now cleared? Or is some of your
guidance including some backlog clearance? So that would be helpful if you could help us understand that.
And then, Bill, I guess it's my last chance to ask this one, but could you comment on your underlying GDP growth
expectation in your forecast now? Has it changed since you guys reported last quarter?
And, Steve, if you could comment maybe on the 8x26 shipping date as well. I don't know if you want to comment on
that, but I was just curious whether that – devices with that product could ship in the middle of the year or are we still
looking sort of toward the end of the year when those devices would ship into the market? Thanks.
<A - Steven M. Mollenkopf>: Rod, this is Steve. I'll just knock those out pretty quickly. In terms of 28-nanometer, we
– I think we probably cleared that sometime in the middle of the quarter that we just reported on. There was some
discussion in the industry about some of the OEMs also having some constraints outside of our part, touchscreens and
things like that. You've probably read as many as I have on that. But I don't know to the degree that that's been cleared
or not.
The 8x26 just to finish up, is really the end of this calendar year.
<A - William E. Keitel>: And, Rod, Bill here. On the GDP growth estimate that's underlying our current plan, it's
unchanged from the time of the analyst meeting. At the time of the analyst meeting, consensus GDP worldwide from
economists was about 3.4%. And we thought that was a bit rosy. We based our plan on 3% world GDP. Recently,
consensus economists were down to 3.2% and we're maintaining our basis of a 3% worldwide GDP growth for 2013.

<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Appreciate it. Bill definitely will be missed. Thanks for all the help and time over the years.
So have fun in retirement.
A couple questions. Question 1: when I look at your guidance for the TRDS and back it out of your full year guidance –
I'm sorry – your future guidance for the full company and then back into a QCT guidance and then look at your unit
shipment guidance for next quarter, you can sort of back into what you're thinking about ASPs. It looks a little bit like
you're guiding ASPs, Steve, to be up next quarter is where I'm going for, in MSM shipments. And I just want to make
sure that the math is correct and that you are looking for ASPs and chips to go up at least one more quarter. And if so, if
you can give some color on the variability behind that and what happens going forward?

And then Bill, on margins for QCT, at the Analyst Day again I think you had guided to somewhere 18.5% to 20.5% for
the full fiscal year. We're now at 26% for Q1. Last year we did something similar. We started off at 23% and we came
down through the year but we had that funny thing with 28-nanometer that made the operating margin at the end of the
fiscal year unnaturally low. Do you still think we'll end up – you made the comment that you're unchanged from the
18.5% to 20.5%. But we've got to start pulling some 13%, 14%, 15% operating margins to get us back into that range
when we start off the year so strong at 26%. So I guess what I'm saying is do you really still believe that? And if so,
why would it get that low near the end of the year?
<A - William E. Keitel>: Okay. Ehud, this is Bill. I'll take both those questions. On the MSM ASP expectation there
we had expected to increase a bit sequentially in the first fiscal quarter and we successfully did that. And yes, you're
right, we do expect another increase sequentially in the second fiscal quarter. Somewhat of a pattern we're expecting
for the full fiscal year for QCT.
On the QCT op margins, we are holding to that guidance range that you gave. For the second quarter – second fiscal
quarter – we're expecting a fairly significant dip in the operating margins. It's based into the guidance we gave on a
plus, minus 17% kind of range. So – and the decrease there, four drivers: number one is the volume. We do expect a
decrease in MSM volume in the second fiscal quarter. Number two, QCT carries the bulk of the operating expense in
QUALCOMM and it's this time of year where we restart employee payroll taxes and the marketing expenses typically
tick up into January – starting in January relative to the December quarter. Thirdly, it's the time of year where we
typically do our price resets in the QCT business. And then lastly, the QCT team has a fairly high degree of activity of
new product work ongoing. And so we expect that to drive up the product costs starting with this quarter.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Okay. That's helpful. Can you give us a percentage like you do sometimes as to what percent
of R&D is going to future looking types of revenue or is that something that's not really quantifiable?
<A - William E. Keitel>: I would just repeat what we said at the analyst day that we've got approximately 30% of our
current R&D going towards projects that we don't expect to deliver revenue in fiscal 2013. Oh, excuse me, 27%. It was
30% the year prior. Came down to 27% is our current expectation.

Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thanks very much, and, Bill, I also wanted to extend my best wishes to you as well
into retirement. Just a couple of questions. One is more on the short term chipset guidance. I understand that you are
expecting some normal seasonality there but it seems that the decline that you're expecting is perhaps not as
conservative as I might have expected. You have the seasonality factor. You've also got one of your big customers,
Apple, whose implied decline in the March quarter is about the same magnitude as the total number that you're guiding
to. And so I'm just wondering if you're accounting for the normal seasonality outside of that one customer especially
given that there may have been some excess inventory in China and also given calendar Q4 was larger than normal for
you because of the shortage alleviation. On the other side of that wouldn't we see a bit more of a correction in the
March quarter? And then I have a longer term question as well.
<A - William E. Keitel>: Okay, Simona. On the Q2 chipset guidance – fiscal Q2 guidance – we did factor in
seasonality. The last few years we often see a dip going into the March quarter but relative to five, six, seven years ago
it's not as much as we used to see back then. So we have taken account of that.
We also think that the channel inventory is being managed pretty tightly. So hopefully we're right on that estimate and
therefore maybe a bit less dip than what you otherwise would see. If you recall from the Analyst Day many of our
customers are relying on us much more for their inventory needs and you'll see that when you look at our – get through
our financials. Our inventories grew pretty nicely in the December quarter, in line with what we wanted them to grow.
So I think we've got Q2 pegged pretty well, albeit, keep in mind that the order interval has decreased and so there is
more volatility in that MSM number. And then you had a second question?

<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Yes. So just a second question was on an update on the tablet market. Do you have a
sense for what percent of tablets are shipping with 3G and 4G attached in them right now as opposed to Wi-Fi? And
based on the builds you're seeing, where do you think that might be a year from now?
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Simona, this is Derek. I think the percentage of total units that have been shipping with 3G
attach has been relatively stable. It's bounced around a little bit and maybe come down the last couple quarters some,
but as we explained at the Analyst Conference I think Paul went through this in his presentation – we're really hoping
and expecting that to change course going forward now that we see more flexibility on the operator side with data plans
and hopefully more competition in the tablet device space with Windows RT and some of the new Android tablets
coming in.

Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and Bill, best of luck. Question on the annual
guidance. You're taking annual EPS up pretty much by less than you just beat and you have a lower tax rate going
forward and the OpEx is basically unchanged. I'm just wondering why that annual EPS guidance wouldn't be higher? It
doesn't feel like you're guiding to any lift at all into the back half of the year.
Also if you can – one more question if you could revisit that inventory question. I know you're talking about customers
relying on you to take more. But at the same time you built quite a bit of inventory in a quarter where – in front of a
quarter where chipsets are going down. If you could just help us rationalize what's actually going on with your own
internal inventories, that'd be very helpful.
<A - William E. Keitel>: Sure, Stacy. First on the EPS guidance, correct, relative to our midpoint for Q1 we came in
$0.14 higher and relative to the full year – relative to the midpoint we're raising our guidance by $0.13. So in so many
words what we're saying is that although we saw a real nice improvement here in the first quarter, we're cautious on the
remaining three quarters given the macro environment and so we're not adding to the improvement at least at this point
for the full fiscal year.
In terms of the tax item that you mentioned, yes, there was a positive on the – because of the R&D tax credit extension.
But if you recall though what we have here on the outlook is better for QTL. Pretty close what we previously had for
QCT and that on balance raises our tax rate. And so that was able to – with the R&D tax credit extension we were able
to offset that. There were a few other items that weren't that materials so I didn't mention them. For example, foreign
exchange in this outlook relative to the budget hit us about a penny. So you've got some small things that are offsetting
the benefit of the R&D tax credit extension but from an operating standpoint I think it's a pretty solid $0.13 raise for the
full year.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: And the inventories?
<A - William E. Keitel>: And then on the inventory, yes. We are increase – we have increased our inventory.
Remember now we're increasing – we've got a higher end product that we're – we've got a lot of demand for, which of
course, that aligns with our guidance that we do think average revenue per MSM is going be increasing here into the
second quarter – in fact into the full fiscal year.
So yes, our inventory is growing. We have been relatively short on inventory given the 28-nanometer production
shortfalls relative to demand. Now that's caught up and so with the boost in our inventory I think we're going be better
positioned now to handle the fluctuations that we typically see in customer order demand.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Great, very helpful. Thank you, guys.

Matthew Hoffman from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matthew Hoffman>: Bill, congrats on a job well done. So I'll get one last question in here for you. The largest
change in the regional forecast was the uptick in China. Can you give us some color on whether TD-SCDMA and
uptick there really affected your view in the forecast?
Then this one's maybe for Derek. As TD-SCDMA moves up the value chain here later this year and we start to see
more of a high end offering in TD-SCDMA, will that have a positive impact on the royalty rate assuming a greater
portion of the Chinese market has multimode phones and maybe even some export? Thanks.
<A - William E. Keitel>: Matt, this is Bill. On the first one on China, I think it was pretty broad-based. Yes, we are
updating our estimate a bit – improving our estimate for TD-SCDMA but the strength across all three operators is quite
strong. CDMA 2000 is going very strong. Take it back to the remarks that Paul gave earlier and then China Unicom
with WCDMA. So I think it's pretty widespread. China's going quite strong for 3G/4G devices and we've seen that
trend and our updated estimates here are just improving that trend a bit.
Much the same for Latin America, that's the other market of note I would draw your attention to. We've seen a lot of
strength there and just our most recent data points say that that's likely to be a bit stronger than what we had previously
been expecting.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: This is Derek. On the TD-SCDMA situation in China we have been continuing to collect
some amount of royalties on TD-SCDMA although, as we've said, we've struggled a bit with some of the local Chinese
companies. But I agree – we do see an opportunity as the volume hopefully migrates at the high end to multimode with
UMTS or even CDMA. And then with the trials launching – the inclusion of LTE, that should open up an opportunity
for us to collect on a larger portion of the China Mobile volume. Not sure it's specifically a rate issue but certainly an
opportunity to grow the revenue base.
<Q - Matthew Hoffman>: Thank you.
Operator
Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Yes. I have two questions. The first one is just I'd like to understand the assumptions about MSM
seasonality into – or semiconductor seasonality into the second half of the year because you're assuming, and I know
we spoke about it, but you're assuming that EPS is going to be down in second half 20% versus the first half. And in
last year that was a much worse year it was only down 15%. The previous year was down 13%. So you're assuming
that this year is going to be much worse seasonality-wise – much worse second half as first half. And I'm wondering
about the MSM assumptions. What drives this number so low? And I know you spoke a little bit about – you gave a
very detailed answer. So I want to focus my question just about the MSM assumptions for the rest of the year. Thanks.
<A - William E. Keitel>: Okay. Tal, it's Bill. I'll take a cut at it and then maybe others want to add into it. On MSM
seasonality, we do expect – obviously we've given you our estimates – our guidance for fiscal Q2. If you just take the
midpoint of that, we are expecting a decrease. Midpoint's about 169 million MSMs compared to the 182 million we just
reported having shipped in Q1. Then going into Q3 at this point we're modeling a flattish number and then an increase
going into the fourth fiscal quarter.
On the – how that correlates this year to our earnings per share as compared to prior years, recall that in the last couple
of years the QTL earnings strength has been very strong, at least in proportion to the QCT earnings strength, whereas
this year, although we're looking for both business segments to grow at a double digit rate, we're looking for QCT
growth to be substantially greater than the earnings growth for coming from QTL.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Okay.

Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead your question.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks, and congratulations to Bill again on a job well done. On QCT I understand some
of the drivers with respect to the margin decline. The question I have for Bill and Steve is – the level of market share
that you guys have in LTE, the mix shift that you're seeing on the ASP side that's going to probably continue, should be
positive drivers throughout the year as well. Just the magnitude of the QCT margin pressure seems surprising to me.
Now, why isn't that a reason why just the margins aren't a structurally higher level? Maybe they do drop, but certainly
to 17% or 18% in the coming quarters seems quite extreme. So I'm just trying to understand why that isn't more of a
positive driver or are you taking something aggressive on the pricing side more meaningfully than we think?
And then a question for Derek specifically on licensing. There's a building sense now and it's becoming quite clear that
you're going to sell maybe 200 million, maybe 250 million 3G enabled smartphones from the Asian Taiwanese chipset
community, whether it's MediaTek, Spreadtrum, et cetera, and you guys should be able to license those phones. How
much of that market are you actually assuming that you can license in this year's guidance? Are you being cautious
because it's a different ecosystem to license? Or is a significant amount of that embedded into your estimate somehow?
Any sense around that would be helpful.
<A - William E. Keitel>: Kulbinder, first on the QCT margins – it's Bill. I gave the four major drivers for the decrease
that is built into our estimate. I'm not going to – I'm going to stay away from assigning a value to any one of those four.
It'll have to suffice to say that we're very comfortable with our forward plan in the business. It is a large decrease in the
operating margin, but it is, as we've said in the past, we're going to see quarterly swings. It's nothing changed on what
our three to five year goals are for the QCT business, nor our ability – our sense of our ability to achieve those goals.
So there are a lot of factors, obviously, but I would just say the pricing that we give is very thoughtful, very well
considered and it's always with a mind towards where we're going to be looking a few years out.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: This is Derek. Let me go ahead and take your second question. So there isn't really a different
base of customers that are buying from MediaTek or others. I mean, we have now, as we've talked about, I think more
than 70 companies licensed in China, and pretty much all the major suppliers in Taiwan have been licensed for quite
some time, and those agreements require them to pay royalties regardless of whether it's our chip or anybody else's
chip. And so when we think about the market and we give our projections, we're really trying to capture the entirety.
And I feel very confident that maybe with the exception of some of the TD-SCDMA volume that I spoke about a few
minutes ago, we're really well positioned to capture the sales of all 3G and 4G devices that are going to be supplied,
irrespective of the chipset that's in there.

A couple of questions. First, touching on the revisions or lack thereof for 2012 and 2013, Bill, you indicated that you
hadn't changed your GDP assumption, but yet we saw pretty substantial revisions up for 2012. So just wondering if
there was anything that made you feel more cautious about how that GDP could have impacted us, especially since we

And then, Derek, I wanted to follow up on Kulbinder's questions, I guess, related to licensing. In particular on
TD-SCDMA, could you give us an estimate as to what you think your current coverage or collection portion is on the
TD-SCDMA handsets that are being shipped? Thank you.
<A - William E. Keitel>: James, on the first one, we did see a very – we are seeing a very nice upside to calendar 2012
3G/4G units. And I would just generally say it's fairly widespread by geography but it's largely two main drivers. One
is the upgrade rate. Apparently subscribers upgrading to smartphones or upgrading their existing smartphone is one of
the major drivers. And then secondly, we think we're continuing to see good progress on migration of 2G to 3G.
We don't have a specific reason as to why those wouldn't continue to be positive factors into 2013. It was simply a
matter of – we're only three months into the new fiscal year. And we concluded that we have a positive bias in that
3G/4G unit forecast for 2013, but we thought it was just a bit early in the year to be raising our estimates there. We
thought let's wait another three months, see where we're at at that time. Although the – we're very pleased, obviously,
with the total 3G/4G market, I think we all have to be cautious given the macro-economic environment that we're all
seeing here. So I would just say, positive bias, but not enough at this point to cause us to raise those estimates.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: James, this is Derek. Let me take your second question. The information on the TD-SCDMA
volume in China is a bit difficult to get your arms around completely at times. And I don't have – I can't give you a
specific percentage today. I will say that as time has gone on and there's been shifts in, sort of, the supplier base, the
percentage of total units as best we can tell that we're actually collecting royalties on has come down some over time.
But then as you go forward, as I said, there's some trends that are going to shift things, we think, back in the other
direction, a higher percentages of these devices that are going to be multi-mode with either LTE or UMTS. So it's
really a bit hard to pin it down.
The other thing just to make sure is clear, when we give our estimates for unit shipments for the year, what we include
is the percentage of total TD-SCDMA that we expect to get reported to us and royalties to be paid on.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Barclays.
<Q - Jeff T. Kvaal>: Yes, gentlemen. Thanks very much. And again, Bill, congratulations and best of luck. My
question, Derek, is for you, and I am wondering if you can talk us through a little bit big-picture about where you feel
that we are in the migration from 2G to royalty-bearing phones. How far along in the penetration wave are we and how
quickly do you think we might move up that penetration wave over the course of the next few years? And I think the
idea is – and we've seen some exceptionally impressive growth out of QTL over the course of the last few years, as Bill
suggested himself, that the mix seems to be shifting the other way, at least this way – this year. Should that continue?
How should we think about the growth trajectory in that business? Thank you.
<A - Derek K. Aberle>: Sure, excuse me. I think what Bill said is, I think we're seeing exceptional growth out of the
QCT business this year, but we're still expecting significant growth from QTL as well. So we're not suggesting we're
expecting a decline there. It's more that QCT is really accelerating.
So you've got to think about it a couple different ways. One is, if you look at the unit shipments, there's still a pretty
decent amount of 2G volume out there that will be shifted over to 3G. When you think about it from a TRDS
perspective, meaning the units times the ASP, actually the volume out there on 2G looks a bit smaller. But I think the
opportunity ahead is quite great because we're expecting when those units transition from 2G to 3G, they're going to
transition at a higher ASP, whether that's initially a feature phone, although those are rapidly going away, or more
likely a low-end smartphone.
So as we look at our plan, and we've said, we expect continued strong growth in the business over the five-year plan,
that's because we see still quite a long runway. I think China still has, what, about 26% penetration. That was in Paul's
note today, or the comments today and we've got places like Latin America, Eastern Europe, some very large markets
that still have quite a ways to go through the transition and I think as they do that, they will go through at, I think, at a

Mark McKechnie from Evercore Partners, please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark McKechnie>: Great. At the end of the cycle here. But, hey, Bill, your onshore cash grew nicely sequential,
I believe. I think, what, by like $4 billion or so, am I right? And maybe you can tell us a little bit about how that
happened? And if you feel like the onshore/offshore cash challenges have subsided a bit here? Thanks.
<A - William E. Keitel>: Sure, Mark. Yeah, total cash grew nicely, and more so on the offshore. But offshore –
onshore did increase as well. I mean, we're clearly in a position where we're hoping our 10b5-1 program that we have
in place will trigger to use up some of that onshore cash. We think we're in a bit of an excess position on the onshore.
But having said that, I think you know our philosophy, we like to be very patient on those buybacks, and our history
has shown that that's been the prudent thing to do, that eventually we'll deploy that cash. But at least historically, we've
been able to deploy it in a way that's a very good return for the shareholder.
On the offshore and your question, am I more optimistic, I think I'm probably just a nod less optimistic on timing. I
think we've all seen that we haven't seen any – much – or let's say, sufficient cooperation in Washington, that is giving
me more optimism on an effective corporate tax reform, which is really what's needed. And clearly the agenda here in
the near-term seems it's going be consumed with debt ceiling, sequester, gun control and immigration. However, I
remain hopeful. I think it can be a good driver to further improvement in the American economy. So I remain hopeful,
but my timeframe on hope has just moved out a bit.

It's hard to imagine that this is the last earnings call I'm going do with Bill. So I just want to say congratulations again
and thanks, Bill, very, very much.
William E. Keitel
Thank you, Paul. I'm going to miss QUALCOMM greatly. I will. Thank you.
Dr. Paul E. Jacobs
Don't go too far away from us, Bill. You're still part of the family. And, of course, we're looking forward to welcoming
George at the next call and have to say it's a great time because the company's really executing extremely well and
we're competing both at the high end and the value segment in smartphones which are continuing to grow globally.
Real excited about the new products, the new Snapdragons are gaining a lot of traction and we're porting new radio
technologies, new processors, new graphics, just all sorts of things that are getting integrated into those devices really
driving our lead and using our scale to advantage in terms of being able to invest in R&D and invest early and drive
that. And obviously the licensing business continues to grow strongly. S

So a ton of opportunities ahead of us both in the traditional businesses and in the non-handset devices and so I think the
company's very, very well positioned to seize the opportunities we see for the future. So thanks very much to all of you
and I guess we'll probably see some of you in Barcelona. So thanks again. Thanks, Bill.
