Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. 3M finished the year strong; delivered both record sales and record
earnings in the fourth quarter. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we posted organic growth everywhere in all business
groups and in all geographic areas. We did that while expanding margins, increasing profits and investing in our future.
I'll take you through a few numbers. Earnings per share rose to $1.81, up 11.7% year-over-year. Sales was $7.7 billion,
a fourth quarter record.
Organic growth company wide was 6%, paced by Safety and Graphics at 9%. Our other four business groups, Health
Care, Electronics and Energy, Industrial, and Consumer, each grew a solid 6%. We saw organic growth in every
geographic area. Both APAC and United States grew 7%. For the United States, that marked its strongest growth of the
year. Latin America/Canada grew 9% while Europe/Middle East/Africa grew 3%.
Our team is clearly capable of executing in tough environments and fighting through tough headwinds. That includes a
stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced fourth quarter sales by more than 4%, yet we still delivered good top and bottom
line growth.
Operating margins remained healthy at 21.5%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. We again generated strong
cash flow with a conversion rate of 144%. This allow us to invest in the business and continue rewarding shareholders.
We returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And in December, we announced a
20% per share increase in our Q1 dividend for 2015 on top of a 35% increase in 2014.
Overall, we finished the year strong and I thank the entire 3M team for their hard work and execution. Nick will now
go through the details. Nick?
Nicholas C. Gangestad
Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 4, where I'll review the components of our fourth
quarter sales change. Worldwide organic local currency growth was 6.3% with volumes up 5.6% and selling prices up
0.7%. This was our strongest quarterly organic growth since Q1 2011. The Treo acquisition added 10 basis points to
growth and the stronger dollar reduced sales by 4.4%. All-in, sales rose 2% versus fourth quarter of 2013.
Leading the way with 9% organic growth was Latin America/Canada, where Electronics and Energy, Health Care, and
Safety and Graphics all grew double digits. Mexico delivered strong double digit growth in the quarter and Brazil was
up slightly. Asia Pacific grew 6.9%. Safety and Graphics and Health Care led the way with growth of 12% and 9%
respectively. Organic growth was 9% in Japan, or 4% excluding Electronics.
China Hong Kong grew 4% or 6% excluding Electronics. The United States grew 6.6% led by Industrial at 10%,
Health Care, Consumer and Safety and Graphics all grew 7%. EMEA posted organic growth of 3.3% in the quarter.
Central East Europe and Middle East Africa each grew double digits while West Europe grew 1%.
EMEA economies remained soft, but our teams are managing the situation well by growing our market positions and
driving continuous productivity across the region. Organic growth within EMEA was positive in four of our five
businesses led by Safety and Graphics and Electronics and Energy. Consumer was down slightly in the quarter.
Turn to slide 5 for the fourth quarter P&L highlights. Fourth quarter sales were $7.7 billion, up 2% year-on-year with
6% organic growth more than offsetting the stronger dollar. Operating income rose 5% to $1.7 billion and earnings per
share rose 12% year-on-year. We increased operating margins by 60 basis points year-on-year while continuing to
invest for the future.
I'll now go into more details on our margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 40 basis points to operating
margins and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed 60 basis points.
Selling prices increased year-on-year across many of our businesses supported by technology innovation, brand and
strong new product flow. Raw materials were again lower versus last year's comparable quarter. Commodity prices

declined as we closed out Q4, and we expect these tailwinds to accelerate in 2015.
Lower pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to margins. Strategic investments reduced margins by 80 basis
points. This includes increases in disruptive R&D programs, business transformation and ERP costs and restructuring.
During Q4 we took portfolio actions totaling $30 million spread across the United States, Western Europe and Asia
Pacific.
Foreign currency exchange reduced margins by 10 basis points, and the Treo acquisition was just slightly dilutive.
Finally, productivity resulted in a benefit of 10 basis points to margins year-on-year. Earnings were $1.81 per share, an
increase of 12%. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedging, reduced earnings by $0.05 a share, given the broad-based
strength of the dollar. A lower year-on-year tax rate added a penny to per share earnings, and average diluted shares
outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's fourth quarter, which added $0.08 to fourth quarter earnings per share.
Now I'll review cash flow performance on slide number 6. Free cash flow was strong in Q4 with 144% conversion
versus 131% in last year's fourth quarter. Operating cash flow increased $190 million driven by multiple factors,
including higher net income and improved fixed and working capital efficiencies. For the year, we delivered 104% free
cash flow conversion.
We continue to manage toward a better optimized capital structure by adding balance sheet leverage, which we are
using for two purposes: first, to invest in our businesses; and second, to increase cash returns to shareholders.
Full year capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, an important element as we continue to expand the business
organically. We paid $2.2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends during 2014, up $486 million versus 2013. As a
reminder, on December 16th, we communicated a Q1 2015 dividend increase of 20% per share. And in terms of
buybacks, gross share repurchases in 2014 were $5.7 billion, up $440 million year-on-year. Net debt at the end of
December was $3.5 billion, up $2.3 billion from year end 2013.
Next, I'll go through the results of our business groups starting with Industrial on slide 7. Industrial with sales of $2.6
billion delivered strong organic local currency growth of nearly 6% in the quarter. Advanced materials led the way with
double-digit growth. Our aerospace and commercial transportation business generated high single-digit growth, and we
also saw strong growth in industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket and auto OEM.
All regions delivered growth for Industrial, paced again by the U.S. at 10%. The U.S. growth was broad-based with
notable performances in the three Industrial heartland businesses; industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive
aftermarket and abrasives. Latin America/Canada grew 6% followed by Asia Pacific at 5% and EMEA at 1%.
Operating income was $538 million, and operating margins were 20.5%, down 90 basis points versus last year's
all-time Q4 record margin, which was driven by very strong productivity. Investments were higher year-on-year,
including efforts to better optimize elements of our U.S. supply chain. Fourth quarter 2014 operating margins were in
line with normal seasonal trends. And for the full year, margins were a solid 21.7%, up 10 basis points versus 2013.
Let's now look at Health Care on slide 8. Health Care delivered another very good quarter with sales of $1.4 billion in
organic growth of over 6%. Every health care business posted positive organic growth. Our large core medical
businesses, namely infection prevention and critical and chronic care, posted strong growth in the quarter. Health
information systems and food safety each grew double digits.
Health Care grew organically in all geographic areas led by Latin America/Canada at 12% and Asia Pacific at 9%. The
U.S. grew 7% and EMEA grew 3%. In developing markets, Health Care grew 15% organically, marking the 12th
consecutive quarter of double digit growth. This has been a high priority investment area of ours for some time and
these investments are paying off. We continue to build our capability to expand even further into the future.
Operating income was $431 million and margins remained strong at 31%, which includes 30 basis points of dilution
from the Treo acquisition. Integration efforts are tracking to our expectations and the business continues to exceed sales
and profit objectives.

Please turn to slide 9. Electronics and Energy continued to build momentum with strong fourth quarter results. Sales
were $1.4 billion with organic growth over 6%. Operating income was $257 million and margins increased 2
percentage points year-over-year to 18.7%. Recent portfolio management actions are enhancing our relevance with
customers and generating operational efficiencies, which contributed to the growth and margin improvement in the
quarter and for the year.
Organic local currency sales grew 9% in our electronics related businesses as we continue to see strong end customer
demand enhanced by spec-in wins at several OEMs. In our energy related businesses, organic local currency sales
increased 2%. The electrical markets business was up high single digits, while renewable energy and telecom both
declined year-on-year.
On a geographic basis, organic growth in Electronics and Energy increased 13% in Latin America/Canada, 7% in Asia
Pacific and 5% in EMEA. The United States was flat year-on-year.
Please turn to slide 10. Fourth quarter sales in Safety and Graphics were $1.4 billion, up a robust 9% organic rate.
Personal safety grew double digits as we continued to see strong demand for 3M safety solutions in the manufacturing
sector. In addition, our respiratory products are selling well in China, where air quality is an ongoing concern.
We also saw a pickup in sales related to Ebola in the quarter. We estimate this added approximately $30 million to Q4
sales. Elsewhere in Safety and Graphics, commercial solutions grew mid single digits and organic sales declined
slightly in roofing granules and traffic safety and security.
Asia Pacific delivered 12% growth for Safety and Graphics led by personal safety. Growth was 10% in Latin
America/Canada, 9% in EMEA, and 7% in the United States. Operating income was $285 million, and operating
margins increased 1.6 percentage points to 20.8%. This result was driven by strong organic growth and productivity.
I'll finish with the Consumer business group found on slide 11. Fourth quarter sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion with
organic growth of nearly 6%. All four businesses in Consumer grew organically, led by a double digit increase in
do-it-yourself. This business continues to win in the marketplace with leading brands such as Filtrete filters and
Command adhesives. We also saw good growth in consumer health care with notable strength in our Futuro branded
health supports.
Looking by geography, U.S. organic growth was 7%, boosted by a strong holiday sell-in of Scotch and other 3M
branded products. Elsewhere, organic growth was 8% in Latin America/Canada and 5% in Asia Pacific. EMEA
declined 1% year-on-year.
Operating income increased 12% to $254 million, and margins were 22.5%. Margins rose 2.1 percentage points
year-over-year. The combination of strong organic growth, productivity and portfolio prioritization continued to drive
efficiencies across the business.
That wraps up my review of the quarter. I'll hand it back to Inge.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Nick. The fourth quarter was a strong ending to an equally strong year. In 2014, we deliver a record $32
billion in sales. We grew organically in each business group and geographic area with a good balance between
developed and developing markets. We expanded margins and returned a record $7.9 billion to shareholders. We also
made good progress on each of our long-term financial objectives, which I laid out at our Investor Meeting here in St.
Paul on November 8, 2012.
On earnings per share, our target is 9% to 11% average growth. In 2014, we grew EPS 11.5%. On organic growth, our
target is 4% to 6%. We grew 4.9% organically for the year. For return on invested capital, our target is 20%. In 2014,
we achieved 22%. Finally, on free cash flow conversion, our target is 100%. For the year, we hit 104%.

Driving our success is the skill of our people and the strength of our business model, which includes three key levers.
The first is portfolio management. Since 2012, we have realigned our portfolio from six sectors to five business groups
and for 40 businesses to 27.
In 2014, we combined businesses within three of our business groups, Electronics and Energy, Safety and Graphics and
Industrial. All-in, we invested $90 million in 2014 in portfolio actions to position us for greater future success.
We also look to enhance our portfolio and complement organic growth through M&A. In 2014 we invested $1 billion
in acquisitions including the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary, one of 3M's most successful businesses. We
also just recently divested our traffic control business. Active portfolio management is delivering significant benefit for
3M, including greater customer relevance, scale and productivity.
Investing in innovation is our second lever. 3M's primary growth strategy is organic and we strive to develop unique
solutions that advance, enhance and improve outcomes for our customers. This is why research and development is the
heartbeat of our company. In 2014, we invested $1.8 billion in research and development. The strings of our innovation
engine helped drive organic growth of nearly 5% in the year. 3M also own more than 3,000 patents in 2014. In our
history, we have now own more than 100,000 patents globally.
The third lever is business transformation. At our Investor Meeting in December, I laid out our path forward, which
includes implementation of global ERP system. This will create a more agile and efficient 3M and allow us to better
serve customers around the world.
Looking at our 2014 performance, I see clear evidence that our playbook includes these three levers is continuing to
drive strong results and value creation. We expect to continue that momentum in 2015.
Please turn to slide 13 and I will review our outlook for the year. EPS guidance remains unchanged at $8 to $8.30.
Organic growth is still expected to be 3% to 6% in the range. Given the strength in U.S. dollar, we are seeing stronger
currency headwinds than expected in December.
We now estimate FX to reduce sales by 4% to 5% versus previous guidance of minus 2% to minus 3%. However, as
evident in our fourth quarter and full year result, we know how to operate in this environment. In addition, we see input
costs lower versus one month ago and our sourcing teams are focused on maximizing those benefits. Our tax rate
estimates remain to 28% to 29% with free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%. As you can see, we look forward to
another strong and successful year.
And with that, I thank you for your attention, and we now welcome your questions.

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Thank you. Good morning and.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Ajay.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Congratulations for nice results. So if I just look at the organic growth, to me it seems like
you're defying all the negative macro headlines out there. Imagine a lot of what you're seeing, what you're doing here
with like share gains, but, Inge, just maybe couple on that. I'd be curious, one, just on your take on what the macro is,
what you're seeing by geography. And then second, if you're able to kind of identify or talk to some of the markets that
you're seeing share gains that I would imagine some of this is share gains in terms of the growth of those markets.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, thank you. First of all, I am and we are pleased to see the momentum that has built over
many quarters now relative to organic local currency growth. And for me specifically why that is very encouraging is

that we have made a lot of efforts relative to our organization structure, both in United States but also outside of United
States to make sure we becoming more efficient and effective and more relevant to our customers, and I think that is
what we see paying off. And it's broad-based.
And I think that is also related to – we have a very diversified portfolio as a company. If you think about the five
business groups, we're very diversified from the business group perspective and we are very diversified graphically as
well with United States as the biggest geographical area for us and type of a homeland. So it's very nice to see it all
coming together for us.
When we looked upon the result for the quarter and then look out to the range for 2015, there's no change in the range
for us. We still believe – we had United States, we have a 7% organic growth for the quarter. We have said for 2015,
3% to 6% in the range. We believe that will be on the high end of that range in my mind as we sit here today, doing
very, very well.
APAC, we had another 7% in the quarter and we have seen businesses coming back a little bit both in China for us and
in Southeast Asia. And Japan had a very good year as well for us. But when you look upon that in terms of a range for
the year, we believe Asia is 3% to 7%, China's probably 4% to 10% and Japan a little bit lower. So there is good market
conditions for us in order to be able to grow.
Latin America, as you saw, came back and Latin America/Canada came back this quarter. And we talked about that at
the last call where we said, see, 5% to 8% for them as we roll into the year and we're still sticking with that. Brazil was
slightly positive. Mexico did very, very well. So I think when you look upon North America, U.S., Canada, Mexico,
has very good growth momentum for us.
And then West Europe, we would say, as we said before, a little bit of question mark. We have had that in the range of
minus 2% to plus 2% for the year. We had growth there of 1 percentage point in West Europe and Europe/Middle
East/Africa 3% for the quarter. And as we produce quite a bit in those countries, in terms of export, that should not be
too negative for us as we move ahead.
And, as you know, it's not only that research and development, which is driving organic local currency growth by the
way, but also the strategy we've had around domestic business models should play for us here. When you ask about
market share and so forth, we have many businesses, so it's difficult to go through all of them. But when I look upon, it
is clear that we take market share in many of our businesses.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Excellent. That's very helpful. And then quick one for Nick. Maybe on the currency exposures,
Nick, any color on how you position in terms of hedging, both natural and through contract? And then maybe any
comments on your Swiss franc exposure, please. Thank you.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes, Ajay. If we go back to the December 16th earnings outlook meeting, at that time
we shared that we expected FX to impact our earnings per share negatively in 2015 by $0.10 to $0.20. With the
movement in the foreign exchange rates that we've seen in the last month, we now put ourselves right at the high end of
that range as hurting 3M's earnings per share by $0.20 year-on-year.
Our approach in managing that is really unchanged and it's on several fronts. First of all, we have a strong management
team that knows how to manage through foreign currency exchanges, and that has been demonstrated time after time.
We also have a hedging strategy where we hedge approximately 50% of our economic or P&L exposure. And we
hedge that out in the past for 12 months.
As we noted in the middle of 2014, we extended that tenor out to 24 months for some of the currencies in developed,
some of the developed countries we're in, such as euro and yen. And then operationally, some of the things we do to
manage that exposure is looking for opportunities in sources of supply and in some cases raising prices to offset that
currency or pegging our selling prices to a hard currency, such as the U.S. dollar. And that's much of the story we've
had in the past and it remains the same in 2015.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: I wanted to follow up on the question on currency a bit. And just how do you guys think
about adjusting production or changing how you think about your – how you supply the marketplace just given the
fairly violent swings we've had in currency? And like for example, with the Canadian dollar has fallen dramatically as
it has, does it make sense to produce in that country and export into the U.S.? Or are there other things that you can do
that could help mitigate the impact?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Scott, that's a good and interesting question and I'll just put it in a short-term and a
long-term perspective. From a short-term perspective, this isn't the type of thing that week-to-week, month-to-month
that we fluctuate our production from one part of the world to the next. Our number one focus is how are we going to
serve our customers locally. And then from there, we then focus on, are there opportunities.
So I'll use the Eurozone right now where we have a European center of excellence that's looking at what kinds of
opportunities do we have with the current FX rates with – on the euro. Looking at our material costs, are there
potentials to renegotiate purchase prices. Material localization, does it create new opportunities for us to source
something from a new supplier at a different FX exchange rate to our advantage?
In times like this, it also causes us to manage our spending probably more tightly in some parts of the world. And then
to what you were talking that's a little longer term, looking at regional self-sufficiency. We do have manufacturing
capability to manufacture products that is spread around the world. And then we use movements like this to look for
those opportunities. That's going on constantly and it's a heightened case for us right now, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. That's helpful. And then when you look at your CapEx budget for 2015, I'm trying to
get a sense of where are the priorities. Where do you – where are you investing? And once – I mean this question asked
a couple years ago would have been all China or even other emerging markets and has that shifted at all back to more
developing nations or? Just give us a sense of when you think about the priorities for the $1.5 billion, where are you
going to spend money?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Scott, I characterized our priorities as fairly balanced and not changing in 2015. And
there's a couple dimensions to talk about that. First of all, we try to have a nice balance of where we're investing in
growth, expanding our capabilities and our capacity to meet local customer requirements. Second, we're also investing
in increasing our competitiveness often that's in renewal or enhancements to existing manufacturing sites we have.
And then third, there are some strategic investments we're making where it may be expanding in a new geography or
one of our significant strategic investments is our investments in business transformation and ERP. Geographically, we
continue to see a nice balance of where that's going. It's not skewing more to developing markets right now. In 2015,
we see a balance very close to what we've had in the last two years.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. That's helpful. Okay. Great job, guys. Thanks. I'll pass it on.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Andrew.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hey. Just a question. In terms of restructuring in the quarter, it seems like strategic investments
reaccelerated versus the third quarter. So the first thing, can you just – if you mentioned $30 million for restructuring in
Q4, what was the 3Q number if you can remind us?
And then if you could just talk about the balance of strategic investment and restructuring versus the benefits, because
last quarter they turned positive, and we're back to being negative. Just how should I think about the benefits of
restructuring going forward?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Andrew, a couple points on that. Yeah, our $30 million, that was restructuring
portfolio actions that we took in a few of our businesses, in Electronics and Energy, Safety and Graphics and Health
Care, and as I said earlier, spread geographically but most heavily concentrated in Western Europe for a total of $30
million. And that was very close to zero in Q3 of 2014. So an uptick from the level we saw one quarter before.
Returns that we see on this will vary by geography. The restructuring actions we're taking in the United States, we see
paybacks occurring within the next calendar year or less than 12 months. The paybacks that we see on our Western
European portfolio actions typically take longer and we see paybacks that can take two years or three years on those
investments.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: But just as we're thinking about the paybacks, right, because obviously you've been reinvesting
for a couple of years now, and as I said just going back last quarter you had a pre-deposit of tailwind from the benefit,
and this quarter I think it was relatively flat. How should I think about that going forward?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, thinking about that going forward, Andrew, part of our – part of what I laid out
for 2015 is that we're expecting $0.10 to $0.20 of productivity benefits and part of our margin expansion in 2015 versus
2014, a portion of that productivity benefit. And I'll roughly attribute one-third of that productivity benefit is coming
from past restructuring activities that 3M has invested in.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Got you. That's great. And just a small follow-up. What's your assumption for oil price that's
baked into your forecast for the year?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Andrew, for the year, we are estimating that oil prices are going to average $50 a
barrel. And while you're on the subject, in the December 16th earnings call, part of my outlook at that time was that
raw materials we expected to benefit our earnings per share in 2015 by $0.15 to $0.25. With our latest assumption on
oil prices, we're now right at the high end of that estimate. We're still in the estimate, but now at the very high end of it.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Thank you very much.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: You're welcome.

<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: And nice quarter.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: I guess my first question's on price cost. Nick, you've been talking for a while that we're
going to start to see a lower benefit from price cost and historically, over the past year, you've done closer to about 100
basis points, and you got 60 basis points this quarter. Can you just talk to us a little bit about the dynamic in this
quarter? Was it because you lap some pricing increases? And how should we think about pricing in 2015?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Joe, yeah, it did come through almost exactly like we were – as we were
describing. The components of what we're seeing there, we did have significant price growth in 2013. And there is a bit
of lapping occurring there. We do continue to still see strength of the 3M product innovation flow, the strength of the
3M brand and the impact that has on pricing.
FX in the first part of 2014 had a more pronounced impact on our pricing growth and that abated some in the fourth
quarter partly of the mix of where the FX movements have been occurring. It's much more in developed markets in
currencies such as the euro.
And then going forward, we continue to expect low price growth. Of all of our organic growth, the 3% to 6% that we're
projecting for 2015, we're expecting the vast majority of that to be in volume growth and not price growth.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. Great. That's helpful, Nick. And maybe one follow up for Inge. Inge, you mentioned
earlier on M&A, you mentioned Sumitomo. Just wondering whether the environment recently with the valuations
coming down in certain end markets, whether things have gotten any more attractive in terms of the pipeline for me
from an M&A standpoint.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: You're talking overall M&A pipeline. You don't talk specifically Japan, right, the talk overall?
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: No, overall.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Overall, yeah.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Overall.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, our pipeline is robust and we are working at constantly. And I – as I said earlier, I feel
that we're in a much better position now to really identify the most attractive pieces for us, as we are – have a better,
much better understanding today versus two years, three years ago of the positions in our portfolio and between the
different businesses, and also where we now have identified the real fundamental streams of 3M, which is four, as you
know, which is around technology, manufacturing, global capability, and brand equity.
So I will say that we are in a much better position today in order to be able to look upon them and identify them, et
cetera. So that's good. And we have, as I said earlier, from a – moved from a more of a bottom-up approach, we
complement that with a top-down approach as well in order to make sure that we can identify and find something that
can be used more broad-based in the organization.
Ceradyne was probably the first one around those acquisitions and it's working out very well and again had a very good
quarter for us this quarter. And so think about it in that perspective, we find out that's very attractive for us, it's both
sustainable end market that is interesting, but also some technology for us that we can expand into our other platforms,
which is an important thing for us. And technology innovation for us is important for us in order to create more value
for customers and for our shareholders, so it's an important element.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Thanks for the color, and nice quarter.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning, all. Wonder if we could dig in a little more on that pricing
point, specifically around your ability to price versus translation and other currency effects competitively in Europe and
Latin America. So to what extent is there a lag here in those pricing actions being taken? So when I look at that 1.4%
on price in EMEA and 3% in Latin America/Canada versus minus 9.7% and 9%, should we count on that catching up a
bit in the next quarter or two? And then Inge, just strategically, as you think about this going forward, any competitive
dynamics that change as a result of that currency fluctuation?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Steve, in the past what you've witnessed for price growth, when it's driven by FX
reductions in the last couple years primarily in developing markets, you've seen a pretty significant amount of that
recaptured in price. And if I were you modeling, I would not be modeling that same ratio of pricing action to offset
that.
The businesses are out there engaged, working on where the opportunities are for offsetting some of that FX in price,
but the ratios that we've experienced in the past are not going to be the same as what we're going to see in Western
Europe. There are some parts of EMEA, though, where we are changing our pricing to be U.S. dollar priced, which will
bolster our price growth there. But the guidance I give, Steve, is temper that ratio that you've historically seen.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: And.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: And coming back, Steve, if I may on your question, I think one important thing is to recognize
the investments that we have done over years under the umbrella of domestic demand and domestic manufacturing,
which is helping you a lot relative to issues like this. I think the other thing is the technology innovation will by
definition in most businesses help you.
And the way we look upon our business we have one that I will describe as a design and spec-in business, and then you
have one on consumables. On designer spec-in businesses, where you provide technology innovation that is coming on
platforms, that's a big advantage for us, because the technologies is there. And in most cases, we are able to produce
locally.
And the other thing is, over one-third of our business is in United States. And as I've said before, 3M never left United
States. We stayed here. In fact, we have also invested this year in more capacity specifically in our Health Care
business. So I see in terms of some competitive moves, yeah, from time to time that can be in my view in smaller
countries around the world, maybe some push in the low end of the portfolio from some local competitors, but I think
that's not what 3M is all about based on our business model generally speaking.
So we should be able to hold in there, and as I said, probably gain market share as we move ahead. I am generally
speaking very, very pleased with the execution relative to our commercial decision capabilities in the company. And
I'm very pleased to see how that momentum has built now for five quarters, six quarters and slightly stronger every
quarter. So that's good.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: 3M used to quote a percentage of regional production for regional consumption or
supply, which you've referred to several times now through this call. Do you have a sense for how high that is these
days?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: It depends on the region by definition and it's slightly higher in West Europe and United States
versus in APAC and Central East Europe and Middle East Africa, but we are pushing that, I will say as we move ahead,
but also being thoughtful relative so we do not build too much capacity and duplicate efforts.
So it's I think have been a big effort and as you remember that we talked in the past about slightly complicated supply
chain operation. And so maybe I said to many of you is that that's a big thing now that we go after as we move into
2015 and beyond is to make sure we get much more streamline supply chain and better cost of goods sold and better
inventory management and so forth.

<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: And was wage inflation anything unusual in the quarter at all and that when you do the
productivity 10 basis point number, I assume that's net of wage inflation?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes. That is net of wage. And, no, we are not seeing anything unusual in wage inflation
or wage pressures. It's very normal trends for us.

Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Shannon.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey. Can you just dig a little bit more into this U.S. Industrial strength? You said it was
up 10% in the quarter. And I think the – you mentioned the Safety business was also strong in manufacturing. What's
sort of the strongest thing you're seeing there, and your confidence level, what you see changing?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, yeah, so first of all, the two businesses as you talked about in Industrial by definition,
core industrial and personal safety, they often go in hand by hand, right. So we saw good growth there. So for us, we
saw aerospace and transportation in high single-digit growth. And if you take the core business, which is – I will
categorize as adhesives and tape and abrasives, we saw very good growth. We saw adhesives and tape that is as our
biggest division. We saw that at 8% growth in the quarter. And we also saw automotive at 5%. So I would say it was
broad-based in United States in those businesses.
And, as I said earlier, you think about that for us as a design and spec-in, where you have coming in on products and
platforms and then you have the consumables where you're using our products in your manufacturing operation and so
forth. So I would say it was broad-based. And when I looked upon the growth for the businesses, in Industrial, we were
around 5% plus for every business in United States. So very strong. And as you said, personal safety was even higher
than that. So it looks good for us. And the team is executing well. So it's good.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And then 3M has pretty interesting view into how the impact of lower oil prices
is actually going to impact demand in the economy and sort of the positives and negatives of that. Do you have any
kind of early read on that? Or anything you've sensed in your businesses or seen talking to your business leaders or a
view of how this might play out?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Shannon, the impact on the business and our ability to organic grow, we – I
really don't have any insight to share there of anything changing in the market as a result. The primary impact we are
seeing is what's coming at us with commodity prices and what we've been seeing in what we're paying for commodities
so far this year. And why I'm saying that we're now on the high end of our $0.15 to $0.25 benefit from raw material
prices.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. But you haven't sensed sort of an early pickup and better consumer spending in
your businesses because the consumers have more discretionary cash?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah. We haven't seen that yet, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane Dray>: First question was on R&D. And Inge, I know that there's a plan to ramp up R&D to a 6% level,
but it didn't look like it started to happen this quarter, actually declined year over year. I know it probably shouldn't be a
linear process, but maybe you can comment on the R&D spending over the next couple of quarters?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, first of all, it's – we see improved productivity coming out of the laboratories,
which we are very pleased about. If I give you some facts relative to that additional 5%, from 5.5% to 6% increase in
spending, is around disruptive technologies. And this is now going into the third year. So, overall, we have 30 programs
that are funded and 19 of them came on in 2013, seven in 2014, and we are looking for another four here in 2015. So
the investment over the years have been 82 in 2014, it was 40 in 2013, and we plan for another 70 plus this year.
Seven of the programs are now in early stage of commercialization, and that's in health care, infrastructure and
transportation, electronics and consumer market. So we had sales from those investments in 2014 for around $150
million. And we are looking, as I said in New York, for around $250 million as we go ahead. So we'll continue to
invest and as we have talked about in the past, our New Product Vitality Index is robust 32% to 33%. That's a good
place for us to be and we are continuing to invest in.
Now, the investment going into it is important, but equally important for me is to see the outcome. And I'm pleased by
that, because as you see, we're running in the middle of a range of 4% to 6% now running around 5%. In fact, this
quarter, on the high end of that range. And that is clear evidence that new programs are being introduced as we go. And
we have quite a number of new products introduced in 2014 that hit the market. So it was $10.4 billion of new products
hitting the market from 3M 2014. So I'm not – we continue to invest, but they are not excluded from productivity
improvement.
<Q - Deane Dray>: That's great color. And then my second question, wanted to go back to the hedging practices to
Nick for a moment. And it was interesting to hear that your response has been to extend the duration of your hedges
from 12 months to 24 months and we are seeing companies invoke new hedging practices. We saw GE doing that.
Honeywell has done that. So you've extended the duration. But I was curious why would you not increase the percent
of your current hedges from 50% to let's say 75%? Did you look at that, what the costs are there?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Deane, thanks for asking a clarifying question on that. One of the constraints or
governors on our ability to hedge is qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. And if we go over 50% in most cases,
we would then be subject to mark-to-market accounting and therefore defeat the purpose of what we're trying to do
with our hedging process. In fact, we d probably add more volatility if we did that. So that's the upper limit constraint
on what we can.
And part of our approach, if I go back over a decade, is not to eliminate all the risks there. Our approach is to give the
business some time to react and adjust to the changing business conditions. And that's consistent with our 50% strategy.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Great. Nick, that clarification was real helpful. We would rather not see you go through that, the
currency mark-to-market gyrations. So we'll live with the 50% then. Thanks.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: What are you guys seeing in Europe specifically maybe in some of your industrial
verticals?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, first of all, it's – I would say, as you saw relative to the growth for the quarter for us in
Europe, was okay I will say. And I will say that specifically we had good growth in some of the businesses that
specifically on automotive and so forth, which is a big portion in Europe. We also saw very good growth in personal
safety, which is very much related into the Industrial space.
So it's still a slow growth generally speaking over there, but I think personally with the trend relative to the currency
that we will see more export coming out of Europe. And our position in Europe is very strong I will say in our
Industrial position and in Health Care. We are weaker in the Consumer space in Europe based on historical position. So
I think as export will increase as we go, I think that will help 3M as we go ahead.
I think the other thing relative to Europe is to say that we have been on West Europe specifically now for many years, I
think four years relative to the structure over there. So I think one of the thing that s sometime it's difficult to predict
exactly the outcome of the growth, but I think one thing that you need to do as an enterprise is to address your structure
constantly. And as we have talked about earlier, we have addressed that big time in terms of going from a subsidiary
structure to regional structure and taking out quite a bit of layers and management in the organization while we kept the
front end of the organization in terms of execution.
So let's say, I think we are in a good place in Europe. But it's not an easy environment as we all know, but there's no
disadvantage for us by definition. And as I said, the portfolio for us is strong in Industrial, Health Care and Safety and
Graphics. Those businesses are the strongest for us. Our Electronics and Energy and Consumer businesses has a
smaller mix in Europe. And I will say specifically consumer electronics is very small in Europe. We are stronger in
Energy. Consumer retail is by definition a small portion for us. And I think there is – I think in that segment also where
you would see a lot of pressure maybe as we go ahead.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Thanks. Just one last question. I know this is a dumb question for you guys, but
is there any quantification of what you guys sell in and around the oil and gas markets? Is there any quantification of
whether it's 2% to 3% or do you guys have visibility on what you may sell in and around those markets, whether it's
adhesives or anything like that, that go into those economies?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yeah, Steve. Yeah, we do look at this, and approximately 3% of our revenue is into the
oil and gas industry.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Great. Thank you. Very helpful.
