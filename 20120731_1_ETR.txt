MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Please stand by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Release
Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, for introductions and opening comments, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of
Investor Relations, Ms. Paula Waters. Please, go ahead.
Paula Waters
Good morning and thank you for joining us. We'll begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and
CEO, Wayne Leonard, and then Leo Denault, our CFO, will review results. In an effort to accommodate everyone with
questions this morning, we request that each person ask no more than two questions.
As part of today's conference call, Entergy Corporation will make certain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve a number of
risks and uncertainties, and there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or
implied in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these factors is included in the
company's SEC filings.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Wayne.
J. Wayne Leonard
Thanks, Paula. Good morning, everyone. I'll talk today with one of our key initiatives, the proposal for the utility
operating company to join the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator or MISO. In May, the Louisiana

Public Service Commission became the first retail regulator to approve, subject to certain conditions, the proposal by
Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to transfer functional control of their transmission facilities to the
MISO regional transmission organization. MISO change of control proceedings are in various stages of progress before
retail regulators in Arkansas, Mississippi, New Orleans, and Texas.
During the second quarter, the Arkansas Public Service general staff modified their position such that Entergy
Arkansas should continue to progress toward joining MISO. And, when certain conditions are met, the APSC would
grant the full change of control. An order from the Arkansas Public Service Commission could come at any time now.
Testimony has been filed in the remaining three jurisdictions, and subject to various conditions, Commission staff or
the advisors and interveners in each proceeding generally have been supportive of or at least have not expressed
opposition to joining MISO, with the exception of course of the Southwest Power Pool. We believe we should receive
all the retail Commission orders on MISO in 2012.
Given this progress, final preparations are underway now to initiate the regulatory approval process for both spin-off
and merger of the Entergy operating company's transmission business with ITC Holdings Corp. The retail regulatory
filings will describe, on both a qualitative and a quantitative basis, the benefits to customers and other stakeholders
resulting from this superior independent model for transmission operations that ITC provides as well as the improved
financial flexibility and strength of the Entergy utility operating company following the completion of the transaction.
We expect to make the initial filings in Louisiana, followed by filings in other retail jurisdictions and at the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission over the next few months. Concurrently, a fully-functioning project management
office is mapping out the processes, activities, and plans for the targeted 2013 closing to ensure a seamless transition.
In other utility developments this quarter, the Administrative Law Judges hearing the Entergy Texas rate case issued
their proposal for decision in early July. The ALJs recommended an overall $16.4 million base rate increase. However,
the staff's working papers that were used by the ALJs indicate an approximate $28.3 million retail base rate increase.
Further, the ALJs recommended a 9.8% allowed ROE. This compares to the adjusted $105 million base rate increase
and ROE of 10.6% that was requested by Entergy Texas. We should note that the recommendation affirmed in full
Entergy Texas' past fuel costs and made no adjustments to $408 million of capital additions or over 99% of affiliate
costs; that is, the ALJs are not saying you are ineffective, inefficient, or imprudent. Instead, the ALJs' recommendation
results from what we believe are misapplications of basic regulatory principles and practices and these misapplications
undermine the traditional rate-making process and public policy objectives. The end result makes it impossible for
Entergy Texas to earn a fair return and that is a clear violation of some of the oldest tested and affirmed principles of
regulatory law, no matter how you get there. And, particularly, we believe certain adjustments are clearly without basis
or merit. For example, approximately $30 million of purchased capacity costs incurred after the end of the test year, but
in the allowed pro forma period when those rates will be in effect, was adjusted out with a sort of hyper-technical
rationale that is at odds with the purpose of the regulation. I won't go through all the disagreements we have the ALJs'
recommendation but we strongly believe this is a fundamental misapplication of longstanding regulatory rules and
practices in Texas, which provide for recovery of known and measurable costs.
Under the ALJs' proposal, these non-fuel costs could not be recovered for up to two years. That is the time it takes to
prepare and complete another rate case that includes the full year of the costs to be reflected in the test year itself, and if
the timing isn't perfect between the test year and historical costs, they may never be recovered. That is why it is
common practice in Texas and elsewhere to utilize pro forma adjustments to the test year to eliminate discrepancies,
particularly when you don't use a formula rate plan or have extensive use of riders. Regarding regulatory decisions that
discourage prudent capacity purchases that benefit customers, this will force the development of a robust efficient
wholesale market if it's allowed to stand. A public utility must be afforded the opportunity not only of ensuring its
financial integrity so it can maintain its credit rating and attract additional capital as needed, but also of achieving
returns on investment comparable to those of other companies having corresponding risk. This is the law of the land
and it is without argument. And, ALJs' recommendation fails to acknowledge in any way how this proposal lines up
against that basic litmus test.

The PUCT is scheduled to take up the proposal for decision-making at the August 17 meeting. It is expected that a final
decision will be made at this meeting or by the next meeting on August 30 at the latest. Entergy Texas has several other
remedies available if the PUCT does not reverse the ALJs' recommendation. Options include continuing to pursue the
open rule-making docket to establish a rider to recover capacity cost, filing for the authorized transmission and/or
distribution riders to fully recover incremental investment costs above baseline set in the case, preparing to file another
base rate case if adequate recovery is not achieved in this proceeding, and of course, seeking relief through a legal
process.
In Louisiana and New Orleans, annual formula rate plan filings were made in May. The Entergy New Orleans 2011 test
year FRP filing reflected earnings below the bottom of the bandwidth, indicating a modest increase in electric and gas
rates, totaling approximately $4 million. Entergy New Orleans also requested to accelerate funding of its cash storm
reserves to allow it to meet the $75-million target by 2017 that was established by the City Council. Under the FRP
tariff, new rates will be effective in the first billing cycle in October. This year's filing follows four straight years of rate
decreases in New Orleans. Even with these filed changes, electric rates for Entergy New Orleans customers would be
nearly 20% below 2011 levels across the country for non-hydroelectric utilities. Furthermore, rates for New Orleans
customers would be among the five lowest in the country after factoring in a reasonable price for CO2 as a proxy for
climate risk across the country. The same general profile holds true for the rest of the operating companies, explaining
in part the strong economic development activity in our region. The earned return reflected in the 2011 test year FRP
filing for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana was above the bandwidth, indicating cost of service decrease to $6.5 million.
In addition, the company is requesting adjustments outside the FRP, primarily for lower capacity costs. At Entergy
Louisiana, the FRP filing reflected 2011 earnings consistent with the bandwidth, and therefore, no cost of service
adjustments are necessary. While Entergy Texas earned within its bandwidth – while Entergy Louisiana – I'm sorry –
earned within its bandwidth pursuant to the terms of the FRP, the company is requesting rate adjustments outside the
FRP for capacity costs for PPAs not covered under the fuel clause. Both FRP filings with the LPSC are under review
now and the FRPs would require rate changes to be effective in September. In addition, Entergy Louisiana's recent FRP
filing was supplemented to include the estimated first year impact of the Waterford 3 generator replacement project.
Consistent with the previous LPSC order, rates will be updated upon completion of the project subject to a standard
prudence review. The Waterford 3 project continues to meet – provide milestones to achieve the planned end of 2012
in-service date.
In early July, the steam generators arrived on site. They are ready for installation during the fall refueling outage. This
Waterford 3 project is the second major capital project for the nuclear organization this year. In the spring, extended
power outage project was installed at Grand Gulf during its refueling outage that concludes in June. Plant personnel are
in the process now of increasing production after achieving the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval to operate
at the higher power levels of 178 megawatts. This 15% extended power upgrade will make Grand Gulf the largest
single-unit nuclear plant of its type in the country.
One last comment relative to generation initiatives; in July, the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas' request to acquire
the Hot Spring power plant and to – a special rider to recover the costs at the 10.2% ROE established in the most recent
rate case. This follows the first quarter 2012 certification by the Mississippi Public Service Commission for Entergy
Mississippi to acquire the Hinds plant. A federal proceeding and retail cost recovery remains pending in Mississippi.
Closing of the acquisitions has been delayed pending U.S. Department of Justice review. We do not know where the
DoJ is with its review of the transaction or to the extent which its review has been or will be affected by the ongoing
federal investigation of competitive issues of detail of the operating company. The confidential nature of the DoJ
review of the transactions and the civil investigation do not allow me to comment beyond the fact that the reviews are
ongoing. However, I can repeat that we believe the operating company's practices and policies at issue have satisfied all
applicable laws and regulations.
In other utility matters, last month the FERC issued a decision in the Entergy Arkansas opportunity sales case. As a
reminder, this case consumes a limited amount of short-term wholesale Entergy sales, less than one-half of 1% of the
total system sales, to third parties from 2000 to 2009. The FERC found that the sales in question were allowed under

the system agreement and made and priced in good faith, but disagreed with after-the-fact accounting used to allocate
the energy to supply those sales. We believe our actions were consistent with the system agreement and as such have
filed for rehearing last week. The FERC also set for hearing a separate proceeding to determine a reallocation of costs
among the operating companies, consistent with its decision, without completing the voluminous necessary calculations
and, therefore, cannot quantify the effects of the reallocation on individual operating companies at this time. We may
not have a final FERC decision on this matter until 2014.
At Entergy Wholesale Commodities, the NRC renewed Pilgrim's operating license through 2032 in late May, about two
weeks before the original license was scheduled to expire. The decision by the NRC came after an extensive and
rigorous review, spanning a 76-month period where the NRC spent more than 20,000 hours, conducting inspections
and reviews and soliciting active stakeholder participation. The stated goal of the NRC is to complete these reviews in
30 months.
While the Pilgrim license renewal was the longest to date, it is almost certain to be surpassed by the Indian Point
process given the number of issues and parties involved. We filed the 20-year license renewal applications for Indian
Point Units 2 and 3 in April 2007. The application date was more than five years before the expiration of the current
operating licenses, in September 2013 for Indian Point 2 and December 2015 for Unit 3 and, as such, meets the
standard for the NRC's timely renewal provision which allows continued operations until the NRC takes action on the
applications. Current progress certainly points to timely renewal protection being applied for Indian Point 2 next year
and likely for Indian Point 3 as well.
Since 2007, the NRC issued the required safety evaluation report in 2009 and a supplemental environmental impact
statement about a year later in 2010. Both these safety and environmental reports support issuance of the 20-year
license renewal. Supplements to these two reports are to be expected as the regulatory guidance comes through the
NRC's ongoing oversight as well as when open issues are resolved. Safety report was first supplemented in August of
last year, and another supplement is expected to be finalized by year-end. Around that time, we're expecting a finalized
first supplement to the environmental report. We do not expect any of these supplements to change the NRC staff's
conclusions that there are no safety or environmental issues which would preclude the Indian Point units from
operating safely for another 20 years.
The next milestone in the NRC process is the initial hearings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board scheduled
to begin in October. To date, the ASLB has admitted a total of 16 contentions, the most ever in a license renewal
proceeding, and the ASLB is on track to hear possibly three to four times more contentions than have ever been heard
in a license renewal proceeding. Two contentions have been resolved, one in a settlement, the other in a Commission
order. 10 of the 14 remaining contentions are slated for the Track 1 hearing this fall. No final schedule has been set for
the remaining four issues.
The NRC process allows for additional contentions to be filed after issuance of the supplemental reports, or after any
new material information comes to light, and as we've experienced the Pilgrim and Vermont Yankee, new contentions
may be filed even after the record is closed. I won't go over all the details of each contention; that would well take more
time than you've got here today. But, suffice it to say, these are complicated technical issues that take time to fully
investigate, resolve, and document. The key takeaway from all this discussion is that the nature of the rigorous process
before the NRC indicates it will be years until we reach final decision before the Commission.
In conjunction with the NRC process, we also need resolution on the water quality certification issue associated with
the Clean Water Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act consistency determination. On the first issue, last year we
filed notice with the NRC that the New York State Department of the Environmental Conservation, or DEC, had not
issued a final decision on our water quality certification application within the one-year time period that is required by
law. The NRC has not ruled in our filing, but if they agree that a waver has occurred, then a new water quality
certification is not a requirement for NRC's issuance Indian Point's renewed licenses. In any event, however, Indian
Point must comply with New York water quality standards through the proceeding on the State Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit or SPDES.

The department's ALJs have combined the water quality certification and SPDES issues into one joint proceeding and
are hearing that case in parallel with the NRC review of the waver issue. Hearings before the ALJs or the New York
State DEC will resume this week regarding the best usage of the Hudson River and on the efficacy of performance of
the wedgewire screen proposal that we've made. These are just two of several issues in the water permitting and
certification proceedings. But, the central issue is the evaluation of what is the best technology available or BTA.
Operations with cooling towers are operations with our proposed wedgewire screen alternative. And, either of these
options is required only if Indian Point is creating an adverse environmental impact, a point on which we obviously
disagree with the state and that we have preserved from further litigation at a later date.
Portions of these proceedings date back to 2003 when the New York State DEC issued a draft SPDES permit for
post-license renewal period, suggesting cooling towers are BTA. Since then, we filed expert testimony on how cooling
towers don't lead to BTA standards for a host of reasons, including that it is highly unlikely that cooling towers can
even gain the required air permits or approval by local governments through zoning and other permitting issues. And,
furthermore, it is difficult to see how cooling towers could pass any reasonable cost-benefit test compared to
wedgewire screens which the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled can be considered as an element of determining the best
technology available. Staff of the New York DEC has not yet filed its primary report or the basis for why they regard
cooling towers as BTA. And, no dates for hearing have been set for the threshold BTA issue to be argued in the
sunshine before the assigned judges. As it stands today, we would expect these water quality proceedings to extend into
at least 2013 and possibly well beyond that.
One last issue to report on water – to report, the first case under the law on water quality issues is whether Indian
Point's operation has environmental impacts on the Hudson River. While the ALJs declined to hear this argument in
this proceeding, it is fully supported by our research and evidence and ready to be presented on appeal should cooling
towers somehow prevail in the joint water quality proceedings. Secondly – and I know all of this starts to blend
together over time as you hear this, but this is new and it's certainly not trivial. So, you might want to listen carefully.
Last week we filed with the NRC a supplement to the Indian Point license renewal application related to the State of
New York's requirement for a coastal zone management consistency determination under the federal Coastal Zone
Management Act or CZMA. The supplement states that federal regulations make clear, given previous reviews of the
Indian Point facilities, there is no need for a further state CZM review, and as a result, the NRC may issue the requested
Indian Point renewed operating licenses without the need for an additional consistency review.
Let me amplify that point. Hang on just a second. Sorry; I've lost ten pages of my script here. So, let me amplify that
point. The preamble to the federal regulations implementing the CZMA state in the event the state agency has
previously reviewed a license or permit activity, further review is limited to cases where the activity will be modified
substantially, causing new coastal zone effects. That exception does not apply in the case of Indian Point since no
change in operations is proposed for purposes of license renewal.
Prior CZMA consistency reviews were done for Units 3 and Unit 2 in 2000 and 2001, respectively, when the New York
Power Authority and Con Ed transferred ownership of the plants to Entergy. In both instances, the State of New York
determined that operation at the Indian Point facilities was consistent with the state's coastal zone management plan.
Based upon these and other prior reviews and the fact that it's part of the license renewal proceedings, Indian Point's
continued operations will not be substantially different than when the prior reviews were conducted. We do not believe
CZMA requires Indian Point to obtain another consistency review from the State of New York in connection with its
license renewal applications. To that end, yesterday we filed with the ASLB a motion for a declaratory order, agreeing
with our position. Responses by parties, including the State of New York, to our ASLB motion are due within 10 days,
although extensions are possible. We expect that once the parties have stated their positions, the ASLB will set a
process to resolve the issue and issue a decision. ASLB decisions are appealable to the commissioners. But, if not
appealed, the decisions are final.
In summary, we've made clear our position, supported by the expert opinion regarding the law and consistency of prior
reviews conducted on Indian Point that there is no basis to require a CZM determination as part of the license renewal
process. How and when the processes will advance from here will be determined by the ASLB. It's important to keep in
mind, under federal regulations, the NRC is the ultimate decision-maker on whether changes have been made that

warrant additional review.
As a reminder, the federal law also states as national policy the preference for continuing to use already developed
areas, again, like the Indian Point facilities instead of developing new greenfield areas within coastal zones. And,
furthermore, New York State's federally-approved Coastal Management Program cites the location of nuclear facilities
in the coastal zone including Indian Point as demonstrating the state's recognition of the national interests of energy
facilities. Regarding that last point, there is good reason why Entergy point serves the national interest. Indian Point is
safe, secure and vital. It's the only plant in the country to voluntarily submit to an extensive Blue Ribbon Panel audit
which we passed with flying colors in 2008. The conclusion of the panel's of experts was unequivocal. Indian Point is a
safe plant.
Before closing, I want to highlight a few recent awards recognizing the operational strength of our organization. In a
report issued by J.D. Power and Associates earlier this month, all of Entergy's utility operating companies showed
gains in the 2012 Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study. In fact, Entergy New Orleans was named the
most improved utility company. This contrasts to the results overall where the National Customer Satisfaction Index
declined by 3 points, second consecutive year of decline. A key factor for the industry of course was the negative
impact on perception of power quality and reliability due to part – due in part to severe storms that affected several
parts of the country. In May, nuclear operations once again received top industry practice awards from the Nuclear
Energy Institute for innovative improvements in cost and safety practices at Pilgrim and Arkansas Nuclear One. This is
the tenth consecutive year we've received nuclear honors in the NEI TIPs Award Program.
And, finally, I'm pleased to report that once again Entergy scored a perfect 10.0 global rating from GovernanceMetrics
International in July 2012 for best-in-call corporate governance. Entergy has maintained this rating in each of the
quarterly periods since 2006, with the exception of one small dip in early 2011. Establishing stringent corporate
government standards and living up to them every day in everything we do is an absolute necessity to us and to
maintain the trust that you've placed in us. We demand it of ourselves, and I can assure you the Board of Directors
demands it not only of us, but of themselves as well.
And, now, I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Leo P. Denault
Thank you, Wayne, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I will cover second quarter 2012 financial
results, our cash performance for the quarter, and then add a few closing remarks.
Starting with our financial results on slide 2, higher overall second quarter 2012 earnings were driven by higher results
at both the utility and EWC compared to a year ago and lower results at parents and other. Second quarter earnings
included a special item for expenses incurred in connection with the proposed spin-off and merger of Entergy's
transmission business with ITC Holdings. Spending on our spin-merge initiative reduced the quarter's earnings per
share by $0.05 at the utility.
Now, let's turn to operational results for the quarter. Slide 3 summarizes the major drivers for operational earnings.
Utility results were higher than a year ago, due primarily to a reduction in income tax expense. This was partially offset
by lower net revenue and higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expenses.
An agreement with the IRS regarding storm cost financings in Louisiana for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reduced
income tax expense by $180 million for the affected companies, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.
The companies also recorded regulatory charges totaling $101 million after tax, which reflect an agreement to share the
tax benefits with Louisiana customers. The net effect of these items increased utility earnings by $0.44 per share.
Excluding the regulatory charge, utility net revenue was modestly higher this quarter compared to a year ago. The
increase was due largely to positive weather-adjusted sales growth. After excluding the effects of weather, build retail
sales increased 4%.

The Entergy region benefited from a reasonably healthy economy. Industrial sales continue to grow from expansions.
However, overall weather-adjusted sales growth through the second quarter is roughly consistent with what we
expected. While the effect of weather was positive for the quarter, it was lower than the significantly warmer than
normal temperatures last year. On a year-to-date basis, the weather effect was negative and well below last year. Higher
non-fuel operation and maintenance expense partially offset the earnings increase. O&M for the quarter reflected
higher compensation and benefits costs, driven primarily by pension expense. Fossil and distribution spending also
increased over last year, due in part to increased fossil outage spending, with timing differences also contributing to
both.
Slide 4 summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for the second quarters of the current and previous years. The
quarter-over quarter decline was due primarily to lower net revenue and increased non-fuel operation and maintenance
expense. EWC's net revenue reflected lower energy pricing for its nuclear fleet. Nuclear generation also declined as a
result of additional refueling and unplanned outage days. Lower production was offset by the exercise of re-supply
options under power purchase contracts. The non-nuclear portfolio partially offset lower net revenue from EWC's
nuclear fleet. The RISEC plant acquired last December was the driving factor.
Higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense also contributed to the decrease in operational adjusted EBITDA.
The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs, again, primarily pensions. The RISEC
acquisition also contributed to higher non-fuel O&M. While EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA declined, its
earnings increased quarter-over-quarter. The increase was due primarily to two items not included in adjusted
EBITDA, lower decommissioning expense and a lower effective income tax rate. Operational results at the parent and
other disclosure segment declined due primarily to higher income tax expenses on parent and other activities. The
income tax expense increase reflected the net effect of favorable tax items recorded in both quarters. The 2011 effect
exceeded the current quarter.
Slide 5 provides a recap of our cash flow performance for the quarter. Operating cash flow for the current quarter was
$587 million or $67 million lower than the same quarter last year. The decrease was due to lower net revenue at EWC
and a regulatory refund to a wholesale customer at the utility.
Slide 6 summarizes our 2012 earnings guidance which ranges from $3.49 to $4.29 per share on an as-reported basis and
$4.85 to $5.65 per share on an operational basis. The as-reported earnings guidance range was updated to include
specials recorded in the current quarter. The as-reported guidance does not reflect any potential future expenses for the
special item in connection with the proposed spin-merge of Entergy's transmission business. As reported, earnings
guidance will be updated to reflect the special item as actual costs are incurred throughout 2012.
On our last earnings call, we identified several challenges that had developed during the first quarter. At that time, we
also had other significant uncertainties such as a pending appeal of the foreign tax credit decision. While we still have
our biggest quarter to go, as we sit here today, we are well positioned relative to our full-year guidance range. Current
indications point to the higher end of the range. As we head into the second half of the year, we remain focused on
continuing to produce positive financial results as well as strong operational performance. And, we remain focused
beyond 2012 as well. As we look ahead to 2013, I want to offer some initial thoughts.
Turning to slide 7; at the utility, we work to get the right regulatory constructs in place to provide every jurisdiction the
opportunity to earn its allowed return. One example is the Texas rate case that Wayne discussed earlier, which will
have a bearing on 2013 and beyond. We also have other upcoming rate cases. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana will file rate cases in January of next year. Entergy Arkansas is also expected to have a rate case tied
to its exit from the system agreement at yearend. All are likely to take most of next year to complete. Further, the
timing and execution of our investment program will affect results.
At EWC one of the most significant variables is the price of power, both energy and capacity. Commodity markets
continue to challenge margins. However, fundamental indicators in the natural gas market, such as narrowing storage
surpluses, falling rig counts and low liquids margins, appear to be signaling that we're moving off of a bottom and into
more constructive territory. The appendix to this webcast, presentation, includes details on the current state of the
market for energy and capacity prices for EWC.

Protecting the long-term value of our nuclear assets is a key priority. That includes managing the license renewal
process for the Indian Point units as well as defending the license renewals already received from the NRC. In the
meantime, we are utilizing hedging strategies to protect near-term value while retaining longer-term options. For both
businesses, managing costs remains at the forefront; however, as we've seen this year, some things like pension
expense are driven by external factors we don't control. Efforts are underway to determine opportunities to mitigate
cost pressures now and over the long term.
At the parent, we are always looking for opportunities to improve business results. For example, last week we received
authorization to execute a $500-million commercial paper program at the parent. The CP program will provide a
cost-effective source of capital as well as incremental financial flexibility. At current rates, borrowing from the
commercial paper market could be about 100 basis points below the rate on the revolver, which will provide interest
savings and bottom-line earnings. We are now finalizing plans to implement this program in the third quarter, assuming
market conditions stay favorable.
Every day we focus on safety, operational excellence, risk management, and disciplined capital deployment. Whether
managing the current year or planning ahead, the goal is to deliver results that will create tangible long-term value for
our stakeholders.
And, now the Entergy team is available for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Good morning, Steve.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: On the last earnings call, Wayne, you brought up the concept of looking at strategic options
for the unregulated generation business. Could you just update us on any thought process there?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Well, I'll let – Leo and his team's been working on this. But, I think one of the things that
we emphasize is that given the uncertainty in a lot of these marketplaces and with environmental regulations and other
types of things that we almost have to go back. One of the additional things we're doing is going back to when we've
tried to form a nexus. And, our opinion at the time, of course, was these businesses don't belong together for a number
of reasons. They're financed differently. They have different credit metrics, things of that nature. And – but then as
power prices have fallen and things of that nature and then credit metrics and credit quality have become a real issue
for this on a standalone basis as a structure for the wholesale business, and – but nonetheless, we still believe it should
be separated from the utility. So, one of the other options is to look at transactions or assets or whatever that impact
positively credit quality, so we can get back to maybe the notion of separating the two businesses rather than focus just
on a functional adding power, maybe it's something else. And, I will let Leo expand on his thoughts on the idea.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah, Steve, the bottom-line is if you go all the way back to the kinds of things we would have
been looking at, at the time we came up with the separation concept, a lot of those ideas haven't gone away. As we've
always looked at that portfolio, ways to grow the business, ways to protect the business, way to enhance the credit
quality of the business, ways to provide liquidity to the business, we continue to look at all of those kinds of
opportunities, whether they involve internal moves or transactions-based ideas and really could run the gambit of ways
to improve the credit quality, improve the margins, improve the valuation and to make sure that we continue to protect
not only the parent company, but the utilities as well.

<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. One other question; just – Leo, thank you for giving some of those 2013 drivers and
beyond. Is there – just maybe a punch line of what you were trying to highlight with these? These seem generally the
stuff that we normally – you've highlighted in the past. Was there any – is it mainly these rate cases that...?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah. Really, Steve, it was just to give you all an indication of what's going to drive 2013 and
beyond and the timing of when those things actually show up during the year as much as anything else.

And, we'll hear next from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: I just wondered if we could go back to the MISO conversation and the ITC transaction. If you
think about timing and the perpetual delays to getting the filings done for ITC, is there something structurally you're
seeing that is slowing down that process? And, what is the level of confidence we'll see a filing get done in the third
quarter?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Theo Bunting is really heading that process up as the CEO of our utility but, Dan, I don't
think there's anything structurally that's holding it up. It's – our commitment is to put on the strongest possible case in
an area that is new to a lot of the parties to the case and we want to make sure that we fully support and emphasize how
important this is. We're bringing together two companies, Entergy and ITC, along with a number of outside experts
who believe very strongly and have evidence to support why an – the independent model is so much better than what –
how we're doing it today. And, just bringing all that different points of view and testimony together so it's clearly –
everybody is on the same page and it's clear to the Commission and other interveners in the case, had been a little more
challenging probably than we might have expected. We thought that we would be able to make our first filing in
Louisiana near the end of this month. We gave ourselves another week to button everything up and we're just not quite
there yet. Now, Leo and Theo are having meetings this week to try to resolve any issues that we feel like are not
supported as well as we want, to get that analysis and the testimony so it reads typically the way we would do it – or
ITC would do it when you're just doing it on your own. So, there's nothing structural; it's just complicated when you
involve more parties and we want to get it right. Theo, do you have anything to add or...?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah, I would like to add something, Dan. I agree with a lot of – most all the things
Wayne said. The other thing I think you need to consider is we're doing this in multiple jurisdictions and we're trying to
do this in a manner that would allow us to make those filings in those jurisdictions with not much passage of time
between filings. So, obviously, we have to think about how do we ensure we incorporate all of items we need to
consider relative to those jurisdictions so that, when we start that process, we don't get any significant slowdown. I do
think, as Wayne said, there's still some things we need to work through. We'll be working through those things over the
next few weeks. And, we'll begin that filing process.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Great. Thank you. And just, Leo, on the tax issues for the year, is there anything else we should
be looking at that you could provide a benefit for this year? And, did you anticipate this level of benefit showing up in
the guidance when you guys updated it this spring?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, when we updated the guidance this year. Obviously, we had the possibility of both
positive and negative items in the tax arena. We knew we were working, obviously, on a settlement, but at the same
point in time we had the appeal of the foreign tax credit decision which had already been lost in a different jurisdiction
at a different district, for which we had provided a reserve last year. So that could have been the positive that you saw
this quarter because of the win. But, if we had lost that case, it was a significantly larger negative possibility. So, we

had indications around both of those things but they were unknown at the time and could have gone either direction.
There's always a few things in the hopper, as you know, based on the size and number of the positions that we've got in
front of us at the moment that may or may not turn out, may or may not happen, could go to litigation like the foreign
tax credit case or could be settled; it just depends on where we are in the audit cycle and what issues are available there.
We had taken some of that into consideration when we reset the guidance. Remember, the $0.22, I think we
characterized that as other. In the improvement in original guidance, some of that was taken into consideration, tax
items that may or may not occur. I think we even mentioned that at the time.

We'll hear next from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Hi, Greg.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Focusing on Table 4 on Page 3, your weather-adjusted sales growth has been quite robust. You
make some comments in there about growth – industrial sales growth, particularly in Louisiana. You also had retail
sales growth. Can you extrapolate (a) on what's going on in terms of residential growth, why that's so strong? What
types of industrial activity you're seeing that are leading to this type of growth? And, then the decline in the refineries,
could we characterize that as seasonal because as I understand it they were down for maintenance and therefore that
should be additive when they come back? It's really a very positive underlying theme here.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Okay. Theo, do you want to take that?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Sure. Greg, as Leo mentioned in his opening comments, obviously on the residential –
I'll start with the residential side first. We are seeing some impacts from still a fairly strong economy in our region,
especially when you compare it to what's going on nationally. Also, I think you have to think about some of the things
we had last year that didn't necessarily repeat themselves this year. We had certain events last year that had a
dampening effect on sales, for instance, the flooding we had from the Mississippi River that reduced sales volumes.
And, also I think you – last year we had fairly extended periods of extreme weather, high bills, and generally customers
respond to that. So, yeah, we probably had some amount of customer response relative to bills last year. And, also I
think Leo mentioned the fact that our – may have mentioned the fact that our billing cycles this year for the quarter had
a few days beyond what we would have seen last year as well and all of those things really cobbled together had some
effect on the year-over-year change. I think if you go back and if you look at the residential growth year-over-year last
year it was actually slightly negative. So, given that, we saw a fairly robust change year-over-year, but again as Leo
said earlier, I think we still fundamentally feel like we're where we about expected to be at this point in time relative to
sales. In terms of industrials, I think it's the chemicals that continue to show fairly strongly in terms of segments in the
second quarter and a lot of that is relative to facilities expansions. As we go through the year, we'll likely see some of
that moderate as we're seeing those expansions and when they hit in various points in times in prior years. There are –
obviously, we do get outages in certain areas in terms of customers bringing their facilities down for various reasons
and that can move our industrial sales up and down as you compare period to period.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Good morning, Julien.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Just on the Texas rate case here, just – if things don't turn out as positively with the
final reg here in August, what are the various avenues? You alluded to them quickly on the opening statements. But, if
we were to see a move towards a capacity type rider, when would that happen? Or alternatively, if we weren't, at what
point down the line, say six months, a year from now, do we see another filing, just to be a little bit more explicit about
the timeline?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Theo?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah. It sounded like you had a number of questions there, Julien. I'm trying to [ph]
filter (48:15) through them. Yeah, the first thing I would make sure we all understand is where we're at today is we
basically have a proposal for decision. It's not an order from the Commission. And that's still forthcoming and part of
that – obviously what we would do relative to that would have a lot to do with what comes out of that Commission's
order. I would say it's not unusual in Texas for a commission to not accept all aspects of a PFD, and as Wayne talked
about earlier, in terms of various riders that are in place today in the current rate construct in Texas, obviously those
would be opportunities for us given once we know the outcome on the case itself. And, obviously, to talk about what
we might do and when we might do it at this point in time is probably a little premature because we don't have the
outcome on the case yet.
The capacity rider is – it's in a rule-making phase and we are working and will continue to work to move that along.
Also, as Wayne mentioned in his opening script, a big part of what the issue in the case as it relates to the
recommendation of the ALJs is capacity. And, if in fact – just assuming for a second that we don't fundamentally get
what we believe is appropriate treatment relative to that, then we would obviously write to and try to ensure that we
move that rule-making along in order to get proper alignment of the regulatory construct in Texas with what we
fundamentally believe is appropriate and what's taking place there.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Just to add, I think like Theo said, we need to get the order out of the Commission.
Hopefully, it will undo some of these, what we think, are inappropriate adjustments. But, it won't only just be the
outcome, it will be the tone set in the order, hopefully will give us some guidance that will be instructive to which way
to best proceed. Obviously, we want to – we don't want to start a war with the Commission by going one way if they
would prefer another. We're hopeful that they will acknowledge that this does not give us the opportunity to earn a fair
return and they will fix that or give us strong guidance on how to fix that ourselves.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: All right, great. Thank you very much.

We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Greg asked that question on sales growth. I was wondering, though, on the – one of the
commissioners in Louisiana is talking about changing the ROE significantly on the downward side. I was wondering if
you could elaborate if he is being joined by anybody else or if he is an outlier on that. And, any thoughts you have on
that.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: I'll let – Theo is maybe closer to it but, as you know, in this interest rate environment, I
suspect there isn't a commission around the country you don't have at least one commissioner who's bringing the issue

up, is it appropriate; it's a good question. Obviously, it's – interest rates are much lower that we're used to and the – in
like Louisiana specifically, we really have not heard a lot on that issue. We do have one commissioner a little more
outspoken on it but again that's – it's fairly common I think across the country but, Theo, why don't you...
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah, I think also one thing that you will note in Louisiana that issue has come before
the Commission at least on maybe one, a couple of occasions, and they've just not moved it along. And, as Wayne said,
I think we have one commissioner there who is very interested in looking into this. But, I think you also have to
consider and I think they have to consider interest rates is really just one input into that entire process of defining what's
an appropriate ROE. You also have to think about risk premiums, and you also have to think about the fact that there's
a legal standard around what is the appropriate ROE. And, an ROE basically should be set such that you can maintain
the financial integrity of the company; you can raise capital on reasonable terms, such that utility can discharge its
public duty relative to customers. And, in this period of time where we're seeing fairly expensive capital investment
across the utility industry, I think regulators really need to think about and consider all of these elements as you think
about what is the appropriate ROE for a utility.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, great. And, then on the stock buyback repurchases; any thoughts at this point in time? I
know you've got a lot of things going on, a lot of initiatives, obviously the ITC stuff and everything else. How should
we think about your thoughts about stock repurchases given everything that you're looking at and what have you?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Leo?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, obviously we haven't – didn't have any stock repurchases in the quarter. We've completed
$150 million of the $500 million of authority that we have at the moment, so there's $350 million left. Just
philosophically the way the repurchase program works is based on the results out of EWC and/or any kind of
transactional-based results that we have. For example if we sold an asset or what have you, the dividend is usually paid
for by the utility. So that's the construct around it. And, depending on what capital expenditures are, cash flow may or
may not be used for that. So, for example, at the end of last year when we acquired the RISEC plant, we spent over
$300 million on that plant; that's part of what goes into the decision-making process around the repurchase. So, at the
moment, we haven't done any recently. We typically don't signal what we are or aren't going to do but just
philosophically to know that transactions and/or EWC non-utility earnings that's where the buyback money comes
from.

We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: You've been making progress at the state level in moving towards membership in MISO.
And, in the filings obviously comes up the discussion of distinguishing between MISO membership and approving the
ITC sale. Can you talk about just general feedback that you've been receiving at the state level to the ITC sale element
relative to MISO, appreciating that that's a later element but just nonetheless, any color on the feedback you've received
at the state level?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Thanks. Theo, why don't you go ahead and take that?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah. Stephen, I'm not sure – the audible level was fairly low. Let me see if I can repeat
your question on what you were asking. What you're asking and – as to in the MISO proceedings is are we getting
questions around the ITC sale and/or – I just want to make sure I understand what your question was.

<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Yeah. I think my focus really was just on, in your conversations about the overall ITC
transaction at the state level which understandably would come up as part of the MISO proceedings, can you just talk
generally to the feedback that you've been receiving at the state level relating to the ITC transaction?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah. And, I made a huge mistake; I said sale. It's not a sale; it's a spin-merge. I hope I
don't – I don't think I used that term in my testimony that I plan to file. But, in any case, it does come up from time to
time but we try to make sure folks understand that they are separate processes. They're separate transactions. They're
separate steps. Obviously, we need to get to MISO, to an RTO in order to fully – to effectuate the ITC transaction. And,
as we've said to many of the regulators, we are focused on getting to MISO, getting to an RTO. And that's part of the
reason I think why you've seen some passage of time and some separation as it relates to the filings around the ITC
transaction is that we are – we're trying to work through within the various jurisdictions that MISO process and move
the various commissions along and the other parties to get through that MISO process and get our MISO approvals but
it does come up from time to time.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Yeah, I think the discussions I've been involved in I think it's actually been very
encouraging. The regulators have been very interested in trying to understand more. When we proposed a similar –
actually it wasn't all that similar, a few years ago it was a hostile environment with regard to some type of divestiture of
the transmission system. They have – the questions we've gotten have been very much on point with regard to how
things will change. The overall feeling seems to be that, given the amount of merchant capacity we have in our
territory, given some of the feedback that they've gotten from some of the merchants and some of the extensive audits
that we've had relative to merchant – some of the merchants' concerns and other concerns, they understand that this
needs some sort of resolution other than continuing to try to just regulate this thing to death. Separating it resolves all
those issues and eliminates any perception, along with it solves a lot of problems for Entergy with regard to credit
quality and that just lowers rates for customers and ensures reliability. And, we've had really good dialogue I think with
the commissions. And, the big concern – the biggest concern that I've heard is to try to explain exactly how giving up
jurisdiction – that FERC would have ultimate authority, how they maintain authority to execute their job, assuring
reliability at a fair price and all those type of things, and they don't want to end up just as another intervener at FERC.
And so that's I think – been working through the process, trying to make sure that that doesn't happen, isn't the – is
really the issue with them. But, again, it's been very constructive.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Great. Thank you very much.

And our final question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. I just want to make sure I'm following the rate changes you expect between
now and maybe the yearend of 2013, following on some of Leo's comments. You discussed the Texas rate case. The
question is do you think you would file another case and have new rates in place before yearend 2013? Then, the
Louisiana formula rate plan adjustments that are outlined in the appendices, do you expect incremental adjustments
before the actual Louisiana rating changes or rate cases resolve? And, then the timing of an Arkansas case, how early
would you file? When do you think rates would go into effect there? And, apologies, a fourth item, how do we think
about how Grand Gulf's uprate will impact rates?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard>: Theo is getting a good introduction here to his new job. But, he's – like we've said before,
he's certainly up to the challenge and probably the most knowledgeable person we've ever had in this job. So, we'll let
him prove it right now.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I think he's asked me to prove that because, first, he wants me to make sure if I can
actually remember all the questions. I'll start maybe in reverse order. Grand Gulf; I think as you know, Grand Gulf is
FERC regulated and there is a specific tariff around how cost through the unit power purchase agreement of SERI and
the various operating companies, how that cost flows from Grand Gulf or from SERI to the operating companies, and

the various operating companies have different regulatory mechanisms in place to recover costs associated with those
billings from SERI. And, they vary a little bit jurisdiction to jurisdiction but they all have fairly timely mechanisms in
place to recover cost associated with Grand Gulf. In terms of filings, obviously, we would expect the filing in Arkansas
consistent with its departure from the system agreement and obviously that's targeted for the end of 2013. Louisiana,
you talked about FRPs. Wayne talked a little bit about the FRP result as it related to our filings based on the 2011 test
year. I think as Leo mentioned we would be making rate case filings in Louisiana in January 2013 to basically reset
rates. Depending upon the length of the proceeding, potentially you could have some impact from that decision relative
to that case in 2013 but that will be a function of the procedural schedule that obviously we will get once we make
those particular filings. As it relates to – I don't remember what other questions you had; Mississippi, we made an FRP
filing, no changes relative to that filing based on, again, a 2011 test year. And, was there another jurisdiction that I'm –
was there a jurisdiction I missed?
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: When would you – if Texas rate case resolved in the next month or so, when do you expect
you would be back in filing for a new base rate increase?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I think it's premature to talk about that at this point. We don't have an order out of Texas
and so, until we get an order and realistically see where we are, we'll evaluate that and make an assessment as to what
is the appropriate time to file.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.

Thank you, Deanna, and thanks to all for participating this morning. Before we close, we remind you to refer to our
release and website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G compliance statements. Our call was recorded and can be
accessed on our website or by dialing 719-457-0820, replay code 8666645. The recording will be available as soon as
practical after the transcript is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission due to filing requirements
associated with the proposed spin-off and merger of Entergy's transmission business with ITC Holdings Corp. The
telephone replay will be available through August 7, 2012. This concludes our call. Thank you.
