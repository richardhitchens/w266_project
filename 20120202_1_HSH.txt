We'll take your questions after management's prepared remarks conclude. To ensure adequate time is available for all
questions, we do request that you limit yourself to one, and we'll do our best to answer concisely. Jan?
Jan Bennink
Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Sara Lee Q2 earnings call. Before going
into the presentation, I'd like to take you through the agenda of this morning. I'll start off with an update of the spin, so
the pure-play programs, then we have a deep dive into two companies, the Coffee & Tea company, which will be done
by myself and then Marcel will give you a deep dive into Meat Co, followed by the financial overview of Mark and
then as Melissa already said, the Q&A.
So Starting with the pure-play progress, I mean streamlining the portfolio, as you can see, all the divestitures are
completed. The only surprise you'll see in this page is the Bakery Australia which we have decided to retain. We've
decided to retain it and put it and not sell this before the spin and put it together with our U.S. business and make that
kind of a combined bakery business, so it falls under the Meat Co in the future. So Sara Lee's Sweet Bakery as an entity
within the Meat Co business.
Going then to the next one, which is the acquisitions, I mean we've made four acquisitions if you go from now until
today. First one is Aidells. I mean it has been integrated into the business as of July from this year, completed, doing
very well. Marcel will come back to that later in more detail, but it's doing extremely well and everything is completed.
Three acquisitions made in Coffee, small ones, but important ones in order to enhance our growth profile. We've made
an out of home acquisition in Scandinavia to strengthen our business over up in the north.
We made an acquisition of a coffee company which is a retail chain in coffee in Holland. Now don't expect that we're
going into retail. I mean this is just an acquisition to strengthen our position in Holland where we have some cafes,
Starbucks is not present and we'll see it more as a laboratory of growth to get more knowledge about our young
consumers and making sure that we are very well set for the future in terms of what we don't want to do in terms of
innovations.
Tea Forte, again a small acquisition, in the premium tea segment, our normal tea is more in the mainstream to
lower-priced. This will be a first entrant into the high margin and high growth premium tea segment. We will learn the
very entrepreneurial spirit. We'll leave it separate completely in the beginning and we'll try and learn from them as
much as possible. You can see them a lot in the more upscale hotels. So, they're out of home-based and perhaps there is
possibilities to move them back into the retail. So that is in terms of acquisitions.
Then moving to a deal we announced last Thursday. Now, a lot of people have asked what exactly is different now
versus what you've had in the past. I think there is a significant difference in what we've had in the past and what we
have now. The deal which we made with Philips is a mutual exclusive deal on all machines that we still produce. So we
move from only the Pads which we've had and the Senseo machine will go into all segments meaning beans, meaning
cups, meaning liquid, meaning instant. So there is everything which goes to the consumer market, we'll do together.
There is an up – an incredible possibility to do more in terms of geographic expansion innovation within that segment
of Coffee. And we're both very committed to that.
Now, another big difference is that last – before it was kind of a full company deal. We have put a Board in place,
which is run by Michiel Herkemij on our side and Pieter Nota, which is the Head of the Consumer Goods for Philips on
the other side. So a Board which will meet to make sure that the progress done, that the innovations are happening and
if there's any conflicts between the two companies that they're being resolved on the highest level. So speed,
innovation, geographic expansion and new machines.
Now, in order to do that, we need the Senseo brand which is owned – was previously owned 50-50 by Philips and by
us. We have decided to acquire that because having full control over the brand equity, I think we found it critical, that
definitely we have big plans with this brand. So we paid in total of $170 million for one making the acquisition of the
trade mark, as well as making sure that all contractual parts were finished. So that's Philips. I think we expect a lot from

this deal and it will not happen that in the last – as we've seen in the last nine years, when there was only one
innovation in the last nine years. We'll have innovations coming up every year.
So next – next thing, organizational structure, also there importantly – I mean the both of the two, the CEO and CFO
have started as of the 1st of December last year. So Michiel and Michel, don't confuse the two because they look very
similar in terms of names, they're very different in terms of personality. So they have started since the 1st of December
made already significant progress in the business, very well-accepted and they're going with a high speed in terms of
innovations and making sure that the company is completely ready by spin and hopefully in a great place afterwards.
They've already made one change in the top structure. The manager for the rest of the world which is everything
outside Western Europe, they have changed that. We're currently looking for a new person. The rest of the world we
see as a critical part for our growth engine. So we want to have – make sure that we have the right person in place
there. We're looking for one and we'll be announcing in the next couple of months. So that's in terms of organization in
Coffee & Tea.
In Meats, very early days, I mean, Sean is in there for two weeks. So it's early days, first impression, very good. It's
very good to have somebody in place who has seen it all, done it all, all the experience from Campbell and I think that's
a big advantage. And the organization is moving now with greater speed to the – to what we want to do with the Meats
business. So organizational-wise we feel much happier. Things are in place and things are moving.
And then in terms of cost structure for the business, we – the fixed cost, I mean, we had IT contracts which were in the
Sara Lee business which were significant. They were more for a $30 billion company rather than for a $2.4 billion
company. So we renegotiated all the contracts with all our key contractors. That will result in significant cost savings in
the next two to three years. Mark will come back to it later in his presentation, but I think in terms of fixed cost, an
enormous kick in the box.
We continue to look for opportunities in fixed cost. That's an ongoing process. We're fortunate in both of them, but
there are still opportunities which we see and we want to make sure that we do that in a right – on the right pace rather
than going too fast for the organization.
Working capital, as you will also see later from Mark's presentation, working capital is a main issue and a big issue in –
even an opportunity, in Coffee Co. We have now dedicated a manager who will do nothing else but making sure that
our working capital will go to the targets which we have set and in the mid-term, we're looking for the 5%. And I
haven't completely convinced Michiel Herkemij that we want to go to my favorite zero but I mean I'll get him there one
day or another. He doesn't – I hope he doesn't listen to the call, but anyhow. Portfolio optimization, we continue to look
and fine tune the company to look at for profitable growth opportunities.
The last page in terms of the update, critical dates. Now the IRS Private Letter Ruling, I think we've had a lot of
questions about the IRS Private Letter Ruling. We're progressing well and we expect the ruling to happen in the coming
weeks. The moment we have it, we will – or at the moment, we will issue a press release where we will give details of
the IRS Private Letter Ruling. It has taken a bit more time than we had anticipated because it's a complex deal. So it is
something which the IRS is – it's more complex than most of the other rulings we asked. So that's why it's taken a bit
more time. I apologize for that. I think we don't have a good track record in terms of kind of keeping our timing when it
implies to regulatory approvals, but I hope you trust us. But as of now, all the regulatory approvals have ended up in
the promises we've made and so I think also here you should have good faith.
SEC filing follows immediately after. So that will happen in early March. The Investor Days, the two Investor Days,
Coffee Co has been fixed for the 14th and 15th of March in Amsterdam. The invitations have gone out and I hope most
of you, if not all of you, are able to visit the two days conference where we will really tell everything about what we
want to do with Coffee & Tea company.
The Meat Co Investor Day has been moved to May. We really want to give Sean a possibility to make the strategy the
way he thinks is correct and we thought that doing it too early would be a little bit bad because he wouldn't be able to
just go and have a deep dive in the business and have a strategy. So that's why we put it in May. And the spin date will
be in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. So that's the update on the spin. We feel good about the progress. I think things

are happening the way we wanted. I mean sometimes a little bit of a delay, but at the end we'll get exactly where we
want to be.
Then moving on to Coffee & Tea. If you look at the first page in the Coffee & Tea financials, you see that the net sales
in Q2 has grown by 12%. We increased our MAP by 20% and you're seeing our operating income up by 2%. Now, the
operating income up by 2%, I think that's against a quarter last year which was at record high margins. So I think that's
when comparability is difficult. And secondly also, I mean, just keep in mind that the prices of our raw materials in Q1
are practically equal to – Q2 and Q1 are practically equal. And it's a first-in, first-out principle we use and new prices
of the more – more favorable prices will kick in the Q3 and Q4 of this year. First half gives us a 13% growth, 24% up
in marketing and adjusted operating segment up 9%. So also there progress was made.
The volume in mix, I mean a slightly disappointing number, if you look at it for face value in terms of volume, minus
6.5%, I'll come back to that in a second on the next page. Mix, very good, up 5%. I think that's actually where we'll be
pushing in the future, much more on mix, making sure the high margin products deliver higher growth and that's the
whole game. Price up 11.8%. You see that between Q4, Q1 and Q2, you see the pricing from 14% to 13% to 11%
basically. That's not surprising because the price increases have happened last year. So that you'll see taper off in the
remaining part of the year. Adjusted net sales up 11.6%.
Now why is the volume down the way it's down, 3.1% in Q1, that's the next page. Total volume down 6.5%. The
French private label, we've been talking about that very clearly in the past. It is at the same levels. It's about 1.5%,
1.3%, but an important number is the Thailand flooding. I mean, our Thai business has been, now it's stopped. It
basically had been put in, sold one case. Our factory was flooded. I mean our business – we couldn't deliver and we
have no – we didn't have any backup in terms of delivery for the Thai business. It's a very different instant business
which we cannot deliver out of anywhere else. So as a result of that, basically you will see a zero behind volume and
sales and profit for Thailand. That will last another four to six months. So it will be not easy to just fix that
immediately, but that's a part which has a big influence on the volumes, which means that the ongoing business is
slightly down 1.1% versus the Q1, which is scattered around a couple of other countries. But it's overall, we feel that
the – there's no negative trend happening anywhere. I'll come back to some of the key countries later.
Margins, they're steadily improving. I think this is the line we'd like to see. Coming from a 12.4% which is – hit the
rock bottom in Q4, going to 13.3% in Q1 and then up to a 14.6% in Q2. And as I said before, raw material prices
between Q1 and Q2. That is not a major difference. The more favorable prices are coming down – are going into the
financials as of Q3 and Q4. So that's the margin of progression. I mean, just to make sure for the record – I mean, we've
been talking about historical margins in the past – I mean, we're not saying – we've never said that historical margins
will be achieved this year. We've said that the historical margin is our midterm guidance in terms of where we want to
go in terms of growth as well as historical margins going back. We see here a positive trend and as long as this positive
trend continues, I am very happy.
So looking at our key countries, I think it's the next page. I mean, looking at our market shares in Holland, France, and
Spain, which make up a great part of our Western European business and that's also critical. In Holland, you know that
in Holland, what we had in 2009, we had a – our market share of 57%. That was always in that area of 57%, 58%.
We've suffered in 2010, in the first half of 2011 and what you'll see on this chart, that actually the trend is reversing.
We've hit the bottom also here and we're going back to the levels we're used to. And in the December share, although,
one word doesn't make a summary, we see actually that things move up, now to a 55.3%.
Please note that these are shares without the instant. I mean we will- in the future, we'll give our shares including
instant, but redoing everything for the past and including instant was a bit difficult. So this is the way we've been
working up till now. So this is the roast & ground market, the bean market, ex instant. 55.3% is our market share in
Holland, very good at the expense of private labels.
Secondly, France, which has been a success for the last two, three years. You'll see that we're moving up from a 22%
market share to currently in December at an almost 27% market share, very much behind the growth of Senseo as well
as the cups. So the mix plays an important role and the roast & ground market is holding steady. So France also very
good and if you would go to the last page in terms of market share, Spain which is economically proving up the most

favorable country in the EC, but for us it's our star performer. We've moved up from a 20% market share in 2009 to
currently 27%, still growing. We see very high sales growth. So it's both market share, as well as sellout. They are
doing very well and this is mainly behind introduction of capsules. But as a result of introducing capsules very
successfully, we've also seen a pickup in all our businesses because our relationship with the trade has all of a sudden
shifted to a much more focused Coffee & Tea Company.
So that's in terms of market shares. And the next two pages, we'll talk a little bit about the innovations we put in place.
I've talked a little bit about our preference mapping in the past. Now this is just – we're looking at consumers in Senseo,
but they give us back and say the coffee is not awesome. We'd like to have a bit of a more robust coffee. So we have a
whole line extension range of more robust coffee, more towards the espresso part launch in all our key Senseo
countries. That's what we did in Senseo and we did exactly the opposite in the capsules where people who find the
espresso too heavy, give them a Lungo version and so we extended our range from 11 to 15 variants, give more choices
to the consumer. And actually the Lungo introduction has had a significant impact in France because people – they like
the espresso but also like the Lungo coffee, as well as in the Nordic countries, Holland and Belgium. So the four
countries that will be are Spain, Holland, Belgium and France.
So this is in terms of the Senseo and capsules and then when we're talking about the bean market which is reviving
worldwide, I think worldwide trends around 7% growth in the beans. We've had basically done nothing in the bean
market. We've put ourselves completely on the ground coffee run on the beans market. We introduced a range of beans
in Holland. This is you see one pack but also here you see probably nine variants in the total beans and that has been
introduced in October. So you see a first part of innovations kicking into the business.
Last page in terms of Coffee & Tea before I hand it over to Marcel, what are we doing going forward? I said before the
favorable commodity costs in the second half will start coming in. I have to give a little notice, I mean of course there
will be some price pressure and some pressure from the trade saying what hey, the prices are going down. I'd like to see
my prices going down. So we have some issues with some of the trades specifically, France. Up till now we've been
able to keep up with it. I mean we've been able to hold strong. We will not probably see a fall through – I'm sorry, a full
fall through of all the raw material prices back into the profits. But through innovations and to having a good position
towards the trade, we think we can hold pretty steady there. But that's, I think, a favorable tailwind with what we're
having in the Q3 and Q4 and hopefully going forward.
Organization, I talked about the top line. I mean people are – we're making some other changes in the top structure, and
in the second layer, we're increasing our commercial skills in the top hundred of the people, marketing, sales.
Previously, the organization was much more built on production and finance, and having marketers and having sales
people in the organization is a process where we feel this team is going to.
Innovations, I think there – as of, I think, April, there will be not one month where there will not be a new innovation
coming into the markets. We will see the first re-launch coming into March, April which is on the premium coffee
segment, already introduced now in Holland. I mean presented to the trade, very well accepted. And then you'll see the
big re-launches of our segments in the summer and then follow it up. As I said, every month there will be new
innovations coming in and you will see a full range as far we can show it in our Investor Day in March.
Foodservice, we haven't talked much about foodservice. As you might have seen in our press release, foodservice had
only a 2% growth. It's 27% of our total sales. So make the difference, it's a big difference. We've focused mainly on
retail, and I think it's now the place to make sure that we also start delivering very much better in our foodservice
business. We feel there's some thoughts. We'll try and give you the first thoughts in March.
We've already made a management change in our key country, Holland for foodservice. You can guess where the
person's coming from. He's an ex-Heineken foodservice person. Heineken is very good in foodservice. I think we'll get
a lot of expertise integrating foodservice into our brand experience. I think it's the key message we're going to give you
and going forward. But that's work in progress. So retail doing very well, foodservice a bit watered down, a lot of work
to be done but progress is in line with expectations. We have ups and downs but we all feel very positive about the way
we're going.

Going on to Meats, Marcel, up to you.
Marcel H. M. Smits
Okay. Thank you, Jan. Good morning, everybody on the call. Just for your recollection I served as the Interim CEO of
our Meat Co business from the middle of September until the recent handover to Sean Connolly. It's been a fun and
interesting experience. I spent a lot of my time in the business. I think we've made some solid progress and I have to
say that I'm very confident that under the leadership of Sean, the company will do very well.
From what I've experienced over the last few weeks, Sean's background will allow him to hit the ground running. The
guy obviously knows what he's talking about. So let's have a look on how we did. After four quarters of mid-single
digit volume declines, which started in the second quarter of FY 2011, it was clear that it was an imperative to change
that trend line. We said as much in the press release of the first quarter, pointing out that innovation and selective
pricing actions would contribute to improving volumes on a go-forward basis.
In the organization, of course we significantly invested in MAP and slotting in the first quarter. So here are the
financials. Let me start at the left side of the slide. Adjusted sales were up modestly with 1% in the quarter and that's an
improvement, from the decline in the first quarter. As the quarter progressed, we saw trends improving and that is
really the first key message. Sales are up and trends are improving.
Adjusted operating income was down $2 million, which is a mixture of pluses and minuses. We see very solid SG&A
in manufacturing savings coming through from all the initiatives that were implemented in Q4 of last year and Q1 of
this year and good savings coming through is the second key message. We've had to invest back in – surgically in price
and hence we did now fully recover on commodity increases in this quarter and – that pulled our operating income
down. In all, if I go to the right side of the slide on an accumulative basis, then adjusted sales are flat, MAP is up,
reflecting investments and profit is marginally down.
Now, let's go a little bit deeper. Here we break out the sales increases and decrease over the last three quarters. In Q4 of
last year, we recorded a volume decline of 4.9% and that is the upper left figure. In Q1 of this year, we saw a decline of
5.7% and with the actions that we've taken, we brought that down to 3.5% in the second quarter. As I said, as the
quarter progressed, we gradually improved, so Q2 was better than Q1 and within the quarter, we gradually improved.
Meanwhile, mix, that's the second line, nicely improved with a 1% gain in the second quarter versus a 0.4% decline in
the first. Pricing, third line, is gradually decreasing and let me just recall that a lot of our price increases were put
through in Q2 of last year and we're starting to lap. Overall, as I just said, in the past or in the last line, we've had a
small decline of sales in the first quarter, 0.6%. You see that down below and a small plus of 0.9%, up in the second
quarter.
Before we go any further, let me just give you three more perspectives on the volume and mix developments in Meat
Co. Firstly, as we've been doing the sums, it turns out that the volume decline in the second quarter is nearly entirely
driven by the declines in seasonal items, such as cocktail links and pies and a couple of others. All the non-seasonal
items together brought the flat with of course the big pluses and minuses, but they broadly cancel each other at. Not
doing well in your seasonal items is not exactly a badge of honor but it adds to our confidence that the base business is
stabilizing.
Second perspective then, and you've read about it in the press release, is the transfer of part of accounts to a broker,
which took place in Q1. These accounts represent approximately 15% of our retail sales and as we've transitioned,
we've held back on our promotional spending in these accounts and we suffered some volume loss. It'll take a bit of
time but we're absolutely confident that we'll get that right.
The third perspective then is a split between Meat products and Bakery products and on that one, I have a slide. As you
can see here, if you split out our Meat products from our Bakery products, you see more rapid improvement. That's a
helpful perspective. The trends in Meat products are improving rapidly both on the retail and on the foodservice side.
On the Bakery side, we have work to do. In all, our Bakery business saw volume declines of approximately 10% in

both quarters and part of that is the seasonal items that we've just talked about. Our foodservice Bakery business, I
think is fine. It is suffering from market shifts in the restaurant business and I saw an analyst commenting on that
yesterday. Out of home deserts in restaurants are down in the double digits and we are faring better.
On the retail side, we will have to focus on innovation with competitors being particularly aggressive on price, in
particular in pies. A long-term measure of how we're doing from a volume perspective, of course, is market shares and
on that side, the news is very encouraging. I'm not going to dwell on all the details of this slide, but as you could see
here, we're starting to improve.
In most categories, we're showing an improvement versus the first quarter. That's the second column. And in a number
of categories, shares actually improved over the year-ago period, as shown in the first column.
If you take a step back, the messages are the following. We feel great about Jimmy Dean, which continues to deliver
very strong results on the back of added-value breakfast products. Our success has been noticed. Others are trying to
follow but we seem to have the upper hand and we have a very good pipeline of new products coming down the line.
We have work to do in Hillshire Farm lunch meats and it's a large business and we're working on a string of
innovations, largely coming from the Energy in Motion initiatives. We feel good about Ball Park. The brand is
delivering against expectations and we have exciting communication and products in the pipeline.
Now shown on this slide, is Sara Lee Deli; it's a delicate business, no pun intended, and much smaller than the three
brands shown here. And we've got good plans in place to strengthen it. And we have the technical capabilities to do
well with a bit of focus.
And those headline statements lead me to quickly review some innovations. This is another Jimmy Dean breakfast
proposition. We have bowls, we have sandwiches, we have crumbles, what have you, and we've just launched Sausage
Gravy & Biscuits and we have more to come in the second half.
As I said, in Hillshire Farm, we have work to do. In the quarter, we launched Gourmet Creations and Deli Carvers, both
of which tried at Smits family and approved and American consumers seem to feel exactly the same. We're working
hard to bring further innovations to the market in the Hillshire Farm brand.
Meanwhile, we're proud to say that with Aidells, we've done a great acquisition. Jan has already referenced it.
Company has come with a strong management team, wonderful people and they're delivering great results. They
operate in a premium segment than the rest of our company and there's good growth in that segment and they are
capturing more than their fair share.
We've given them the Gallo brand to manage and we're excited about what they're doing to revitalize that business and
that's the second benefit. And last but not least, I've observed that people from Sara Lee are all over the Aidells' new
family members and we're quickly absorbing entrepreneurial spirit and ideas. The Aidells people keep saying that
they're just rounding out figures, but that really sells them short. As a company, we've learned a lot from how they
operate.
To round it up, let me just give you a couple of broad assessments coming out of four months of being the Interim
CEO. I think it's fair to say that the business has gone through a lot of change and restructuring. Sale of the fresh bakery
business in North America and the sale of the North American foodservice coffee business were impactful and over and
above that we pushed through very significant organizational change and cost reductions in Q4 of last year and Q1 of
this year. All of that is being absorbed and the company is holding up pretty well. I have to say that as much as I
enjoyed being interim CEO, it's very helpful that we now have a permanent CEO with a strong background in
American food products.
In addition, it is fair to say that we've stretched the pricing in order to deal with the onslaught of commodity costs and
Mark will talk about the size of the figures that we're dealing with. Strategically, that's exactly the right thing to do and
we will continue to lead, but we can't get out too far ahead and it's encouraging to see that if you make small changes to
[indiscernible] (29:29), you're actually seeing immediate effect coming through. I'm comfortable by the way that we
can afford to be competitive as our cost structure is improving very rapidly.

Meanwhile, the move of our sales accounts to a broker is the right thing to do. But as these things go, there was some
disruption, but dealing with reputable people and we have high confidence that together we will get it right. It's fair to
say that in Hillshire Farm, we've got real work to do. This slide puts it's fairly bluntly and we have to tip our hats to
competition who have innovated us in lunch meat, but we have the plans and the actions in place to get it right.
Lastly, then seasonal items were tough for the second quarter, partly in Meat, partly in Bakery. About two-thirds of our
Bakery products, however, are in foodservice and that's a quite profitable business. We have the products, we have the
innovation and we now have to make sure that the equation works with focus and hopefully, consumers going back to
eating more desserts.
And with that, let me hand it over to Mark.
Mark A. Garvey
Thank you, Marcel and good morning to everyone on the call. I'd like to start by reviewing some key financial
highlights for the quarter. First, we are reaffirming the adjusted earnings per share guidance that we provided at the
beginning of the year. The range remains unchanged despite a weakening euro.
Adjusted net sales were up 6% for the quarter due to improved pricing and mix offset by volume declines, which Jan
and Marcel have discussed. Adjusted operating income increased 18%, $256 million assisted by a continuing reduction
in corporate costs and adjusted earnings per share was $0.27 for the quarter, up 29% from $0.21 from the same quarter
last year.
Now, let me discuss our guidance in a bit more detail. As you may recall, when we began this fiscal year, our guidance
had assumed an average euro-dollar rate of $1.44 for the year. We are now projecting an average rate of $1.35 or $1.32
for the remainder of fiscal 2012. Despite this decline, however, we are comfortable that we can keep the earnings per
share and operating income guidance ranges unchanged, aided somewhat by reduced corporate cost expectations.
Consequently, we are reaffirming earnings per share guidance of $0.89 to $0.95 and operating income guidance of
$875 million to $930 million. We are also maintaining our net sales guidance range of $7.9 billion to $8.15 billion,
however you will appreciate that the decline in euro makes it more challenging for us to achieve the top end of this
range. Net interest and tax rate guidance are also unchanged.
On this slide, you can see a summary of our second quarter and first half performance for continuing operations. As I
mentioned, adjusted net sales grew by 6% for the quarter and year-to-date. Gross margins declined as both pricing and
commodities have risen causing a percentage decline, as well as commodity costs not being fully offset during the
quarter at Meat Company.
MAP spend excluding acquisitions was flat compared to last year, with increased MAP at Coffee & Tea and lower
MAP in Meat Company. For the half year, however, MAP was up 9%.
Selling, general and administrative costs were down 8% in the quarter, assisted by reduced Meat Co and corporate costs
somewhat offset by increased Coffee & Tea costs, due to standard overhead remaining from the household and body
care dispositions.
Overall, adjusted operating income was up a strong 18% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date and adjusted operating
margin was 12.5% for the quarter and 11.1% for the first half, an increase of 130 and 60 basis points respectively.
Now, the primary drivers of operating income for the second quarter and first half are outlined on this slide. Overall,
commodity costs were not matched by pricing in the quarter, primarily due to pricing actions at Meat Co, as Marcel just
discussed. At Coffee & Tea Co, pricing did just offset commodity costs for the quarter, as we had expected. MAP was
flat and the other drivers of operating income improvements come from lower SG&A costs and lower non-commodity
costs and cost of goods sold, somewhat offset by a negative volume mix.

Here you can get a perspective as to the significant commodity cost increases our businesses have been managing
through. In fiscal 2011, we had commodity cost increases of $646 million and for fiscal 2012, we expect an additional
$415 million of which $323 million has been incurred year-to-date. Therefore for fiscal 2011 and 2012, both
Coffee/Tea and Meat will have absorbed approximately $1 billion of higher commodity costs.
Our corporate costs continue to decrease as we prepare for the spin. General corporate expenses were $21 million for
the second quarter and $31 million year-to-date, representing a significant reduction from fiscal 2011. These reductions
were achieved due to lower head count as we have moved to reduce those functional areas of corporate that are not
focused on the spin and in addition, pension expenses are lower than last year.
We now expect general corporate expenses including trademark amortization expense to be in the range of $85 million
to $95 million for the fiscal year. Also during the quarter, there was a benefit of $15 million from commodity
mark-to-market gains compared to a loss of $2 million in the same quarter last year.
This analysis shows adjusted earnings per share for the quarter and the first half at $0.27 and $0.45 respectively.
Adjusted EPS grew 29% in Q2 and 36% year-to-date. This is due to improved operating income which on this slide
includes the impact of acquisitions, lower interest expense, somewhat higher tax expense and of course, a reduced share
count.
The next slide shows earnings per share as reported and as adjusted for continuing operations. We reported earnings per
share of $0.05 for the quarter. This number was impacted by significant item charges, primarily related to the
renegotiation of key IT contracts as well as spin-related advisory costs. There were also some adjustments to tax
reserves during the quarter. Backing these costs out, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.27.
During the quarter, we had significant item charges of $170 million, excluding impairments and gains or losses on the
sale of businesses. There were two major components of these charges. Firstly, as I mentioned, we renegotiated our
global IT contracts with our key vendors IBM, HP and AT&T. And have now established separate contractual
arrangements for Coffee & Tea and Meat Co for their required services going forward. This renegotiation was also
necessitated by the significant disposition activity we have had over the last 18 months. We had termination costs
associated with changing these contracts and those charges have been included in significant items. The contract reset
will lead to annual savings of approximately $30 million, which was included in our previously communicated savings
estimate of $180 million to $200 million for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013.
Secondly, similar to our first quarter, we incurred spin-related advisory costs which we have included in significant
items. These costs include accounting and tax advisory-related expenses, legal compliance costs and consulting costs
associated with establishing the two new companies.
We now project significant items excluding impairments and gains or losses on the sale of businesses to be between
$525 million and $550 million for fiscal 2012. This projection has increased since our prior guidance primarily as a
result of the termination of prior agreements with Philips at a cost of approximately €50 million. We estimate the
after-tax cash impacts of these significant items will be approximately $350 million to $400 million.
And approximately 50% of our projected significant items will be costs that we incur on projects which will benefit the
future companies in terms of savings such as the IT contract resets. The remaining costs are those costs associated with
executing the spin and disposing of discontinued operations.
Now, I would like to turn to working capital and provide you with an overview of how we are looking at trade working
capital for Coffee & Tea and Meat Co. As Jan mentioned, we have appointed a full-time working capital manager for
Coffee & Tea and their role will be to focus on significantly reducing trade working capital as a percentage of sales. As
you can see here, for the first half year, average trade working capital was 20.3% at Coffee of net sales compared to
18.1% in fiscal 2011. You can see that this has been caused primarily by inventory, which has been impacted
significantly by commodity cost increases. As Jan mentioned, Coffee & Tea has been given a target to reduce trade
working capital as a percentage of sale to 5% in the next two to three years.

On the next slide, you can see the same metrics for Meat Co. In this segment, trade working capital is currently at 8.3%
of net sales showing an improvement from 8.6% in fiscal 2011, mostly driven by payables and receivables. Finally, I
would like to give you an update on overall cash flow and our anticipated year-end cash and debt balances. In the
second quarter, cash flow from operations was $253 million, compared to $205 million last year and for the
year-to-date cash from operations was $33 million, a reduction from $233 million in fiscal 2011.
The half year decrease is primarily attributed to a one-time €60 million payment to the Netherlands pension plan in the
first quarter, higher cash payments for significant items and a decline in cash generated by discontinued operations as
dispositions have closed. We are also updating our year-end cash and debt balance guidance. This is primarily due to
the recent acquisition of the Senseo trademark, the decision to remove Australia Bakery from strategic review and the
recent Coffee & Tea Co acquisitions which Jan mentioned earlier. We now expect year-end cash and debt balances to
be approximately $300 million and $2.4 billion, respectively.
And finally, we expect to pay the $3 dividend in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. With that, Jan, Marcel and I
would be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Eric Serotta, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Eric Adam Serotta>: Good morning.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Good morning, Eric.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Adam Serotta>: I'm wondering whether you could go into the stranded costs related to HPC and the other
divestitures. How much of that has been eliminated to-date and how much of that do you still have on your plate?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yeah, Eric, it's Mark. What we had said last quarter that we approximately $50 million to $60
million of headwind as a result of stranded overhead. We would still keep that amount in terms of the guidance we're
giving. We have just closed a lot of these businesses. So that's still a work in process, so not a significant amount has
been removed to-date, I would say.
<Q - Eric Adam Serotta>: Okay. And then shifting gears, in terms of I think it was Jan's comment on anticipated
pricing pressure in Coffee as commodity costs have started to come down. Have you actually seen or experienced some
of that pricing pressure to-date and what gives you the confidence that you're not going to be sort of giving back all of
the expected windfall from costs coming down?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I mean, there is – there has been some pressure. I think most of the pressure has been in France,
actually with one of the big customers. So far, we've held the price. And as I said, will everything fall through? From
the 100%, we'll hope 70% will stick with us. I think it's because the margin improvement, because we have covered the
absolute cost of the coffee prices, but not the margin improvement. So we're still behind in that respect. So, there's a lot
of things we can talk with the trade about.
The innovations is the second thing, which gives me a lot of confidence, because if we move with our innovations as
fast as possible, that means that the whole pricing element becomes finally up for discussion. Because we'll have new
packaging, new prices, new formats and that will help a lot in the discussions. So, will it be 100%? No. Will there be
difficulties, absolutely yes. But we feel comfortable that we can keep a significant part with us.
<Q - Eric Adam Serotta>: Okay. I'll get back in the queue, thank you.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Thank you.

Chris Growe, Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Hi, Chris.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Chris, good morning.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: I just have a couple questions for you. My first one, Mark, I don't know if you can
provide this, but do you have a cash flow from operations estimate for the year? If you gave that, I may have missed,
I'm sorry.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: No, we haven't been giving cash flow from operations estimates, Chris. What we've done is
given the year-end cash and debt estimation. We haven't given specific cash flow from ops.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. I just had two quick questions within the business then and I'll give them to you,
let me just get some comment, please. The first one is your mix improvement in Coffee. I know that's been – that's part
of the plan and part of the new productivity. Is that what I credit a lot of the improvement in mix to is sort of new
products and the way you're moving the business?
And the second question relates to Meats, if I could add that as I just said, I'm seeing a lot of categories you're pricing a
good bit below the category now. You said more recent, it's an increase in promotion. I know that's again part of the
plan. Do you see the second half of the year where your pricing is still below your cost inflation in Meats because of
the activity you're doing at retail? Thank you.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Well. I'll take the Coffee, the Coffee part and Marcel will take the Meat part. In terms of mix,
you'll – it's exactly – it is the innovations as you've put it. And I think capsules had played an important part clearly and
the premium roll-out of some premium products in the roast & ground. Those are, I think, the two key elements and in
one of the big countries, Senseo has done a positive role. And I'm talking France here.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yeah. In pricing in Meats, let me just give you a couple of perspectives. We're not now
undercutting competitors by being more aggressive on price. We were – as I've said, we were ahead in selective
categories and we've corrected that. I think we've been saying consistently raw material prices need to be reflected. And
what you then see is that not everybody takes the same perspective of these time lags. We got ourselves a bit ahead of a
number of people. We've corrected that and we've just become more competitive.
The second half, what will help is two things. First of all, we're seeing selectively that commodity costs are now
flattening out. So beef prices still going up, but on pork and the pork and sows, things are starting to come down. So
that's going to be helpful and in the Foodservice side, we're in a position where a lot of the price increases contractually
lag with the commodity prices in the market. So on the Foodservice side, we'll have a benefit in the second half.
Now those two things will help. We haven't given any projections for where costs and pricing are going to come out.
But we – it's not that we have a huge hole in the ground for the second half from costs and pricing and it's conceivable
that we end up with a small plus.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Is the $90 million or so in incremental input costs you expect for the second half, is that
mostly in Meats?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: I don't have that split, but that's probably it. It's never going to amount...
<A - Jan Bennink>: Yeah.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: It's should be in Meats, yeah. Because in Meats, prices have been on an upward trend and
it's actually only over the last three months or so that...

<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Yep.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: ...it's started to come down a bit on sows and pork as I just said, on beef price – beef prices
continue to increase. On the Coffee side, the market, I think, has turned earlier than what we're seeing in Meat and we
don't have a turn in Meat yet.

Eric Katzman, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hi, good morning, everybody.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning, Eric.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Jan, I guess the first question is you talked about the IRS approval. I don't expect you to give
a quantification of what that means in terms of expected outcome versus good outcome, but could you – maybe
quantitatively you could do it but, can you...
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: I think the reaction in here is – it gives you an idea as to what the answer will be. Let's
continue, Eric, sorry.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Yep. I mean, maybe you could just give us some idea as to what feasible outcomes are of that
resolution since it's taken over a year now since you initially indicated and then I just have one follow up on Coffee..
<A>: This is Mark.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Yeah, Eric, I'll answer. We really can't. However, we expect to be talking to you very, very soon
about the outcome. The discussions are progressing as we would want them to progress and from that perspective, we
feel pretty good about what we've been talking to you about in a few weeks.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay.
<A>: Yeah. And I think the other thing to say is, there's a lot of work going into this from people from the IRS and it's
not appropriate for us to give you all sorts of indications and color while those discussions are going on. So, we're
having that dialogue. We're hoping that soon we'll be back to you and it's a fairly complex transaction. So, there's no
hint of criticism or anything that we think that the IRS is moving too slow. We're happy with the way it's moving.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: And I would just add from a sequencing perspective here. We've got the ruling to come.
We're going to file our statements with the SEC, probably the beginning of March and then we've got Investor Day at
the middle of March. So over the next five weeks, you'll see a lot of things coming through.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Well, Wall Street and patience are usually not similar.
<A - Jan Bennink>: I understand your impatience completely.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: And then on the fundamentals side of it, I understand the – the adjustment in coffee volume
for the private label and then obviously the Thai flooding, I didn't even know you had a Thai coffee business, but you
learn something new every day. But the ongoing business actually weakened a bit sequentially. Maybe you could talk a
little bit about that.
<A - Jan Bennink>: If you look at the volumes, there's a couple of countries who are doing – kind of Eastern Europe,
that's a part of the volume where it's declining a little bit in terms of volume, specifically Hungary. I think and then
there's a scattered one is Denmark. There's some volume losses. I would say that overall if you look at the key countries

in Western Europe, they're doing well. I mean, as indicated by the share charts I've showed you. But the smaller ones
are having some hiccups. And Foodservice is also something which I said, it's a 2% sales increase, but it's also
suffering in volume. So those are the smaller countries. We focused on the big ones in the beginning.
Smaller ones are suffering a little bit, Eastern Europe, Hungary specifically, and foodservice.

Bryan Spillane, Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hi, Bryan
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi, just two questions. One, Jan, in Coffee especially in your large markets, I guess,
Holland, France and Spain as you launch innovation over the next year, will there be any churn in terms of your current
SKUs? I guess, as you put more higher value SKUs into retail, would we expect to see maybe some of the lower value
SKUs come out or are you expecting to see an expansion or growth in your shelf space? Just trying to understand if
there's any churn that we should expect.
<A - Jan Bennink>: No. I mean, you will see a lot of renovation of all the products which are currently on the shelf.
So I think – I would say we're probably mid-priced to high-priced in some of the markets we're placed. There's no
indication that we will take out the lower priced brands. The only one where we'll be looking at the lower price and
some churn, it might be Brazil because we have some low volume in Brazil. So that one we might be looking at but if
you look at the key countries anywhere else, that will be not eliminating SKUs and replacing them. It is often
re-launches of existing ones, making them better-looking, better-tasting and increase the prices or keep the higher
prices in place. But don't expect a big churn in terms of eliminating SKUs.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay, great. And then, I guess, just one last question, it's just as we move closer or as we
approach the split, just could you remind us, just in terms of what the cash outlays will be, better, I guess, unusual as
you split? There's – aside from the special dividend, are there any other – will there be pension contributions or just any
other sort of abnormal payouts that would be connected with the timing of the split?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yeah, Bryan, it's Mark. The two big payouts that we've currently assumed in our cash and
debt assumptions is of course the $3.00 dividend plus payment of the repatriation tax that we need to pay if we
repatriate that money from Europe to pay the dividend. So, they are the two big ones that are in there and then I've
outlined in my presentation just what the significant item cash payments are, so you can see that as well.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Right. So beyond those three items, there's nothing else that would potentially use up cash
that we should be thinking about.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: At this point, no. Clearly when we talked to you three months ago, we didn't have the Philips
agreement. That was something that came through, which we did at this point...
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Right.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: And as far as – if we see an opportunity that makes sense and we'd obviously look at that, but
at this point, no.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Thank you.

<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: We're trying to be helpful and it's fine. I understand that you asked a question, but the
appropriate thing to do is to complete that process. We are pleased with the way the IRS is dealing with – is navigating
through the file. There's a lot of work going in from the IRS side. We should really complete those discussions with
them first before we start talking about it with the investment community.
<Q - Jason English>: I can appreciate that. On fundamentals with the business, thank you for the additional color on
some of the volume weakness in the Meat business. I think you said almost all of it right now is attributed to the
seasonal products. Well seasons have largely passed and your comparisons do get easier, is it unreasonable to think that
we could be looking towards volume stability going forward?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yeah. We're hoping that in the back half, our volume figures will be better than in the first
half. Obviously whether or not that's going to be zero or a small minus or a small plus, I think it's too early to tell. We
have made a determination that we shouldn't give guidance on that. There's a couple of things that will help. There's
some innovation coming through. We're annualizing some things that we exited. We exited some in-store bakery pie
business with selective customers. We provide them with pre-baked pies and we exited some of that in the third quarter
of last year. So that will lap. We've exited a bit of bacon business. That will lap. So that will help – the innovations will
help. And as I've said, we – we're our own strategy in terms of we want to make sure that we and everybody else
recovers the impact of multi-pricing. But we're not going to sit idly by as people work off a different spreadsheet than
we do.
<Q - Jason English>: Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Yeah.

<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Just curious, Jan, if there is a positive shift we should consider in the sort of ongoing margin
structure for Coffee, as a result of the new Philips deal. Because, I guess, wasn't there a royalty paid I guess on each
pod sold or whatever to Philips? Does that change the margin structure going forward and if so, how substantial is that?
<A - Jan Bennink>: You have a good memory.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Yeah, it's getting worse every day.
<A - Jan Bennink>: If it's getting worse, I mean – yes, it's true. I mean, it was – there was a royalty payment in the old
contract which has been eliminated and that was in the cost of goods. So you would expect that the cost of goods as a
result – I mean then the margin will improve on the Senseo products, yes.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got you. And no or at least willingness to quantify that at this stage?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Not at this stage. I mean I think there is a lot of pluses and minuses. I think we'll wait for the
March Investor Day where we'll give you the full update. But there – a clear answer, there was a royalty payment,
margins of Sanseo will be better.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Great. And then this might be for the Investor Day as well, but I know you've talked in the past
about getting the organic top line growth for Coffee go up to that kind of high single-digit level, and based on all the
things you've got coming, a lot of the reinvestment that you'll do, is it a transition process to get to that level or given
all of the things you've got planned, is high single-digits something you can get to sooner than later?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Because there's a couple of things happening. I mean there's moving parts. I mean if you've seen
the organization, it's probably the key bottleneck. I mean how fast can I get the people in place to make it happen. I
mean execution. The ideas are all there. Wow fast can I get it executed? I think that's what Michiel is was currently
struggling with, getting good sales/marketing people in, making sure that production is capable of moving all the lines.
If I said that all our SKUs will not be looking the same in 24 months from now, that means production-wise, there is an
enormous amount of change happening. So it can't happen overnight. You have to give us time for that.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Yep. Thank you.

Robert Moskow, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi, thank you.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Hi Robert.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: I thought the tone about Europe was more positive than what we've heard from other
consumer staples companies. You mentioned share gains being a big driver of it and the Netherlands, France and Spain.
So, it sounds like your business is regaining some momentum.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Right.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: What about the overall environment though? Is coffee continuing to be a rather unique,
inelastic category in a recessionary climate or are you concerned about what you see going forward? Thanks.
<A - Jan Bennink>: I am not really concerned, I don't know whether you saw also – I mean the Nielson data which is
on the consumer staples in the first four weeks of the year. They were actually all up basically. So, coffee isn't unique. I
think it is the cost of coffee is not necessarily prohibited for growth. I mean it's like people paying for Starbucks
coffees, much more than they pay for the normal coffees.
I don't see it suffering. There's a lot of upside in terms of – there's no competition. I mean very little competition in the
countries where we're playing. Our competition is private labels. In France, we have Kraft, so that's a bit more. So
you're playing against people who are not focus manufacturers. So I think there's a lot of upside in market share gains.

Market will not be growing. I think market will be – look to be stable. I don't expect any big declines or upticks, but it's
more a market share gain. So, I'm not worried about the economic climate for coffee, not at all.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: And, and any other factors...
<A - Jan Bennink>: Normally, we start a presentation and we talk about the economics, we start there and we'll stop
the presentation. We take a cup of coffee and we'll start all over again. This is not the way I run the business.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Well, let me ask then about a follow-up to Andrew's question about the high
single-digit growth, as you look towards fiscal 2013, you're going to lapping all these price increases. Does high single
digit growth imply some kind of price element to it and is it possible it could go negative in fiscal 2013?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I mean, it's a little bit too early to talk about that but overall, I would say will 2013, it will be the
year where you'll see everything happening? As I said before, no, it won't. Will it go negative? I don't think it will go
negative. I think it's – will pricing be a part of it? There might be some inflationary pricing or mix pricing getting in
there but I do not foresee if the raw material prices to continue the way they go, that we'll have any price increases on
our price and the products. So it will be – volume and mix will be the driver rather than price.

<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Good morning, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Just coming back to the Netherlands coffee business, I know that a few quarters ago, you
were worried about private label encroachment in Senseo. I'm just trying to interpret the graph here in terms of the
share trends. Are you now basically saying that year-on-year, you're gaining share rapidly? Here I'm getting a
sequential picture, but for example, in the fourth quarter, was your branded Senseo share gain in the category up
materially year-on-year?
<A - Jan Bennink>: If you take specifically Senseo, no. I mean, Senseo is the laggard in the Dutch portfolio at the
moment. So everything is growing except for Senseo. So that's where we have a lot of work to do and that's where also
a lot of our re-launches and focus will be on for the next six months. So...

<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Just an easy question, I guess, really just routine to cash flows. I'm curious, I know you saw –
or I saw you increased your year-end debt balance from ,I guess, $2.1 million to $2.4 million, so it's about $300
million. But the year-end cash flow balance isn't changing at $300 million. So I guess I come back to, I guess the
question is the actual trademark spend, I didn't see it in the press release for Senseo, should we assume that that cash is
being paid out this fiscal year or could that potentially be deferred to fiscal 2013?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yeah, Rob it will – we're assuming it's paid this fiscal year. It's €117 million between the
actual trademark purchase and the termination of prior contracts with us.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, perfect. And then when I split out the two businesses and I look at what potential
EBITDA could be conservatively, and I look at the debt, it would seem like the Meats business would need to acquire
all of the debt or sort of assume the debt because it will be the parent. And if I do that, then the leverage on the Meats
business winds up being like almost five times. So, I'm just wondering if you can give some color around – I guess the
potential of maybe increasing debt on the Coffee business and then helping pay down that leverage on the Meats
business.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yeah. And what we've said before is that we're assuming and you'll see a lot more of this of
course in the Investors Days, but we're assuming that both companies have investment grade credit ratings. That's what
we're assuming and how we're moving forward here. That would mean from a U.S. perspective where we have all of
our debt essentially right now, that some of that would have to come down and we would have to have debt raised in
Coffee Company. Now the mechanics behind that, we'll go through at the appropriate time. Again, we're getting the
ruling. We're going to get the SEC statements in, et cetera, and you'll have Investor Days and so you'll understand that
more in the coming weeks. But you should not assume that Meat is going to be levered five times.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: No. Right, right, right. Okay, great. And then one last easy question, I know obviously you
continue to point to the frozen breakfast category which you're doing well in and the category itself is doing very well.
And I'm just curious, what do you think is actually driving that consumption? We hear from the cereal players that
cereal is really health and wellness, but it's not growing. So I guess one, do you think you're taking share from cereal,
kind of as an anytime meal or – and/or do you think consumers basically just want to buy taste and not health and
wellness?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: What we're providing is – we're providing a convenience proposition and a – actually a
fairly good start of the day. And that's the campaign, I know that you're familiar with from Jimmy Dean. That's actually
a proposition that resonates with consumers. You can back it up with good data that show that if you eat a meat -based
piece of breakfast, that helps you to be more energized throughout the day. And I'm not going to go further into that
because I think that's something that the meat company needs to further develop.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: But meat in the morning is a good start of the day. And I've had the privilege of working
with a lot of people in the business. And there is quite a bit of data which actually underpins that. So we have a good
advertising campaign, which gets that message across and that's a fact-based campaign. So all these products are just a
decent start of the day. And for moms who want to give their kid something wholesome and healthful which gets them
through the day all the way to lunch, a meat-based breakfast is an excellent choice.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Perfect. All right, well, thank you so much.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Thanks.

<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Thanks, good morning. Just thinking about single-serve in Western Europe here and
particularly the single-serve espresso, given your emphasis on longer-term mix contribution, how are you thinking
about the longer term risks from private label there and even from fresh competition? I realized there isn't much overlap
right now and your reason is ethical coffee, but as the category develops, how are you thinking about longer-term
margins, I mean, even with the Nespresso patents expiring?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I think the – they will all – depends a little bit on how Nespresso is doing and how they will be
able to keep up their legal battles. I think the legal battle of Nespresso continues the way it is and the patents keeping
up and I think there's a lot of leeway still on the patents because they're filing all the time. The private labels have little
chance of entering massively. There's- if you look at it, it is a minor player at the moment everywhere. There is – it's
basically between us and Nestlé. So will there be some pressure? Potentially. Do we expect it a lot? No, I don't think
so. I don't see it. I think there's only upside and I think it is upside in terms of if we will be moving geographically to
other areas, there's a lot of upside for that.

Ken Zaslow, BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Hey, thanks for the question. I just have two quick questions. One is did you discuss what
type of savings you're expecting from moving to the broker network, and can you talk about how that's going to affect
you guys? How much volume is going to be affected for how long on that?
And then the second question is in terms of – staying on the Meat business, the MAP spending being down, is that a
function of just waiting for the innovation to catch up or is that something that – I guess what's the outlook for your
MAP spending beyond the next couple months?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Okay. Let's first talk about the broker situation. That's a double-edged sword. Our analysis
would indicate that we will have saving because we're talking here about accounts, in many instances smaller accounts,
and therefore the broker actually leverages across a wider group of products than just the Sara Lee products. So you
have saving and by the same token, you -we're confident that we will achieve a better sales performance. So it's
something that works in both ways. So far, we're seeing the savings coming through. And as we transition, we're
confident that in the next few quarters, we'll make sure that the increase in sales will come through as well.
We have high confidence. These are people who work for a variety of fast-moving consumer goods people in North
America. Sean actually has experience with them. So the confidence level is high that we will achieve both benefits.
In terms of MAP spending for the back half, what I think you should anticipate is that wherever we have relevant
innovations, we will support them appropriately and I'm not going to pin that down on a specific number, but what
we're doing here is we're putting the business on a sustainable path where by the end of the year, we can say this is the
– this is the profit that we've made and that's based on a sustainable MAP figure. It's sustainable pricing to give you a
good view of what the operating performance of the business is.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Can you quantify the savings on the broker? Is it a couple basis -100 basis points – a
couple basis points, order of magnitude on basis points improvement of the margin structure?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: If you don't mind, I'm going to pass that one. But obviously for that type of fairly complex
implementation, we wouldn't have done that if that would be just for a couple of hundred thousand. So, there's a
meaningful saving. We're pushing through a large program of savings. I think in the earlier calls, we've indicated that
we have an FDE reduction of approximately 400 people. So that's a big number. And this is a meaningful initiative in
that list. It's not the most important initiative, but it's one of the meaningful initiatives that contribute to the overall
savings that we're achieving.

<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: And then just on the MAP side, just to understand, is there a structural increase that needs
to be done or – not next quarter, not the quarter after that, but going out like one to two years, is there a structural shift
that needs to be stepped up in the MAP spending, or is it something that's just going to increase at a rate of sales growth
or something like that longer term? Just are you guys under-investing now and expect to have a big catch up or is it
something that just – you've reached a base at this current level?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: I don't think we are under-investing. We have in the past said that – both Jan and I has
been on record in saying that we think over time, MAP levels in both businesses will go up. But what we now really
need to do is we need to give Sean a free hand to take a view and then present his views on the business because he's
going to be driving that business. And by the way, he's got all the background and training to do that very well. He has
an excellent track record. He's a great marketer. So, I think let's – if you don't mind, I'm going to bump that call to the
investor conference and then Sean will no doubt have a view for you.

Akshay Jagdale, KeyBanc Capital Markets.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Good morning.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: My questions for Jan, just on the long-term prospects of Coffee Company. If you look out
like three to five years, what are some major consumer trends that you think the Coffee Company will have to
capitalize on and how would that sort of manifest itself into the sales mix for the company? Would it manifest itself
into a different country or geographic mix or more so a product type mix?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Yeah, I think if you look at the big consumer trends, what will happen is single-serve will
continue to grow. I think that is a clear indication. I mean, will there be single-serve in different ways, it might be
liquids, it might be different pads, pods, anything. I think single-serve will be an important part. Therefore our – kind of
our link with Philips is critical.
Beans will be another product where I would see growth happening. So just fresh beans, freshness, direct delivery,
personalization of your beans. I mean, kind of you want to have your own type of beans which you get delivered at
home. Price is unimportant. So I think premium products, beans and single-serve is a critical one.
I think if you look at instant, that will continue also to be important and I think instant is the way we're seeing it
developing. I wouldn't be surprised that even in roast & ground markets, instant will become a bigger player than it
currently is. So those are – I would say overall the three areas. roast & ground as a total market will, whether it's filter
or ground coffee, will be not – you will see different things. You will see better products. You will see more catered
products. Where there's a big trend, that you'll see a big increase, no. It is more like market share gain, but the big
trends, beans and single-serve. Those are the two big things and instant will play in a role in there.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: So, looking out a few years, I mean, if Coffee Co is able to do what you strategically want it
to do, would you see a bigger mix shift on product type or is it also sort of a geographic mix shift, also a big component
of the strategy?
<A - Jan Bennink>: No, not necessarily, we don't need a geographical fix. But I prefer to defer this question to March.
I mean, you'll get a full update of where we think the growth will come from, where the segments – what it'll be
growing, what are the consumer trends. We'll go into depth, especially in the beginning of the session. We'll go into all
the consumer trends, exactly the questions you're asking and how we're going to play with that. Geographically, we can
very well play in the geography we are. Do we need to expand to some geographies to just optimize our portfolio?

Your last question. Priya Ohri-Gupta, Barclays Capital.
<Q - Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta>: Hey, thank you for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could add some
color around the capital structure for Beverage Coffee Co. As we look out to potential liability management that could
ensue in the coming months, should we be thinking about debt issuance for Coffee Co occurring primarily in European
markets or the U.S. markets or some combination of the two? Thank you.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Hi, it's Mark. You will get a lot more detail again in March, when we have our Investor Day
on Coffee. But as you know, we will be looking to raise some debt in Coffee Co. That could be U.S. or European. We
haven't made the final determination on that yet.
