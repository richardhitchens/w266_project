Robert J. Stevens
Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. We know most of you are having a really
busy day and we appreciate you being with us.
I want to begin with a brief summary of the third quarter, which I see as a continuation of the strong momentum and
focus on execution we've been achieving throughout this year. In the third quarter, segment operating margin increased
to 12.1%, a solid improvement over the prior year level of 11.2%. Cash generation was strong at $1.6 billion and
earnings per share from continuing operations expanded by 11%.
Our financial strength enabled the 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.15 a share or $4.60 annually. This is the
10th consecutive year that we've raised the dividend by a double-digit percentage increase. We continued to implement
our cash deployment strategy and returned over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter, through dividend payments
and share repurchases.
Strong year-to-date performance and execution also enabled us to increase our 2012 full year outlook for sales,
operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. These results reflect the strength of our corporation and
the focus we all have on delivering value to customers and shareholders. Thanks to everyone in the company for their
many contributions in driving these strong results.
Turning to the external environment and budget status, Congress passed the continuing resolution to fund government
fiscal year 2013 activities for six months, through March the 27, 2013.
Under this continuing resolution, our key programs continue to be supported and funded at levels consistent with prior
fiscal year appropriations. Beyond the continuing resolution that's in place, the possibility of sequestration continues to
be of great concern to us.
As currently written, this law that requires approximately $55 billion in reductions to defense accounts and a like
amount to non-defense discretionary accounts will take effect on January, the 2. We have petitioned Congress and the
administration to stop sequestration and replace it with a more constructive process, a position we continue to support.
In parallel, we've also been asking the government for additional planning information, so we can responsibly and
properly prepare to act.
On September the 28, the Department of Defense provided additional planning guidance indicating that no contract
actions associated with sequestration would occur on January the 2, the date sequestration is to be effective. And that
no contract action would likely occur for several months beyond January the 2.
On that same day, the Office of Management and Budget assured that any of our employees who would potentially be
affected by a reduction in force necessitated by sequestration would be eligible for full coverage under the provisions of
the WARN Act and that our company would be able to recover associated costs.
With this new information, we adjusted the timing of our actions as it would have been improper for us to issue WARN
notices in October or November, when the timing of any potential sequestration-related events would likely not occur
for at least six months or more.

Some reporting about our decision to move the timing of the release of WARN notices has been inaccurate. Concluding
that, we either no longer intend to issue WARN notices at the sequestration-driven reduction in force, if necessary or
that employees potentially affected by reduction in force would not have the full coverage of the WARN Act or that our
actions may have been taken to achieve some political objective.
These conclusions are not only inaccurate, they're absolutely wrong. The additional planning guidance we received
from the Department of Defense on September the 28, moved the likely timing of sequestration-related actions by the
government by about three months into 2013, and we adjusted our schedule accordingly.
So, let me be very clear. We will issue WARN notices at the appropriate time, if sequestration actions meet the
required conditions in full compliance with the law as we always have. We will work to assure that our employees are
treated fully and fairly under the law, receiving protection under the WARN Act, which for us has been and remains a
high and non-negotiable priority.
And our sole interest and motivation throughout all the discussions about sequestration has been to understand the
complex issues arising from this unprecedented circumstance, to be fully compliant with law and regulation and to take
actions in the best interest of our company and our employees. We have done so and we will continue to work to stop
sequestration.
So, while I can't precisely forecast the impacts of sequestration or events that will unfold in a dynamic global security
environment, there is one thing I know for certain. Every one of our 120,000 employees stands ready to take on
whatever challenges will emerge.
We've worked hard over many years to build a culture based on ethics and integrity and high performance. We have a
strategy that is tuned to the complex global security environment we face. We have extraordinary talent and dedicated
employees who have fashioned an all-weather portfolio of global solutions for global customers and we continue on
our drive to reduce costs and meet affordability goals.
We'll be happy to talk to you about these subjects and any others you may wish; but first, let's turn to Chris for an
outline of our operational highlights. Chris?
Christopher E. Kubasik
Thanks, Bob. As you noted, from an operating perspective, we had a very strong quarter and maintained our positive
momentum in an uncertain and challenging environment. We also continued to implement strategic actions to increase
our customer alignment and drive affordability throughout the enterprise.
We recently announced the de-layering and re-organization of our Electronic Systems business resulting in two new
business areas effective December 31. The businesses are: Missiles and Fire Control, which focuses mainly on the
mission of the Army and Special Operations Forces; and Mission Systems and Training, which supports the Navy and
the Missile Defense Agency. This new structure will streamline management, reduce costs by $50 million a year and
better position us to grow integrated services and support for our products.
I'm also proud of our continuous efforts to improve affordability and I would like to highlight three areas. First, we're
leveraging engineering processes and advanced technology. Second, we've improved supply chain integration. And
finally, we've reduced our overhead costs.
One of the best opportunities to drive affordability is in the design and technology insertion phase, where we make
decisions in concert with our customers about how mission success will be achieved.
We've developed engineering-for-affordability principles that center around rapid, transparent and collaborative
decision-making to achieve mission success with the most affordable designs. Advanced technology is foundational to
this approach. Application of advanced manufacturing processes and materials allows us to perform more rapid
prototyping, reduce component costs, speed up the development process and shorten design cycles. We are training our
engineering workforce to bring cost to the forefront in all of our development programs.

The supply chain is another focus area. About 60% of our program content is provided by our suppliers and teammates.
As systems become increasingly complex, tight integration of this network of companies is key to maintaining
affordability.
To respond to this complexity, we have launched a focused effort to meet with our top suppliers and subcontractors to
assure plans are in place to continuously improve their program execution, affordability and quality. We also have
instituted corporate-wide agreements, which have generated more than $300 million in annual savings.
Reducing overhead costs is another element of our approach to affordability. Our significant successes in this area
include reduction of $1.2 billion in annual costs over the past two years, while remaining on target for an additional
$1.1 billion this year. We've reduced 1.5 million square feet of facilities over the past two years and have additional
planned reductions of 2.9 million square feet for 2012 through 2014.
With the future uncertain, we will continue with our initiatives, remain agile, and take further actions should
sequestration occur.
Turning to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, overall the program continues to progress in development flight
testing, solving technical challenges, increasing production deliveries, and expanding international activities.
Total flight tests on the program have now been ahead of plan for the last 21 months. Year-to-date through September,
test flights are ahead of plan by 181 flights or 25%. And test points are also ahead of plan by over 1,100 points or 17%.
We currently have 15 aircraft executing this plan.
With our IAM partners back to work, production activities also continue to expand as we delivered 12 aircraft in the
third quarter, up significantly from second quarter deliveries of three aircraft. This brings year-to-date production
deliveries to 17 aircraft, illustrating the program's maturity and progress.
Internationally, the F-35 is maintaining strong partner support. This quarter, we delivered the first international aircraft
to the United Kingdom with the acceptance of their initial STOVL aircraft. And Italy became the eighth international
customer to formally fund procurement for aircraft.
We continue to receive significant interest and inquiries from other international countries as they evaluate the F-35 for
their next-generation fighter requirements. We recognize that the key to the long-term success of the F-35 program is
delivering fifth generation capability, while driving down the cost of the aircraft as quickly as possible. And it is
happening.
Our labor cost curve for assembling aircraft is improving faster than any previous fighter program dating back over 40
years. As volume increases, we believe this has us positioned to achieve the unit-recurring flyaway cost objective of
$67 million, and [ph] FY $12 (12:25) by 2018. We are achieving these results by implementing various cost-cutting
programs, such as streamlining aircraft assembly, reducing time between building jets and improving material flow.
At Fort Worth earlier this week, I saw firsthand the improved aircraft processing flow and upgraded tooling that is
helping to drive down the cost below the government's baseline estimates.
In summary, the program is demonstrating increasing maturity, tempo and affordability. And the JSF team looks
forward to providing this critical asset to our nation and our allies.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance.
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Chris. And good afternoon, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along
with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.

Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of the third quarter. Sales for the quarter were $11.9 billion, similar to what
we generated in the second quarter of this year. Our segment operating profit margin was strong at 12.1% and I'll
discuss that in more detail in a couple of charts. Earnings per share grew 11% to $2.21. Our cash from operations was a
robust $1.6 billion. And we increased our quarterly dividend by 15% to $1.15 per share, while also increasing our
outlook for sales, earnings, EPS and operating cash for the full year. Lastly, in our release today, we provided
preliminary 2013 financial trends and pension information and I'll discuss those in a little more detail in later charts as
well.
On chart 4, we'll look at sales by the four business areas. Aeronautics sales were 7% lower than in the third quarter of
last year, driven primarily by lower C-130 deliveries and F-22 production volume.
Electronic systems sales grew 4% in the quarter as all three lines of business had growth over the same period last year.
As expected IS&GS had lower sales than last year, but the decline was only 1%, as we experienced continued growth
in our intelligence line of business, driven by federal cyber activities.
Space Systems sales were 5% lower than the same period last year, as we had one commercial satellite delivery last
year and none this quarter. So, overall a 2% decline in sales driven by lower aircraft quantities in the quarter and the
timing with satellite deliveries.
On a year-to-date basis on chart 5, you can see that three of the four business areas have experienced growth over the
2011 period with total sales up 2%. This strong performance led to the increase in our full year sales outlook.
On chart 6, we'll discuss our segment operating profit margins for the quarter. The primary reason for the 90 basis point
margin increase to 12.1% was due to improvements in Electronic Systems and Space Systems. In Electronic Systems
the margin improved by 110 basis points to 13.3%. The improvement came from Missiles and Fire Control, primarily
in Air and Missile Defense programs and MS2 from our Ships and Aviation Systems programs.
The increased margin for Space Systems was primarily due to higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance and
wind-down activities associated with United Space Alliance. The margins for Aeronautics and IS&GS were relatively
comparable to last year.
Turning to chart 7 and our earnings per share in the quarter, EPS from continuing operations grew 11% over the
amount reported last year, driven mostly by the higher margins in the quarter and adjusting our reported EPS for the
effects of the FAS/CAS adjustment increases our EPS to $2.60 per share.
If you'll turn to chart 8, you can see our operating cash flow performance in the quarter compared with last year.
Operating cash was just under $1.6 billion this quarter compared to $551 million last year, though last year included
nearly $1 billion in pension contributions. And considering the strong performance so far this year, we again increased
our guidance for operating cash flow by $100 million to greater than or equal to $4 billion for the year.
On chart 9, we'll discuss the dividend increase in the quarter, our 10th consecutive year of double-digit increases. You
can see the dramatic increase in dividend levels and yield over the past five years with the current yield in 2012 more
than twice what it was in 2008. And the increase brings our annualized dividend yield to just about 5% based on recent
prices.
On chart 10, we'll discuss our updated guidance. Due to the year-to-date sales performance, we increased our sales
outlook by $500 million. We increased segment operating profit by $175 million. We also increased our earnings per
share by $0.30, which I'll detail on the next chart and again we increased our cash from operations by $100 million.
Chart 11 shows our earnings per share outlook reconciliation. You can see that the segment margin – segment
operating profit increase was the primary reason for adding $0.30 to our guidance, reflecting the increased earnings
outlook by each of the four business areas.
Chart 12 shows our increased sales guidance with all four business areas increasing guidance for the year, resulting in
the $500 million increase in total. Space Systems has the largest increase, $250 million reflecting strong government

satellite activity. And Electronic Systems increased by $150 million with growth coming from both MS2 and Missiles
and Fire Control.
Chart 13 shows our new segment operating profit guidance. Here again, all four business areas are increasing their
outlook for the year with the largest increases also coming from Electronic Systems and Space Systems and the total
increase for the year equaling $175 million.
On chart 14, we'll discuss the preliminary trends we see for 2013. First, our trend data does not assume the impact of
sequestration as there are still many unknowns remaining as to how sequestration would be implemented, if enacted.
With that caveat, we expect a low single-digit decline in our total sales volume. Aeronautics and Electronic Systems are
expected to be roughly comparable with 2012 levels. Space is expected to be down slightly due to the absence of any
commercial satellite deliveries in 2013. And for IS&GS, we are expecting a decline in the mid single-digit range,
resulting primarily from the continued downturn in federal IT budgets. IS&GS also is expected to have the greatest
impact from the continuing resolution due to the short cycle nature of the business.
We expect our segment operating margin will remain above 11% next year, the seventh consecutive year that our
margin will exceed 11%. And with an assumed 75 basis point reduction in the discount rate at year-end down to 4%
and an 8% return on assets this year, our FAS/CAS pension adjustment is expected to be $700 million, about $135
million lower than the 2012 level.
Finally, we expect the level of pension contributions next year to be comparable to this year's level, although I'll remind
you that we'll be considering potential discretionary contributions between now and year-end, consistent with our
historical practice.
And finally, we wrap up with our summary on chart 15. The third quarter builds upon the strong performance we've
demonstrated this year and our increased outlook reflects our expectation that 2012 will be a very solid year. We
continue to return value to shareholders with our industry-leading dividend yield and we'll be providing detailed
guidance on the January call reflecting our new business area alignments.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris for final thoughts before he open up for questions. Chris?
Christopher E. Kubasik
Thanks, Bruce. I just wanted to take a quick minute and remind everyone that this is Bob's last earnings call as he steps
down as CEO later this year; and therefore, he won't be joining us on future calls. Despite knowing his aversion to
personal praise and accolades, I want to thank him for his service and stewardship of our corporation. Bob's leadership
and passion have been embedded in the DNA of our corporation. His focus on mentoring and training of
next-generation leaders has created the deepest bench strength in the industry and will serve the corporation for decades
to come.
On a personal note, I've had the privilege of working with Bob for over a decade in my various roles, and I've seen his
passion for the mission and his drive for excellence demonstrated on a daily basis.
I know many of you on the call have also had the pleasure and opportunity to interact with Bob over the years. So, Bob,
I'd like to speak for all of us and thank you for your contributions and wish you the best.
With that, I'll open up the lines for questions, Allie, and we stand-by to answer.

[Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we are limiting you to one question. Please return to the queue for any
follow-up questions. Our first question comes from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Yes. Thank you. Yeah, first, Bob, it's hard to believe it's your last earnings call. And I
just wanted to say, it's been great working with you over the years. I mean, you've always provided some great insights
regarding both the company and the industry. And so, I wish you all the best going forward. But I'd like to get one
more insight from you on a favorite topic here, which is the F-35.
If you look back over your last several years, could you describe how the F-35 program has changed in two ways?
First, how has Lockheed Martin's relationship with the customer evolved? Since negotiations always appear to be pretty
tense and neither of you has much of an alternative to the other? And then second, how has Lockheed Martin's
approach to performance changed along with that of the program office, so that you can avoid some of the pitfalls that
we saw farther back in the past related to cost and quality and schedule? So, perhaps you could give us a sense of those
two things.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Sure. I'll do my best, Doug. Thanks for the kind comments. Let me start with the evolution
of the program and customer relations. I actually think that with respect to expectations, we've been very, very close
with all our customers. And I would extend that to members of the Congress. I think everybody understands that we
have an aging, tactical fighter fleet that we need to capitalize that fleet, that we need fifth-generation capabilities. And
in the most ideal circumstance, we would not do this alone, but we would do this with friends and allies. So, that we
would have both burden sharing on the cost and flexibility and interoperability on the mission-capability side of that
platform; and the F-35 does all those things.
Since I was here at the beginning, or the inception of the F-35 program, I know full well that no one really
underestimated the challenge or the complexity of bringing online a fifth-generation airplane with three variants that
would have the performance characteristics that are embedded in the F-35.
And I would tell you, in my best professional judgment having done this for a long time, while there are areas of
challenges that we continue to work on, there are other areas where we've done very well. And I think, if you scale the
size of this program – recall that, many people talk about it being the biggest program or the most expensive program.
But it is designed to replace more than 10 other kinds of airplanes. So, that if you have an overrun of a percentage, it's a
big overrun because it's a big complex program.
Anytime we don't meet a performance commitment, we feel there's been a shortfall on our part and we redouble our
efforts to accomplish those goals. But, I think the program has had the highest level of visibility, the most numbered of
detailed reviews, and absolutely the greatest level of transparency where you all on the call know the technical details
of this program as it's unfolding almost at the same time the engineers responsible for the performance of the system
know it. And, I think there's some very good features of that and I think there's some really lousy features of that
because people come from the wrong conclusion because they haven't done this before as to what is a likely outcome
about resolving a technical issue. So, we know that it's not easy but this program is succeeding. And, I'll ask Chris to
comment in a moment because it's worth the time to comment. He spent time in Fort Worth with the new Chief of Staff
of the Air Force who's deeply involved in this program. Chris will give you his own assessment. You mentioned
customer relations. It's a challenging program but I personally believe the customer wants what we want and we will do
everything that we must do to have very high quality relations and get everything about this program right because the
stakes for the country and for our friends and allies are just too damn high to set the bar anywhere else.
With regard to our performance, we've always been realistic. We have superb subject matter expertise here. I would put
our high-speed combat tactical fighter airplane program credentials against any other company on this planet and I
believe there are those who would kill to have the capabilities we have in not only our company, but remember, the
extensive supply chain that we've built for the F-35 around the world. So, it's a complicated program but it is improving
in its dimensions. We're happy to pick ourselves up and move ourselves forward. When we're doing well, we'll tell you.
When we're not doing well, we'll redouble our efforts to get this right. Chris, you have some insight; you've been in
Fort Worth just this week.

<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Yeah. Thanks, Bob. Doug, a couple of things I might want to point out is we actually
have 94 aircrafts in production flow between Fort Worth, Marietta, and the Italian facility. So, we have LRIP 3 aircraft,
all the way up through and including our first LRIP 7 airplane. So, I'm not sure everyone appreciates the quantity and
the speed at which these aircrafts are in fact being produced. And, as I look ahead to next year, we will actually deliver
more F-35's in 2013 than the F-16 and the C-130J combined. So, the volume is picking up, the production is going
well, and the customer has been very satisfied in the deliveries that we've made. And, as many of you may know, even
later this year the Marine Corps is preparing for its first operational base for the F-35 at the Marine Corps Air Station in
Yuma. So, there is some outside perspective to give you the volume and the progress that we're making. Specifically,
you asked about the relationship, and General Bogdan was in Fort Worth recently, last week if I recall, had very
productive meetings with the team. We're very excited about him taking over, and we're looking forward to working
with him. And, we're both committed to 100% strong – 100% commitment to a strong and collaborative relationship.
As Bob said, I was recently this week down with General Welsh. He is very engaged. He was checking on the status of
his aircraft. And, both these gentlemen are very demanding. They hold us to the highest standards possible and we
actually prefer that. So, we're looking forward to a great 2013 on F-35 and much more after that.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Yes. Bob, a couple of years ago, you laid out a vision for making Lockheed a global security
company. And, in a way, one can see the proposed move with EADS and BAE as some attempt to – for others to catch
up on that. Can you expand a little bit on what you see going forward in terms of pressing on that vision? Do you think
that you would be looking – that the company would be looking for international acquisitions or pieces of that to build
more of a global perspective?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Heidi. When we talked years ago about a global security
company, we were not necessarily focusing on international acquisitions as much as expanding international
opportunities by building the core portfolio of the business that would address the emerging or evolving needs. And, of
course, at the time we were talking about cyber security when I think others weren't talking about cyber security. We
were talking about moving more into services business and support and logistics for the core that we have. I'll tell you,
I am really quite pleased with the portfolio that we have and how well that portfolio is maturing. Now, I will certainly
say in the same breath, that which was embedded in Doug's question, we want to do a better job on the F-35, we know
there are areas where we need to improve, and I think we're a company that realistically looks at that. But, I am very
pleased with the portfolio. So, as we look at the evolution of global security now, we take into account the evolution of
world economic conditions that I think generally we would describe as showing signs of stress, and the stress may be
different depending upon what region of the world we look at. But, generally, we've concluded there will be fewer
resources available to our customers, wherever those customers may be, relative to meeting what is essentially a
growing set of demands in the global security environment, which tells us as we evolve this portfolio into international
opportunities we must continue to drive on affordability and cost reduction. And, I think we're doing that effectively.
And, we have not stopped the continuous pursuit of refining that mark. I think we've done a very good job of exploiting
partnerships internationally. Rather than making international acquisitions as the only avenue to extend the range of our
company, we've sought out very high quality partners who bring immediate value-added credentials to enhance our
offerings. And, I think you should look for more of that from us. But, you should also think of us relative to
acquisitions in terms of extending the string of pearls approach of very selective, very high quality, very easy to
integrate, very specific and purposeful additions to the business. So, I do expect more from Chris and the leadership
team on extending the global security reach of the company.
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: And, Heidi, I'll just – it's Chris. I'll give you a little more insight. Here in the third
quarter, 25% of our orders were actually from international customers. And, as you know, we're – currently about 17%
of our revenue is derived from foreign military sales and direct commercial sales. I see a pathway to about 20%. And, I
think that's based on the strength of the portfolio as Bob said, and when you look at missile defense with PAC-3 and
THAAD, the precision-guided weapons, and of course the aircraft, I'd be disappointed if we're not at that 20% goal in

Our next question comes from Bill Loomis of Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: Hi. Thank you. I have a question on IS&G (sic) [IS&GS] (32:39) on the outlook. You talked
about a lower mid single-digit decline next year, yet you've won some pretty substantial contracts, the DISA GSM-O
and DoD DC3 are just two of them. What's going away as some of these bigger wins you've had are ramping up over
the next year?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes. Bill, this is Bruce. I'll take that one on. I think – when I think of IS&GS going into next
year, there's really two pressures that we see occurring simultaneously. One is, as you're well aware of, there is a
six-month continuing resolution at least for the first six months of the fiscal year. I'll remind you that IS&GS is the
shortest cycle business of our – of all of our business areas. And, therefore, it converts the most sales from the current
fiscal year of any of our business areas. So that continuing resolution period caused us to have some pause from some
increases that might otherwise have happened had that not been in place. And, the second element that's causing some
pressure in 2013 is simply the overall federal IT budget. And, if you take a look at where the federal IT budget is
planned for 2013 and beyond, it has some significant reductions from the previous year's level. And, being that we're
the largest provider of IT services for 18 straight years, it's hard to overcome that sort of budget reduction when you're
as big a player in that marketplace as we are. So, those are really the two biggest drivers going into next year. And, I
wouldn't want to split it up and say which one is the bigger contributor but I'd say probably, if I was, it would be the
overall IT budget reductions.

Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. First off, Bob, great working with you over a very long period of time and best
wishes to you. I have a more mundane question just on the change in Electronic Systems and the restructuring there –
or the realignment there. Just on the surface it doesn't seem like breaking one segment into two would save money and
obviously that's what you guys are in the business of doing these days. So, maybe if you could help elaborate on why
that saves money and if it's just a matter of taking a layer out, why wasn't it done previously? Just finally, on the same
point, does this – can we read anything into this in terms of potential portfolio moves next year?
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Joe, this is Chris. I'll take a attempt at that. The way we eliminate cost in this is that
we've eliminated a layer between the businesses and then ultimately the executive office. If you go back in history,
maybe a decade ago or so, we had probably 12 individual entities, maybe all in the $0.5 billion to $1 billion range and
the Electronic Systems business area oversaw and managed that broad portfolio. Over time, we've consolidated and
combined each of those entities, most recently with Owego being combined into our MS2 business, prior to that I think
the Eagan facility as well. So, when we looked at the current alignment, we had about four businesses reporting in and
we thought they had gotten to the scale and the size that we could consolidate them. Each of these will themselves
eliminate some costs and we're looking at – probably close to 200 of our employees will be laid off as part of this
process here in the coming months. And, we think it was the right thing to do and it was the right time to do it.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: In terms of portfolio moves, anything we can read into it, Chris?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Nope.
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Nope, it was just to – like I said, to eliminate the costs, get closer to the customer, and
better align our training and services business with the underlying core product. So that's all there was to it.

Our next question comes from Michael Lewis of Lazard Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael S. Lewis>: Hi. Thank you. And, my question is how do you see the book-to-bill ending out Q4? And, I
think the more important question is have you noted any momentum from the POs on getting awards out the door
quicker following the yearend and now moving into the next fiscal year?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, Michael, this is Bruce. I'll take that one on. Book-to-bill wise, let me just – maybe just
address it from a backlog perspective. I think we're at $75.6 billion or something like that through the end of the third
quarter. That's basically tracking where we thought we'd be at this time. We are actually probably a little bit ahead of
where we thought we'd be otherwise. I've said on previous calls and I'll say on this one, I still think we will end the year
fairly close to where we began the year, at close to $80 billion of backlog, and the orders that need to happen in the
fourth quarter, there's very few of them that are, I'll say, competitive orders. Most of them are just fiscal year orders that
happen every year and they're not just sort of orders that are subject to the sequestration limits because they are not
necessarily large orders that are increasing over the prior fiscal year's – last year, same timeframe. The one big item
that we are watching is, in order to get to that level that I talked about, again close to where we started the year at from
a backlog perspective, we need to close on the F-35, LRIP 5 contract and get the additional fundings from undefinitized
contractual action for Lot 6 on that. We stand here today, thinking that can be done in the fourth quarter and that's the
basis of the planning that we have for the end of the year for that backlog number.
As far as your second question, some acceleration; I think we saw some of that throughout the year. That's, again, one
of the reasons why I think we were ahead of where we thought we might otherwise be at the end of the third quarter
and I think people back – I can't remember if Chris said it or whoever said it earlier but some comments about
unfunded obligations and trying to get funds put on contract as we head into a sequestration environment. I think we
saw some customer actions doing that. It's hard to put a figure on that, if you will, but I think we did see – our
experience with that some of this earlier this year as well.

Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good afternoon. Bob, best of luck with the next chapter.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thank you.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Quick question, just as a bit of a follow-on, taking the last questioner's topic one step further
and talk about 2013 as it relates to the opportunity set. Assuming that sequester – there is some sort of resolution there,
what are the things that are going to drive backlog and book-to-bill next year? And, given the pipeline and the visibility
that you have, is it possible for us to continue to maintain a book-to-bill around 1?
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Jason, this is Chris. Let me give you a couple of the larger opportunities and orders
that we're looking at. We have F-16 in Iraq. We have a multiyear potential for the C-130J with the U.S. Government.
We have the next tranche of C-5 aircraft. And, while it probably wouldn't be an order, but there is a decision for the
F-35 in South Korea. And, I think that might actually hit the books when we're successful in 2014. But, the decision
should be announced later this year in 2013. So, we see those opportunities in Aeronautics and the Space business. Of
course, Orion, we're looking at two more [indiscernible] (41:25) satellites. And, there's actually a couple of commercial
satellites internationally that we're in current discussions with. So, I see opportunities there as well. The former
Electronic Systems, a couple more Littoral Combat Ships, as I mentioned in my upfront comments, missile defense
between Aegis and PAC-3 and THAAD we see lots of opportunities, not only here but around the globe. And, then
within IS&GS there's several opportunities including a couple international, specifically in Australia and working with
the Missile Defense Agency here. So, it's a pretty broad portfolio. Some of these are competitive, some are follow-on.
But, we're pretty optimistic about the 2013 opportunities to grow this enterprise.

<A - Robert J. Stevens>: And, Jason, you asked the question could we hold – I think if I understood your question
right, could we hold to the level of backlog that we had this year. We still think we'll end the year 2013, assuming the
orders that Chris just described come through, at about – again for another year, about the $80 billion level as well.

Our next question comes from Rob Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Good evening.
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Hey, Rob.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: How are you, Rob?
<Q - Rob Stallard>: First of all, best of luck for the future, Bob. It's been quite a ride.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thank you.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: The question I have is regarding the dividend. You highlighted that you raised the dividend again
quite recently, another double-digit increase. You're now paying at over 50% of earnings, over 50% of free cash flow.
How much longer can these double-digit increases continue until they start to get a little bit unsustainable?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Rob, I'll take that one on. We – I think we've been very pleased with the dividend
increases and what we think that's brought in terms of, I'll say at least from my perspective, a little bit of price stability
and I think a little bit of price floor to the stock price since we've increased the dividend here recently to the levels that
we have now. Several years back under Bob and Chris's leadership, we committed to providing 50% or more of free
cash flow in the form of either dividends or share repurchases. I'm pleased to say with the increases we give in
dividends, we now do that strictly by the dividends that we do provide. We're – if we just stop there with dividends,
you're already at the 50% of free cash flow. As I look this year and next year, the first thing that I tend to do when I
look at the dividend and payouts and the like is I do adjust for the FAS/CAS. So, if I was to do that this year, for
instance, I think we'd add back $1.60 or so for the FAS/CAS impact to our numbers in the – and, therefore, the earnings
per share gets close to a $10-per-share number. So, when you get on a cash-on-cash basis, the dividends are less than
50% as I would view it today. And, I think going forward the question is how much cash do we need to invest in the
company to support the growth rate of the company. We're generating far more cash today than we need to support the
growth rate, particularly when that growth rate starts to slow going forward. And so, going forward, I still believe we
will be generating more cash than we need to support the growth of the company. And, we will have the opportunity
when cash harmonization kicks in, in particular over the next few years, to recover a lot of the discretionary – and not
just discretionary but that's a big piece of it – pension payments that we've paid in the last few years. And that will have
the effect of increasing cash over what you might ordinarily think is sort of an average run rate. I'll remind you that we
have some $4 billion of advanced funding in our pension plan that is yet to be recovered under our government
contract. So, as cash harmonization plays out over the next few years that will be added to the average run rate, if you
will, of cash generation. And, I think that's where the opportunity to continue with dividends and other cash
deployment actions, not just dividends, will come from.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So, pension, $700 million; walk us through some of the assumptions. You talked a little bit
about the discount rate but, like, where is your return – what are you assuming for a return on assets and where are you
year-to-date? What should we look for CAS to do next year? What should we look for your contribution to be next
year?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. I'll take that one on also. So, pensions were – we changed our long-term rate, I'd say, at
the start of this year, end of last year to 8% per year. We're tracking very nicely to that as we sit here today. I think the
overall global markets are above that and we're tracking I'll say nicely with, what, a little less than two months to go on
the year but I feel good about what our returns are for this year. Next year's numbers were also premised – well, I'll
back up – next year's numbers were premised on us achieving 8% this year so that's the starting point. And, as far as the
CAS cost next year by itself, I'm trying to recall that but I think the CAS cost itself goes up to, like – think of it $1.4
billion-ish or so. Think of a FAS number, if we stopped today, somewhere around $2.1 billion and that's how you get to
the $700 million FAS/CAS adjustment. And, the contributions that we're expecting to make next year are essentially
the same as this year; you just think of that as $1.1 billion-ish range.

Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good afternoon.
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Hi, Sam.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Chris, I wanted to go back to something you had said earlier in the call. You talked about
$1.2 billion of overhead reduction in the last two years and on the docket for another $1.1 billion this year. And, I'm
trying to just understand how much does it cost for you to actually accomplish that? What kind of returns do you get?
And, then how much of that do you actually get to keep as opposed to it ultimately going back to the customer?
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Yeah, Sam. That's a great question. It varies by business area. This is pretty much the
overhead reduction. A lot of this ties to some of the facility. I gave you some numbers on the facility square footage
that we're taking out. We do a business case and a payback for all these affordability projects that we have. And,
generally, they pay back within the 12 to 18-month cycle. So, when we do something like facility consolidation, we'll
be moving – the cost of moving, the cost of consolidating as it relates to that. Right now we're about 50% cost plus,
50% fixed price. So, half goes in back to the government if you will; the other half generally is built into our forward
pricing to some degree. It really depends on the backlog mix. But, the investments to get these overhead savings are not
that significant and generally results in both people and capital assets as the main driver. Of course, we're focused on
processes and new systems and such. But, it's a pretty quick payback.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Sam, I'll – let me add to that. The conversation that we have internally here has placed a
greater emphasis on this general subject of affordability and cost reduction because, with or without sequestration, we
know that we're facing a long cycle where the demands of our security customers are going to go up relative to their
missions. And, they're not going to have the economic resources available to meet those growing demands. And, we've
got to get out in front of this. So, we are pushing ourselves. And, Chris is absolutely right and embedded in your
question is the notion you certainly want to pick the highest payoff opportunities and do them the soonest and we are.
But, I'm not and we've not been reluctant to look at all sorts of cost reduction opportunities, even if they have a longer
payback. As long as they pay back because it's going to be a longer cycle process that we're involved with, where it's
going to take continuous refinement, continuous refocusing. And, one of the benefits that we think we achieve from
some of these reorganizations is not necessarily measured in the economic return but in our ability to have greater
levels of agility and more refined resource allocation, so we can move with the increasing rate of the volatility in our
markets. So, one of the characteristics we've seen out on the marketing horizon is this shorter cycle, much more highly
volatile environment where change is occurring more quickly and you have to be able to respond to that change. And

so, there's this proportionality between the size and structure of the organization and the ability to move quick at the
edge. And, we're getting better at moving quick to the edge. And, with that, we can take costs out of the business.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Sam, you might get a triple out of this one because I'll speak to this one also. And, I
think I'm going to go back to something Chris said in his opening remarks. I think we're all good at it, we've all
demonstrated, we've all done this throughout our careers of taking the kind of actions to reduce facilities, head count
when it's required and I don't think that's necessarily all that newsworthy or all that new and innovative. What Chris
mentioned in his opening remarks, though, talking about taking into account affordability to the design of products and
getting that upfront view of affordability that's something I am actually very excited about. And, I think we've really
just scratched the surface on that. And, as we see the chance to bid and win new products with that concept in mind, I
think you will see some really interesting characteristics coming out of that because we are changing the nature of
maybe how we've done that in years past to – in a manner, in a process that I think is going to pay off significantly to
both ourselves and our customer.

Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hi, good afternoon. And, Bob, let me join everyone in congratulating you on all your
successes. I think, Chris, he's left you with a pretty high bar for stock price performance and I think as a shareholder
he'll hold you to it. So, best of luck on that.
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: He's right here.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: I'm right here. He is up to it, Carter. Trust me, he's up to it.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: I want to expand on the last question, if you will. Obviously, your peers are chasing down the
cost curve as well to remain competitive. And, I wondered if you might tell us how it is that you benchmark yourself
against the peer group to see how well of a job you're actually doing and getting costs out? Obviously, there is a lot of
overhead that's going to need to come out of the industrial base given the budget forecasts that we're looking at even
without sequestration. And so, I wondered if you might share with us how it is that you benchmark yourself and then
give us an assessment of where you are relative to your peers in your efforts so far.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah, I'll be very blunt about this. We started to take costs out before our peers. And, we had
no reservation about being the first mover here. And, there are an extraordinary number of metrics that we can
benchmark ourselves to. We think one of the most meaningful ones is examining our win rate when we get our
feedback from our customer – how many competitions are we losing because we were not cost competitive – because
that brings it home more clearly than anything else. I think what will give us the competitive advantage as we move
forward with a competitive group that is also attempting to remove cost is we've made significant new investments in
new products where others have older product lines that will require new investments. For example, we have the
Littoral Combat Ship. We have the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter which is a fifth generation capability. We've refreshed
Aegis to an open architecture. We evolved PAC-3 and we're evolving the THAAD Missile System. These are all new
and fresh technologies. We have a similar portfolio in Space Systems. The vitality and the vibrancy and the recent
investment in these new next-generation systems, I think, has a lot more legs in a competitive climate, particularly in a
climate where we'll be taking costs out. So, our goal here is to focus on the benchmarks in the industry. We are entirely
comfortable at front-running the industry when we have confidence in knowing what we have to do and how we have
to do it. And, we have that confidence. We think we have a relevant portfolio that's proven. And, as we drive higher
levels of affordability, we think we'll pass that metric of cost-competitiveness in competitive awards as we look
forward.
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Yeah, Carter, I'm glad you asked the follow-up question because we do spend a lot of
time talking about affordability. And, the point I was trying to get across is it's more than the cost-cutting. We talked
about the supply chain. And, Bruce reemphasized the importance of the engineering and design. So, we can go on all

day. But, another very, very important element is the volume. And, the executive leadership team spends a fair amount
of their time traveling the globe, building relationships, meeting with customers because we all know whatever product
it is, if we can get some of our allies and friends around the globe to also purchase airplanes or missiles, not only does
the U.S. Government benefit, but they benefit as well just from a financial perspective. There is obviously strategic,
operational, and other benefits of coalition of warfare but that's another leg of the affordability. And, we spend a lot of
time trying to grow this business. And that's one of the benefits that all of our customers realize.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Allie, this is Jerry. Just to be sure, I've got a note here that there are seven people in the

Yes, sir. Our next question comes from Rich Safran of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hi, Rich.
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Hi, Rich.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Bob, once again, best wishes.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thank you.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: I wanted to just ask about – if I might, about build rates at Aeronautics, C-130J, C-5, and
F-16. I think you're delivering 34 C-130J's this year, 37 F-16's, if I got my numbers right. Just wanted to know if you
could comment if you are anticipating similar run rates next year or could this moderate some? Also, I know you're
tracking a bunch of new orders. And, I just wanted to know if any of them, you think, might impact 2013 deliveries.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Rich. This is Bruce. I'll take that one on. Chris made, I thought, an interesting observation
relative to our expectations next year with the F-35 deliveries surpassing both C-130 line and the F-16 line. I think
that's the new era that we're facing as a corporation, an era where obviously the F-35 is going to become the dominant
production line in the corporation. And, it started this quarter, the third quarter, with more deliveries for the F-35 in this
quarter than any of the other two aircraft as well. As we look into 2013 and I look at Aeronautics in general, there is a
lot of mix that's going on within Aeronautics. In my prepared remarks, I said that Aeronautics is going to be relatively
comparable next year from a revenue perspective to where they are this year. But, there is a lot of moving pieces in that
number. So, you're spot-on with the aircraft quantities that you gave for 2012. You should expect somewhere on the
order of 20 to 25 fewer F-16's next year than this year. And that's predominantly because we're building in 2012 some
24 aircrafts for the Government of Turkey and they're actually being built off the Turkish line. So, while we hate to lose
the aircraft, the good news of that discussion is that really the aircraft build rate at Fort Worth won't change from 2012
to 2013. So, there is an element of stability there that might not be apparent given the quantity changes.
We're also looking to lower the C-130 build rate. You're right, the numbers, we should do 33, 34 this year or so. We're
going to ramp back down to about 24 per month – or excuse me, I wish it was a month, 24 aircraft per year build rate
on the C-130 beginning next year. And, we think that that level allows us to have, again, a stable build line for a
number of years going into the future. And, then offsetting those two reductions, which may not be all that apparent – I
don't think you mentioned C-5 – but we're going to deliver 3 or 4 of the C-5 in the RERP aircraft, the Re-Engining and
Reliability Improvement Program for C-5s. And, those 3 or 4 will grow to probably close to 10 or so next year. We're
getting very close to the maximum rate on the C-5 program which I think hits about 11 aircrafts per year to modify
those 49 C-5s into the RERP configuration. So, between the lower F-16s, the fewer C-130s, higher C-5s, and then the
missing piece is higher F-35 volume next year, Aeronautics is going to stay relatively comparable but again, as I just
indicated, a lot of moving pieces in that discussion.

Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good afternoon.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: I think this one is probably for Bruce. In terms of your guidance for 2013, not exactly sure
what above 11% means but – in terms of the margins but if you could help us a little bit with the big pieces that would
impact margins next year, obviously, little bit lower volume. I think USA is going away, level of [indiscernible] (61:37)
adjustments and whatever else you want to throw in there.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes. I'm not sure I'm going to get at this point, David, any more specific than what we
provided in the press release relative to the margins that we did say. I do think we're going to be above 11%. I think, as
I said in my remarks, seventh consecutive year where we have been above 11%. As we look at 2013, maybe what I
ought to do is just go around by the business areas and talk a little bit of that. I spent a lot of time just talking to
Aeronautics. I think – Aeronautics revenue, I should say. If I think of the earnings or the margin of Aeronautics, in
terms of all the mix changes that I just described, I think we'll have slightly lower margins at Aeronautics, primarily
because of the mix changes that I just described. We're losing some F-16's and losing some C-130's at higher margins
and replacing that with C-5's and F-35's at lower margins. I still think we'll be in the 11-ish percent range for
Aeronautics so not a huge drop-off but probably not as high as this year.
If I go over to Electronic Systems, I think Electronic Systems is probably the one business area that I could look at and
say with the numbers I'm seeing now I'm hopeful at least that there will be some potential for some modest growth
there above even what I'm thinking of for 2013. And, relative to the margins, I think the margins will stay at the 13-plus
percent range. I'll qualify that, though, by saying that we're going to give you in January a new configuration with two
new business areas. So, I'll say – I'll hold that thought until January but I'll give you the data in the current
configuration. And, I would say, we're going to stay fairly close to where we are today from a margin perspective in all
of Electronic Systems.
Space Systems is likely going to be down slightly, primarily because we will have slightly lower equity earnings
because of the USA closure for all intents and purposes. That joint venture is coming to a close this year. Despite that, I
think with some of the production satellite programs that are now going through the production phase and are well out
of the developmental phase, we're seeing some higher margins on those contracts. And, I think that we'll probably see
margins a little bit lower but I would guess in the mid-11s for Space Systems going into next year. They've had a
benefit this year from a couple of the closeouts that we talked about, the wind-down of the USA that won't replicate
next year.
And, then the last, IS&GS; I would think it will follow very closely to where we are now, somewhere in the 9-ish
percent margin range. I think I covered all four of them, David, probably in more detail than you cared to hear but I
think that covers it.

<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Bob, again, congratulations and best wishes.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thanks, Rob.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Two, I'll try and make them quick, one for Chris, one for Bruce. Bruce, I'll just start with you.
On your color on 2013, are you assuming full obligation of CR funds to spending authority limits, or do you invent
some kind of cushion for this half-paralyzed environment we've seen at times this year because, unless we assume full
resolution of sequester by early 2013, I would think – and formal adoption of the fiscal 2013 President's request, might
we think of this as a best case scenario at least for revenues?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Rob, I've thought about that quite a bit and I don't think so. I don't think it's the best-case
scenario. Obviously, the worst case would be a sequester. But, is this the best case? I'm not sure of that. We have very
few....
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: [indiscernible] (65:41) negotiated outcome would be something between what I think your
assumptions are and full sequester.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Rob, let me just – so when we paint this, there – now we're talking about some combinatorial
possibilities here. But, it is possible we'll have a CR through March and it – 27th and it's possible that CR will be
extended. There are also appropriations bills that have been marked and a fair amount of effort has been gone into, let
me say, preparing those bills to move. So, it is possible the bill could move even without a resolution to sequester
because part of these interesting combinations that make any detailed planning on our part impossible as to what the
outcomes could be would be a movement of the appropriation bills and some deferral of sequestration while a more
thoughtful process to achieve what's called the larger or the big transaction, the full scope resolution that includes tax
policy, entitlement reform, and defense and non-defense discretionary spending. That could occur too, thereby lifting
the opportunity in 2013 with regard to appropriated levels of funding rather than CR levels of funding. So, there are
interesting combinations here that could either put a little pressure on 2013 or actually relieve some pressure on 2013.
Sorry to interrupt you, Bruce.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: No. Bob gave a much more detailed and thorough answer probably than I was going to do,
Rob. The only thing I was going to say is just to remind you of our portfolio as you go around the four business areas,
really Aeronautics and Space Systems for large intent and purposes don't have much impact to the CR because most of
their sales are coming from fiscal year 2013 budget so very – I'm not sure I'm going to use the world insulated, but very
little impact from there. IS&GS, as I said many times, short cycle business would be the most subject to CR. But,
frankly, we weren't expecting a whole lot of growth year-over-year, fiscal year over fiscal year, in that business to
begin with. And, then Electronic Systems is somewhere in between. I think you had a question for Chris that you didn't
get to ask, Rob. Did we lose you?

Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good afternoon and best wishes, Bob. And, thanks for hanging in there on a long
afternoon.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thanks, Myles.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: A couple follow-ups and clarifications. You didn't mention when you were talking about
bookings, a larger Space contract that I think was a 2012 opportunity. And, I don't think you mentioned it within the
realm of the 2013 opportunities either. Is that still on the table? And, Bruce, it's not implied to get to $80 billion you
need this to happen.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Rob, I'll just say our government satellite....
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Myles.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: I'm sorry [indiscernible] (69:08) Myles. That's two calls in a row I've called you the wrong
name, Myles. There must be a meaning there somewhere. I'll just leave it and say that our government satellite business
is very healthy, strong, and well supported. The $80-billion achievement, if we're able to get that this year, I did
mention that reliance on government satellites because I'm not concerned about that relative to our ability to achieve
that number.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Just to clarify, so you don't need it to achieve the number?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: We do not.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. And, then the other question was really more around the F-35 and the overall lifecycle
opportunity which has always been a key part of that program. It sounds like the customer wants to, not surprisingly,
insert some competition to maintain pricing discipline. Has your view changed on Lockheed Martin's ability to capture
that tail of the program and really make it into the bigger opportunity that it's always been, if you could capture that
aftermarket stream? Thanks.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Well, Myles, we, one, know the program pretty well and know the demands. Nobody wants
to lower the total cost of operation of this airplane more than we do, along with our customers. We see competition in
every aspect of this business every day. And, we certainly not only don't fear the competition, it actually makes us
better. I think our customers realize that. So, if there are competitive opportunities here that also lower the total cost of
operation, we're certainly going to pursue them and pursue them aggressively. I think we have the insight that one
would have from being the design agent and the prime contractor overseeing the supply chain. I think we are as able as
anybody to provide very high quality, very low cost support and service throughout the lifecycle of this airplane. So,
we look forward to these discussions.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Allie, I think we've got time for maybe two last questions here.

Our next question comes from Peter Arment of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Thanks. Congratulations, Bob. Hi, Bruce, Chris. Chris, a question regarding – when you were
talking about the reorganization and taking costs out and – I can appreciate stripping out some of the management. But,
I'm surprised you're not seeing – doing more in IS&GS given that that's where you're seeing the most delay awards or
scope reductions and the customers have been focused on price. Is there opportunity there to continue to take cost out?
Or, is it just not businesses that you want to break out for competitive reasons?

<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Yes, Peter, we think we've been very aggressive in taking out costs. If I think back a
couple of years, I think we had over 145,000 employees. We're currently at 120,000. We don't announce but we're
happy to talk about the layoffs. There have been significant layoffs probably every quarter for the last eight quarters.
We highlighted this because of the reorganization. But, we've streamlined over the years. I recall when IS&GS had
about 11 different companies, if you will, or components. We're now down to three, a civil, a defense and an intel line
of business. We're very competitive. Bob mentioned we look at our win rates on occasion when we lose competitions.
I'm not aware of any competition in IS&GS where we've lost as a result of cost. So, again, we're – we've done a fair
amount. We'll continue to look at it. And, of the $1.1 billion, I'm sure a couple of hundred million of that is coming out
of the IS&GS. I just didn't differentiate it or highlight it for you.

The last question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. And congrats, Bob, on your last call.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thanks, Noah.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Since I'm last, I'm going to try to sneak in two follow-ups to some of the other conversations
you've had. So, the first one is with regard to the potential strategies with which sequestration could be avoided, Bob, I
wonder are there one or two bigger things that are being discussed on The Hill that are floating to the top and what are
the high points of them, if there are? And, then secondarily and separately on the margin topic, you mentioned in your
remarks you have had six or seven years in a row with the segment operating margin above 11%. I basically wonder if
you think you can repeat that. You've talked about the cost reductions and productivity improvements. On the other
hand, you have a generally tougher customer. Presumably these EAC adjustments wind down and become a headwind.
Is that 11% a reasonable longer term-margin? Or, does it need to come down?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah, I'll start with the discussion about strategies for sequestration. Of course, on The Hill
now there is no discussion because we're in the recess prior to the election. To perhaps oversimplify this, but maybe a
little oversimplification is good because it is really a complex set of scenarios right now, three things – one of three
things will likely happen. We'll get a resolution or the grand bargain outcome which tends to have value ranges of $4
trillion to $5 trillion which is a significant amount of work that would go in, looking at tax, looking at entitlement,
looking at spending. The onset of sequestration could be delayed beyond January the 2nd, maybe to be co-terminal with
the CR in March or maybe beyond that. Or, sequestration will take effect. My sense is the latter two are a little bit more
likely than the first one. It would seem to be hard to get a grand bargain in a lame duck session of the Congress. So, my
guess is we'll either see a delay of the onset, or sequestration will take place. When you think about sequestration
taking place, we've already received from the Department of Defense additional planning guidance that we received on
September 28th that said they don't anticipate taking any contract actions on January the 2nd. And, they thought it was
unlikely that they would take contract actions for several months beyond that, which puts us through our first fiscal
quarter and puts the government into its second fiscal half before any impacts might be realized, at least on the defense
side. Civil government agencies are going to be different. And, they don't have the large acquisition accounts and a lot
of their expenses are associated with people. So, it's just not clear. I know everyone of us wants to be in a position of
doing better at predicting what will happen with respect to sequestration. But, I can tell you, I don't know. And, I don't
know anybody who does know. There's a lot of speculation but there's not greater clarity. So, inside our company,
we're preparing for the prospect of sequestration. As I said, we will issue WARN notices if that's required, if
sequestration has reductions in force. We're working every day to try to avoid that. In the interim, we're asking our
employees to stay very focused on the tasks at hand. And, I think you see in the third quarter and in the year-to-date
performance an exceptional quality by the talent in this company and their professionalism at staying focused on the
goal, on the mission, on execution. And, they are not being distracted by this. And, for that, we are all so enormously
proud of them for remaining focused like that. So, the best we can do is try to keep you posted on how sequestration
unfolds. Obviously, the next event would be what happens in the lame duck session of Congress.

Relative to margins, I do think that it is possible to sustain these margins over the long run. And, we haven't given up
on attempting to improve these margins. It has a lot to do with your portfolio, it has a lot to do with your business mix,
and it has a lot to do with how well you're able to execute. And, we make investments every day on building this
portfolio to have real legs and real durability in a complex global security environment. We do focus every day on
execution. And, we're taking this business more broadly internationally and expect to have pretty robust opportunities
to perform.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Noah, I'll just add, I think we are structurally different today and going forward than
we were maybe a few years back. That has helped our situation as well. Bob mentioned the international content
growing. I think that's one thing that contributes to the ability to maintain at the 11%. We've talked a lot about our
equity earnings. Those are companies that we did not have the – I'll say the margin boost from recognizing those equity
earnings in years past. And that had, in the case of United Launch Alliance, a double benefit because you lost the sales
associated with that activity. So, the margin from it was pretty substantial. And, then the last thing I'll point to a
structural change is, if you just think of all the combinations that led to the current Lockheed Martin, a number of those
brought with them intangible amortizations associated with those acquisitions. And, those were a drag on margins in
the early years of this corporation as well that no longer exist as we sit here today. Bob?
Robert J. Stevens
Yeah, thanks. First, let me thank everybody for being on the call. If we had a long day, you had a longer day. So, we
appreciate you being here with us. I certainly appreciate your kind words and all the good wishes you offered me. I was
thinking that, since I became our company's Chief Financial Officer in 1999, we've had about 52 quarters together to
have these exchanges. And, I have really enjoyed the interaction that we've all shared over the years. I want to wish
each of you well in your professional pursuits and certainly in your personal lives.
At this end, I'm certain our company is in great hands with Chris and Marillyn and Bruce and Jerry and the other
members of the executive team. I'm really grateful for having the privilege of working on this management team and
having had the opportunity to work with my fellow employees here, who are simply exceptional people who do
extraordinary work in the nation's interest. I will miss them and I will miss you. But, I will be listening to these calls.
So, I'm sure that Chris and Bruce look forward to talking with all of us in January. We'll sign off from this end. Thank
you.
