Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Many of you have heard me speak before about the full portfolio and its
significance to Southern Company and to our industry as a whole. Simply put, we are inventing the future of clean,
safe, reliable and affordable energy for the benefit of the customers and communities we serve. Our full portfolio
strategy, which includes new nuclear and innovative new technologies for 21st century coal as well as natural gas,
renewables, and energy efficiency, is a fundamental component of that mission. I'd like to take a few moments to
highlight how this all of the above approach continues to be beneficial to customers, and to discuss several projects
helping to shape the full portfolio for the future.
To begin with, our diverse generation fleet enables us to quickly adapt to constantly changing market conditions with
the ability to utilize the most cost-efficient generation resources at any particular point in time. When natural gas prices
are low, for example, we are able to take advantage by burning more natural gas and less coal. Such was the case in the
first quarter of this year. Gas energy climbed to 48% of our energy production. Our use of coal for the quarter was the
lowest in several decades, falling to 32% of our energy mix. And as a hallmark of our integrated business model, we
passed those savings along to our customers.
Natural gas, of course, will continue to be a dominant solution. Recently, our gas consumption was about 1.5 BCF per
day. This year, it could approach 1.9 BCF per day. And by 2020, the amount could be as much as 2.3 BCF per day. But
natural gas is not a panacea as we cannot assume that current prices will endure indefinitely. We must, therefore,
continue to pursue the development of a truly diverse generation portfolio, one that provides the necessary optionality
and flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.
In addition to natural gas, 21st century coal and new nuclear, we are rapidly building out our energy portfolio with
renewables, including solar and wind. With that in mind, I would like to take a more detailed look at how we've
expanded our renewable resources in recent months.
Four Southern Company subsidiaries recently marked major milestones in the strategic expansion of one of the nation's
largest renewable energy portfolios through the announced development or acquisition of large scale solar projects.
Gulf Power and Mississippi Power recently announced power purchase agreements with solar facilities totaling 173
megawatts that are currently being developed on military bases in their respective states. Georgia Power broke ground
at Fort Benning the first of four 30-megawatt retail rate-based solar projects in development with the U.S. Department
of Defense. And there's more likely to come.
In February, our Southern Power subsidiary announced the acquisition of two solar projects, totaling 99-megawatts in
Georgia, the 80-megawatt Decatur Parkway Solar Project, and the 19-megawatt Decatur County Solar Project. And,
most recently, Southern Power announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in the 32-megawatt Lost
Hills-Blackwell Solar Facility in California, from First Solar.
Also in March, Southern Power announced an agreement to acquire the 299-megawatt Kay Wind facility, currently
under construction in Oklahoma. This acquisition is expected to close in late 2015, upon successful completion of the
project. Kay Wind will be the largest renewable electric generation plant in the Southern Company system and the first
wind facility we will own. Upon completion of these projects, the Southern Company system expects to own or
purchase the output of more than 3,100-megawatts of renewable resources system-wide, including 44 solar facilities in
seven states.
Let's now discuss our two large construction projects, which are equally important to our full portfolio of generation
resources. Our new nuclear project, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and our 21st century coal facility in Kemper County,
Mississippi, featuring coal gasification technology developed by our researchers in partnership with KBR and the
Department of Energy. Both of these projects stem from state-specific resource planning processes that value
generation diversity, including the hedge that these new resources represent against potential carbon dioxide
regulations in the future.

First, an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The primary focus of the project continues to be on quality and safety.
Georgia Power has maintained an exceptional safety record for a construction project of this size, which currently has
over 5,000 people on site. During the first quarter, our outstanding safety culture manifested itself, as we performed
over 1 million safe work hours without a recordable injury. The quality oversight from our nuclear team continues to be
invaluable. This is a complex project with numerous challenges. We are proud of how well our processes and controls
are holding up to the inspection of both the NRC inspectors and Georgia Power's regulator. More importantly, our own
rigorous oversight is being manifested in the quality of the facility. The new Vogtle Units are being built to serve
Georgia customers for 60-plus years and the oversight in place today should help ensure that these units will function at
a high level for decades to come.
Construction activities are tracking closely with the revised schedule provided by the contractors in January. The
greatest risk to the schedule for both units continues to be in the timely delivery of structural submodules.
I'm pleased to report that the quality at the Lake Charles facility has improved, and we no longer expect submodules
from that facility to require remediation on site before being released for assembly. We anticipate continued delivery of
panels throughout the year from Lake Charles and we've been informed that the scope of work may be expanding there.
Critical path remains closely aligned with delivery and installation of panels for the shield building. These panels are
fabricated by Newport News Industrial and quality has been good. Acceleration of work at NNI, along with improving
the panel installation process represents one of our best opportunities to improve on the schedule provided by the
contractors. Critical path runs somewhat parallel with activities inside the containment vessel.
The CA01 module is one of the major next steps inside this area of a nuclear island. The final concrete pour is
necessary to install CA01 were completed late last week. CA01 is now projected to be lifted into place early in the third
quarter of this year. A number of you have visited the site in person, and the progress is obvious. While the entire
project is proceeding well, the Unit 3 annex building is an area of noteworthy progress. The annex building is necessary
for the initial energization of the control systems for Unit 3, an important early step in the start-up process. The
concrete foundations and structural steel for this facility are well underway. And in late February, the first of 34 wall
submodules for the Unit 4 CA20 module was upended, marking the start of the assembly process.
On the regulatory front, $198 million in expenditures submitted in the 11th Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report
were unanimously approved on February 19 with a cumulative amount approved to-date of $2.8 billion. Additionally,
the procedural and scheduling order for the 12th Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report was approved on April 7.
Consistent with a longstanding Georgia law, the order re-affirmed that neither the project's certified costs nor the VCM
8 stipulation in 2013 constitute a cost recovery cap. Georgia Power will be allowed recovery of all reasonable and
prudent start-up costs, up to and above the certified amount. And we believe the semi-annual VCM process, including
the testimony of the independent monitor, continues to build a record that has thoroughly documents Georgia Power's
prudent management of the project.
The order also establishes a schedule for filings and hearings on our request of the Commission to verify and approve
$169 million in expenditures for the second half of 2014. Georgia Power expects to file direct testimony on Friday.
Hearings are scheduled to begin on June 2, and we anticipate a decision in mid-August. A full schedule is included in
our slide deck.
Now, let's turn to an update on the Kemper County IGCC project. The Kemper project also boasts a terrific safety
record, with now over 2,500 workers on-site, no safety incidents occurred during the first quarter. In early March, we
completed the first firing with natural gas of the facility's gasifier burners, a significant milestone. We continue to make
tremendous progress on our other start-up activities as we look ahead to the first synthesis gas production planned now
for the third quarter. In the meantime, the combined cycle at Kemper continues to perform exceptionally well, with a
first quarter equivalent forced outage rate of less than 1% and a capacity factor in line with the rest of our combined
cycle fleet.
Turning to the legal and regulatory fronts, the Mississippi Supreme Court's order, which deemed that the 2013 Kemper
settlement unenforceable and reversed the subsequent rate order, has been met with vocal opposition from state-wide
industry groups, business organizations, the state economic council, and members of the Public Utility Staff and

Commission as well as other public entities through amicus briefs filed with the Mississippi Supreme Court. Most of
the briefs emphasize that the rate plan agreed to in 2013 was of great benefit to the customers of Mississippi Power, and
that a traditional rate case could mean rate impact approaching 40% for some customers. This compares to the 25% rate
increase contemplated in the original settlement, 18% of which is already in place.
While we await the court's decision on rehearing, we will continue to work toward a reasonable, comprehensive
settlement with the Public Utility Staff. However, as a possible alternative to a settlement, we are also preparing to file
a rate case by mid-May. With the completion of the project in sight, we want to ensure that the rate recovery is
adequately addressed in a timely manner.
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of
2015, reporting earnings of $508 million or $0.56 per share, compared with earnings of $351 million or $0.39 per share
in the first quarter of last year.
First quarter results for 2015 include a $6 million after-tax charge related to an increased construction estimate for
Mississippi Power's Kemper Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle project. The first quarter results for 2014
included a $235 million after-tax charge for the Kemper County – for the Kemper IGCC project or $0.27 per share.
Excluding these items, Southern Company earned $514 million or $0.56 per share during the first quarter of 2015,
compared to $586 million or $0.66 per share in the first quarter of 2014.
Earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were in line with our expectations and were positively influenced by retail
revenue effects at Southern Company's traditional operating companies, offset by milder winter weather than in 2014
and increased operating and maintenance expenses.
Moving now to an economic and sales review for the first quarter. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2015 was
modest, but our retail sales across all customer classes are encouraging. Total weather adjusted retail sales grew 1% in
the first quarter, led by industrial sales, which were up 2%. We have now enjoyed eight consecutive quarters of positive
year-over-year industrial sales growth in our region. Industrial sales growth remains broad-based across eight of our
largest 10 industrial segments. The strongest industrial segments include petroleum, up 10%; stone, clay and glass, up
6% due to improvements in the housing market; transportation improved 5%, as automotive manufacturers expanded
output. Weather-adjusted residential sales were slightly positive for the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to strong
customer growth of nearly 16,000, a 55% increase over the approximate 10,000 new customers gained in the first
quarter of 2014.
Weather-adjusted commercial sales were up 0.7% for the quarter. Office vacancy rates continue to show signs of
improvement and more office retail projects are being announced. Currently, more than 1.9 million square feet of office
space is under construction in metro Atlanta. In addition, a number of new Atlanta projects are expected to begin
construction soon, including the Mercedes-Benz headquarters.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, non-farm employment increased in all the states of our retail service
territory between February of 2014 and February of 2015. Nationally, Georgia ranked number five among all states for
job growth, and Atlanta was ranked among the top five metro areas. Meanwhile, our economic development pipeline
remains robust with more than 300 potential projects representing 37,000 potential new jobs and over $34 billion in
potential capital investment.
The climate for business and investment remains strong in our service region. Alabama and Georgia were recently
ranked number one and number four, respectively, among states in which to do business by Site Selection magazine.
Turning briefly back to Southern Power. As Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, Southern Power continues to find
new projects that meet its investment criteria. In our fourth quarter call, in early February, we outlined two categories

for Southern Power's CapEx projections, base CapEx and placeholder CapEx for growth. Base CapEx includes projects
we have identified as likely, even though we may not have reached final terms or received all regulatory approvals. In
February, our base CapEx included, among others, the Kay Wind and Decatur projects Tom mentioned earlier. Since
then, Southern Power has identified a number of additional projects for 2015 and 2016. As a result, we are shifting
dollars out of the placeholder category and into base CapEx for Southern Power. The result is that we have accounted
for all of our original 2015 placeholders and have moved $100 million from the placeholder to base in 2016. With our
2015 success thus far and the long runway between now and the end of 2016, we are confident about our ability to find
solid projects to account for our remaining 2016 placeholders.
Before turning the call back to Tom, let me cover two final items. First, our earnings estimate for the second quarter,
which is $0.69 per share. Secondly, I'd like to highlight our dividend announcement last week. Our board of directors
approved a $0.07 increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.17 per share. This is our 14th
consecutive annual increase and marks 270 consecutive quarters dating back to 1948 that Southern Company will have
paid a dividend equal to or greater than the previous quarter to its shareholders. Over the past two decades, our
dividend has accounted for nearly 70% of our total shareholder return. It is the cornerstone of our value proposition and
the board's decision last week reinforces its confidence in the strength of our long-term financial plan.
I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thanks, Art. After a successful year in 2014, Southern Company has entered the new year with strong momentum. We
see a franchise business that is operating better than ever, solidifying its position as an industry leader in all phases of
the business. We see important progress on major capital projects and we continue to excel with our customer focused
business model. We also see a strengthening economy in a region poised to grow in the months and years ahead.
In short, we believe Southern Company is well-positioned to succeed in 2015 and in the years ahead behind the
strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy to the
customers and communities we serve. Southern Company is keenly focused on remaining an industry leader for the
long term, and forward-thinking decisions with regard to our generating portfolio are a key aspect of that effort. But the
evolution of our business does not stop there. We recently announced the launch of a new Energy Innovation Center to
be located in Atlanta's Technology Square. While we remain steadfast in our commitment to excel at the fundamentals
of making, moving, and selling, and consuming electricity, we also understand that the way in which customers use
energy may change over time. The Energy Innovation Center is just one way in which we are working to anticipate the
future and lead the way with the development of new energy innovations.
Going forward, we will continue to build on our long history of inventing the future by relying on the thinking of our
entire workforce and with potential partners such as [indiscernible] (24:24) and other major established and new
entrants to the energy industry. Initial possibilities involve expanding the notion of energy infrastructure to assets
beyond the meter, unmanned aerial vehicles, hydrogen production from underutilized generating facilities, and
desalinization plants. As Art indicated earlier, the strength of our underlying franchise, as well as our continued focus
on remaining an industry leader through innovation underpinned the board's decision last week to increase our
dividend, which supports our objective of providing superior, risk adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the
long-term.
We are now ready to take your questions. Operator, we'll now take the first question.

Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. And our first question comes from the
line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Greg. Greg?
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Oh, I'm here. Can you hear me?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, we can now.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Sorry. I was on mute. It's been a long day already. You're like our fifth call. But – so what is the
legal path in Mississippi today that either gets you back to a settled rate deal or puts you in a formal rate case filing?
Like, what are the different paths that get us back into a settled low rate hike or put us into a rate filing in May?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. That's right. Just as we described, there's two paths. One is we've been having, as
you all know, prolonged series of discussions with the Staff. We continue to think they're constructive. I think the result
of a settlement could, in essence, preserve and form the rate structure that we put in place in 2013. Failing to reach a
settlement, we will file a rate increase in a conventional rate case. It is conceivable you could file the rate case and file
the settlement at the same time. But those are the two paths.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. But the Supreme Court's decision has essentially closed off the creative approach you
used to pre-funding the capital project? Or is that not the case?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, No, that's not the case.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The settlement would essentially preserve the structure, which would mimic what was
approved in 2013.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: That would be great. Second question is on your continued expansion of the renewables
platform. When we look at – so essentially the announcement of this new – of this wind project acquisition fills in some
of the sort of the notional space in your Southern Power CapEx budget?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: It's not incremental to the budget that you've already articulated to us?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's part of the – yeah, it was in the base already.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: It was in the base.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Got you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And what we've done is – I think the change here is on the graph we showed – is that we
essentially have spoken for all the placeholders in 2015, so we're very confident of hitting our numbers for Southern
Power in 2015.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. And how much of your total CapEx in 2016 at Southern Power is currently sort of money
projects that are definitely going forward versus placeholders? Oh, that's here on, sorry, page 12. Sorry.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: About $400 million – yeah, there you go, about $400 million.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: All right. And then can you articulate – sorry, go ahead.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, we feel really good about hitting our placeholders in 2016 also, but we're not at the
stage we're ready to declare those as part of base. We've improved it by $100 million.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Got you. And then is there a way you can articulate what you think the earnings contribution is
going to be from the Kay Wind facility when it comes in?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, the Kay Wind facility, the benefits are not investment tax credits. They are production
tax credits. So I don't recall the 2016 benefit, but it should not benefit 2015 at all. It will be a 2016 addition.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And it'll be a little over $0.01 a year or something like that for whatever, 10 years.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. That's great. And when is the next milestone, if we have a firm milestone? This is my last
question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: A filibuster.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Your conversations with your EP&C contractor at Vogtle with regard to the delay they
announced in the in-service date.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, so we continue to have constructive discussions there. And one of the things I think
we tried to highlight in the initial remarks is that we can see our way through to some ways to improve the schedule
that the contractors have delivered to us. We've been pretty clear about that in our disclosures. So we continue to work
with them, and we're trying to find ways to reach an amicable kind of resolution to that.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: And is there a sort of definitive milestone to look for there in terms a drop-dead date or...?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Not really. The ultimate conclusion would be litigation in the city of Augusta, Georgia.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: All right. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of James von Riesemann from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - James D. von Riesemann>: Tom, how are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Super. Hope you're well.
<Q - James D. von Riesemann>: Thank you. I am. Hey, I have two questions for you. So, the first question is can you
guys provide a little bit more color on the continuing disconnect between the 3% GDP growth in the service territory
and yet 0.2% residential growth?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah. Jim, our expectation was, for the year, about 3% GDP growth. That was underlying
our forecast of low growth this year of the 1.3%. We've had a very strong economy here in the Southeast. I think our
numbers and results reflect that. As we outlined in the script, that's driven by the industrial sales growth. But, we're
beginning to see movement on the residential and the commercial end, as well. This is the first quarter in about four
years where we've had positive growth in all three customer classes.
So, we think it's broad-based, and if we look at employment growth both in the manufacturing sector and in other
sectors, it's beating the national numbers. So, the economy in the Southeast has been a bit stronger, in our view, than
what we're seeing on the 0.2%.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, if I could – at the risk of falling into Fed speak, too, there's fascinating
developments, and some of the things we're seeing are better than, but in some ways mimic what we're seeing
nationally. Better than, clearly, is in the industrial growth sector. Even surprising to us how strong it is. And even,
probably, better than what we're showing. We think that chemicals, for example, was slightly negative, but those were
outages. So we expect to see chemicals rebound. And, recall, a continuing theme has been segments, which are
dependent upon natural gas. Well, those are going to be really strong, we think, for the rest of the year.

The only kind of cloud on the horizon there is primary metals and we think that's kind of strong dollar, strong imports,
low oil prices, and therefore, metal associated with pipelines are probably slowing down a bit.
But, one of the things that I think is really interesting that Art alluded to on the residential sector, we're starting to see a
pickup in household well formation. It's pretty modest, but still a pickup. Interestingly, the Fed guys are concerned by
that, in that it looks like they're not consuming this pickup in either the top line revenue or a reduction in costs, like
lower gasoline prices. They're saving it.
We are within kind of a historical range of savings rates, so it's not particularly troubling to me. And, frankly, if
households are reducing debt or investing or even just putting money in a checking account for now, at least they are
less exposed, they're more resilient to future economic dislocations. So, it's not all bad. Value is a function of risk and
return and GDP growth is return, increased savings rates is an improvement in risk. So it's not all bad. And when you
consider that the United States GDP was 0.2% growth in the first quarter, you look at our numbers, clearly better. We
feel pretty good about our prospects going forward.
<Q - James D. von Riesemann>: So the answer – thank you – the answer to the question on the growth and the
improvement leads me into my next question. So, if I look at your trailing 12 months on a weather-normalized basis,
you're at [ph] $2.76 (34:12). But, if I remember correctly, at the end of the – in conjunction with the fourth quarter call,
you had [ph] $2.76 to $2.88 (34:18) was your expectations for the year. How do you get to the upper end of that band
or even the middle end of the band, given that your trailing 12's at the very bottom?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Improvement at Southern Power is an easy way.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Weather. Good weather. Better than expected economic outcomes.
<Q - James D. von Riesemann>: Okay. Okay. I'm just – there's nothing else that I'm missing, am I?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I don't think so.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No. And if you remember, too, one of the things – I think we said this before, Art, was the
lower end of our range was bound by Southern Power...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ...not filling in its complement of CapEx. We've kind of lived with the base scenario.
Well, we think we're there for 2015 and potentially, could even improve.
<Q - James D. von Riesemann>: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

And our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett from Morningstar Equity Research. Please proceed with
your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Mark. How are you?
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Good afternoon, guys. Doing well, thanks. A couple of questions here. One is sort of bigger
picture. You gave a little bit of detail around what you see in the commercial sector. And, obviously, it's – from a usage
perspective, it lags a little bit, but we have a nice pickup here in the quarter. I'm wondering is this about the level of
improvement that you've baked in for expectations in your guidance here?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Actually, we're looking for a little more improvement.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The expectation for the year in terms of segments is -
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Like 1.4% on commercial, about 1% on residential and 1.7% on industrial. So, we're a bit
ahead of our industrial numbers. We still got a little ways to go on commercial.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, 1.3% for the year total.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Right. Sorry. That number had slipped to 1.4% on commercial. That's the level that's in your
guidance. Okay.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: And then year-over-year, obviously, base business growth driving a lot of that OpEx, I'm sure.
Is this level of kind of the year-over-year increase sort of a guide for the remainder of the year, or do you have a lot of
flexibility there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I'm sorry.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Flexibility on CapEx is going to go to...
<Q - Mark Barnett>: I'm sorry, OpEx.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, if it's – yeah...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Operating expenses. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The first quarter was a bit of an anomaly. You may
remember, Mark, that first quarter of last year, we deferred a lot of expenses at Alabama Power. They were non-nuclear
outage costs under an accounting order that they were operating under last year.
And then, also, if you look at year-over-year, there were more megawatts out this year across the system than there
were last year. So, there were more outage costs this year. And then you just got normal growth for the rest. That's a big
piece of it, as well. So, if we look at what we expect for the year, I'd still think my guidance from the last call of about a
3% to 3.5% growth in non-fuel O&M for the year still applies, and the first quarter is just kind of an outlier that will
correct itself through the year.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And when we came up with the $0.55 estimate for the first quarter, it almost exactly
expected this level of O&M.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Got it. Okay, thanks for the reminder. It has been a long day, as somebody mentioned earlier.

Last question. Can you just remind me if Governor Dean has signed the new solar bill, the [ph] HB-37 (38:41)? And,
generally, what you expect to see as a result, in terms of maybe your own programs or offerings in the state?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: He has not signed it, to our knowledge. But, I can tell you all this is very consistent with
our plan. I have always tried to position the company as given whatever business circumstances exist, for us to find
ways to play offense. And to the extent distributed generation becomes important to the customers of this state, it is the
clear mission of our businesses to provide that service and those assets to our customers. So, we fully support any
development, with respect to distributed generation, whether that's rooftop solar or some idea associated with storage or
community solar or financing or anything else. Now, whether we do that ourselves or do it through third-parties, our
job is to find ways to succeed in this changing business environment. And I think we're demonstrating that in a superb

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Anthony, how are you?
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Not bad. I just wanted to follow up on Mr. Gordon Goes to Washington's question on
Mississippi. Just it seems like there's a disconnect there, when you look at the two roadmaps you have of a
conventional rate case for the 30% to 40% rate increase or – I'm not sure if you used this term, but maybe a glide-path
or some type of nice trajectory of rate increases. It would seem like a no-brainer if you were a regulator or you were
one of the intervener parties. Could you maybe highlight what that disconnect is and maybe handicap what you think
the chances are of a potential settlement in Mississippi?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Anthony, the only thing I can tell you. I don't want to characterize the decision that's kind
of in front of these folks, but if you look at the broad-based support that the company has enjoyed to ask the Supreme
Court to reconsider their decision in the amicus briefs, including the Staff, to me it is an obvious decision that benefits
the citizens of Mississippi to pursue the settlement or at least restore what the Supreme Court invalidated in its recent
order. Either one of those is, I think, in a broad sense the obvious way to go in the state.

were consuming coal. 70% of our energy came from coal and then 16% from natural gas. When you look at recent
history, 1.5 BCF per day, now this year may be as high as 1.9 BCF per day and depending on what happens with
111(d) and a variety of other things, that per day gas consumption can average somewhere around 2.3 BCF per day. So
when you think about the attractiveness of Southern Company being one of the nation's largest consumers of natural
gas, our value as a kind of a key tenant to any of the infrastructure that needs to be [ph] billed (43:08) out to meet that
kind of demand really gives us some opportunities to pursue a variety of investments. And we're all over that stuff. So
we'll see what happens.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: How about gas reserves and rate base? Something you're considering [ph] at this point?
(43:25)
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: This goes way back to even when I was, gee-whiz; I think I was CFO and COO. So we're
talking now 10 years ago we've been kind of kicking that around. And back then we weren't consuming that much
natural gas and it wasn't as important. But certainly it's an idea that has merit, and as natural gas becomes more
important to us, especially given its volatility, relative to other fuel stocks, we'll certainly keep that on the front burner
of ideas.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: And also -
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: In any case, we would not want to take price risk on molecules in the ground. This would
all be a fuel clause related issue.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Right. One other question about nuclear. We've heard recently from Commissioner Echols
that he sees the need for another two units beyond the current and that it depends on how well the project goes and
whether 111(d) goes. So I'm just wondering if you have actually been in conversations about that. Is that something
that's actually being planned out at this point? Or is it just being – is it just talk for now? And also, is this something
that you can hold over the consortium's head sort of, so to speak. It guarantees some kind of good performance going
forward also in the litigation?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So many of you on the call may remember in 2014, I want to say it was the summer in a
Q&A session at the Bipartisan Policy Center I think, after a remark I made that I did allude to the fact that we would
be, I forget, delighted to consider new nuclear. The steps that would be taken first would be to essentially begin the
permitting process to undertake a new plant, not necessarily to commit to build a new plant. So, in essence, it's fairly
modest dollars in order to secure the option. And we moved along and then we were hit in December with the change
in schedule put forth by our contractor group. We were very clear that we don't believe that the contractors are doing
everything they can do in order to fully mitigate their schedule, per the requirements of the contract. And so, what I
said at that time was that I thought it was sensible for us to set aside a lot of talk about new projects until we came to
more resolution as to the commercial dispute. It is clear to me that if the contractors want to succeed in the United
States with AP1000, then they need to perform well on Vogtle 3 and 4. It is, in fact, the benchmark plants for all
AP1000s going forward. So, you can draw your own conclusions as to their motives.

if you look at kind of how they got to their delays in schedule, are there things you're going to be able to do to mitigate
that from happening kind of going forward, so we don't run into this 12 months or 18 months from now, them saying
"Well, we have the same sort of delay problems"?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, we tried to kind of suggest that in the prepared remarks, at the
outset. I think there's a clear opportunity to advance some schedule mitigation with Newport News. That's our opinion.
And it's not only production out of their facilities, but also the installation of the panels. We need to make sure that all
of that is done well.
Also, you must know that, especially those of you that have visited the site, and we encourage everybody on the phone,
if you can figure out a way to get to the site, we love showing it off. I think the people that were there were, I think,
really struck with the kind of progress and quality of the work there. We have an enormous quality assurance program
and, as licensee of the plant, we ultimately are responsible for having the right kind of plant built there. Our QA
program has been focused not only on site, but also at places like Lake Charles. And, I think, our working with the
contractor has helped put them in the position where now we essentially have been able to accept production out of that
facility and go ahead and put it in a production process.
As we move to more work inside the nuclear island, that kind of process improvement, quality assurance, and
ultimately production on site is going to move the needle in the right direction. So we remain relentlessly focused on
ways to work with them to do that. And, I would argue, in the past quarter or so, I think we've made progress in our
thinking.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: I know Mike just asked the question, but just on the gas reserves and rate base issue, the
legislation in Mississippi seemed to open that as a little bit more of a window than previously discussed. Is that
something you guys are going to look to pursue? Or how do you read that legislative action?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, it's a law largely focused on EMC's recovery of economic development projects. It
does authorize the PSE to deem that natural gas reserves are used and useful as utility plan or whatever. So, a similar
concept – so it is something we would consider, as there is natural gas, kind of, generation in Mississippi. I think, once
you're post-Kemper, Plant Ratcliffe, it's a third, a third, a third, coal, gas, and Kemper.
A similar concept that we have at Kemper is, in fact, the lignite mine. It's a similar idea where, essentially, we own the
lignite and it's in rate base, and it serves to hedge, kind of, any future price swings. Remember, that has almost no
volatility going forward. So, it's certainly a valid idea, something we consider, and it makes sense.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And, I guess just on the renewable side of the business, you guys are able to put
renewables and rate base in Georgia. You've been doing PPAs in the other states. Is there going to be an opportunity
when you guys can start putting or feel more comfortable putting some of those assets into your rate base rather than
contracting out where the cost of capital is higher?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, sure. And I think to the extent those assets ever gets flipped, sold, what have you, I
think we're a natural buyer. One of the things that we always kind of think about is for any of our assets and although
we tend to acquire some, you know we sold some or swapped some. Who is the best owner? And we always seek to
achieve that position. So I think there will be opportunities for us, should those assets ever come to the market, for us to
be a strong player in acquiring them. That may be at Southern Power or it could be at the OpCo.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: But you don't necessarily see the utilities doing more to develop renewables in territory in a rate
base asset?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Oh, no, absolutely we could. And in fact, I tried to suggest that in that little funny sentence
where I said "and there's probably more to come," if you remember that sentence. We've done a lot of business in
Georgia. We've done 4 times 30 with DoD facilities. And I said, "and there's more to come." So I'm very bullish on
that. We've had a terrific relationship with the DoD. You know that the DoD has a renewables mandate goal, what have
you. And I think we were probably the first ones in the United States to work with them constructively to fulfill that
mandate.

And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Ali, how are you?
<Q - Ali Agha>: Hey, Tom, good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And first question, Tom. Just wanted to clarify your scenarios on getting closure on the Mississippi
issue. I recall one of the options previously was for the Supreme Court to overturn their ruling, which I guess was 5-4.
Is that still an option, or are you really thinking is global settlement could address all the issues they raised in the
original ruling and take care of it from that perspective?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Ali, it's both of those. The Commission – I mean the Supreme Court could certainly
reconsider their decision, that obviously. And think about the broad support in the state. Just about everybody in the
state that we had huge participation in the amicus brief. But failing that, we could reach a global settlement which
would in effect mimic many of the characteristics of the original rate order that was entered into in 2013. We could get
that as well. We think any of those are better than filing for a 40% increase in a rate case, but we'll see how it goes.
Those are the paths we will follow.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And also to be clear, I think you mentioned thinking about filing that rate case by mid-May, just a
couple of weeks from here. So in your mind the other two parts, whether a global settlement or a Supreme Court
reversal realistically could happen within the next couple of weeks?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure, and then I suggested on the call earlier today that another alternative is for us to file
the settlement proposal at the same time contemporaneous with the conventional rate case.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Right, yep. That's right. And then, secondly, this show cause notice that they put out there to you guys
on market [ph] bond (54:16) issues, how big of a deal is that, and how do you see that playing out?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We don't think it's a big deal right now. Look, I don't think there's any evidence. In my
opinion there's very little evidence, no evidence, that Southern Power has any market power in the Southeast. I think
this was a reaction by the FERC staff that basically pointed out that there was not much activity in our auction
mechanism that we had put in place really up until 2014.
In 2015, we introduced kind of a tweak on that auction process, which increased the activity of the auction many-fold.
But you got to understand, through this period we've been a net purchaser, not seller. So, heaven's sakes, I don't know
how we exercise market power as a net purchaser of energy. Number two, the Southeast has been traditionally a
bilateral market, and people are very happy. There's been no contention at FERC that suggest that there's something
wrong with the auction process we have in place. This, in fact, was a rule by the FERC that basically is raising a
question where I'm not sure there's any problem at all. So we have a chance to respond, and we'll provide our evidence
and have a good, constructive dialogue with FERC. And we'll see how it goes. In the near-term, you should think about
that in the next three years to five years, at least in the thinking we've done so far, there's almost no potential adverse
financial impacts from this.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I see. Okay. And then, in your financial planning, you still have assumed no equity issuance through
2017. I was just curious, how much cushion do you have right now, so that that scenario – different scenarios keep you
in that no-equity issuance mode, or are you fairly close if you get more Southern Power activity, et cetera, that equity
comes back into the equation?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Ali. Just recall, last year we issued $800 million versus the $600 million we planned.
So, we were a bit ahead of where we thought we'd be. We don't really have any scenarios in which – in the foreseeable
future, even with the Southern Power investments that we have outlined in our CapEx program, where we would need
more equity. It would have to be in excess of the amounts that we forecasted, and you can see we filled up our bucket
in 2015 on placeholder projects. We still have a ways to go in 2016. So, I think we're good, to give you a feel for it. I
don't have a number to give you about where we are in the limit, but I think we're in pretty good shape.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And, I think we suggested in the past that, kind of, as we start to wind-down our CapEx, and
if you look at our CapEx slide, kind of, what was it, $6.8 billion to $5.5 billion or so to $4.3 billion or something like
that, we're probably over-equitized to some degree. So, there's not pressure to sell more equity.

And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, Tom. Congrats on a good start to the year and especially on the renewable side. One
quick Mississippi question and then one natural gas question for you.
In Mississippi, the court decision referenced pretty clearly the need for a prudency review before the Commission can
grant any kind of rate increases. And given that this stems from a rate payer or a customer's acting as litigant here, do
you need to have a prudency hearing of some kind as part of any settlement docket?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We've already filed a prudency record last year. So, we think all the evidence is there
necessary for the Commission to act right now.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. So, the Commission could issue a prudency determination, based on what's in the
record right now and that should satisfy effectively what the Supreme Court said had not been satisfied when the
Supreme Court made its ruling?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That is our belief.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. On the natural gas side, when you look at the infrastructure of the natural gas system
throughout your service territory and, maybe, even in slight neighboring areas, where do you all see as the biggest
bottlenecks? Meaning, where is there a lack of midstream infrastructure that is needed to be able, over the next, I want
to say, five years to 10 years, because it's kind of hard to look much more beyond that, to help alleviate some natural
gas or other midstream related bottlenecks in your area?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, it's a fascinating question. I wish I had my map and my pointer and – it really
depends on what you believe out of 111(d) and what we do with other kind of displaced coal assets, should they arise.
Recall, under [ph] half MACT (59:27) or MATS, we went from, kind of, 20,000-megawatts down to
13,000-megawatts, with four of the 1,000-megawatts coal units being retired – being converted to gas,
3,000-megawatts retired completely. By EPA's own math, and I'm not going to stand by their math, because I, frankly,
don't believe it's achievable in the timeframes they do, but they would have us retire enough coal down to about
4,000-megawatts.
So, what do you do? Do you convert that to gas? Do you build greenfield gas? Where do you build it? If you want to
think about the way the pipes work in the Southeast, there's kind of two big themes. The normal conventional,

historical theme would have come from the west. And you got a lot of pipelines that kind of run from the Gulf of
Mexico up through the Northwestern part of Georgia, if you think about it that way, where you don't have a whole lot
of distance to cover. You have some embedded costs that are attractive and we could certainly link into systems to the
west. And there's even – it's not just Gulf of Mexico stuff, right? There's Fayetteville and some other areas out there
that are shale gas-related.
The other theme would come out of kind of the North, and so you would think about pipes that may come down north
to south and kind of approach our territory more from the east. And so we'll see how that goes. You're talking about
probably more expensive pipes, so can you get a basis difference in the gas between the north and, say, a Henry
Hub-looking kind of proxy. So that's really the two big themes in gas infrastructure that we seem to see.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And my apologies real quick back on Mississippi. And this may be an Art question.
Art, given the court case and where it stands now, what happened in the first quarter from a GAAP accounting
perspective in revenues in Mississippi versus what had been basically going on through all of 2013 and 2014? And I'm
just trying to kind of match up our GAAP revenue numbers to the Mississippi rate increases, are they reflected in
GAAP revenue? I know the cash was collected previously. I'm just trying to think through the puts and takes here.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Michael, the – we didn't record any [indiscernible] (62:05) revenue in the first quarter, but
there were some impacts for equity return on some other pieces that actually went back into fourth quarter of last year
where we unbooked some of that. But it was all really deferred. I don't have a number to give you, but I can get you
something after the call.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Yeah, I mean, just trying to think big picture. You're basically no longer booking the
revenue related to Kemper, that $156 million number.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, all of that was never going to income, per se. It was all being booked on the balance
sheet as a regulatory liability, and it was going to be used to offset rate increases as the plant went into service over
time. That was the whole design of [indiscernible] (63:07).
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Right. Okay. I'll follow up offline.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: So we did in fact – yep.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: I can follow up offline. Sorry to get too far down in the weeds on this one on the call.
Much appreciated, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, we love that stuff. No problem.

And our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your
question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: How are you, Tom? Hi, Art, how are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Super.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hey, Shar.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Just a real question – a quick question on Mississippi. I know you're kind of working on
potentially striking the global settlement. Can you remind us if the asset has sort of a capacity factor hurdle it has to
meet once it's live? It's good to see that it's running like a CCGT but I'm kind of curious on what the hurdles are once
it's live.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, recall, that the combined segment that's running right now is running on natural gas.
Ultimately, we have been working with the Commission on an arrangement in which, when you think about it, when
we had the project certified there was a capital cost component and then there was an energy cost component. And
what we've been able to kind of think about in the settlement is a way for us to essentially assure that Mississippi
customers are held harmless from any cost overruns. We've done that painfully for all of us. And then, otherwise to
assure that the energy benefits are there for Mississippi's customers. And I think we can get that done. Now, you all
must recognize that when Plant Ratcliffe was originally approved, this is a process that occurred in 2009 and 2010. And
remember, we only had 10% of the engineering done. There's been a host of changes in a variety of fronts including
natural gas prices, commodity prices, a whole host of things. I think what we would undertake to do is make sure that
we could deliver the energy benefits that the Commission thought they were getting when the project was approved.
We've already spoken for the capital costs. I think we can get that done.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Got it, got it. And then just one question on renewables, Tom, is we're starting to see some
more contracts being signed post-ITC step-down. Curious on if you're seeing that within the Southeast? And then, kind
of, what that placeholder could look like for Southern Power, between wind and solar, say, post-2016?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. So, you know what's interesting, Shar, is that right now there's an enormous rush to
get stuff done, particularly in solar, before the end of 2016. And, certainly that has filled up our wheelbarrow of capital
placeholders for 2015 and we feel really good about where we are for 2016. The wind deal was a way to straddle – in
fact, it was interesting, one of our own directors used the phrase "a divot" in kind of the development activity of
renewables and, therefore, earnings associated with the renewables.
The other thing that's fascinating is, as we start to consider kind of beyond renewables to 111(d), we'll probably have a
final rule there in summer, say August. The states will now have to start providing for the reality of complying with
that rule. And, therefore, we got to start thinking about gas. And remember, as I suggested earlier on the call, if we're
going to do new gas generation, we need new gas infrastructure. Those things can go hand in hand in filling in that kind
of flat spot.
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Got it, got it. And then just on any of the Southeast states, is anybody close to submitting a
state implementation plan, or are we like really far off?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You don't have a final rule to react to. Hey, Shar, Art just pointed something out. Why
don't you say it – on the solar?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, if you look at our CapEx budget, in terms of growth CapEx in 2017, it's like $200
million, but...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Of solar project.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: ...solar project. So it's very, very small compared to 2015 and 2016.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. So there is $200 million anyway.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's way less than what we're seeing right now.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And [indiscernble] (67:47).
<Q - Shahriar Pourreza>: Excellent, thanks so much.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet. Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Tom, how are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Awesome. How are you?
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Full, thank you. It seems, incrementally, with each call, you're embracing more and more
renewables. I mean, if this trend continues, what are your current thoughts about when a YieldCo might come into
serious consideration?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, we're really following through on what we said we would do. You know, it's funny.
It's kind of what you say and how you say it, I guess. The whats of what we've been saying here have been pretty
consistent for a while now. We thought that renewables would be important, certainly solar renewables through 2015
and 2016. Well, you had the 30% investment tax credit environment. And that kind of beyond 2016 into 2017 and
2018, where 30% goes to 10%, all of a sudden, wind starts looking like a way to address that gap. Also, you should
know the strategic synergy. We started procuring wind energy via contract. So for us to take an equity position in wind
puts us in a different posture than we had been before.
With respect to a YieldCo, you know that – you know that – we'll consider anything. But, I think, on balance, we felt
that Southern Company in and of itself was a YieldCo anyway. We have really efficient ways to raise capital. I think it
introduces complexity into your balance sheet, and long term, I'm not sure that it inures to the benefit of shareholders. It
certainly has short-term appeal, but I would never want to impair the long-term viability of this company by doing
financial engineering or tricks.
The other thing you should just know, and let's just point out again, we haven't talked about it on this call, but we have
on other calls, we have terrific tax appetite. And, given our scale, given our tax appetite, you know that we've always
been conservative. Gee-whiz, our tax appetite remains a competitive advantage for us to play in these fields, link in that
with our experience with the major vendors, our low cost of capital, access to capital markets, gee-whiz, I think the
developers that want to do something significant look to Southern as the premier partner right now. That's why we've
been able to fill up our dance card.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay. Thank you. And then, it was refreshing to see the Kemper charge kind of immaterial this
quarter. How does the future look there?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Tell me about it. Hey, look, we're in start-up right now. There's a smidgen of construction
left, but we're essentially in start-up. And the team there is working wonderfully. We brought in a guy that has had a
tremendous amount of experience in start-up of these types of processes, Chip Troxclair. He and his team have really
done a dynamite job of staying to schedule and working around the issues. It's refreshing to us as well. They're doing a
great job.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Thanks, Paul.

<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Very good. Good afternoon. First question's on slide 18, your financing plan. I noticed there are a
couple of revisions from the slide from last quarter, the big one's being Alabama in 2015 went from $700 million to
$1,375 million, and then in Mississippi bank debt in 2016 went from zero to $900 million. I was wondering if you
could talk about what's driving those changes.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, I believe the Alabama took advantage and issued some additional debt this year and
actually did refunding that probably wasn't reflected in the schedule we showed you on the last call. The Mississippi
bank debt was really a renewal of bank notes that were maturing this year. There was about $775 million maturing this
year, and we actually renewed those plus a couple of hundred million or $175 million or so of additional money. And
really, that's serving as bridge financing until we get into a position where we can either go to the capital markets or do
our securitization financing.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Okay. And I wanted to go back a little bit on your retail sales growth. You talked about the
change in the weather normalized sales. I was wondering if you could give us a little color on the customer growth.
How is that going? Is it consistent with your expectation? Or how is that playing out?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah. Well, we talked a little bit about customer growth in the residential side. We had
16,000 new customers. I think last year we added 10,000 customers in the first quarter. So pretty good jump in growth.
I think if you do a year-over-year look, it's about a 37,000 customer increase. If you look at what we have added since
the first quarter of last year, it's 37,000 customers. You may recall that prior to the recession we were adding almost
60,000 customers or more a year. So it's not back to where it was, but it's showing stronger growth.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Okay. And then last, I was looking at the Vogtle construction update on slide 5, I think it is, and I
noticed, you didn't really change any of the information related to Unit 4. And, I was wondering if that was according
to plan or if there's been some slippage in the near-term and on the horizon, they're essentially the same as what you
reported last quarter.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I don't have last quarter's slide in front of me, but I believe that what you're seeing there is
still kind of consistent with where we are. The biggest new module, that CA04 module is not a very big one, neither are
CB65 or CB66. So the next biggest module for Unit 4 will be CA20, and we mentioned that in the script. That is just
now beginning assembly in the MAB, the Module Assembly Building.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: So the schedule hasn't really changed for Unit 4 then, from what you reported last time?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Not that I'm aware of.
<Q - Dan Jenkins>: Okay. Thank you. That's all I had.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, sir.

And, at this time, there's no further questions. Mr. Fanning, are there any closing remarks?
Thomas A. Fanning
Yeah, thank you. Listen, everybody, we appreciate you being on the call. I think the company is off to a great start, as
we've said. The franchise, for some time now, has been in as good of shape as it's ever been. We continue to execute
like champions and we're going to do our best to make sure that, as shareholders, you're handsomely rewarded. Thanks
very much. Talk to you soon.
