Gerald L. Hassell
Thank you, Valerie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us to discuss our second quarter performance. As Valerie
mentioned, Charlie is here with us today, along with Todd and members of our leadership team. Now, I'll be taking you
through the highlights for the quarter for one final time and then invite Charlie to make some remarks after we've given
you some color for the quarter. Next quarter, you'll be in Charlie's very capable hands.
Now turning to our release, as you may have seen, we again delivered double-digit EPS growth for the quarter as we
achieved healthy revenue growth in both our Investment Management and Investment Services businesses, and we
benefited from the more favorable rate environment. We earned $0.88 per share, up 17% year-over-year. Total revenue
grew 5% driven by 6% growth in investment management and performance fees, 4% growth in investment services
fees and 8% growth in net interest revenue. Total non-interest expense was up 1%, and we generated more than 340
basis points of positive operating leverage.
Our pre-tax margin increased to 33% and to 35% on an adjusted basis and we are continuing to deliver high returns on
tangible common equity, this quarter achieving a strong adjusted return of 22%. So, this is now our tenth straight
quarter of solid performance against the EPS goals we shared at our October 2014 Investor Day, reinforcing how well
our diversified lower risk business model is positioned to deliver consistent results in all market environments.
So, now let me update you on some progress against our strategic priorities. As you know, our top priority is driving
profitable revenue growth. Investment services revenue reflected nice growth across virtually all business lines.
Notable items include strong performance in our clearing businesses, net new business including collateral
management solutions and of course higher equity market values. For the quarter, we had $152 billion in estimated new
AUC/A business wins. Now that includes the $33 billion Prudential Fund administration win that we disclosed in early
April, and we continue to remain encouraged by the strength of our new business pipeline.
We are benefiting from our investments in cutting-edge collateral management and U.S. government securities
clearance capabilities and in market-leading technology to meet client and market demand in these areas. Tri-party
balances grew, reinforcing our multi-quarter growth trend and reflecting a high level of client uptake. So this year
we've on-boarded a number of new repo and collateral management clients, and the demand for our solutions remains
high. Now while the initial revenue impact is relatively small, we would expect these programs to build over time. And
we've also begun on-boarding clients affected by JPMorgan's decision to exit the U.S. government securities clearance
business. The revenue impact in 2017 will be modest, as many of the largest revenue-producing relationships will not
be coming on board until 2018. We expect to see the full revenue impact in 2019.
Our other clearing business remained strong as well, benefiting from the restoration of money market fee waivers and
another quarter of strong growth in mutual fund balances. Mutual fund consolidation, driven by the DOL Fiduciary
Standard Rule, is contributing to increased clearing activity. We had an 11% increase in long-term mutual fund assets
and solid growth in our subaccounting services in asset servicing. Now during the quarter, we became one of the first
banks to go live as an intermediary for U.S. dollar payments with the first phase of the SWIFT global payments
innovation, or gpi. Now that's a service that improves the speed and predictability of cross-border business-to-business
payments. BNY Mellon clients will benefit from quicker and faster use of funds, greater transparency of fees and
payments tracking.
Now turning to Investment Management, it also had a strong quarter, with revenue up 5% year over year and pre-tax
income, excluding intangibles, up 20%. Our adjusted pre-tax operating margins rose to 34%, up 4% year over year.
That benefits from the increased revenue and the margin expansion efforts that we've taken over the last year to focus
on strengthening our core business performance. We achieved a record high of assets under management of $1.77
trillion. Now that's supported by $14 billion in increased flows with long-term active flows of $16 billion, which
includes LDI, and flows from our cash business of $11 billion, and that was partially offset by index outflows of $13
billion.

In terms of investment performance, against the backdrop of relatively strong quarter for global markets, our long-term
active strategies performed well, with 72% and 84% of the assets above their three- and five-year benchmarks,
respectively. Now investments in other initiatives are continuing to gain traction as well. So for example we are seeing
strong interest in our newest boutique, Amherst Capital, where we have been strengthening our alternative offering that
is part of our public and private real estate investment strategies.
Our Wealth Management business also had a strong quarter, delivering record levels of revenue and pre-tax income as
a result of positive flows and higher net new business. The organic investment in expanding our Wealth Management
sales teams has now turned profitable. So in summary, the diversity of our Investment Management business mix
combined with a strategy of meeting the growing client demand for high-value active solutions and ongoing expense
control, continue to drive improved financial performance in this sector.
Our second priority is executing on our business improvement process to create efficiency and quality benefits for our
clients and reduce technology, operations and structural costs for us. So during the quarter, we expanded our cognitive
technology functionality to deploy optical/intelligent character recognition to processing functions. We believe our use
of cognitive technologies is leading-edge. So during the quarter, we were recognized at the Blue Prism World awards
for best use of robotics process automation to deliver overall business value. During the quarter, we also signed
additional clients to our collateralized optimization technology application. It helped our broker-dealer services clients
achieve the optimal use of their assets and maximize capital efficiencies. It's one example of how our business
improvement process is contributing to revenue growth.
Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. The results of the 2017 CCAR stress test
demonstrates the high quality of our balance sheet. Of the U.S. GSIBs, we had the lowest drawdown of our CET1 ratios
through the supervisory severely adverse scenario. Through stress scenarios, we benefit from our fee-based recurring
revenue stream, which delivers consistent earnings and strong capital generation. In addition, we have a very
high-quality credit and investment portfolio and a low-risk business model.
Now, from a regulatory ratio standpoint, our fully phased-in SLR is now 6%. We established a separate legal entity for
our operational aspects of our U.S. government securities clearance and U.S. tri-party repo business, to make us more
resilient, transparent and resolvable. We also simplified our legal entity structure in Europe and across the globe,
eliminating a number of entities and all of the regulatory requirements that go with them.
Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively. And you saw that during the quarter,
we returned more than $700 million in value to our shareholders, repurchasing $506 million in shares and distributing
$199 million in dividends. As we announced last month, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2017 capital plan as
part of CCAR. Our board has approved the repurchase of up to $3.1 billion of common stock, including the repurchase
of $500 million of common stock contingent on a preferred stock issuance. Now this is over the next four quarters. I'm
pleased that we've been able to increase our quarterly dividend by approximately 26% beginning in the third quarter of
this year.
Our fifth priority is attracting, developing and retaining top talent. The executive appointments we have made during
the quarter demonstrate our ongoing focus on tapping into great talent and fresh perspectives in the marketplace, while
also providing growth opportunities for our top contributors from within our ranks.
Now you know all about Charlie and the strong leadership experience he brings to our team. We spoke to many of you
about that on Monday; as you heard, I am thrilled with his selection and he is absolutely the right person to lead the
company into the next phase of growth. Now, in addition, last month, we welcomed Bridget Engle, a proven
high-impact IT executive with more than 30 years of experience spanning AT&T, Lehman Brothers, Barclays and most
recently, Bank of America. She is focused on advancing our technology strategy. We promoted Michelle Neal, the
CEO of our Markets business, to our Executive Committee, which speaks to our confidence in her ability to evolve and
grow our Markets business and to leverage the broad expanse of our trading, financing and liquidity capabilities across
our entire client base.

Frank La Salla was named CEO of Corporate Trust after a highly successful run leading our Alternative Investment
Services business. And Frank is working to further build out our Corporate Trust platform, and sales and leadership
team to deliver superior solutions for our clients and extend our position in this important business. Chandresh Iyer
succeeded Frank as CEO of Alternative Investment Services. Chandresh, who helped drive significant improvements to
our asset manager, asset owner and hedge fund middle office solutions business, will continue to build the company's
real estate administration and ETF services while extending middle office solutions to our hedge fund administration
clients.
Joining Chandresh's team is Peter Salvage, our new Global Head of Hedge Fund Services. Peter is a veteran leader of
the hedge fund, middle office, back office services, innovation and technology space. Peter and his team are focused on
expanding our client base of hedge, credits and hybrid private equity funds. And finally, we named Rohan Singh,
Asia-Pacific Head of Asset Servicing. He has nearly three decades of leadership and client-facing experience in the
business. His hire demonstrates our continued investment in delivering our full capabilities in APAC. So as you can
see, we continue to develop, promote and invest in the best talent in the world.
So in summary, we delivered strong EPS growth, nice revenue growth and significant positive operating leverage. We
and our clients are just beginning to capitalize on the benefits of our strategy and our investments in growth. We have a
proven ability to execute, and we have distinctive capabilities in areas of growing demand, where we can help alleviate
environmental and regulatory pressures on our clients and make it easier for them to access the insights and information
they need to succeed. And we believe our early commitment to an open-source digital platform sets us up nicely to
continue to differentiate ourselves in the global marketplace.
With that, let me turn it over to Todd.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. It was a good quarter as we continued to execute our strategy and build a
foundation for future growth. When you look at the results for the year-over-year quarter, a few things stand out.
First, we experienced solid revenue growth in both segments with investment management and performance fees up
6% and investment services fees up 4%. Second, we grew total revenue by 5% and that's at a time when FX is under a
bit of pressure due to low volatility. And I think that demonstrates our well-diversified, lower-risk model is positioned
to create increased value through most environments that we face. Third, our net interest revenue and our net interest
margin benefited from the rate increases. And finally, expenses were a little higher; yet we still generated excellent
positive operating leverage and increased our operating margins.
Now if you turn to our financial highlights document, I'll continue my commentary starting on slide 5, which gives an
overview of our results for the quarter. Our second quarter EPS was $0.88. That's 17% higher than a year ago. And if
you look at the underlying performance on a year-over-year basis, the second quarter fee revenue was up 5%, expenses
were up 1%, and we generated more than 340 basis points of positive operating leverage. Our adjusted pre-tax
operating margin was up 2 percentage points to 35%.
Net interest revenue also increased a strong 8%, and that was driven by higher interest rates. As we have noted in prior
quarters, the strength of the U.S. dollar continues to impact our results negatively for revenue and positively for
expense. On a consolidated basis, however, the net impact from currency translation was essentially neutral once again.
Income before taxes was up 12%. And our adjusted return on tangible common equity was 22% for the quarter, and
that compares to 20% in the year-ago quarter.
Moving ahead to slide 7, I'll discuss our consolidated fee and other revenue primarily on a year-over-year basis. Total
investment services fees were up 4%. Asset servicing was up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Both increases
reflect net new business including the continued growth of our collateral management solutions businesses as well as
higher equity market values. The year-over-year increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger
dollar and the impact of downsizing the retail U.K. transfer agency business.

Clearing services fees increased 13% year-over-year, and they were up 5% sequentially. They were driven primarily by
higher money market fees as well as growth in our long term mutual fund assets on the platform. Issuer service fees
were up 3% year-over-year, and that reflects higher Depositary Receipt fees. On a sequential basis, Issuer service fees
were down 4%, and that's primarily due to seasonality in Depositary Receipt revenue. Treasury services fees increased
1% year-over-year and sequentially, and that reflects higher payment volumes. Now that's partially offset by higher
compensating balance credits. If you adjust for the compensating balance credits, Treasury service fee revenue
would've been an additional 4% higher.
Investment management and performance fees increased 6% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. That reflects higher
market values, money market fees and performance fees. The year-over-year increase was partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, and that's principally driven by the British pound. On a constant currency
basis, investment management and performance fees increased 9% year-over-year. Investment Management's focused
approach to delivering profitable revenue growth that centers on expanding our product offering to meet the evolving
client demand and high-value active strategies coupled with ongoing improvements to business processes as well as
increased efficiencies. As a result of the actions that we've taken over the last year, the adjusted pre-tax operating
margin for the quarter increased 397 basis points to 34% year-over-year.
Foreign exchange and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was down 9% year-over-year, and it was up 1%
sequentially. FX revenue of $151 million was 9% lower and 2% lower sequentially, reflecting lower volatility that we
saw in both periods. The year-over-year decrease was partially offset by increases in volumes.
Investment and other income of $122 million compared with $74 million in the year-ago quarter and $77 million in the
prior quarter. Both of those comparisons primarily reflect lease-related gains in the second quarter.
Slide eight shows the driver of our Investment Management business, and I think it'll help explain some of the
underlying performance. We achieved record assets under management of $1.77 trillion. That's up 6% year-over-year.
That benefited from higher market values, net inflows that were offset a little bit by the unfavorable impact of the
stronger dollar once again against the British pound for the most part.
Long-term active flows were $16 billion. That was driven by the second consecutive quarter of positive LDI inflows. It
was $15 billion in Q2 and continued momentum in fixed income flows where we saw $2 billion of inflows.
While we experienced outflows of $2 billion in active equities, outflows this quarter were among the lowest we've seen
over the past few years. While we had index outflows of $13 billion, those were primarily due to portfolio rebalancing
from several large international clients. And similar to last quarter and in contrast to the industry trend, we experienced
cash inflows of $11 billion, and that's benefiting from our strong performance from our core money market funds.
Of note, client assets in Wealth Management reached record levels this quarter and it's up 10% year-on-year. And
turning to our Investment Services metrics on slide nine, we achieved record assets under custody and/or administration
of $31.1 trillion, up 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, mostly driven by higher market values. We estimate total
new assets under custody and/or administration business wins were $152 billion in the second quarter, once again a
pretty good result.
Looking at the other key investment metrics, you'll see average deposits declined 10% year-over-year. That reflects the
impact of the rate increase as well as our efforts to proactively manage our balance sheet to meet the current liquidity
and capital requirements. Given the strength that we've been seeing in our capital ratios, we were able to accommodate
some additional client deposits this quarter, and our average deposit balances actually increased 1% sequentially and
that contributed a little to our net interest income. Tri-party balances grew a strong 19% year-over-year and they were
up 5% sequentially, and volume increased with the additional businesses we are onboarding.
Turning to net interest revenue that's on slide 10, you'll see that on a fully taxable equivalent basis NIR was $838
million. That's up 7% versus the year-ago quarter and 4% sequentially. Both increases primarily reflect the benefit of
higher interest rates. The year-over-year increase also reflects lower premium amortization that's partially offset by
lower interest-earning assets and higher average long-term debt. The sequential increase also reflects an additional
interest-earning day, as well as a modest increase in interest-earning assets.

Turning to slide 11, you will see that adjusted non-interest expense increased 1% year over year and was up slightly
sequentially. Expenses were a little higher in the second quarter than we had guided on our first quarter earnings call.
About half of that increase was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter; although it was up on a
year-over-year basis, it was actually weaker in the quarter. The other half was due to higher incentive expense, and that
was both due to performance of the businesses, as well as the impact of a higher share price and the mark-to-market
impact on the variable-compensation component of incentives.
The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher professional, legal, and other purchased services that were
partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar, as well as lower net occupancy expense. The increase in professional, legal,
and other purchased services is primarily related to regulatory and compliance costs, especially the 2017 resolution
plan. Earlier this month, we delivered that plan, which we believe makes us more resilient and resolvable. We incurred
significant cost due to the construction of the plan itself, which has made us more resolvable, and we continue to expect
some of these expenses to be phased out over the coming quarters.
Net occupancy expense decreased as we continue to benefit from the savings we generated from the execution of the
business improvement process, and sequentially lower staff expense was offset by higher Other, Business Development
and Software and Equipment expenses. The decrease in staff expense was driven by the impact of the vesting of
long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees that we recorded in the first quarter as we've done in previous
years.
Turning to capital on slide 12, our fully phased-in supplemental leverage ratio increased to 6%, and that meets the
upcoming 2018 regulatory requirements. Plus it has what we now believe is a very reasonable buffer. We also remain
in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio.
A few additional notes about the quarter. Our effective tax rate of 25.4% is in line with guidance. On page 9 of our
press release, we show investment securities portfolio highlights. At quarter-end, our net unrealized pre-tax gain on our
portfolio was $151 million. That compared with a pre-tax loss of $23 million in the last quarter, with the improvement
primarily driven by the decrease in market interest rates for the period. In summary, a strong quarter performance as we
continue to execute well against our three-year goals.
Now let me provide you with some color on how we are thinking about the next quarter and the full year to assist you
with your modeling. Third quarter earnings are typically impacted by a seasonal slowdown in transaction volumes and
market-related revenue, particularly things like foreign exchange, collateral services and securities lending. That all is
often offset by the seasonally higher activity that we see in depositary receipts. However, for this coming quarter, we
would expect the seasonal bump in DRs to be about half of what it was last year, and that's around $50 million,
reflecting a somewhat less favorable market environment.
Now during our first quarter call, we indicated that our net interest revenue should be up in the range of 2% to 4% for
the second quarter. As you can see, we came in at the high end of that range. We had also indicated at that time that we
expected to be in the 4% to 6% range for the full year, that NIR would be up in that range. Given the performance that
we've seen in the second quarter, as well as our outlook now for NIR, it has improved, and we think we should be at the
high end of that 4% to 6% range.
Another item, back in January I told you that investment and other income should be in the range of $60 million to $80
million each quarter, and this quarter it was elevated quite a bit because of the lease-related gains that I mentioned
earlier. As you have seen over many quarters, this line does tend to be a little bit bumpy, but for the full year, we still
expect to average the high end of the $60 million to $80 million range per quarter.
On expenses, as we noted last quarter, we expect to see a $10 million decline in each of the last two quarters, or about
$20 million in total, mainly from reduced consulting fees related to the resolution plan. For the full year, we expect our
total adjusted expenses to be up around 1%, although the improved revenue performance and the recent decline in the
dollar may make this a bit more challenging.

Regarding taxes, we expect our 2017 effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%, along the lines of what we
previously guided. And finally we expect to generate positive operating leverage for the entire year of 2017.
With that, let me hand it over to Charlie to say a few words.
Charles W. Scharf
Thanks, Todd. It's great to see that Gerald and the team were able to deliver more solid results in Gerald's last quarter
as CEO, and that he and the team have been able to create momentum. I know I said it a few days ago, but I have a
tremendous amount of respect for what Gerald has accomplished during his 44-year career and six-year tenure as CEO
here at BNY Mellon. We're working very well together, and I look forward to his continuing advice and counsel. We
will continue to build on all that he and the team have accomplished and will focus on both efficiency and growth.
While we understand that short-term results give us the credibility and resources to invest for the long term, we will
sustain a strong, trusted and well-respected company with real long-term, sustainable growth.
Gerald and Todd are in the best position to comment on the quarter, so I'll hand it back to them, and I look forward to
speaking with you more after I'm settled. Gerald?
Gerald L. Hassell
Well, Charlie, thank you very much for those kind remarks, and, operator, we're now able to open it up for questions.
Operator, can we open it up for questions? Yes, thank you.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning. Gerald, congratulations also on a great career at BK. And, Charlie, best of
luck. If I could just ask on NII, Todd, to your point on the good progression, just as far as your outlook, I was
wondering the Securities book yields were flat sequentially, and I'm wondering if you can just help us understand just
the on and off, what's coming on and what's coming off? And any changes that you're seeing in terms of just the
environment and how you're able to invest there? It seems like the benefits you got were more in the cash deposits and
in the loan book and the securities yields were flat. So I'm just wondering if you can help us understand the movements
there and how that looks forward?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, Ken. Good morning. So the securities' book does have about 30% of it that is
floating, so that reprices regularly. And there's a little bit of lag to that, but we see that reflected in the numbers over the
past couple of quarters. The other 70% is being reinvested in similar duration securities, and there's a flat yield curve.
So those rates really haven't gone up much. So it's not really benefiting from a change in the rate environment.
As we look forward, we would expect to see those yields continue to grind up if they follow the forward yield curve.
You'd probably see the entire securities portfolio continue to grind up maybe in the range 6 basis points or 7 basis
points a quarter.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Got it. Great. Thank you for that. And secondly, if you can provide a little color on that issuer
services commentary. Is this an environmental point about the seasonality being different? Or are you seeing some
structural changes to either the usage of DRs or the way that market is moving around nowadays?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. The comment I made was we typically see in the third quarter a fairly substantial
bump. We expect to see that in this quarter, but not as large as what we've seen in the past. I think, Brian, you can kind

of point out what the factors that are driving that.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yes. Sure, Todd. I think the reason the growth in the third quarter wouldn't be as high as
last year are really driven by three different factors. One is just market and economic conditions have driven a decline
in DRs outstanding in a couple of large emerging markets.
Second, there was some non-recurring M&A activity and privatization activity last year in the second quarter that won't
repeat itself this year, so that's going to create a year-over-year difference. And then we are seeing pretty aggressive
competitor pricing in the marketplace, and we've been sticking to our discipline around profitable growth, and as a
result, we've lost a couple of clients in the DR space, which is another factor. So those are the three factors. But
honestly, we think our profitable growth strategy is the right one long-term for the shareholder. And in terms of our
market share of new issuance, our market share still remains market-leading and solid.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And corporate actions in the space tend to be episodic anyway, so you are going to get
some swings there from period to period.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Understood. All right. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Hey, guys. Good morning, everybody. So I continue to be kind of fixated on the whole
repo clearing, collateral management issues. So maybe I'll take another stab at this. Any way you guys can help us size
how much this contributes to revenues today. And I guess more importantly, the opportunity you see from JPMorgan
exiting this business. I guess a couple years ago I heard you talking about onboarding some clients, but any way you
can help us size this I think that'll be helpful. And I guess just more importantly, taking a step back, the Treasury's
suggestion on the SLR relief, if that does come into fruition, should be pretty positive for the repo markets broadly.
Again, maybe taking a step back, you can help us think through how this could impact BNY Mellon's revenue as a
whole.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Alex, you're layering a lot of questions for us there, but let's see how we can handle
them. I'll start...
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: It's all one topic.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes. I'll start with the clearance topic and ask Brian to pitch in. So when we look at
collateral management, it's another form of custody. So we're acting as a custodian, as do many of our competitors and
that falls to the asset servicing line. It's a relatively small component of the total asset servicing line, but it is the fastest
growing component. And we're starting to see it actually move the needle a little bit. So when we look at the growth in
the quarter and we look at the underlying growth rate, probably about half of that was contributed by improvements in
collateral management. I don't know, Brian, you have anything to add to that with the new clearance clients coming on?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yes. I mean JPMorgan, as you said, announced their exit from the government clearing
business last year, but we're only now beginning to transition them after putting in place the enhanced governance
model and the enhanced resolvability model that Gerald talked about. So we actually converted our first small
JPMorgan client in the second quarter, and we'll be converting now, over the course of the rest of this year and the
course of 2018, the rest of those clients, as well as some other clients, new market entrants into this space. So we think
that U.S. government clearing and tri-party and global collateral services will be an increasing driver of the growth over
the next 18 months and we're all aligned to drive that growth responsibly.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And I think, Alex, the related question you had is how about the impact of the treasury paper
on regulatory change. A component of that was to exclude things like treasuries and central bank cash, and perhaps

treasury repo, out of the denominator of the leverage ratio, and the SLR. As you look out to the binding constraints for
the big broker-dealer – big entities that have broker-dealers, that is their binding constraint. So I would assume, if
they've got some relief, the matched books that they had run in the past could probably grow, and we would benefit
from more activity. So we would be very welcoming of seeing that. We think it'd be healthy for the treasury market
itself because I think it would add greater liquidity to the market, tighten up spreads, and we also think there'd be more
transaction volume flowing through us if that were to be the case.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got it. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just a second question around the NIR
dynamic and just deposit betas you guys are seeing in the quarter. Any meaningful change from the last hike given
client behavior you guys observed I guess post the June hike? And then specifically with respect to noninterest-bearing
deposits, seems like that's been fairly stable for you guys, but any sign you're seeing that customers in that bucket are
starting to look around for places of a little more yield.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yes. Why don't I talk about a couple of points here. If you look at page 8 of our earnings
release, we disclose what the cost of our interest-bearing deposits and the change in the quarter and you can see this
quarter it went from three basis points to nine basis points. So we had about a 29-basis-point increase on average in the
interest on excess reserves. So if you take into consideration that about 75% of our deposits are U.S. dollar
denominated, that equates to the quarter of somewhere between a 25% and a 30% beta. We do think that beta with
future rate increases will increase, but it will continue to add positively to our NIM. So we do anticipate betas moving
up above the 50% range with the next few movements.
In terms of deposit behaviors, they've probably outperformed our expectations a little bit in the second quarter. In terms
of the total deposits, they're up a little bit. U.S. deposits are just about dead flat on a sequential basis, both in the
noninterest bearing and in the interest bearing. And we do believe, depending on how the Fed does its tapering, that we
might continue to see some modest run-off in noninterest-bearing deposits. I think what goes on in the interest bearing
is going to be just related to the betas. So there's no reason that we'd have to see that kind of a run-off, but the net
impact is still a positive one with our NIM increasing more than the impact of the run-off. That's what we're currently
modeling.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Yes. Maybe I can add a little something, Alex, and that is we have a very, very good
process internally by business segment around seeing the deposit flows. I mean, that's one of the benefits of enhanced
data by business line, by segment, they can work with our treasury area, making sure we're pricing the deposits the
right way for the best outcome for the firm and for the clients. And that process is working very smoothly.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got it. Thanks, guys, very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi. Thanks very much. A question on asset servicing. We try to get at this once in a while and
there's a lot of moving parts. But the markets are up a lot, your assets are up a lot, asset servicing up just 1%, I wonder
if you could parse out what's mix shift, what's price rates, what's currency, what's the U.K. TA business impact. It just
came up lighter, and I think, there's just a bunch of moving parts in there.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sure. How about if I start and Brian. So, one of the things that I want to make clear is if you
look at the asset servicing line for the enterprise, that does include some fee revenue that's generated in Investment
Management and some fee revenue that's generated, and most of it, obviously, is generated in the Investment Services
business. So, on the Investment Management side, we've seen in our boutiques a little lower securities lending and in
the kind of the custody-related business in Wealth Management, it's been relatively flat. The remainder of it is running
through Investment Services, and Brian, you can speak to that.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah. From an Investment Services perspective, I mean, the revenue growth is up 2%
year-over-year. If you adjusted that for the impact of currency and the impact of our repositioning of the U.K. retail TA

business, the growth rate is more like, I'd say approximately 3.5%. So it's reasonably solid growth rate. We still think
that this business is positioned well for growth long term. Asset managers are faced with secular trends that are putting
pressure on their cost base, and we really are part of that solution in terms of extending variable costs, shared
economies of scale solutions.
So we see significant growth opportunity ahead, in the middle office space, in the real estate private equity fund
administration space. We're strengthening our team in the ETF services space and we sort of have a life cycle approach
to ETF services. Not just the core servicing but we're an authorized participant and we have a platform for asset
gathering and now, a new no-transaction fee ETF asset-gathering platform at Pershing. So I think we're continuing to
do the foundational things we need to enhance the growth of this business and, as Todd and Gerald already mentioned,
collateral management, which is core to it, is one of those drivers going forward.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: I think just as a reminder, too, our business mix is a little bit different. So we're much more
fixed income oriented, as you know, fixed income is actually down a little bit year-over-year, but we're benefiting from
the expertise that we have in the collateral management side of that. So I think that's an – so we do get a market bump.
There's no question about it, but it's probably not as high as you might see it, somebody that was more oriented toward
equities.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Fair and all good. I appreciate that. Just one little follow-up. I'm not sure if I missed it. But you
mentioned what you won in the quarter. Do you have a number for what's won but not yet funded pipeline?

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Hi. Good morning, folks. Maybe just back on the balance sheet. Todd, if you can comment on
how you would potentially envision the balance sheet size if some of the recommendations by the Treasury do come to
fruition in terms of releasing cash and treasury securities from the SLR denominator? I know it's very early, of course,
but how you might think about that shaping your balance sheet size strategy over the next couple years. And then, just
also just quickly on the other securities portfolio line, the yield was down 10 bps; just wondering if there's any premium
amortization increase in that in 2Q?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I'll have to ask a follow-up question of your question on the second question, but as to the
balance sheet size, Brian, if we do get relief from the Treasury recommendations, we're going to have to think through
what to do – that would relieve a fair amount of our capital requirements. And so we've been pretty disciplined in the
past, and I expect that we will be in the future. And so, if growing the balance sheet makes sense, we'll do that. If not,
we'll buy back our shares.
And so we'll have to compare what the alternatives are with that incremental cash. We'd love to see it, because we think
it would propel behavior, and we love the optionality that it would provide. But, again, that activity would have to be
contingent on making a decent return, because ultimately it's freed-up capital, so we've got to do something with that
capital, and so that's how we're thinking about it. I didn't completely understand your second question, Brian.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: That was just on the other securities portion on the average balance sheet. I think yield went
down. I mean, it's a small thing, but [indiscernible] (44:30) balance, the yield went down by 10 basis points, if I'm not
mistaken. 1.25% to 1.15% in the quarter. Just didn't know if there was anything to that in terms of mix, or was premium
amortization a factor?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. I don't know off the top of my head. There isn't a lot of a premium amortization
impact, so I don't think that's going to be driving it, but I don't – if you'll recall back in the fourth quarter, we adopted
what we called the prepayment method for premium amortization. And under that method I think we've reduced quite a

bit of the volatility out of the numbers. So I'll have to look into that. I don't have that detail, Brian.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up for Brian on the client adoption of NEXEN. I know you
guys have been talking a lot about increasing client usage of a number of different services, and you're beginning to see
a little bit of an incremental revenue impact. Just did that impact asset servicing positively this quarter, and are you
seeing that as a potential revenue impact in the second half?
And then, just maybe, I know Charlie's going to comment a lot more next quarter, but in terms of the technology
initiatives that you've been putting in place in the business improvement process, should we be thinking of any type of
strategic change to those priorities with Charlie in the CEO seat?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah. It's Brian Shea. Let me start with the NEXEN comment. We continue to see
increasing adoption of the NEXEN platform, and we continue to build out capabilities and add more capabilities to
enhance the client experience and their ability to operate effectively. We've now crossed the threshold of over 100,000
client and internal users on the NEXEN platform, which is good.
In terms of revenue generation, there's going to be some fee revenue growth from core services like API, access, and
processing, and then obviously premium services. It is not yet a meaningful contributor to the revenue base, but expect
that that revenue impact will grow over time, and at this point, we don't want to provide specific guidance on that.
Want to just continue to build the platform out and see client adoption.
I would say that the client impact is growing, and positively, more and more case studies and examples where getting
the access to the real-time data through APIs is making a meaningful difference in our clients' business and enabling
them. For example, in one case, a major financial institution getting collateral and liquidity information multiple times
intraday, enabling them to manage their collateral and liquidity more effectively, and saving a client millions of dollars.
So really adding value more and more, and there's more proof points and case studies that that's going to continue to
grow.
In terms of the business improvement process, I'll comment on it and if Charlie wants to add something to it, I'm sure
he will. Look, the business improvement process is going to continue. It's critical to our performance, the environment
– and the market environment requires us to continuously optimize our existing investments in order to fund strategic
growth investments and reward shareholders. So I see this as a process, not a project, and something that we would
continuously do as part of a continuous improvement culture. And so we have a pipeline of initiatives already
underway and already being analyzed that would continue to drive momentum in that space. And I would hope and
expect that Charlie would agree to that, and he's going to have a chance to decide right now. Go ahead, Charlie.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: It's like mother and apple pie. I agree completely with what Brian said, and I just look
forward to getting into the detail and understanding the specifics a little bit more.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Great. Thanks very much for the color.

Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the deposit
growth trends. We saw the foreign office deposit growth tick up, and I think, Todd, you referenced that U.S. deposit's
stable, so it seems like all that deposit growth came from foreign offices. At the same time, we saw the cost of those
switch from negative to positive. So number one, I guess what drove that cost? And was there any particular region
driving that? Or was there a mix shift there in that line item?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. So, yeah, we're kind of mixing apples and oranges here. Where the deposits are
booked is not necessarily a reflection of the underlying currency. So what we did see – and a fair amount of our
deposits are booked at foreign branches. With that, the actual mix of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar deposits changed
just slightly because we saw our U.S. dollar deposits flat and our non-U.S. dollar deposits increase slightly.

So as we go through the tick up for the period on our interest-earning deposits, the cost moved up from 3 to 9 basis
points. And all of that was attributed to the dollar impact. So when we walk through – and I'd mentioned this earlier on
the call – when we do the arithmetic, that equates to somewhere between a 25% and a 30% beta on your dollar
denominated interest earning deposits.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Got it. So regardless of domicile, currency driver was all USD. No real change in the
non-U.S. dollar base deposits?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: That's correct. It was flat from period-to-period on average.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then when we think about revenue
growth in Clearing services, I want to say that was a pretty strong component that we saw here this quarter. And when
we think about durability, I know you had some decent growth in the cash products as far as flows go. Is this just a
catch up there? And, therefore, we should think about this as the right jumping off point for that line item? It's tough
because we can't see the exact AUM in the disclosures yet in those products, so just not completely sure how much
that's up.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: So, why don't I take a stab at this since it bridges both of our major sectors? First of all on
the Clearing side, the further consolidation of mutual fund assets onto our platforms is increasing, and it's very
gratifying to see that our platforms are being used more extensively as that consolidation process occurs. And we are
winning business from brokers and accelerating that pace, and more importantly advisors as we shift to an advisory
model, utilizing our platform to capture assets. That's one of the reasons why you've seen the Clearing business pick up
as nicely as it did as well as the fee waiver impact.
The second part of your question is we are seeing and capturing more cash through our various portals and platforms.
So whether it's the purchasing platform, our liquidity services platform, we are capturing and internalizing more of that
flow, and that's why I think we're outperforming, capturing cash in our money market business and that flows into the
investment management area.
And I think our performance in the management of the money market funds has also improved, so we are now very,
very competitive on the returns in the money market funds. So the combination of the increased performance on the
funds and the capture of the cash is allowing us to outperform.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Terrific. Thanks for all the color.

<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. I had technical difficulties on the call on Monday. So my first question goes
congratulations, Gerald, for your great career and welcome, Charlie. Charlie, can you share with us – I know you got
the technical background from Visa and how that will help probably in the investment services area, but when you look
at slide 3 of today's handout, you see that the investment management revenues have been pretty much flat for now
two-and-a-half years. What's your view about the Investment Management business when you look forward?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Well, if I think generically, the underlying business dynamics are something that fits very
well into what we do. I obviously have a lot to learn about our boutique model, what drives the performance, what
drives how we've done, and honestly, I've spent just a little bit of time with Mitchell, but we're going to spend a bunch
of more time going through what the plans are. And when there's more to talk about, we'll certainly do, which I would
certainly be, by the end of the quarter and at Investor Day.

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yes. Gerard, one slight correction to your comments. The revenue growth in Investment
Management was up very nicely and the pre-tax income's up even more. So we just want to stand corrected a little bit
that the performance in the Investment Management area has actually been quite robust this year.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. And then, Todd, can you give us an update, in 2014 at Investor Day, you talked
about the balance sheet shrinking maybe $40 billion to $70 billion over time. Where are you on that number when you
calculate your peak deposits to where they are today? How much are you down?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: If you look at it on average, interest-bearing deposits on a year-over-year basis are down
about $25 billion. So we're pretty far along the way. Most of that is in dollars. Now when we gave that indication, we
assumed a parallel shift in all currencies, and so we haven't seen that. So we're not seeing any declines in the non-dollar
deposits at this point, Gerard. So I think we've pretty much tracked along our expectations and we could see a modest
additional decline. Now that all being said, the markets are growing, and so with the growth, the natural underlying
growth may offset some of what the interest impact and the Fed tapering impact would otherwise have.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Thanks, guys. First question just on Investment Management, I think most of the trends, you
guys mentioned the performance, flows, revenues, margin, everything looked pretty good. There's just two items I just
had a quick question on. One is on the other line, it looks like there was a loss there. I think that's usually seed, but
markets are pretty strong, so I don't know if that was something a little unusual. And then I know you guys mentioned
on the high net worth side, deposit balances declining for net interest income. I think we're seeing that across the
industry, but just any color on how much that's tax related versus clients being more engaged in the market versus
sitting on cash.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes. I'll make a brief comment and then Mitchell can jump on. We are seeing a little bit of
a decline in the wealth deposits and I don't know if you have any further comment on that.
<A - Mitchell Evan Harris>: Just on wealth deposits, you have a couple things I think going on. You have seasonality
that happened in the second quarter with tax payments and with interest rates moving up, at least private clients are
moving into other products right now. So there's shifting out. With respect to the other revenue comment, it's really
primarily an abatement of the cash waivers that we pay out to investment services, so it's more of an internal transfer
from us over to investment services.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And, Michael, were you referring to...
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Okay. Thanks.

income?

terms of the full year, that $60 million to $80 million. I just want to make sure we're thinking about that right, meaning
$60 million to $80 million for the remaining two quarters? Or do we take the elevated level that you had this quarter
and the rest of the year would be lower?

Our final question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Back to the deposits, firstly, can you
remind us why your clients leave non-interest-bearing deposits with you? You've got over $70 billion of them. It's a
very sophisticated client base. I'm sure they'd rather earn some interest if they could, so why do clients leave those
non-interest-bearing deposits at BNY Mellon?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, there's a substantial amount of those that are non-dollar, and so right now in the
non-dollar category, interest rates are extraordinarily low or negative in some instances.
In U.S. dollars, it tends to be frictional cash. I mean, most of us leave a little money in our checking accounts. It looks a
lot like a retail business when you have many thousands upon thousands of accounts, and our clients are trying to make
sure that they don't incur overdrafts in those accounts, so they'll leave a little bit of a cushion for that frictional activity.
And then the final point, in some of our payments businesses we actually give an earnings credit. So we don't pay
interest on the account, but we credit fees for the account. So that's still denominated as a non-interest-bearing account,
but it effectively offsets fees for the services provided.
This quarter alone we saw a pretty healthy payments business. The fees were only up 1%, but if we reflected the credits
that they got from non-interest-bearing balances, that would have added another 4%. So the actual underlying activity
was up a pretty healthy number.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: And then just to follow up on that, non-interest-bearing is obviously a much higher percentage
of liabilities or earning assets, or however you want to look at it, than it was before the crisis. Is there anything
structural that's changed that means that it should be higher other than the interest rates environments?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I wouldn't say that there is. Obviously, the value of managing that tighter and tighter will
go up as interest rates go up, and that's why we would expect in our models, and we've reflected that that is probably
going to be the case. If you look back at us prior to the crisis, we were running those numbers somewhere around 16%
of the balance sheet. It's probably a little bit higher than that now, but I believe the non-dollar component of it has
contributed a fair amount of that as well.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Thank you, Geoffrey.
Gerald L. Hassell
Thank you very much, Geoffrey, and thanks, everyone, for dialing in. We really appreciate it, and I'm sure you'll follow
up with Valerie and our team on further questions.
