Meg Cushing Whitman
Thank you, Rob. And thanks to all of you for joining us today.
With the first half of fiscal 2014 closed I'm pleased to report that HP's turnaround remains on track. As you would
expect in a turnaround of this scale, there are some businesses performing better than we expected, and others with
more work to do. We've made significant progress in putting the systems and structures in place to more effectively
manage the business, and we are focused on putting the right talent in place to lead the next leg of the turnaround. Most
of all, we've stabilized the top line and we're starting to see the benefits of our focus and investments in key
technologies.
We have more work to do to improve the consistency of our execution and lower our cost structure to drive overall
profitability, but I believe we're well-positioned as we enter the second half of 2014. Rest assured, sustained, profitable
revenue growth remains our top priority.
Innovation is at the heart of our strategy to turn HP around. And in the second quarter you saw the launch of several
critical elements of our innovation agenda. In cloud we launched HP Helion, a portfolio of products and services that
enables the next phase of our enterprise customers' cloud journey. Helion is changing the game in cloud by allowing
the integration of public, private, managed cloud and traditional IT environments on an open and secure platform. We
are addressing a major pain point for the enterprise customers with Helion, and the early interest has been very positive.
We also announced further significant business model innovation in our Server business, with the creation of a joint
venture with Foxconn. Together we're creating a new line of cloud-optimized servers specifically targeting service
providers. This partnership brings together the high volume, design and manufacturing expertise of Foxconn with the
compute, services, brand and go-to-market leadership of HP. Together, we will redefine the infrastructure economics of
the world's largest service providers.
In big data we unveiled the HP Shark system for SAP HANA. This new converged system is designed to deliver higher
levels of performance and availability for in-memory computing at up to twice the speed of other solutions. We saw
strong sequential growth in our HANA offerings in the second quarter.
And we introduced OpenNFV, a comprehensive network function virtualization program. This new program is
designed to help telecom customers launch new services faster with less expense and lower risk. NFV is one of the
most significant shifts the telecommunications industry has experienced in the last 20 years, and represents an
important opportunity for HP.

As I have said before, we continue to see an acceleration of the massive shifts that are transforming the way customers
buy, pay for and consume technology. This reality is creating both opportunities and challenges for HP and every one
of our competitors. To win, we have to continue to focus and make HP a more nimble, lower cost and more customer
and partner-centric company. We've made a lot of progress to that end over the past two years, but we still have more
work to do in our structure, our systems and our go-to-market.
In the second half of 2014 we will be accelerating these activities to ensure that we have the right structure in place as
we enter 2015. As a result we now expect up to an additional 16,000 employees will leave the company under the
previously announced 2012 restructuring program. This will bring the total number of employees leaving under the
program to as many as 50,000.
No company likes to reduce their workforce, but the reality is that HP must be maniacally focused on continuous
improvement in our cost structure. We believe this further alignment, along with the expected increased investments in
innovation and infrastructure set us up as a force to be reckoned with in the rapidly shifting markets where we compete.
Turning to the second quarter, HP delivered $0.88 in diluted non-GAAP net earnings per share, at the high end of our
previously stated financial outlook of $0.85 to $0.89 per share. For the second consecutive quarter, total revenue for the
company was approximately flat in constant currency and we once again delivered very strong cash flow, generating $3
billion in cash flow from operations.
Now let me turn to our Business Group performance in the quarter. Overall, results in Q2 were driven by solid
performance in Printing, Networking and Personal Systems as well as disciplined cost management across all of our
businesses. In Personal Systems we had a very strong performance with revenue up 7% over the prior year. Overall
we're seeing a slowing market contraction and signs of stabilization, particularly in commercial PCs. This is coupled
with support from a refresh of an aging install base and the expiration of Windows XP.
HP executed well in the quarter, particularly in our commercial PC segment. Overall, PSG operating margins improved
and we gained share with good growth in Europe and Japan. We reclaimed the number one position in both commercial
PCs and in desktops, all against a backdrop of a declining market.
Looking forward, I'm excited about the strength of our product lineup and we will remain focused on profitable growth
and continuing to drive further action on our end to end cost structure.
For the fourth consecutive quarter our Printing business once again outperformed the market and saw unit placement
growth and we held or gained share in every major printing category and region on a year-over-year basis, all while
delivering another quarter of excellent profitability.
In Enterprise Services, as expected, revenue was down 7% over the prior year as delayed key account revenue runoff
from FY13 continued. The operating profit margin in ES was flat over the prior year and up sequentially. We expect to
see a continued ramp in margins in the second half and Cathie will elaborate further on this in a moment.
We remain focused on our proactive sales efforts in ES and are in the early stages of this transition, but I can feel the
increased confidence from our customers.
While total signings were down over the prior year, strategic Enterprise Services bookings growth is encouraging and
we saw good new wins in the quarter.
For example, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security awarded HP a cyber-security contract worth up to $32
million. And Belgium's Flemish government awarded a seven-year €500 million contract to HP and Belgacom to offer
ICT services to all local and provincial government entities. The program will give citizens access to information and
services through a virtual private cloud solution.
We've made progress, but opportunities remain for improvement in services bookings, and we need to move faster in
ramping-up our cost savings and productivity initiatives. However, I'm confident that the leadership team has taken the
right steps to get Enterprise Services back on track.

In the Enterprise Group, revenue declined 2% over the prior year, driven by lower technology services and storage
revenue, as well as the expected decline in Business Critical Systems. This was partially offset by growth in
Networking and Industry Standard Servers.
We continue to see a very competitive market in enterprise infrastructure. I'm confident that the changes we've made in
the leadership and go-to-market execution, coupled with cost saving opportunities and our investment in innovation
have put this business back on the right path. However, we expect it will take a few quarters for these changes to
consistently take hold.
In addition to the new products that I discussed earlier, I'm very excited about some of the innovations that we'll be
rolling out in the second half of the year from our server, cloud, storage, technology services and converged systems
teams. We're doubling-down on innovation in EG, because we believe that is how we're going to differentiate in these
markets.
In Industry Standard Servers revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter. The team continues to make progress on
stabilizing this business and improving our cost structure and go-to-market. We continue to see good customer interest
in Moonshot with over 100 beta customers and engagements through our Discovery Labs, and over 40 partners in the
program. While we are seeing a ramp in Moonshot revenue, we don't anticipate this will become material in the near
term. However, we believe Moonshot is on its way to becoming a disruptive product in a new category of servers.
The decline in Business Critical Systems moderated in the quarter. Revenue was down 14% over the prior year and up
1% sequentially. Storage revenue was down 6% over the prior year as customers appeared to pause to assess new
products and market innovations. Despite the market, we still expect to gain a point of share overall. We have work to
do to improve our go-to-market in this business, particularly our execution in the Americas. We've invested in
additional storage sales specialists, but these take time to ramp to full productivity. Overall, we remain very confident
in our Storage business. We believe our converged storage portfolio is well-positioned to address shifting market forces
with products like 3PAR, StoreVirtual and StoreOnce.
Networking performed well with an acceleration of growth. Revenue grew 6% over the prior year with strength in
switching and routing and we saw growth across all of our regions.
As I have said many times, in a turnaround having the right people in the right place at the right time is critical. To that
end, we recently announced that Antonio Neri has assumed management responsibility for the Networking business, in
addition to his current role leading the Server team. Antonio is a proven leader who has done an excellent job guiding
our Server business over the past several quarters, and our Technology Services business before that. Integrated
Systems are becoming increasingly prominent in the data center. And Antonio's new role will help us better align our
compute and networking product strategies.
In Technology Services, revenue declined 5% over the prior year. The nature of this business means performance
typically lags hardware sales overall, so we expect revenue to stabilize in line with the progress we've made in our
hardware sales. The leadership team in TS has done job an excellent job managing this business, and we continue to see
very good customer adoption of our new services, and margins remain strong.
In Software revenue was flat over the prior year. Performance in the quarter was driven by growth in Autonomy
licensing and strong double-digit growth in Security and Vertica, offset by softness in our traditional IT management
business. Looking forward we will continue our transition to SaaS, while rejuvenating our core portfolio and investing
in operational improvements across this business.
In addition, I've asked George Kadifa to take on a new role as Executive Vice President of Strategic Relationships. In
this role George will be responsible for leading growth initiatives and alliance programs with key partners, service
providers and our largest customers. After leaving HP Software, George has gained a unique perspective on our
strategic priorities of cloud, big data, security and mobility. He understands both the customer requirements and the
partner ecosystems that must be built to realize the potential of these technologies.

Robert Youngjohns will take over for George as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of HP Software.
Robert is a very seasoned technology executive with more than three decades of experience. He joined the company
last year to lead the turnaround of HP Autonomy after serving as President of Microsoft North America.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made, but we still have a lot more work to do. Our focus continues to
be driving innovation, simplifying our organizational structure to speed decision-making, and reducing cost. These
initiatives are particularly important as we continue to navigate a rapidly shifting marketplace.
Against that backdrop, our Q3 outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share will be $0.86 to $0.90. And for the
full year the outlook will be $3.63 to $3.75.
So now let me turn it over to Cathie for a closer look at our performance in the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine A. Lesjak
Thanks, Meg.
As Meg said, we feel good about where we are overall as we reach the midpoint of the turnaround. In Q2 total company
revenue was in line with expectations, with pockets of strength in PCs and Networking. Enterprise Group revenue was
somewhat lower than expected as storage revenue fell, although Converged Storage Solutions continued to outperform
the market.
Total revenue for the quarter was $27.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year and approximately flat in constant currency.
By region, Americas revenue was $11.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year, or down 4% in constant currency. In the
U.S., revenue was impacted by key account runoffs in Enterprise Services, plus softness in laser jet printing and in
most EG business units. This was partially offset by strength in commercial PCs and Networking.
In Brazil, we experienced weakness across all of our businesses. EMEA revenue was $10.3 billion, up 4%
year-over-year, or up 2% in constant currency driven by growth in mature Western European economies. We
experienced double-digit growth in Personal Systems in EMEA partially offset by declines in printing.
APJ revenue was $5.3 billion, up 1% year-over-year, or up 6% in constant currency. We experienced revenue growth in
China primarily on the strength in Enterprise Group and printing. In Japan, Personal Systems revenue was very strong
due to the XP migration.
Gross margin for the quarter was 24.2%, up 0.5 points year-over-year, and up 1.4 points sequentially. Year-over-year,
strength in Printing and improvements in Enterprise Services were partially offset by pressure from the strong revenue
performance in Personal Systems, and weaker Enterprise Group margins due to a competitive pricing environment.
Sequentially, most of our businesses improved their gross margins due to good cost management and pricing discipline.
Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year, primarily associated with
incremental R&D investments. Sequentially, OpEx was up 6% on higher R&D investments as well as a tough compare
due to the real estate gains we reported in fiscal Q1.
As a result, non-GAAP operating profit was $2.3 billion or 8.6% of revenue, flat year-over-year and up 0.1 points
sequentially.
We recorded $174 million of expense on the Other Income and Expense line, with a 22% tax rate and a weighted
average diluted share count of 1.916 billion shares. We delivered second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per
share of $0.88.
Second quarter non-GAAP earnings primarily excludes pre-tax charges of $264 million for amortization of intangible
assets and $252 million for restructuring charges.

Now turning to the business units, in Printing we saw very strong profitability and further traction in key initiatives like
Ink In the Office and Ink Advantage, as well as in Graphics. However, weak toner sales continue to be a headwind as
the hardware install base remains under pressure. We are focused on placing value-added units to support the installed
base throughout the rest of fiscal 2014. Total Printing revenue was $5.8 billion, down 4% year-over-year, driven by a
decline in supplies revenue primarily related to lower toner sales.
Commercial hardware revenue was $1.4 billion, down 1% year-over-year while consumer hardware revenue was $566
million, up 1% year-over-year. Total hardware unit shipments grew 1% year-over-year. Ink In the Office and Ink
Advantage units and revenue each grew double digits, and we grew share in both ink and laser hardware units. Supplies
revenue was $3.9 billion, down 6% over the prior year period, and made up 66.3% of Printing revenue. Although the
mix is down a point year-over-year, ink is a greater part of the Supplies mix, which helped offset the negative impact of
lower supplies on overall Printing profitability.
Total Printing operating profit was $1.1 billion or 19.5% of revenue, up 3.6 points year-over-year. We saw a positive
currency benefit of approximately 1.5 points in second quarter margins, plus we realized some of the benefit from our
focus on reducing non-labor costs and disciplined OpEx management. We expect to reinvest back some of these profits
in value-added hardware units.
Supplies channel inventory levels remain very slightly above our target range. This was primarily due to softer toner
sales in Europe, but we did make progress reducing overall toner channel inventory in the quarter.
The Personal Systems Group had a strong quarter despite a contracting PC market. Revenue and Personal Systems was
up 7% year-over-year at $8.2 billion, driven by strong growth in commercial desktops and notebooks.
Commercial sales grew 12% year-over-year, with consumer sales down 2%, although consumer notebook revenue
grew slightly for the first time since the fiscal 2010 third quarter. Total unit shipments grew 10% year-over-year with
growth in both commercial and consumer. Each segment outperformed the market. Total channel inventory remains
well within acceptable ranges. Personal Systems operating profit was $290 million or 3.5% of revenue, up 0.3 points
year-over-year, driven primarily by favorable mix, partially offset by competitive pricing.
Enterprise Group revenue was $6.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year or down 1% in constant currency, driven primarily
by declines in Technology Services, Storage and Business Critical Systems. Operating profit in the quarter was $961
million or 14.4% of revenue, flat sequentially and down 1.4 points year-over-year as a result of the continued
competitive pricing environment and increased investments, primarily in R&D.
By business, ISS revenue was $2.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, with strength in EMEA and APJ. Sequentially,
revenue declined on lower hyperscale mix after we completed shipping a large deal in the first quarter. Lower
hyperscale mix and good pricing discipline drove gross margins up sequentially again this quarter. While the server
market remains very competitive, we believe we are taking the right actions to improve our go-to-market, strengthen
our channel, and align our cost structure.
Technology Services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 5% year-over-year. TS revenue continues to be impacted by past
declines in hardware sales, but the strategy we have in place remains unchanged and the team is making progress.
Penetration rates were up year-over-year driven by Storage and Networking attach, and we're seeing strong growth in
our newer offerings like proactive care and data center care. Profitability in this business continues to be strong.
Networking performed well in the quarter, revenue was $658 million, up 6% year-over-year, with strength in switching
across all regions and we once again outgrew the Networking market leader. Storage results, however, were
disappointing. Revenue was down 6% versus the prior year period at $808 million. Converged storage declined 3%
year-over-year and 3PAR plus EVA plus XP also declined, but continued to outperform the market.
While it's clear we aren't alone in experiencing weakness in the storage market, we also have an opportunity to improve
execution, particularly in the U.S. We still expect converged storage to become greater than half of all storage revenue
later this year, but we expect Q2 results to pressure overall storage revenue for the full year.

Business Critical Systems revenue declined 14% year-over-year to $230 million as strength in mission critical x86
helped offset the continued impact from the UNIX declines.
Enterprise Services revenue was $5.7 billion, down 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued key account
runoff. By business, IT outsourcing revenue was $3.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year and Applications and Business
Services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 8% year-over-year. Operating profit for ES was $144 million, or 2.5% of
revenue, flat year-over-year. Sequentially operating margins were up 1.5 points driven by ongoing cost management
and continued improvement in our under-performing accounts.
We expect to see continued progress in both of these areas in the second half of the year, as well as better top line
trends as key account runoff tapers, driving a full-year operating profit margin within our outlook range of 3.5% to
4.5%. Although total signings were down year-over-year, strategic Enterprise Services signings were up double digits
once again and we saw encouraging improvement in win rates. Our trailing 12 month book-to-bill was slightly lower
sequentially as we exited Q2.
Signings can be lumpy, but we anticipate improvement in this metric during the second half of the year. Overall we're
making progress on our sales transformation, and are seeing a better mix of new logos, but we still have more work to
do to successfully pivot to a more proactive sales approach.
In Software, revenue was roughly flat over the prior-year period at $971 million with better license revenue due to
continued strength in our key focus areas of security and big data, offset by lower support revenue. License revenue
grew 8% year-over-year with strength in ArcSight, Fortify, Vertica and Autonomy. Support revenue declined 4%
year-over-year as past license revenue declines continued to create a headwind. Professional Services sales grew 1%
year-over-year driven by strength in security and big data. SaaS revenue grew 6% over the prior year period and we
had strong bookings growth in IT Management and Autonomy.
Operating profit was $186 million or 19.2% of revenue, up 0.6 points year-over-year primarily driven by continued
gross margin expansion in professional services, partially offset by increased investments in R&D.
We completed a small software acquisition in the quarter. Shunra provides network virtualization technology and had
no material impact on our financial results in Q2, and isn't expected to materially impact the full year.
HP Financial Services revenue was $867 million, down 2% year-over-year. Operating profit was $99 million, or 11.4%
of revenue. While revenue continues to be impacted by financing volume shortfalls from fiscal 2013, new financing
volume grew 12% year-over-year. The health of our portfolio of assets remains strong and return on equity was 18.2%.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, we had another strong quarter generating $3 billion in operating cash flow
and $2.3 billion in free cash flow. We continue to focus on working capital and brought our cash conversion cycle
down to 13 days in the quarter, helped by a favorable mix with strong Personal Systems revenue and the expansion of
our factoring program.
Consistent with our efforts to improve our payment terms with key partners that I've talked about in previous quarters,
we increased net utilization in our factoring program by approximately $750 million in the quarter. However, we
believe many of our customers would have taken advantage of early payment discounts, so we estimate the actual
benefit to cash flow to be approximately one to two days to our cash conversion cycle.
For the year we continue to expect some upside to our original cash flow forecast, as I talked about last quarter, driven
by working capital efficiencies. We further expect the expanded factoring program to provide some additional benefit.
In Q2, we accelerated our return to shareholders by repurchasing 26.7 million shares in the quarter and paid $298
million in dividends. In total we returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders in Q2 and we are still committed
to our plan to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends for
the full year. We improved our operating company net cash position by approximately $1 billion for the ninth quarter in
a row and ended Q2 with operating company net cash of $2.7 billion.

Now looking forward to Q3, in Printing, we'll continue to focus on placing value-added units and expanding our
innovative Ink, Laser and Graphics programs. We expect that toner will remain under pressure for the rest of the year.
In Personal Systems, we expect the market to remain challenging and that the upward pressure from higher component
costs may limit our ability to pursue upside deals as we focus on profitable growth. Also, don't forget about the Uttar
Pradesh deal from last year that will make for a tough revenue compare in Q3.
In EG, we have a strong team in place that is focused on aligning our cost structure, managing our margin profile, and
improving our go-to-market execution across the businesses while investing for long-term success. And yes, as I talked
about, we expect the ongoing actions we're taking to improve our cost structure and our underperforming accounts,
along with the tapering of revenue runoff, to result in better profitability in the second half of the year.
In Software, we expect to see continued traction in key growth areas like big data and security, while we invest in the
business and manage our portfolio's transition to SaaS.
Across all of our businesses, competing and winning in today's challenging environment requires lean organizations
with a focus on strong performance management. We're optimizing our workforce and re-engineering our business
processes to both build a strong operational foundation and create capacity for investments to drive future growth.
Through this ongoing focus, we've identified incremental opportunity as I have signaled in the past quarters, and we
now expect approximately 45,000 to 50,000 people to leave the company under our announced 2012 restructuring
program. This is up from our previous estimate of 34,000. We expect a total of approximately 41,000 people to leave
by the end of fiscal 2014 with the remainder in 2015. We expect this to create additional run rate savings in fiscal 2016
of approximately $1 billion per year on top of what we've previously laid out, although we expect some of this will be
reinvested back into the business.
In fiscal 2014, we expect approximately $0.02 to $0.03 of incremental savings, an estimated incremental charge of
approximately $500 million, and an additional cash flow impact of approximately $200 million in the second half of
fiscal 2014. We will provide further clarity on the specific FY 2015 impact to P&L and cash flow when we provide our
outlook for the next year at our Security Analyst Meeting in October. As we said, we won't do additional restructuring
at a corporate level after this program is complete. However, each business will continue to drive workforce
rebalancing and we'll account for those changes within the segment P&L.
With that context, we expect full year fiscal 2014 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.63
to $3.75. For fiscal 2014 Q3, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share in the range of $0.86 to $0.90. From
a GAAP perspective, we expect a full year GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.68 to $2.80,
and GAAP diluted net earnings per share for fiscal Q3 is expected to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.63.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Meg Cushing Whitman
Thank you, Cathie. Before we go to questions I'm sure you all noticed that earlier today the HP press release with
earnings went live before the appropriate time, and we are sorry about that and will make sure that that doesn't happen
again.

<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Yes. Thank you. I have two if I could. The first one, Meg, you're taking some incremental
cost out of the system with the additional head count targets. It clearly says that you're – it would seem to suggest that
you're disappointed in some areas. Where specifically is the head count coming out of in the system? Where are the
targets? And then I have a follow-up please.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yeah, sure. So you'll recall that this program goes back to FY 2012. We've actually
increased the number of people who will leave the company a couple of times during this program. And actually on
earlier calls we actually signaled that there might be more opportunity. And I'm actually not disappointed at all with
how we're doing. We just see more opportunities to lower our cost structure, streamline our operations, without
impairing our effectiveness. In fact, making us a more nimble and decisive company. The longer I've been here, I see
opportunities where we can become even better.
So that's the genesis of the program. It will be across almost all the business units and across all the geographies. And
particularly in some of the functional areas that sort of help the businesses grow. So listen, I'm not at all disappointed. I
think it's the natural course of what makes sense in a turnaround of this size and scale.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: The other thing that I'd add real quickly is just it's going to create more capacity to invest.
I think that's really important to HP. Because as Meg has talked many times, the turnaround and our success in this
turnaround is going be on the strength of the innovative products and solutions that we bring to market.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. On my follow up then if I could, I wanted to turn to the printing business. I was a
little surprised to hear you say the install base seems to be declining with the good unit placements that you had for the
last three to four quarters. It really speaks to the supplies. The Supplies I thought was disappointing this quarter, and it
sounds like you're saying it's going to continue to be under pressure. If you could just flesh out a little bit more some of
your comments on the printing business in particular. Thank you.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yeah, let me start with the comment about the installed base largely relates to laser
hardware and the softness in supplies largely relates to toner. Actually ink is doing reasonably well. This actually goes
back a number of years. You'll recall that we, for about seven years, didn't probably make the necessary product
innovations in terms of the next generation of these machines in terms of multi-function printers. And it's also
important, our managed print services business we were late to that market and we're catching up fast.
So we're going to place the right units. We now have the right products, not only for multi-function printers to direct
customers into the channel, but also importantly for managed print services. I think as Cathie said, we'll see some
softener in toner through the rest of the year and then I think we'll start to see more normal patterns. And I think Cathie
wants to add one thing to that.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: I think the absolute size of the installed base is one dimension but it's also the quality of
the installed base. So if we place a unit today that has a much higher usage like an Ink In the Office unit or Ink
Advantage unit, and that's replacing a unit that didn't have as high usage, we actually are doing exactly what we want to
do. So we've got be focused on the size of installed base as well as the quality.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Rob Binns>: Thanks for your question, Keith. If we could have the next question, please?

We have Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open, sir.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: I'm sorry. I wanted to follow-up on the last question in terms of the restructuring and
anticipation of this. It just strikes me as odd that you have a 2012 restructuring plan that is doing significant
incremental work force restructuring in 2015. My understanding originally was 27,000 was what was needed to

right-size the company. Then it went to 29,000 then it went to 34,000. And now it's going to 50,000. And to me, it feels
like a whole new restructuring effort and a whole new outlook on the business. And I can't help wondering why
something so significant has come up relatively suddenly.
Moreover, I'd like to get your input on your confidence for 2015 because clearly $1 billion in incremental savings is
significant and should be applauded. But is that a message that you're not as confident that you can grow EPS in 2015
without these workforce rebalancings? So in other words, do you think HP will grow in 2015? And is the reason for
this incremental workforce rebalancing because you've lost confidence, or you don't have as much confidence in the
company's ability to grow top line in 2015?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So, Toni, let me take that and I'll let Cathie talk about guidance, because we're not
actually going to give guidance today for 2015. But this actually has nothing to do with our confidence in the business.
This has to do with really now understanding the opportunities that we have to make this company better. You've got to
remember, this company was built over many years by acquisition, has five major business units, we sell through
150,000 VARs, we operate in 166 countries.
And as you look at our processes, as you look at how we go to market, as you look at things like sales ops and
marketing, and frictionless e-commerce, there are so many opportunities to improve this company. And we went after
the ones that were immediately obvious, but the longer I'm here and this management team is here, the more
opportunities we see, and we think that's goodness. That's goodness because it makes us easier for customers to do
business with. It makes it easier, frankly, for employees to get things done here. And by the way, has an added benefit
of making us lower cost, so we're better able to compete in a new world order.
But my view is, I've done a number of turnarounds in my career, not at this scale I will say, but they are always, you
see more opportunities the deeper that you get in. I'm actually quite excited about the opportunities it provides. And
Cathie said it well, it does give us the capacity to bring money to the bottom line, but frankly also invest in the things
that are going have this company grow in a sustainable way over the future.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Toni, I would add, we actually tried to signal this at the Security Analysts Meeting and
then on the earnings call last quarter, because we knew we were working feverishly to understand the re-engineering
possibilities and what kind of ramification that would have for the head count that we need to run this company. And
really what I view us doing now is just finally getting to the point of quantifying for you all what that looks like. But it's
been work that's been ongoing since last year.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: I'll just say, in terms of revenue. I think the good news is, we've seen revenue
stabilization in the last three quarters. It wasn't that long ago where this company was declining 7%, 6%, 9%
quarter-over-quarter, and we've had three quarters of basically flat growth. To me that's encouraging, because you've
got to stabilize before you can grow. And you can see the improvement in virtually all the different businesses.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks for the question, Toni. Next question, please.
Operator
We have Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Given Services signings are coming in slower than expected, is this an area where it
makes sense to acquire for growth? And then just as a follow-up to that, full-year Services margin guidance requires
you to exit the year around 6%. Cathie, can you just talk in more detail around where that meaningful improvement
comes from over the next couple of quarters?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Let me speak to the signings and the revenue growth. I think as we said at SAM and as
we said quarter-over-quarter, we're in the early innings of the sales transition to drive a much more proactive sales
approach. And while total signings were down a bit year-over-year, the places that we want to grow, what we call
strategic Enterprise Services signings, were up double digits once again and we saw a very encouraging improvement

in win rates, and actually signed over 200 new logos which is actually a big turnaround for the sales organization over
there.
So we've got more work to do, but I'm feeling confident that we're pivoting the sales organization to be more proactive,
and I think we're being invited to a lot more bids, if you will, than we had in the past. Because I'm seeing it every day,
customers are much more confident in HP and much more confident in our Services business.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And, Katy, let me address the margin question. We have made good progress in
improving both our under-performing accounts as well as really realizing good savings out of productivity initiatives,
and we expect that this progress will continue in both of these areas throughout fiscal 2014. And then if you couple that
with better top line trends, we do expect that we will operate – have operating profit margins in the 3.5% to 4.5% for
the year.
Again, we've got to continue to execute well. We've got to take advantage of the restructuring that we – the previous
restructuring that, by the way, is a bit accelerating as well as this incremental program. But we are starting to get labor
out of some of the protected geos, which tend to be higher cost. And we're also focused not just on labor savings but
also on non-labor savings that come from better efficiency across processes, consolidating service centers, looking at
data center automation. All of which that will help us reach these margins of 3.5% to 4.5%.
<A - Rob Binns>: Thanks, Katy. Next question, please.

We have Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Hi. I've got to just ask you to clarify your answer to Toni's question, because with you hitting
$0.40 in run rate savings by 2016, with such a big increase in the head count reductions, I mean, what are we supposed
to do here? I mean, are we supposed to raise our out-year numbers? We can't just wait for the analyst day. We kind of
need to know what you guys are thinking. The $0.40 in 2016 kind of means we have to raise our estimates unless
something really changes with the top line. So I know you want us to wait for the analyst day, but a lot of us have got to
make a decision by tomorrow. So we really need some clarity there.
And then I just would also like to know on the free cash flow side your preference for buybacks versus acquisitions at
this point of outperformance. Thank you.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Ben, I'm not exactly sure how to answer that question. You know that we don't
provide guidance for the future until we get to our Security Analyst Meeting. And that's really no different than what
we've ever done. What I will say is that the gross savings of $1 billion is incremental to the $3.5 billion to $4 billion
that we announced for the 34,000. Those are gross savings. There is a cost to migrate some of that work. And so those
are not the net savings. In fiscal 2014, we do expect that the net savings from this incremental program is $0.02 to
$0.03. And stay tuned for fiscal 2015's update at the Security Analyst Meeting.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Great.

We have Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I just have a question on the PC side. You've had, you
seen nice growth the last two quarters in a row, especially on the commercial side. Could you maybe just talk about
how much of that growth you think is run by Windows XP going end of life versus maybe more other factors in play as
you go through the rest of the year?

Page 12 of 16
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yeah, I mean, for the market overall, we're seeing some good signs of stabilization,
particularly in commercial PCs, which was up 2% year-over-year. And by the way, there's some strength in EMEA, flat
year-over-year for the first time in seven quarters. So the market's definitely stabilizing. I think we are benefiting from
the migration from XP to Windows. We saw that in spades in Japan. We had a very, very strong quarter in Japan as that
migration took place. We actually think that migration's going to extend for some period of time, maybe another 12 to
18 months. But we also see some momentum in what I would call a long overdue PC refresh. And frankly the fact that
companies are realizing there's a need for a productivity tool that's different than just a tablet.
So listen, I think we expect over time this is still to be a low growth to slightly negative growth category. But I think we
actually have a bit of wind at our backs over the next year to 18 months.
I also actually have to call out credit to our team, our leadership team led by Dion Weisler. They have focused on
profitable growth, creating incredibly compelling products, very crisp market segmentation, leveraging our distribution
strength in commercial and go to market and really focusing on only doing profitable growth, not share for share's sake.
So it's a combination of all those things, I think.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: That's helpful. Let me just follow-up on the cost-cutting initiative that you're expanding now
this quarter. What's the comfort level that this is the final number and there shouldn't be another expansion for this?
Because since you started in May of 2012, this number has close to doubled in terms of head count, so maybe just start
with the comfort that this is it. And secondly, how does this play out for the morale of the company given the head
count cuts seem to almost accelerate a little bit every six months?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Listen, I don't anticipate an additional program. And after the end of this program,
obviously we are in the process of building productivity into the HP DNA, into our business unit and function DNA.
And so that productivity, that ever ongoing quest for efficiency, will be borne by the P&L of each of these different
business units.
But again, I would just say that this company had been through a lot: the acquisition of Compaq, the acquisition of
EDS, 11 to 20 software acquisitions, a lot of change and part of what we're doing is we are integrating, we're
streamlining, we're putting in new ERP programs, we're investing in systems and technology to automate processes that
frankly had not been done in a while. And so I actually think this is good news that we are continuing to take advantage
of the opportunities that we see. But what I will tell you is, I don't anticipate an additional program after this.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And let me address Ben's – the second part of Ben's question. I apologize, I didn't catch
that one. So Ben, I think your question was around capital allocation and how are we thinking about that. We are still
committed to the capital allocation approach that we outlined at our Security Analyst Meeting, which means that
between dividends and share repurchases we do anticipate returning at least 50% of our free cash flow to investors in
fiscal 2014, and we will see the timing of the share repurchase activity levels will vary quarter-to-quarter. But I think
it's really important that given the attractiveness of the valuation of HP shares as well as our anticipated cash flow
generation levels, our approach to capital allocation will have a bias towards share repurchases.
When we then shift to, kind of, what about M&A, as we've talked about, we will evaluate any M&A using a returns
based framework, and any of the near-term considerations in terms of what types of things we might be interested in,
are absolutely going to be in our strategic focus areas such as cloud, security and big data.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: And, Amit, let me answer your question about morale. So listen, no company likes to
decrease the workforce, and we recognize that it is difficult for employees. What I will tell you is, I think our
employees live it every single day, the environment that we're in. Our employees know that there's ways we can be
more efficient. They are in some ways the biggest source of ideas on what we can do differently.
So I think everyone understands the turnaround we're in, everyone understand the market realities, everyone
understands the need to create financial capacity to invest in innovation which will be our point of difference and
making sure that we have the right sales force coverage in every geography. So I don't think anyone likes this, but I
think actually we've done a good job of explaining where we are in the turnaround, what the strategy is, and what's

We have Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to get a little more detail on the pause in the Storage business. You
did give us some detail, but I guess I was a little surprised to hear that the converged piece actually saw some
deceleration. So maybe some more detail on, do you think you're losing share or do you think there's something more
systemic that's going on in the industry right now? Thanks.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So we actually think we'll gain a point of storage in this market. I think what's going
on here, and listen, I'm not sure anyone has total clarity on this. But as I have talked to customers, here's what I've
learned and I've talked to our sales team, is effectively, there's an efficiency thing going on here around compression
and thin provisioning. And then of course, flash is on the horizon in a much more important way than it has been in the
past. And then what's interesting is, the high end, you can now get high-end performance for mid-tier pricing.
And so there's I think a lot of choices now in front of storage buyers, whether it's small- to medium-size to the big
enterprises. So my sense of the situation is, there's a pause, trying to figure out what the right thing to do is, and that
this market will come back in the second half. Obviously we have to wait to see that happen, but that is what most of
our customers and our partners are telling me. And the good news is, we are completely perfectly positioned for where
this market is going. And 3PAR is the exact right product, the flash product is exactly the right product, and we are – I
think we're really well-positioned for where the market is going.
Obviously no one knows exactly what's going to happen. If the market doesn't rebound in the next half then there's
another situation that we're facing, but I don't actually think that's the case. And again, we'll gain probably a point of
share in this calendar quarter.

We have Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe back to the M&A question. Given the stronger
cash flow outlook that you expect this year, I'm just curious how that impacts the appetite to make larger acquisitions
than what you previously discussed. I think you said in the past, small- to medium-size. But with the cash flow
continuing to outperform, how should we think about deal size now? Thanks.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Well, first and foremost, I'll just reiterate what I've said, is we expect to be returns
focused in our approach to acquisition. And as I said before, we don't feel the need for large transformative
acquisitions. We haven't put a specific size range or limits on this but I'd say they are most likely in the range from the
small, low hundreds of millions to mid-size deals. And will largely be in the area of the strategic focus for HP, which
would be largely cloud, security, big data that we think will advance our positions in those businesses.

We have Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you for the question. And again on the restructuring, I guess for Meg, maybe if I
ask the question this way, has your revenue visibility for this business over the medium term or the growth outlook that
you've had, whatever that might have been in any way significantly changed in the past six months that may have
prompted some of this incremental restructuring you are pursuing?
And then linked to that, previously you made it very clear both you and Cathie that you were going to reinvest in a
large part of the initial round of savings. Would the retention of savings be significantly higher on this next round or are
you at this stage still evaluating that?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yeah, so I'll tell you my outlook has actually not changed in terms of where we are in
the turnaround, what my view is of the revenue trajectory. We obviously live in a market that's shifting at warp speed.
This is the fastest market shift I've seen in my career and by the way you knew I grew up mostly in the consumer space,
which tends to move faster than the enterprise space.
I would actually say I'm feeling more confident because we have seen a stabilization of revenue. The very high single
digit declines are over. We've had three quarters of pretty good stabilization and I really like our product road map.
Many folks who have been around HP for a – many, many years have said this is the best product lineup we've had in a
decade. So I feel confident in it.
What I will say is that we need to run this company more efficiently, not only for the benefit of cost, which is good
because then we can reinvest in things that will make us strongly but frankly in terms of ease of doing business, ease of
working here and faster more nimble decision making. We're going to have to be quicker and faster and more nimble to
compete in this new world order and by the way, having a lower cost structure is an added benefit to that.
Cathie, do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: No, I think you're exactly right.

We have Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. I have a question on the printing segment. Even excluding the end tailwind
you discussed, your operating margin strength was fairly substantial given a 6% decline in supplies. Can you give us a
bit more detail on the components of the printing margins and particularly what's occurring within hardware margins? I
understand you have more ink mix on the supplies side. But what's going on within hardware margins and what do you
view as sustainable outside of the yen impact?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Thanks, Bill. So the increase in margins year-over-year are 3.6 points. The currency is
about 1.5 points and then the rest is really strong cost management and it's across the portfolio. It's not a hardware
comment versus a supplies comment. It is a comment about making sure that we've got the right cost structure. And
then offsetting that a little bit is unfavorable mix but it's really important that we step back a bit and we talked about it
at the Security Analyst Meeting in October the fact that we expected from IPG $0.07 to $0.11 of incremental EPS and
that was before incremental investment that we talked about at the time of it being $0.12 across the company and now
we've upped it to $0.14. So we've got to stay – we've got to remain focused on investing for the long term in this
business. That means placing units. That means continuing to invest in R&D.
We think there's a real opportunity to increase the amount of print specialists across the world. So we're focused on
doing that. And it's also really exploiting these new business models, Ink Advantage, Ink In the Office, our
multi-function printer lineup and our managed print services. Those are all really important points that we've got to stay
focused on.

And then finally I'd say that we've got to continue to be very competitive. The market is tough. We've got Japanese
competitors who have an even bigger war chest as a result of the yen depreciation. And so we will be more aggressive
where we need to be.
<A - Rob Binns>: Thanks, Bill for the question. Next one, please?

We have Rod Hall with JPMorgan.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you guys if you could talk a little
about the R&D increase. I know you gave a little bit of color, but could you give us a little bit more color in that area?
What you're increasing, what you're focusing on with the additional R&D.
And then I know this question's been asked a bunch of times, but the $0.02 to $0.03 that you expect to realize in net
savings here in the last part of this year, can you talk to us about the phasing of the savings over the period? Is most of
that $0.02, $0.03 coming in fiscal Q4, or is it coming linearly across the two quarters? Just help us understand how
that's ramping through the back end of the year? Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Okay. So let me start with that last question. Those $0.02 to $0.03, there's a little bit that
happens in Q3 and a little bit that happens in Q4. If you actually go and look at the guidance that we provided for EPS,
the midpoint would suggest that – and we've got it flat sequentially – normal seasonality would suggest it would be
down about a point. The restructuring savings are actually bringing it to being flat sequentially. So that will give you a
little indication of what's going on from a Q3 perspective. And I'm sorry I've lost track of your first question. R&D,
sorry.
In terms of R&D, the increase in R&D year-over-year is actually very broad-based. Just about every business that we
have is increasing R&D on a year-over-year basis. Obviously it's focused in strategic areas. cloud, big data, security,
page-wide array, 3D printing, kind of across the board we're increasing R&D. So it's really not a specific comment for a
particular business.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Okay.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: I'd just say that actually we've increased R&D in Servers. We love our road map. We
love the opportunities there, and we're pretty excited about some of the innovation that's coming down the pike there.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Yeah, so we've got R&D increases in EG. In Storage – within that, we've got Storage,
we've got industry standard servers. So it's really broad-based that we're making incremental R&D investments
year-over-year.
<A - Rob Binns>: Thanks for that one, Rod. One final question, please.
Operator
We have Jim Suva with Citigroup.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you very much. Meg, when you think about how a lot of things have changed in the industry
on the server side, you've got Lenovo purchasing the IBM x86 series, it seems like there's a lot of disruption going on
and an opportunity for HP to gain share in Servers, as we're seeing a lot of CTOs kind of confused and not sure how
that will all pan out. Can you help us confirm if indeed you expect to gain some shift? Not to be blunt, it would kind of
seem like a blatant missed execution step if HP doesn't take advantage of this in the very near term as an opportunity.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So we're focused on this. And there's some early signs that show that we're making
some progress. And as we've seen an increase in win rates attributable almost directly to the uncertainty in the

marketplace around the IBM business moving to Lenovo, and we're building pipelines for future incremental deals. So
good win rates, good pipeline. Feeling good about this. It's a longer sales cycle than you'd think, particularly in blades
and some of these other areas. This takes a bit of time, but I think we have got the sales team focused on this. They're
pretty excited about it. It's an open door that we're running through.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks for that, Jim, and with that, I think we'll conclude the questions.
Meg Cushing Whitman
Great, thank you very much for joining us today.
Catherine A. Lesjak
Thank you.
