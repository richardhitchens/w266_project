Merrill A. Miller, Jr.
Thank you, Loren. Earlier today, National Oilwell Varco announced first quarter 2013 earnings of $1.17 per share on
revenues of $5.31 billion. Included in this is a pre-tax charge of $73 million for transaction expenses and the Venezuela
Bolívar devaluation. Excluding these charges, earnings were $533 million or $1.29 per fully diluted share. Operating
profit for the quarter was $816 million or 15.4% of sales.
Additionally, we announced new capital equipment orders of $3.04 billion, bringing our backlog to a record of $12.9
billion, signifying the industry's continued preference for National Oilwell Varco products. The total exceeds our
record backlog in Q3 2008 by over $1 billion.
I would like to thank all of our customers for their continued confidence in National Oilwell Varco and to all of our
63,000 employees worldwide for their excellent efforts to meet our customers' expectations.
I would also like to welcome all of the former Robbins & Myers employees to the National Oilwell Varco family.
Now, I will turn the call over to Clay and Jeremy to expand on our results. Clay?
Clay C. Williams
Thank you, Pete. National Oilwell Varco faced a challenging quarter in the first quarter. They came in a little softer
than we expected. Despite a choppy market in North America, broadly speaking, we remain bullish on demand for
offshore rigs, for floating production systems and for products and services we sell into international land markets
including fledgling unconventional shale developments.
We had a terrific quarter for new orders for our Rig Technology segment and expect more in the second quarter.
However, we're very cautious about North America and continue to see headwinds here as pricing and volumes remain
under pressure and as demand for pressure pumping and drilling equipment remains weak and operators deferred
expenditures for consumables.
Rig Technology capital equipment orders totaled $3 billion, our second highest quarterly total ever. We received orders
for 17 drilling equipment packages for jackup rigs and eight drilling equipment packages for floating rigs, including
three for Brazil in the first quarter. We also had a significant increase in orders for FPSO equipment.
Our outlook for the second quarter orders remain very strong as well, as we expect even more FPSO orders plus
another great quarter for jackups. There also remained a half dozen floating rigs for Brazil that we have not yet booked
as we await down payments for these, and we see rising interest in land rigs for international markets as new modern
rig designs are steadily gaining acceptance overseas.
Through the first quarter, our very capable teams continued to manage their businesses for the long haul while keeping
an eye on our cost structures in view of near-term softness. It is an unusual time. We have some operations facing
declining backlogs and P&L pressures brought on by low volumes. Others face the opposite problem; they're
overflowing with work and losing efficiency due to the congestion and expansion. Our leaders are doing the heavy
lifting required to reallocate resources, expand capacity in certain areas, right size others, and integrate many new
acquisitions, making good progress on a solid foundation for future NOV earnings growth. And by solid foundation for
future earnings growth, I specifically mean we are investing in a combination of CapEx and acquisition capital to
further distance ourselves from our competition.
Fundamentally, we believe that leading market positions in technology, the largest, most economically efficient
capacity within a particular sector and a deep organizational commitment to the highest levels of service to our
customers is a winning formula. That is the vision they and we pursue daily.

Since the beginning of 2009, we have generated $6.9 billion in cash from operations and raised $3.4 billion in debt
financing, totaling $10.3 billion in capital generated or raised. We have paid $1.1 billion or 11% to our shareholders in
dividends, invested $1.7 billion or 17% internally in capital expenditures and invested $7.4 billion or 72% in
acquisitions.
The largest of our acquisitions since 2009 is Robbins & Myers; we finally closed in the first quarter. It strengthened our
position in a number of key technologies, progressing cavity pumps, flow iron, artificial lift and downhole drilling
motors, just to name a few.
This acquisition makes NOV the largest provider worldwide of enabling technologies required for the drilling and
completion of horizontal wells and caps a very busy four year period that saw us close 51 acquisitions.
We are excited about this aggregate addition of new businesses to NOV, including the talented teams that have joined
our own. We have expanded our substantial offering into the growing floating production systems world, strengthened
our market leading oilfield distribution franchise, added leading franchises in the supply of technology into
unconventional shale developments, and strengthened our offering into new technologies such as composite tubulars –
mostly businesses that we were in before, it's just that now we are bigger and stronger and more capable.
In the near term, however, we continue to face market headwinds. All three segments saw sales fall from the fourth
quarter as U.S. rig counts drifted down another 3% sequentially and Canadian spending on consumables and production
equipment declined even in the face of seasonal increases in rig activity. North America weighed most heavily on
NOV's activity driven businesses, Petroleum Services & Supplies and Distribution & Transmission, with 57% and 83%
of sales mix coming from North America, respectively. Sales were down in the low single digit range for both, at high
decrementals, due to a combination of price discounting and lower volumes which diminish margins.
The Rig Technology segment was not immune from North America either, as sales of drilling, wireline and stimulation
equipment into North America remained low and left our infrastructure that these products come from underabsorbed.
Broadly speaking, demand across North America is soft and price pressures for products and services continues to
intensify. Gradually slowing North American rig count and scattered reports of falling land rig day rates has subdued
spending. Even high growth regions like the Permian and the Eagle Ford are becoming more competitive as labor and
assets from competitors slowly migrate into these regions.
However, overseas, the picture is much better. Demand is up, and we are expanding in places like Abu Dhabi, Oman,
Dubai, South Africa, Russia, Angola, Brazil and Mexico. Continued deepwater development, application of horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracture stimulation to conventional prospects and unconventional shale technologies will
provide the basis for future growth overseas and NOV is exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on these
opportunities.
Our Rig Technology segment is working through an extraordinarily busy delivery schedule now with offshore rigs tied
to faster whole construction schedules in shipyards and much higher BOP demand post-Macondo. Think replacement
BOPs for old stacks that could not be recertified, second BOPs on rigs and fleet-shared BOP demand, all up sharply
since 2010.
To handle the volumes, we have had added a fifth and a sixth and now a seventh subsea stack rig-up pad in the past
couple of years, along with many new machine tools, to our primary pressure control product plant. The expansion
caused us to have to rearrange what we make where, as we poured concrete, and to temporarily increase outsourcing,
which has been disruptive, but necessary, to meet the needs of our customers. To put it in perspective, we will nearly
double output from our Houston BOP manufacturing plant in 2013. Shipments are expected to be up 83% year-on-year.
This expansion and tight delivery scheduling affected the first quarter in two ways. First, higher overtime, freight and
expediting costs drove unfavorable manufacturing variances for a couple of major components that are included in
most rig projects. A cost roll across these, along with drawworks, mud pumps, late in the first quarter, together with
higher expediting and I&C costs, resulted in a net $32 million in aggregate costs being pushed through our rig
construction projects. All of this was booked in the first quarter pursuant to our percentage of completion accounting on
projects.

Second, discrete start-up costs around this expansion, along with start-up costs associated with a huge new flexible pipe
plant in Brazil, the expansion of our Bammel Road aftermarket facility, a top drive manufacturing facility and other
build-outs, added an estimated $10 million in start-up costs this quarter, related to the hiring and training new
workforces and operational disruptions. These will continue for a couple of more quarters, but excluding these, as well
as the effects of the adverse cost roll, margins for Rig Technology would have been in the mid 22% range, consistent
with the fourth quarter of last year.
I know of no better equipment manufacturing team in the world than our professionals who manage this business. They
are always working diligently to reduce costs. For instance, we have concrete steps underway that will reduce BOP
costs, including design changes for ease of manufacturing and new transportation logistics to cut costs. Elsewhere, we
are moving other products to lower cost manufacturing geographies in Asia and Latin America.
Finally, Rig Technology first quarter margins were also affected by double-digit sequential declines in aftermarket
spares and services, following a very busy Q4 last year. We see this as a temporary pause in a strong long-term growth
trajectory. In fact, year-over-year aftermarket spares and services for the group increased 11%, benefiting from the
growing installed base of NOV rig equipment, particularly in the offshore, and recent expansion of our aftermarket
infrastructure through build outs and acquisitions.
With that, let me turn it over to Jeremy.
Jeremy D. Thigpen
Thanks, Clay. National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $1.17 per fully diluted share in its first quarter of 2013 on
$5.3 billion in revenues. Excluding $73 million in pre-tax transaction and devaluation charges, first quarter 2013
earnings were $1.29 per fully diluted share. That's down 20% -- or $0.20 per share or 13% from the fourth quarter of
2012, and down $0.15 per share or 10% from the first quarter of 2012.
Sales of $5.3 billion declined 7% sequentially, but grew 23% year-over-year, despite the fact that the average U.S. rig
count declined by almost 12% from Q1 2012, and the worldwide rig count dropped over 5% during that same period.
Excluding transaction charges from all periods, operating profit for the quarter was $816 million, down 14%
sequentially and down 7% from the first quarter of last year.
Operating margins on this basis were 15.4% for the first quarter of 2013, compared to 16.8% for the fourth quarter of
2012, and 20.5% for the first quarter of last year. Although the rig count in the U.S. continued to decline and margins
for the quarter were somewhat lower than we had initially hoped, we're proud of the work that was done in the first
quarter of 2013 and we remain extremely excited about the future prospects for the company.
Turning to our segment operating results, the Rig Technology group generated revenues of $2.6 billion in the first
quarter, down 9% sequentially, but up 16% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Operating profit for the segment was
$557 million and operating margins were 21.2%, down 120 basis points from the prior quarter and 320 basis points
from the first quarter of 2012.
As you will remember from the Q4 conference call, we indicated that we expected Rig Tech revenues to decline in the
10% range following flush year-end shipments and very little demand for pressure pumping and coiled tubing
equipment in the U.S.
As expected, revenues from backlog were down 10% sequentially. And revenues from our pressure pumping and coiled
tubing equipment businesses were down 46% and 41% respectively. As well, service firms continue to utilize existing
assets and were reluctant to send equipment in for repairs.
Aftermarket revenues also decreased by 12% sequentially with higher revenues from training and installation and
commissioning and relatively flat spare part sales, being more than offset by declines in repair and service revenues,
which posted exceptionally strong fourth quarter results.

Overall, non-backlog revenues declined 6% sequentially. Still we were pleased to receive a partial quarter's
contribution from the Robbins & Meyers acquisition, which added $11 million of incremental revenues to Rig Tech.
And we were excited to see some material improvement out of our FPSO business, which grew revenues 22%
sequentially.
You will also remember from the Q4 conference call that we stated that margins would be challenged to move
meaningfully from the 22.4% that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2012 because of three issues. First, a relatively soft
North American land environment, which curtailed capital spending for new well stimulation equipment, which by the
way, represented 16% of total Rig Tech revenues in Q4 and produces margins that are accretive to overall Rig Tech
margins.
Second, a growing percentage of FPSO related revenue, which generates margins that are currently dilutive to overall
Rig Tech margins. And third, incremental expenses associated with longer-term strategic growth initiatives and
capacity expansion.
Well, issues one and two, which I'll describe as product mix, impacted us about as expected, with revenues from well
intervention and stimulation equipment declining overall 39% sequentially and FPSO related revenues increasing 22%
over that same period. This shift in mix is a current drag on Rig Tech margins, but we believe it to be a transient issue.
Demand for complete frac spread and coiled tubing units will return in the U.S. and we remain convinced that other
countries around the world will ultimately require our technology to access and benefit from their own shale reserves.
We also believe that FPSO margins will increase with both volume and our continued migration from a project to a
product focus. It's important to note that the incremental flow through on the 22% sequential increase in this group was
56%. So while we're not where we want to be yet, we feel confident that we're heading in the right direction.
Issue three, which I'll describe as capacity expansion, had a greater impact on us than we anticipated. As Clay
mentioned, we knew that we would incur some additional expense associated with the startup of new facilities.
However, $10 million was a bit higher than we expected.
And it is now clear that we did not fully appreciate the incremental costs tied to the expansion of some of our existing
facilities, especially our Houston BOP manufacturing plant, which, along with increases in a couple of other major
components and higher expediting and I&C costs, resulted in the $32 million increase in costs in Q1. But much like
product mix, we also believe this to be a transient issue, as many of our expansion projects will be completed this year,
enabling us to replace startup costs with efficiency gains. However, until those projects are completed, we are sticking
with our previous guidance for Rig Tech margins to remain in the 22% to 23% range for most of this year.
Now let's transition to our backlog. As evidenced by the $3 billion in new orders, demand for our technology remains
very strong. For the quarter, we booked eight drill ships and 17 jackups. We also had a solid quarter of FPSO related
orders. And while the overall sentiment for the new land rigs and pressure pumping and coiled tubing equipment in the
U.S. seems somewhat muted, we were encouraged by the fact that we still managed to sell several complete land rigs
into the U.S. market, as well as some disparate pieces of equipment to upgrade our customers' existing fleets. We also
managed to increase our new order booking for well stimulation equipment by 10% sequentially.
All of these new orders were partly offset by revenues out of backlog of almost $2 billion and led to a record quarter
ending backlog of $12.9 billion, up 9% sequentially, and up 25% year-over-year. Of the total backlog, approximately
92% of this is offshore, and 92% of this is destined for international markets. We expect for almost $2 billion of
revenue to flow out of backlog in the second quarter of 2013, and an additional $3.7 billion to flow out over Q3 and
Q4.
Looking into the second quarter of 2013, we expect for orders for new drilling equipment packages for both drill ships
and jackups to remain strong. We also anticipate a strong bookings quarter for our FPSO equipment, and we continue
to see strong demand for new land rigs in Latin America and the Middle East that could materialize into orders in the
quarter.

As of now, we are planning for Rig Technology revenues to increase in the low single-digit percentage range as
continued declines in our pressure pumping and coiled tubing equipment businesses will be more than offset by a full
quarter of contribution from Robbins & Myers and continued growth in our offshore and aftermarket businesses.
Speaking of aftermarket, it's important to remember that the first floaters constructed this cycle are turning five years
old this year, which means that they will be returning to the shipyards for their five-year surveys. While in the
shipyards, drillers will use this time to perform major maintenance and upgrade activities and NOV will be there to
help. In fact, we're uniquely positioned to support our customers during this time as we have been actively deploying
capital into facilities and inventory and investing heavily in our service technicians to make sure that we can meet the
needs of our customers as their rigs come in for their surveys.
We've also been working on the front end to understand our customers' various requirements, such that we can make
the equipment and the personnel available as needed by our customers and compress as much as possible the time that
their vessels are in the yards.
We will also see aftermarket gains associated with the recent acquisition of Robbins & Myers, which brought us a
larger installed base of land BOPs, as well as the service infrastructure to repair, test and certify existing equipment.
Needless to say, we're excited about the aftermarket prospects.
The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment posted revenues of $1.7 billion, which was down 4% sequentially and
essentially flat year-over-year. Operating profit declined 12% sequentially to $311 million and operating margins were
18.3%, down 180 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2012 and down 450 basis points from the first quarter of last
year. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, the $69 million revenue decline carried 64% decremental operating
leverage.
As we mentioned on the Q4 call, because we were entering the year with diminished backlogs and a U.S. customer
base that seemed reluctant to release orders, we expected PS&S segment sales to decline in the low to mid single-digit
percentage range and for operating margins to tick down into the high teens.
We also said that we were hopeful that the U.S. rig count would remain relatively flat through most of Q1 and actually
start to improve as we entered Q2, and that the winter drilling season in Canada, which got off to a late start, would last
a little longer than normal.
Unfortunately, the average U.S. rig count declined an additional 3% sequentially, and in Canada, spring breakup came
earlier than anticipated. As a result, revenues from PS&S, excluding the $50 million contribution from Robbins &
Myers in the first quarter, actually declined by almost 7% sequentially, with every business, with a notable exception of
fiberglass pipe, which benefited from a full quarter's contribution from the Fiberspar acquisition, experiencing a
decline.
While the lack of activity in the U.S. and Canada was somewhat discouraging, the group continues to benefit from our
recent investments in the international arena. Over the past few years, we have built new and/or added to existing
manufacturing capacity across all of our PS&S businesses. With new downhole manufacturing capacity in Brazil, the
UAE and Singapore, new Grant Prideco drill pipe manufacturing and Tuboscope inspection and coating facilities in
both Mexico and the UAE and new fiberglass pipe manufacturing facilities in Oman and Brazil, just to name a few.
These investments have enabled us to move product, service and people closer to our customers and the final point of
conception, and are enabling us to capture a larger share of key markets.
As we enter the second quarter of 2013, we expect PS&S segment sales to be relatively flat as the negative impact of
spring break-up in Canada should be offset by a full quarter of contribution from Robbins & Myers and continued
growth in international markets. And although we cut costs, including reductions in force and facility consolidations, in
a number of our businesses in Q1, we are currently forecasting margins for the segment to tick down a bit more as
mounting pricing pressures on several products, under absorption in a number of our facilities and incremental
expenses associated with both rightsizing our existing businesses and integrating recently acquired companies will all
put pressure on our margins in the near term.

Still, we are excited about the future prospects for this segment. Our international business remains strong. Our U.S.
customers seem to be more optimistic, and candidly, even if the U.S. rig count remains in the 1750 range for the
foreseeable future, our customers will ultimately consume their inventories and begin placing more orders for more of
our products and services. And when they do, it's important to remember that the flow through on that incremental
revenue in this segment is usually north of 35%.
The Distribution & Transmission segment posted revenues of $1.2 billion, down 3% sequentially, but up 118% as
compared to Q1 of last year, due largely to the acquisitions of Wilson and CE Franklin in mid-2012. Operating profit
declined 17% sequentially to $65 million, but improved 51% as compared to Q1 of 2012. And operating margins
declined to 5.3%, which represented a 90 basis point drop from Q4 2012.
On the Q4 call, we indicated that revenues within the D&T segment should move up in the low single-digit percentage
range at slightly lower margins. However, even with the $49 million contribution from Robbins & Myers in the quarter,
the 3% sequential decline in the U.S. rig count, coupled with a shortened winter drilling season, led to the shortfall
against expectations. It's important to remember that 83% of this segment's revenues are generated in the U.S. and
Canada.
Looking into the second quarter of 2013, we expect Distribution & Transmission group revenues to be relatively flat, as
the negative impact of spring break-up in Canada should be offset by a full quarter of contributions from Robbins &
Myers. And we are currently forecasting flat to down margins as we battle pricing pressures and incur incremental
costs associated with rightsizing existing businesses and integrating recently acquired companies.
On the topic of integration, the group has done an exceptional job of combining NOV's legacy Distribution group with
both Wilson and CE Franklin. At this point, we believe that we have captured most of the low hanging fruit. We have
reorganized the team, consolidated over 20 facilities in the U.S. and Canada, aligned pricing with key customer
accounts, leveraged spending with key suppliers, and rolled out a field level incentive plan to reward margin
enhancement.
We're now down to the heavy lifting, which includes implementing a common ERP platform across the business and
consolidating our Houston area facilities into a single building. The group intends to begin the ERP implementation in
Q4, and is planning to relocate into the new Houston facility in Q3. Once completed, both of these initiatives will result
in margin expansion for the segment.
So as we review the first quarter for all of NOV, I think that it would be fair to say that we were disappointed that the
U.S. market experienced yet another drop, that the winter drilling season in Canada was shorter than hoped, and that
the cost on some our products resulted in a re-baselining of projects that negatively impacted our Rig Tech margins to
the tune of 122 basis points.
However, we feel really good about our overall Q1 performance, our market position, and our industry leading
margins. And we remain as bullish as ever on the growth prospects for each of our three operating segments.
In Rig Tech, we continue to see strong demand for onshore – offshore drilling equipment packages, both floaters and
jackups. We are encouraged by the solid sequential growth with high flow through in our offshore floating production
equipment business. Despite a challenging market, we continue to see U.S. land drillers upgrading their respective
fleets, and we are starting to see far more interest for new land rigs in the Middle East and Latin America. We know
that orders for complete frac spreads will ultimately return and we will be even better positioned than before due to our
2012 acquisition of Enerflow. And perhaps most importantly, we know that our aftermarket business will continue to
grow as we deliver more and more rigs to the marketplace.
In PS&S, once our U.S.-based customers work through their inventories, we believe that our recent acquisitions of
companies like Robbins & Meyers and Fiberspar, coupled with our expansion of capacity in international markets, will
lead to very nice growth with tremendous flow through. And in D&T, we're excited about the margin enhancement that
will result from the integration initiatives that are currently underway within our NOV Wilson Distribution group and
our Mono, Moyno artificial lift and industrial pump group.

points sequentially due to all of the reasons already discussed. SG&A increased $15 million sequentially due to the full
quarter effect of the four acquisitions that we closed in the fourth quarter of last year, plus a partial quarter of Robbins
& Myers.
Overall, SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.9% in Q1 as compared to 8% in Q4 and 9.1% in Q1 of last year.
Transaction costs primarily related to the Robbins & Myers acquisition and Venezuela currency devaluation charges
combined for $73 million in pre-tax costs.
Interest expense rose $7 million to $28 million, reflecting a full quarter of interest expense on the $3 billion in bonds
that were issued in mid November of last year. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV was $19 million. This was up $4
million sequentially due to improved product mix and an end of your credit from our billet supplier. We expect for
income from the JV to decline in Q2 as demand for drill pipe, and therefore the green tube, in the U.S. is limited.
Other expense decreased $15 million from Q4 to $13 million, due to lower FX expense and lower bank charges. And
the effective tax rate for the first quarter was 30.9%, which was lower than our historical and expected rate of 32%, due
to a higher mix of overseas income at lower rates and higher U.S. manufacturing deductions.
Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $117 million in the first quarter,
down $10 million sequentially. Depreciation and amortization was $174 million, up $8 million from the fourth quarter.
And EBITDA, excluding transaction charges, was $1 billion, marking the sixth consecutive quarter that the company
generated over $1 billion in EBITDA. For the quarter, EBITDA was 18.9% of sales.
National Oilwell Varco's March 31, 2013, balance sheet employed working capital, excluding cash and debt of $6.9
billion, up $204 million from the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of Robbins & Myers, working capital was
essentially neutral. Total customer financing on projects in the form of prepayments and billings in excess of costs, less
costs in excess of billings was $283 million, down $286 million from December 31, as costs incurred on major projects
continued to outpace milestone invoicing.
Current and long-term debt net of cash was $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter, with $4.3 billion in debt offset by $2.4
billion in cash, of which only 10% resides in the U.S.
Cash flow from operations was $506 million for the quarter. During the quarter, we have acquired Robbins & Myers
for $2.5 billion, which we funded using $1.1 billion of cash on hand and $1.4 billion of revolver debt borrowings, $185
million of which we repaid between the February 20 acquisition date and the end of the quarter owing to our strong
cash flow from operations.
We also spent $168 million in CapEx, as we continue to invest substantially in major expansion efforts, several of
which we expect to be fully operational later this year. Cash tax payments were $171 million in the quarter, and
dividend payments totaled $56 million.
Now, let me turn it back to Pete.
Merrill A. Miller, Jr.
Thanks, Jeremy. I think that Clay and Jeremy have really kind of covered everything very, very well, and I'd just like to
make a few brief comments before we open it up for questions. But I spent a little bit of time in the last quarter
traveling overseas and trying to get a sense of things that I think are pretty important. And I think some things that you
need to keep an eye on, for the folks on this call, number one, I think is China, and I think you should take a look at the
shipyards there. They're becoming much more active, especially in the jackup arena. I think you'll see some floaters and
semis done there. We're positioned very uniquely to be able to take advantage of that.
While there's been some press recently about the slow moving on the China shales, I also believe one of the reasons for
that is because of the lack of infrastructure, and so I might just remind you, we manufacture infrastructure. And so, I
think that in China, we're actually going to see some pretty good things happening with the shales.

I think Latin America looks very positive. I believe by the end of the year, you're going to see PEMEX pickup and I
think that has positive implications for all the service companies and manufacturers. And of course, as Jeremy and Clay
pointed out, Brazil continues to be a very attractive arena for us. We're the leader down there in the drillship awards,
but more importantly than that, we're also supporting everything else that's happening down there through all of our
other operations. So I think Brazil will continue to be a lynchpin of what we're doing.
And then finally in Russia, visited there earlier this quarter, and I really think the Russians are just really almost
begging for the technology that we have to be able to provide to them. We're investing there. I think over the next four
or five years, you're going to see a complete transformation of the rig fleet and a lot of the equipment that are working
in Russia. And again, I think we're very uniquely positioned to be able to take advantage of that. So I think if you really
keep your eye on Russia, China and Latin America, I think those are going to be very important things.
And then finally, I'd like to talk just for a moment about the fact that a lot of the domestic E&P people are getting a lot
more free cash flow simply because of the price of natural gas today. Now, I don't think that that means that they're
going to necessarily drill for natural gas, but what I do believe it means is they'll continue to invest in – especially in
the oily and liquid shales. So – and again, everything that we have to offer positions ourselves for that.
You've heard us talk a little bit about some of the weaknesses in the frac spread, but you have to also remember, those
frac spreads are beating the crap out of each other every day that they're out there working and eventually that then
becomes something that's going to produce more and more revenues for us.
So that's really just kind of a quick overview of the things that I'm seeing out there. I might also add that a week from
Monday is the start of OTC. As usual, NOV is going to have a nice presence there with a lot of the new products that
we have and I would invite anybody that's on this call to please stop by our booth or go to our equipment show on
Holmes Road where our Tuboscope facility is and get an opportunity to see a lot of the exciting things that NOV is
doing.
So at this point, Dawn, I'd like to turn it over to any questions that our customers might – or our listeners might have.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from
Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Good morning, guys. Great overview as usual. And, Pete, you might have answered this
first question I have a little bit in your summary there. But the biggest push back I get from investors on your story is
the perception that the backlog is great backlog growth we're seeing right now, hits a wall next year in – sometime in
2014. We got good visibility obviously this year with the rigs that have been ordered, but in 2014 that falls off and that
you're not going to be able to replace that. So how do you respond to those investors that the growth rate in 2015 and
2016 goes away?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Great question, Marshall. I might tell you the quote that I think of is Mark Twain. And it
was "The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated." And if I could kind of go into how many times I've been
told that the backlog is dead – let's go back to 2008. You're going to lose half your backlog or three quarters of your
backlog, and we lost about 3% when the financial crisis occurred. And we've been told numerous times about the fact
that, well, people just aren't going to keep ordering.
The fact of the matter is we feel very good about the prospects as we look into the future. I can talk until I'm blue in the
face and people are going to believe what they want to believe on that. But take a look at the jackup market. How many
times have you heard about the death of the jackup market? And yet this quarter, we just had a plethora of jackups
ordered and we continue to see a very active area in that arena.

And you also have to understand that a lot of these shipyards in places like Korea, China and Singapore, the shipyards
are in fact the driver of their economic growth, and they're going to do everything they can to try and keep those
shipyards filled with things. And I think you're going to continue to see very attractive prices that are thrown out there
for a lot of the deepwater drillers. And if you take a look, the number of deepwater rigs out there, while it seems big on
a historical basis, it's really a fraction of probably how many rigs you really need to be able to explore the deepwater
basins all over the world.
And so we – and couple that then with the fact that we're expanding into the FPSO arena, and when you take a look at
what has to happen with FPSOs, I mean the approved solution for production on all these deepwater wells being drilled
today is going to be the FPSO arena, and we've positioned ourselves to be able to take great advantage of that. And
we'll continue to look at ways to buy into different companies and also acquire things so that we can expand that even
further. So we feel very comfortable that we're going to continue to have a solid backlog that's going to lead to growth
for NOV.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Excellent, that helps. One quick, somewhat unrelated follow-up, and really more a
clarification. It sound – the margins obviously in Rig Tech a little less than some of us thought. I think you detailed
why pretty well. But it sounds as if you expect to rebound once we get past these abnormal hotshot or transportation
expenses, and that the onetime start up costs fade over the next couple quarters. It – did I hear that right?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: That's exactly correct, Marshall. We had $32 million in net project expenses that hit this
quarter. And then $10 million in sort of start-up costs around the globe and the start-up costs will linger for a while, but
the $32 million cost roll was off of this quarter. So we're confident we're going to end up in the 22% to 23% range
going forward.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Thanks, Marshall.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thanks, Marshall.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell from Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Good morning, Jim.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Good morning, Jim.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Good morning, Jim.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: First question concerns deepwater. I guess how many deepwater rigs did you book in the
first quarter? And I assume by your comments that you booked the first three out of the nine in Brazil and there's
another six to come. And also could you comment on China, Pete? I know you had, I guess, three deepwater rigs in the
fourth quarter come out of the Chinese yards. Have there been any more? And I guess over the course of this year, how
many Chinese yards do you think could become engaged in deepwater rig construction?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: You're correct, Jim. We booked a total eight floaters, three of the floaters for Brazil. And as I
said in my comments, we're hopeful that the last six there will also flow in once we get down payments on those rigs.
So that's the situation in Brazil. The other five were elsewhere around the globe, but more centered in the traditional
shipyards. With regards to the Chinese yards , they've been very active on the jackup front and gaining share there on
the jackup awards. Floaters they're interested in, but that's a little slower in developing.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. Pete, I know you spent – as you said, you spent some time in Russia. My
understanding, and tell me if I'm wrong here, is that Russian companies have to retire the sub-basin mast in Russia after

25 years. And will operators do this or do you think a number of them that you're speaking with aren't interested in
upgrading their rigs but building new equipment, hence your new facility over there?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Jim, actually, yeah, they do need to – they need to redo their rigs after 25 years and I
think that there's a tremendous interest level on getting new equipment and better technology. I think the Russians
know that effectively they've got 1980s vintage rigs and the difference between an 1980s vintage rig and a land rig
today is night and day. And so we're confident that they're going to upgrade those rigs and I think that's going to be a
multi-year expansion that's really going to play well into our hands.
I mean just about every place we go, we like to have a lot of local content for a lot of reasons, but one of the main
reasons is because your transportation charges are lowered dramatically trying to get the rig to the end user. But we'll
have our new facility up and running by next year. And in that facility, we'll be building both rigs and a lot of our other
equipment. But the Russians really have a demand for that technology and we're very bullish on what we're going to
see over there the next couple years. And I think they are going to have to retire a lot of those rigs, not only because of
the law, but also because of just the need for better drilling efficiencies.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: And Pete, one quick last final question is, I know you've been bullish on the outlook for
FPSO orders and I know you're not getting package orders and it's coming in the way of individual products. But could
you characterize the magnitude of the pickup that you're seeing in the last one or two quarters and then take us through
maybe this calendar year into 2014 and in terms of the projected magnitude of the pickup?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah, we – Jim, this quarter, we had products – major sales for turret mooring systems and
buoy products into four projects there, which is a very big pickup. As we've talked about previous quarters, orders had
been pretty slow there in that business despite a lot of FEED study activity, a lot of conversations with customers
throughout last year, and even going back into 2011. And so we're very pleased to see a sharp pickup in orders. And
then in Q2, we expect even more.
And so the trajectory is finally moving in the right direction, the way we were confident it would. And so very, very
pleased to see that pickup. But that – and I'll add, too, that's in addition to the flexible pipe sales, composite pipe, hose
reel systems, riser pull systems, other components that we sell into FPSOs more broadly. So generally, I think we're
seeing that whole market start to pick up as we have expected and pleased to see the direction that it's going.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay, good. Thank you.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Thanks, Jim.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thanks, Jim.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Robin Shoemaker from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Thanks. And wanted to pursue that FPSO a little more. You've told us before, I think,
what you think your maximum dollar value of sales is per FPSO and could you remind us of that? And are you seeing
any opportunities where you might get that total value?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: On the high end – first, FPSOs span a broad range of sizes and capabilities and – as you
know, Robin. And so, they're not – there's a lot of variability in the design of FPSOs. And actually more broadly, let's
say, FS users, things that technically aren't FPSOs that we also sell lots of equipment into as well. But on the high end,
I would say, probably $150 million per very large FPSO is a sort of a reasonable number, and in – technically speaking
for a – I think it's possible for us to go beyond that, and perhaps well beyond that, depending on the capabilities of the
FPSO. But what's probably more useful as sort of an average number might be in the $80 million to $100 million kind
of size range for us.

<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Okay. My other question had to do with these faster hull construction times and how
you've had to speed up the process and incurred a lot of overtime and expediting, and all the things you mentioned
there. It seems like in the past, the shorter the delivery time, the higher the price and the higher the margin, just in terms
of what you could charge for prompt delivery versus longer delivery. And it just seems like now the hurry-up kind of
process isn't giving you the pricing leverage or am I misunderstanding that?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: No, that's partly true. I would say that for certain components for quick delivery, we clearly
do get a premium, but the broad level of activity out there, the portfolio projects that we have today, are being built a
year or more faster than they were 2007, 2008, and have been awarded or bid, let's say, more at our customers' leisure,
if you will. Back in 2007, 2000 (sic) [2008] (45:11), there was a much higher level of urgency injected into the system,
I think principally because the slots available in the shipyards were in short supply, and once a customer secured a slot
at a shipyard, even though the gestation period of the rig took much longer, they tended to sign up pretty very quickly
with us on a DEP.
This time around, the shipyards have a lot more capacity. There's not as much urgency around the availability of slots.
And all of the slots are being bid at much faster construction schedule, much shorter time than it takes to build a rig. So
we've shrunk the number of months from probably 42, 45 months for a sophisticated drillship down to sub-30 this time
around. And once – but the process leading up to signing a contract for that 30-month drillship is a little more relaxed
and it gives – it means that there's a much more sort of competitive fight for the work going into that rig.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Yeah, so it sounds like this dynamic really isn't going to change in any near term future.
In other words the availability of shipyard slots, you mentioned China getting into the business. So it's going to
continue to be kind of -?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: What's happened, Robin, is that as the whole construction schedule has shortened, it's pressed
our plants and our factories to move components out much more quickly. And so it's that concept is little bit divorced
from the process around bidding work and competing with our competitors to supply drilling equipment packages. But
I would also add that as our backlog is filled up and there's lots of rigs out there, in particular in buying components
that are in a little shorter supply, we are certainly pressing for some – a few price increases here and there to cover
these extraordinary costs that we're seeing.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Right, okay. Thank you.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: You bet.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Thanks, Robin.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Great, thanks. Good morning.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Good morning, Kurt.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Good morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: So I think I want to try to get a sense on here is kind of recap, give the general average for the
FPSO per unit. Can you just give us a rough update on floaters and jackups? Are we still around $200 million to $220
million for floaters and still in that kind of $50 million to $70 million range for jackups? Has that changed at all?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: No, that's – Kurt, that's pretty accurate. I mean on some of the floaters, depending on the
complexity, if you've got a complete dual activity, depending if you want one or two stacks, things like that, you could
be as much as $250 million. I think on the jackups, it really is around a $50 million top. We get the max on the floaters

more so than many times on the jackup, but we've really picked up on the jackups as well simply because of our
jacking systems. We're putting a lot more jacking systems out there. So I think that that $200 million to $250 million
and the $50 million number are still pretty accurate.
Then I also might remind you that, as we take a look at land rigs, and especially places like the Middle East and some
of the more complex land rigs, that those will be up into the $30 million and $35 million range and we've been very
successful when that arena improves, and we think that arena will do well over the last part of the year.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Well, Pete, in that context, we've heard recently the Saudi rig count – Saudi is expected to
increase the rig count from – I think we're counting something around 140 today to something around 200 by the end of
2014. First, can you corroborate that? And secondly, if Saudi is looking for, I would say, another 60 rigs, are they all
going to be new in your viewpoint? And if – and where else do you see kind of a similar size kind of increase coming
from? I know you mentioned Russia; that sounded like a five-year process though. But...
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Yeah.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: If you could give us some color, that would be great.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: I think, Kurt, we agree that the Saudis are going to pick up. And I think it'll be a
combination of existing rigs that'll be moving in, and also new rigs. And we're uniquely positioned, because we can
actually – we manufacture our land rigs in Dubai in the Jebel Ali Free Zone there. And so we're able to respond much
more quickly. That's been one of the reasons we've done that because if the Saudis want a rig and we have to make it at
any place, any other part of the world, be it China or even in the U.S., you have to add 60 to 90 days just for
transportation charges. Whereas if we can do it in Dubai, which is what we do, once we're done, it moves across the
border and you're in Saudi Arabia in three days. And so, we think that that's going to be a very attractive market over
the next year or so.
I think Russia is a more long-term market, but I think it's probably also a more sustainable market. And it's one, I think,
that's going to keep on giving for a period of time. I think Latin America on land rigs is going to be a little bit more
exciting than people realize. I think PEMEX, for sure, is going to be doing some things toward the end of the year and I
think that will be both on and offshore. I think you're seeing some things in Colombia. And even the Venezuelans make
noise that maybe something could happen there. But we're probably a little bit more bullish on Latin America right now
than we have been and I think that's something that's probably a second half of the year phenomenon as well.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Pete. And if I could just one more here, just on the FPSO. As indicated,
obviously, initially that's going to be margin dilutive to historical Rig Tech average margins, and as you get more
volume, that will improve. So what's the crossover point in terms of volumes and how close do you think the FPSO
margins can get to historical Rig Tech averages?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Depends on the mix a little bit. We have products within that offering that are accretive to the
mix overall, but others that are dilutive. Right now, the sum of the business is still dilutive, but we're still at least a few
quarters away from having that business be accretive to FPSOs. And I would add, I mean it would take us a much
larger volume through that business to turn that corner, so that's still a ways off. But again, very excited about the
prospects out there. As Pete mentioned, this is sort of the go-to solution for producing out of the deepwater and we
have a great offering of equipment and technologies into that trend. So over the long haul, very, very excited about
what lay ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: That's great. Appreciate your color. Thanks.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Okay, Kurt, thank you.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our last question comes from Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Hi, Bill.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Jeremy, if I perhaps missed it in the prepared comments, but I think you gave as far as the
revenue recognition on the backlog for Rig Tech, $2 billion in 2Q, and then I think you said $3.7 billion in the back
half of the year. I missed the 2014 expectation. Do you have that number?
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Let me check, I didn't say that on the call. Hold on a second, Bill.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Or if not, it's something we can do offline, but I know, Clay, you've typically given it in the
past.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: We're actually checking it a minute, aren't we, Bill? I'll have it for you -
<Q - William Sanchez>: Yeah, we are.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Okay.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: $2.3 billion. I got $2.3 billion.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: $2.3 billion.
<Q - William Sanchez>: $2.3 billion is the – I'm sorry, that's the 2014 total?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: No, no.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: No.
<Q - William Sanchez>: No, I was going to say -
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: I'll get back -
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Yeah.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: I got it right here. It is $4.9 billion.
<Q - William Sanchez>: $4.9 billion, okay, great. Thank you for that. And then I guess just one thing, just so I can just
understand in terms of the margin progression here on Rig Tech. Clay, kind of from your comments, and I think it was
confirmed in the earlier Q&A, that margins in Rig Tech the next couple of quarters are going to be relatively flat I
believe with the 1Q level?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yes.
<Q - William Sanchez>: But yet, I think, Jeremy, you ...?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: No, no, no, no, no. Sorry, Bill. Flat with Q4.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Flat with Q4, okay.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: 22% to 23% range.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay, right. Okay, then that dovetails in because I was – it seemed like if – to get to the 22%
or 23% range certainly on average for the year, you had to see a step up in 2Q. So that makes sense. If not, you're going
to have to have a pretty significant increase in 4Q margins, so. Okay, so 4Q 2012 is basically a good proxy for 2Q 2013
in Rig Tech?

<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yes.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yes.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. And one question just on PSS, is it too early to say, given the mix of the product
launch – and I know there's a backlog component to that business that perhaps you lag rig count recovery here to some
extent, but does 2Q likely represent the trough from the margin expectation?
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: At this point in time we think so. I mean it's – we're starting to hear positive comments
from our customers, the service companies and the drilling contractors and typically we lag their positive comments by
about a quarter. So our expectation is that rig activity does start to pickup at some point this quarter, even if it's not a
lot, that our customers will start working through their inventories and start placing orders for our consumable products
again in Services.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay, great. I appreciate the time. Thank you.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Thanks, Bill.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thanks, Bill.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: All right. Thank you.
