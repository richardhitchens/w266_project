O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, List, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions, and participation in our third
quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today, we reported another solid and consistent quarter with earnings of $305
million or $0.22 per diluted share. Total revenue increased 2%, and asset quality remained solid with the net charge-off
ratio of 39 basis points.
We continue to focus on meeting the financial needs of our customers, and once again in this quarter we grew our
customer base and deepened relationships, as evidenced by growth in quality households and quality checking
accounts, all of which are fundamental drivers of long-term sustainable growth. Although the overall lending
environment was challenging in the third quarter, we remained committed to maintaining disciplined credit
underwriting standards.
Competition remains intense within the business lending, creating pressure on both price and structure. Nonetheless, we
remained prudent how we choose to compete for loans. As a result, there are a number of deals that we're walking away
from that do not meet company's risk appetite or have unacceptable terms.
While we experienced slower demand in July and August, recent trends indicate a very favorable pickup in activity and
have generally been more favorable, both at the end of the quarter and as we enter the next quarter.
The consumer lending portfolio continued to expand including growth in indirect loans, credit card and mortgages.
Additionally, our deposit base continued to increase with ending deposit balances up $308 million from the prior
quarter. We remain focused on growing and diversifying our non-interest revenue, despite the challenging
environment. We believe that allowing customers to bank the way they choose is the key to customer satisfaction and
growth.
We also recognize we must continue to innovate as it is critical to attracting and retaining customers. We are committed
to driving long-term growth while improving efficiency across the organization, supported by our process improvement
initiatives. Despite the recent market volatility and global macro economic weakness, we are encouraged by improving
economic fundamentals throughout our core markets. Although the recovery means uneven, we expect increased
capital spending activity will drive GDP growth into 2015.
Finally, we are encouraged and pleased with the recent announced positive actions by a couple of our credit rating
agencies. We believe these actions reflect meaningful improvements, number of credit quality metrics and our overall
risk profile. We are committed to maintaining a strong risk management culture, and these rating upgrades are further
evidence of our continued progress.
I'll now turn it over to David for a closer look at our third quarter results, and then we'll take your questions.
David J. Turner
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the details starting with the balance sheet. Loan balances
totaled $77 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of $94 million from the end of the previous quarter. The
consumer lending portfolio drove the increase as growth in business lending moderated early in the quarter, as Grayson
indicated.
Total consumer lending increased $120 million linked quarter as production increased 2%. The growth in the consumer
portfolio was led by indirect auto lending as balances increased 4% from the prior quarter. We continue to benefit from
the robust market for auto sales as well as from the process improvements instituted earlier in the year. As a result, we
expect further growth in this portfolio.
Credit card balances increased $19 million or 2% from the previous quarter. This increase stems from a 4% increase in
active card users. To date, our marketing efforts have primarily targeted our existing customer base. As a result, we

continue to make progress as our penetration rate is up 200 basis points to 15% over the last year, and we expect
growth in balances to continue in the near-term.
Mortgage balances were up modestly this quarter as production increased 1% linked quarter. Meanwhile, total home
equity balances declined $96 million as loan payoffs continued to outpace new production. However, total home equity
production increased 13% from the previous quarter as customers continue to take advantage of fixed-rate home equity
loans and variable rate home equity lines of credit. Looking at business lending, this portfolio totaled $48 billion at end
of the quarter, an increase of 4% year-to-date.
Commercial and industrial loans grew $503 million or 2% from the prior quarter. As Grayson mentioned, competition
remains intense in this space. In addition, we experienced loan payoffs related to customer mergers and acquisitions as
well as refinancing activities occurring in the fixed income markets. C&I growth was led by the general industries
group within the geographies as well as REIT finance. Line utilization declined 40 basis points; however, commitments
for new loans increased $1 billion or 2%, and our pipelines remain strong.
Regarding investor real estate, while ending balances were up 1% year-to-date at $6.8 billion, the portfolio experienced
a decline of 2% from the previous quarter. Investor real estate remains an important part of our corporate bank strategy
given our market presence in the Southeast. However, as previously noted, we remain committed to our risk tolerance
levels as it relates to this portfolio. As such, near-term growth is expected to be modest. Based on what we know today
and reflecting our current economic forecast, we expect ending 2014 loan growth to be at the lower end of the 3% to
5% range.
Let's take a look at deposits. Supported by our multi-channel platform, deposits continue to grow increasing $308
million during the third quarter. Of note, low cost deposits grew by $492 million and continues to account for 91% of
total deposits. Deposit costs remain at historically low levels and totaled 11 basis points, while total funding costs
declined to 30 basis points in the quarter. We continued to expect 2014 deposit growth to be in the 2% range for the
year on a point-to-point basis.
Let's take a look at how this impacted our results. Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $837 million,
essentially flat versus the prior quarter. However, as anticipated, our net interest margin declined 6 basis points to
3.18%. Net interest income benefited from an additional day in the quarter as well as from a modest increase in the
securities portfolio. Net interest margin was negatively impacted by approximately 3 basis points due to higher levels
of cash and the additional day.
Both net interest margin and net interest income were negatively impacted by lower asset yields as maturities and pay
downs in loans and securities are replaced at lower levels. Asset yields will likely continue to come under pressure if
the current low interest rate environment persists. Deposit and funding costs are expected to remain stable at
historically low levels with limited opportunity to realize additional cost leverage.
Assuming rates remain at roughly current levels through the fourth quarter, we expect to have net interest margin
compression of 1 basis point to 3 basis points. And net interest income growth will primarily be driven by growth in
loans.
In terms of our interest rate sensitivity, we remain asset sensitive and expect net interest income to benefit from
increases in short-term or longer term rates. More specifically, a 100 basis point parallel shift in rates would increase
net income approximately $160 million in the first year.
Total non-interest revenue increased 5% to $478 million in the third quarter. Service charges increased 4% from the
second quarter, and card and ATM fees increased 1%. Credit card income benefited from a 2% increase in spending
volume.
Now, with respect to posting order, as we previously stated, we plan to begin piloting a chronological approach in
select markets during the first quarter next year. The results from these tests will be used to inform our posting order
process and customer communications. We do not expect to fully implement these changes until the second half of
2015. However, through our current modeling efforts, we estimate the impact from these changes to be in the range of

$10 million to $15 million per quarter. It is important to understand that the modeling assumes a static environment,
and there are numerous policies including funds availability that impact fee revenue.
Mortgage income was down 9% from the previous quarter, primarily related to lower mortgage servicing rights and
related hedge income. Although servicing income has been relatively consistent, we continue to look for opportunities
to grow this revenue source. We currently have approximately $40 billion of mortgages in our servicing portfolio, and
have the operational capacity to take on additional volume.
While mortgage production declined in 2014, the pace of our decline has been less than the industry. Originations
continue to be driven by new home purchases and represented on average 73% of total originations this year. And
looking ahead, the Mortgage Bankers Association estimates that mortgage origination should increase 5% to 10% in
2015, and we expect to continue to outpace industry estimates.
Capital markets income increased $8 million from the previous quarter, primarily related to an increase in activity and
real estate capital markets. This increase reflects the revenue increase from investments we have made to expand our
capital markets capabilities.
Let's move onto expenses. Adjusted expenses were flat from the previous quarter. Salaries and benefits increased $13
million from the previous quarter as head count increased 183 positions. The majority of these positions are in revenue
generating or revenue support roles and include hires in specialty lending, insurance, wealth management and platform
personnel, and will drive future growth and revenue. The remaining portion of the increase continues to be primarily
from hires of support staff, particularly in risk management and compliance functions. With that said, we continue to
closely monitor personnel resources which has resulted in a reduction in head count of 656 positions year-to-date.
Credit expenses have been particularly low for several quarters as we have benefited from loan sales out of our
held-for-sale portfolio. The opportunity for gains will diminish as the balances in the portfolio declined.
This quarter, we also incurred expenses related to Visa class B shares sold in prior years, which resulted in $7 million
of additional expense in the third quarter. Furniture and equipment related expense increased primarily related to
investments in technology, including systems enhancements and data management solutions.
Additionally, we benefited from the recovery to expenses related to unfunded commitments of $24 million, which was
primarily due to the large credit line that funded and was subsequently resolved during the quarter. The adjusted
efficiency ratio improved by 60 basis points to 63.6% in the third quarter as we remain committed to driving
efficiencies across the organization. While some quarter-to-quarter volatility is to be expected, we continue to expect
full-year 2014 adjusted expenses to be lower than those of 2013.
Let's move on to asset quality. Our overall asset quality remains solid as many credit metrics improved in the quarter.
Our non-performing loans declined 7% linked-quarter. In addition, at quarter-end, our loan loss allowance to
non-performing loans or coverage ratio, was 141%, up from 137% last quarter.
Total delinquencies declined 4% and trouble debt restructurings, or TDRs, meaningfully declined 7%, driven by both
refinancing activity and paydowns. In addition, both criticized and classified loans declined from the prior quarter.
Net charge-offs totaled $75 million, representing 39 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was
$24 million or $51 million less than net charge-offs. And based on what we know today, we expect favorable asset
quality trends to continue. However, at this point in the cycle, volatility in certain metrics can be expected.
Let's move on to capital and liquidity. We continue to maintain industry-leading capital levels. At the end of the
quarter, our estimated Tier 1 ratio stood at 12.7% and our estimated Tier 1 Common Equity ratio was 11.8%. Further,
we estimate our fully phased in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio to be 11.2%. And as previously mentioned, we
expect to begin executing our $350 million share repurchase program shortly as we previously planned.
And just a quick note regarding preferred stock expense for the third quarter. Due to the timing of April issuance, the
first coupon period was longer than future coupon periods and resulted in additional expense of approximately $4
million. Going forward, with the current level of preferred stock outstanding, the run rate for preferred stock expense

will be approximately $16 million per order.
Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remains solid with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%. And regarding
the liquidity coverage ratio rule, Regions' funding base and investment portfolio are well-positioned to receive optimal
treatment based on the high-quality liquid asset definition. Importantly, our Regions360 approach supports deepening
customer relationships, which provides an LCR friendly platform for the ratio calculation.
Overall, we're pleased with certain adjustments made to the final rule and expect to be fully compliant by the January
2016 deadline without meaningful changes to our balance sheet.
In summary, our third quarter results continue to reflect our steady progress in growing revenue, while maintaining a
disciplined risk culture. We believe that by focusing on our customers' needs, while prudently managing risk, we will
drive long-term sustainable growth and deliver long-term shareholder value.
Thank you for your time and attention this morning. And I'll now turn it back over to List for instructions on the Q&A
portion of the call.
M. List Underwood
Thank you, David. We're ready to begin the Q&A session. In order to accommodate as many of you as possible this
morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and then one related follow-up
question.
Now let's open the line for questions, operator.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: Good morning. Hi, it's actually Jessica Ribner in for Paul. How are you?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hey, Jessica. Good morning.
<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: Good morning. It sounds like just from your comments, you sound more positive about
2015 than 2014 in terms of loan growth and earnings. Do you feel like you can improve on today's loan growth into
next year? What are you guys seeing?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, as you look at third quarter, we said in our prepared remarks, we saw a moderation
in loan demand in July and August and then we saw loan demand strengthen to some degree in September. We've
continued to see that strengthening of loan demand into the fourth quarter. Certainly, we're encouraged by that. I would
tell you the moderation in the early part of the quarter was a mixture of both the number of merger and acquisition
transactions, where we either were not the bank or the acquirer or we were the bank of both and had to reduce hold
positions on those.
But we also saw an overall reduction in demand and a related production as a result of that demand. And so there were
a number of one-off transactions that we would not have anticipated in terms of payoffs or paydowns. But I would say
generally in July and August we saw reduced demand. That obviously concerned us early in the quarter, but it
re-strengthened in September. And if the trend continues, I think it's a very good sign for 2015 and obviously gives us
the opportunity to perform at an higher level if that trend continues. And at this juncture we have no reason to believe it
will not.

<Q - Jessica S. Levi-Ribner>: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning. Hello?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes, good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Oh, hi. Okay, couple of questions on the overdraft. You indicated that based on the testing
that you've done that starting I think third quarter of 2015 you would expect to see a $10 million to $15 million drop in
your OD fees. Could you give us some color behind the analysis you did to get to that estimate and maybe also indicate
what the total OD fees are? And let us know if you're going to be offsetting any of that revenue shrinkage with other
actions?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I'll start and then I'll let David add to that. We've spent the last several months
making a number of fairly significant modifications to our deposit systems in order to accommodate posting order
changes, as well as to accommodate the testing and forecasting of those changes. All of those modifications have gone
well, and we're in a much better position today to understand what the implications of these changes might be. We'll
start piloting a number of these changes. And in general, without getting too deep into the details, our approach is very
much of a chronological-based approach to posting. And our early numbers would indicate, as David said, that we
could realize a $10 million to $15 million a quarter reduction in service charges.
That being said, we realize that it's our job to figure out how to mitigate those service charge reductions. A lot of it's
going to depend on customer behavior, but also we're looking at all of our deposit related products and how we price
those products and how we deliver those products. And we continue to believe that as we have in the past, as we've
made changes like this to find ways to mitigate those leakages, if you will, of non-interest revenue. We had a good
strong non-interest quarter this quarter, and so we think we're making some of the right changes. David?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah. Betsy, we really wanted to kind of put something out there on posting order. That's a
question we get frequently. It is based on running some models to-date, but we really need to see what the customer
behavior is going to be before we know. And we'll update you when we know. But we want to frame it up a little bit for
you to try to head off the continued question there.
I will tell you that through a lot of changes that have happened in our industry, we've had almost $400 million worth of
revenue taken out of our company that we've had to overcome. And we've created new products and services, and we'll
do the same thing here as well. So we have the teams working hard to grow our revenue regardless of the changes that
we see, whether it be posting order or other changes we have to deal with. And so we don't have specifics on this just
yet, but we will continue to update you and find ways to mitigate this revenue. And we'll give you – as we get closer
and run the pilot, we'll give you better information too to hone in on this number.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yes. I guess is there – just if you can share with us anything regarding some of the
assumptions that are behind the $10 million to $15 million, is it a reduction in fee waivers? This is obviously a less bad
number than some folks had been wondering or estimating out there. So I'm just wondering if you could help us with
some of those details?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I think that clearly because we went through our most recent assumptions and in
testing that, you know, we've assumed a pretty static environment and that you know we're not putting assumptions into
model today that would be indicative of customer behavioral changes. We're assuming behaviors continue the way they
have. We're not putting assumptions in there that we have less account attrition, which is a potential – if this policy for
some customers will be perceived as more friendly, then you could argue that there's some account retention benefit,
but we haven't modeled that in.

So I think we've taken a very conservative approach to how we've modeled this. That being said, the best numbers will
come when we actually pilot this in the first quarter, and that pilot is really going to give us a much clearer view of that.
I think that the primary issue in our part is being very transparent with our customers, making sure that we understand
how this impacts customers, and making sure that we don't lose our momentum in growing accounts as we have been
throughout 2014.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning. Just wondering about the buyback, is your intention to utilize the
full $350 million in buybacks over the remaining two quarters of the CCAR period?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: That's within the plan, yes.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then, on the deposit service, just switching gears to the Ready Advance.
Could you update us on how much in the Ready Advance fees might have been in the third quarter. I believe it was [ph]
signaling and PP&R (27:36) in the second quarter, and how does that trend in the third and what's the time line for that
going away?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, we've – so the change in the third quarter and second quarter is pretty, pretty similar
numbers that we had previously spoken about. We will have by the end of the year, we will have converted everybody
or stopped the Ready Advance program really by the end of November. We should be – we'll have discontinued that
and we've put forth other options for those existing customers in the Ready Advance product that they have today.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: As you recall, we stopped offering that product in January of this year and we've gone
through a couple of conversions. We broke the customer base up into segments. We've gone through a couple
conversions. All of those conversions will be completed before the end of the year. I would say that the drop-off you
saw from first quarter to second quarter was predominantly because of reduced enrollments, if you took enrollments to
zero. The drop-off you saw really from second quarter to third quarter had to do with some limited amount of
conversions. We still have of the customers that we had in that product well probably 60% of those customers are still
active today, but all of those customers will be converted as David said, near the end of November.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: None of that will be in our run rate for the first quarter; there will still be a limited amount
in our run rate for the fourth quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yes, in that product.
<A - David J. Turner>: In that product.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: They will be taking other products, and then we'll have to move some revenue from NIR
up into NII, and that will be based on adoption rates for those customers.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, and that should happen partially in the fourth, and then again in the first?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's correct.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, and then on – just to clarify Betsy's – on the posting order change, we assume
that $10 million to $15 million, we should start that in the third quarter of next year?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: You'll have a very limited amount in the first half of the year, and the balance of that will
be in the third quarter and fourth quarter of next year.

Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Hi, guys. If I could just circle back on the expenses, obviously good progress here,
and as you think about the full year guidance is down year-over-year. I mean, you've been down pretty materially
year-to-date. So maybe boxing it in a little bit more for the fourth quarter if you are comfortable doing so, and then
thinking about the trajectory for next year?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes, Matt. We're still working on next year. We'll update you on that as we get closer
towards the end of the year and have a couple of conferences coming up, we'll let everybody know. As it relates to our
general philosophy, as you know we're wanting to generate positive operating leverage. We have one of the lowest
expense bases, but that being said, we focus on it quite a bit. That does not prevent us from making investments where
we see the need to do that.
As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we increased positions about 183 this quarter. And we put most of that in
our revenue producing or revenue support roles. Because we think that's the right thing to do, and at times you'll see the
expense come before the revenue. We had the same issue about this time last year where we've tried to indicate we
were going to make some investments. We feel very good about that, and so long-term we think we're doing the right
thing.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yes, Matt, we really are trying to take a very balanced approach, both from revenue and
expense standpoint. We've realized that there clearly are investments that we have to make to grow. And to manage our
business better, but there is also opportunities for us to continue to increase the efficiency of our company. And so, we
take this very balanced approach to it to try to – if you will, fund our investments through savings efficiencies. We've
been very aggressive, as you know, over the last several years, in branch rationalization. We do that on an annual basis.
We're going through that process now as we speak, and we're being more rigorous, more disciplined about that this
year.
Over the past seven years we've closed a little over 19% or consolidated a little over 19% of our branch offices. You'll
see us continue to leverage that process to drive even more efficiency through our company. We still believe the branch
is a very relevant channel. We are investing in all of our channels including the branch channel, but we also believe that
we have to manage those channels pretty dynamically. And so over as David said, as we get closer to the end of the
year, through the appropriate opportunities, we looked to update you on some of our cost efficiency initiatives, and we
realized in this kind of low rate environment that we've got to continue to drive that forward.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: As you think specifically about the third quarter expense base, the adjusted $826
million, is that a reasonable kind of run rate or base or should we gross that out for the provision for unfunded credit

losses that was a credit?
<A - David J. Turner>: Matt, without giving you, you got to build your run rate expectations. We don't want to give
specific guidance there, but I do think you need to factor in the unfunded commitment because that's a credit, a
one-time credit that may or may not recur. As you can tell, if you look at that other expense line item we have this
pretty lumpy. And it's because of that expense and unfunded commitment. So that's $24 million going one way. We did
have a Visa expense of $7 million that went the other way. And that shouldn't be recurring every quarter, but we have
had that from time to time. So that's lumpy, as well. That's a net $17 million that I think you ought to consider as you
evaluate what you think our run rate would be.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Marty.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Hey, guys. I had couple of different questions. One is with the rating agency changes
positively, David, do you think you can become a little more aggressive maybe in – maybe using the excess capital to
start pulling down those debt cost and refinancing your debt given the improvement you've seen there?
<A - David J. Turner>: Marty, that's a great question. We look at trying to get more efficient, if you will, from that
funding cost standpoint. As you know, we pay a little over 5% after considering swaps, whatever page it is in our
supplement. We look at that all the time. And when the economics are right, notwithstanding rating agencies, if it
makes economic sense for us to do that, we would love to take that out, use our capital, as you mentioned, and have a
better run rate going forward.
But it has to make economic sense, as the rates have continued to come down it's gotten a little less economical for us.
But we look at it literally every day, so your comment's spot on. From a rating agency standpoint, we have gotten some
improvement out of the rating agencies, and we're looking to leverage hopefully over time even better ratings as we
deal with our customers and also as we deal with getting our debt structure, if you will, as efficient low cost as we can.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then Grayson, we had talked earlier this year about the strategy of how you are
looking at your customers differently in a sense of what they liked, what types of customers they were. Talking about
growing your customer base and deepening relationships, how are you seeing your new approach to the market and the
customers as an advantage now to maybe serve a little bit more the underserved mass market in your markets?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, Marty, as we've spoken before, we're servicing a little over 4 million households
today. We have about a little over 5 million customers. And we're constantly trying to think through ways that we can
be innovative from a product or delivery standpoint to increase our satisfaction or our delivery of customer needs. And
we've offered a number of alternative products to try to bank more of the unbanked or under-banked. Obviously, we
have a lot of competition in that space. And as you may recall, we introduced a suite of banking products directed right
at that segment called Now Banking, and our Now Banking accounts for some 460,000 customers that we've added to
that product suite, and we continue to see progress.
As you saw from our numbers this time, we're growing households, growing accounts. We've got a number of
borrowing segments that are growing, as well as our depository segments are growing. We believe we're making good
progress. I would tell you it's early, though, as we've rolled out this new strategy, in that I would say we are in the early
innings of this, but the progress is good, and recently to try to meet the liquidity needs of some of our customer
segments. We rolled out a Secured Savings Lending product and already have some 25,000 customers who've
registered for that product. So we are still trying to innovate in an environment that will meet customer needs. And I
think your question is a great question because at the end of the day, the only way you have a sustainable business is to
be able to grow our customer base.

Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Good morning. David, I was wondering [indiscernible] (39:02) comments about, I know
this is wrapped up into your general NIM guidance. But can you talk to us about the, if rates stay as low as they are, the
impact from the 10-year – whether it's on what your go-to reinvestment yields are, where premium amortization was
this quarter, and where it goes and any effect on the pension expense for next year?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, let me start with the last one first. So pension clearly is rate driven and we'll have to see
what that looks like. I would caution you, we were low last year about this time and rates kind of spiked towards the
end of the year which helped everybody's pension calculation. So it's a little premature, but you're spot on, a lower rate
environment does cause an increase net-net of pension expense. So we're going to watch that. It's too early to give you
guidance on it. It will be embedded in what we'll give you later on in the year when we start going to the last couple of
conferences.
I think from an overall NIM standpoint, rates are lower than what we had anticipated right now. We've done a lot of
modeling to figure out what that might mean to us and we've given you the guidance for the fourth quarter in that 1% to
3%, which may persists into the first quarter. So we think we can do that 1% to 3%, maybe even through that first
quarter.
And I'll tell you, Ken, this has been so volatile. We just need to wait and give this a little bit of time and see what
happens. If you look at really the domestic economy, everything points to higher rate environment, but you have to start
factoring in the geopolitical issues that are going on, the economies around the world, and so we're in a tough spot, and
of course what the Fed's going to do over time. So we think that's – we believe rates will increase at some point, timing
of which is uncertain. We continue to be asset sensitive. We think that's the right thing to do. But if rates stay low
longer, we will continue, as everybody else will, to have pressure on NII and resulting margin. But that 1% to 3% right
now, I think, could carry us a couple of quarters.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: And within that, can you just tell us what the premium amortization number is for this
quarter? And is that built is – is any change to that built into your outlook?
<A - David J. Turner>: It is. Our premium amortization did increase a bit over the quarter. We were about $40 million
of amortization this quarter, and I think last quarter was $33 million – $36 million, I'm sorry, $36 million. So it did pick
up a bit. But that is built into our overall guidance.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. And then my other question is just about, you have still a couple of sizeable loan
categories that continue to shrink well past I think anyone's original expectations whether it's the owner occupied
bucket, the commercial real estate mortgage and then the second lien home equity, any line of sight in terms of finally
getting to the bottom on those categories from originations versus run-off perspective?
<A - David J. Turner>: Ken, let's take owner occupied real estate. That generally is our small business customer and
small business formation has been down in 2014 quite a bit. And we really need to see and want to see the demand
from that customer. It is our bread and butter. It is really a segment that we can demonstrate our Regions 360 that we
talked about just a minute ago with Marty's question and a lot of services that customer base needs. The problem is, we
just don't see that demand. We see reluctance as we talk to those customers in terms of wanting to borrow for
expansion, given all the uncertainties that exist. Whether it's political, whether it's domestic, whether it's what's going
on in Europe, all kind – Ebola, all kind of issues are factoring in to the concerns of the small business owner.

So we're going to work really hard, have been. We're going to step it up even more so in terms of that owner occupied
base to deal with what the main issue is and that is amortization. Those have a tendency to be term loans that amortize,
and so you have to have production going just to stay even. So we think we can slow that decline.
In the home equity second lien, some of that has been – a lot has been refinanced away, some of it's deleveraging by the
consumer. We have started to see that pace of decline, to decline slower than it has been over the early part of the year.
Some of that has gone into our new product, our home equity loan product. And so we think those are the two, we hope
over time in the balance of 2015, that we see those declines slow down, and that married with the production we think
we can have a reasonable forecast of loan growth in 2015. That of which we will update you on again towards the end
of the year.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: For all that color, David, I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from Sameer Gokhale of Janney Capital Markets.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Hi, thank you. Good morning. A couple of questions. The first one, just to go back to the
buybacks, and I was curious about your thinking behind buybacks, why you didn't buy back any stock, it looks like in
Q2 and Q3, clearly you had the authorization in place certainly for this quarter, but how are you thinking about
buybacks? I mean you are going to buy back more stock, but why didn't you buy back anything in Q2? Just help me
think about that, given that loan growth, I don't think it was particularly strong. So were you anticipating faster growth,
and how should we think about that? It just seems like you have lot of excess capital, so your perspective would be
helpful.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I'll say a few words and ask David to do it. I mean we put our capital plan together
roughly a year ago, it was in the fourth quarter of last year and we put that capital plan together. We clearly had to
make some assumptions around what we thought the forecast for economic activity was going to be, and quite frankly
some of the things have turned out better than we forecasted, some worse. Clearly the economy's recovery has been
slower than we anticipated. Our organic loan growth has not been as strong as we had thought that they would
potentially be at that point in time and alternative investments have not turned out to be as strong as we might have
liked.
That being said, we were very confident in our plan. We felt like it gave us an awful lot of flexibility. We thought it put
us in a position to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, strengthen our capital position, and we were confident in
that plan and we've been executing that plan. And as David said, now we're at a point where we're ready to finish off
the task that we had put into that plan. I know there's been some questions about why we planned it that way and why
we back end loaded this. But again, we used the best forecast we thought we had and we still are confident it was a
good plan. David?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I think going into the year, our loan growth, if you go back to the first quarter, loan
growth was more robust for us. We really want to deploy our capital to grow our business. We think that's why the
shareholders gave us the capital to begin with. Giving it back to the shareholders is what we will do when we haven't
been able to deploy it otherwise. So we put it intentionally in the back half – in the back half of the plan and we had no
objection to that plan and we're executing it in accordance with that. Once you build the plan and submit the plan, that's
what the plan is, there's not really an opportunity to go back and change that plan easily. So we're going to execute
accordance with it and you should see us wrap that up by the first quarter of 2015.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, I am going to ask you a question that's more of a high
level question, and one that I could probably ask CEOs of other banks, as well, Grayson. But one of – what I'd love to

get your perspective on is that you and other banks have been focused on the efficiency ratio and lowering expenses.
And of course I think in any cycle, at any given point in time banks would like to be more efficient rather than less
efficient. That goes without saying. But having said that, if you think about your business and you look about and you
think about the environment we're in, it sounds like you might with your reductions in head count – and this probably
applies more generally across the board – it suggests that you and other CEOs really aren't very optimistic at all about
growth going forward. And I know the hope is that interest rates, at some point, will increase and give a top line
benefit. But having said that, from a business planning standpoint, I mean, how do you think about continuing to reduce
head count going forward in terms of running the business? You seem to be planning for more of a continued
slowdown going forward. Is that accurate, and I'd just love to get your thoughts on that? Thank you.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I appreciate the question. I think it's a great question. I think it's one a lot of banks are
trying to answer. I think my answer would be more optimistic than the picture you just painted. I think that we are
seeing the opportunity to grow our business. We are seeing in the markets we operate in, given the strengths of the
market that we operate in, we believe we've got an opportunity to grow our business. And we do believe that while the
economy is improving slowly, it still is improving, and we're seeing signs of that improvement across all of our
markets.
I've said it internally and I will say it externally, we've made a lot of progress, but we still have a lot of work to do. I
don't believe we've even started to really demonstrate what the power of this franchise can be going forward. I think the
progress we've made in 2014 really lays a solid foundation for what we can potentially do in 2015. But we're growing
customers, we're growing households, we're growing our business. I think the third quarter was slower from a loan
demand than we had anticipated. But if the trend continues, we're more optimistic for the fourth quarter knowing what
we know today.
So all that being said, as optimistic as we are, we still have to be prudent and I think that we have to have this balanced
approach to both investing to grow, but looking for efficiencies around the company that allow us to , you will, be able
to hedge that, hedge that forecast.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Okay.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I would add, I do think the investments in the people that we made, I mentioned that on
the comments roughly 183 during the quarter, but we have done some things to cut back on head count so we had
consolidated 30 branches, we started that in the fourth quarter last year and finished up in the first quarter of 2014. And
when we do that, we have a reduction in staffing levels as a result of that. So that's an example of where we use excess
capital, we take a charge for that, but then we're able to consolidate to get a reasonably quick payback as we
consolidate and take those customers from one branch into another.
So just looking at head count numbers can be a little misleading in terms of what our commitment is to grow our
business because we believe our biggest opportunity is revenue growth and we'll get that by making prudent
investments in people and businesses going forward.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Moreover, it's not just people, I mean, our physical footprint, we're down under 15 million
square feet. We continue to find opportunities to reduce our physical footprint by 10% to 15% a year. And we think
that continues. You know we're operating a smaller physical presence, a lot of branches are smaller. We have fewer
branches, we also are doing the same thing in office space. And in our back offices we're continuing to consolidate
space and just there's a number of different examples of the way we're trying to make sure we've got efficiency across
the company.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Okay, thank you again. I appreciate your response because I know I could have asked pretty
much any CEO and your perspective is very helpful. And then just the last quick one if I may, your capital markets
pipeline in Q4, I know the revenues were up a little bit, but do you see that strength continuing into Q4? Thank you.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I think we've made a pretty sizeable investment in people and product in our capital
management group and our capital markets group. And obviously one of the biggest products in that group has been –
in this interest rate environment it's not been there for us, but I think you know a little movement in rates and we can

Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James.
<Q - Michael E. Rose>: Hey, good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael E. Rose>: Just going back to expenses, how should we think about the environmental costs? Are we
back close to pre-cycle normalized levels or there's more levers that you can pull to reduce some of those costs?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, Michael, we always can reduce cost and build efficiencies. We do that, we have a whole
team and that's what they're focused on, helping each business, each support area, look at how we might improve work
flow. It gets harder from where we are. We've worked over the past few years reducing our overall expenses to support
our business. But that being said, we can continue to do that.
Over time, we've mentioned our overall efficiency ratio being with the rate increase in the 55% to 60% area. We're at
63% and change today. We have a group that we've invested in, it's a Six Sigma group that is looking for our process
improvement to do two things. One, to increase revenue, and we mentioned that I think on our last call where we've
changed process and it helped us increase revenue in things like indirect auto. And we've also used them to help from
an efficiency standpoint on the cost side. So I think we can always look at how to improve there. We have had changes
in our OREO, with held for sale kind of credit related expenses there. We had some benefits through gains on sale that
don't repeat and those are harder to replace. We do focus on consulting expense. We focus on our legal expense and all
those we have opportunities to continue to wind down or reduce over time.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: And Michael, I would tell you that I agree with everything David said, but there's one
additional area, if you look at the investment we've made in risk management and compliance of – in this space a lot of
new rules and as we've gone through those new rules and regulations, we've used awful lot of human resource to ensure
compliance with those rules and regulations. And as we have opportunity to invest in technology and recognize a lot of
these processes there's going to be some efficiencies, and that's a tremendous effort in part of our company today is to
find out how we can improve compliance and risk efficiencies through automation.
<Q - Michael E. Rose>: Okay, that's helpful. And then Grayson as a follow up, you've historically talked about having
a more balanced loan mix between business and consumer. Can you update us on any thoughts there and what the puts
or takes are getting that over time? Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah. We've been stating that desire strategically for some time that we'd love to achieve a
greater balance between business and consumer on our balance sheet in terms of loans outstanding. We've made a
tremendous number of investments in consumer lending products to try to accelerate that remixing, if you will, of the
balance sheet. As you've seen, we've not been particularly successful at that that business loans have been. There's been
more demand on the business loan side of our customer base. And as a consequence our progress in that regard has
been somewhat muted.
Long term we still have that as a strategic desire on our part to achieve a better mix. That being said, we have to take
advantage of what the market offers us in any given economy. And so still a goal that we're working on. But not there
yet.

Your next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good morning. My first question just on the LCR, David. How much is the securities
portfolio going to grow as you march towards compliance in 2015? Or are we really going to see a remix of your
balance into HQLA? And I assume that the 1 basis point to 3 basis points in terms of forward guidance for the NIM
considers that?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah. Erika, it did in fact consider that. We see very little change in mix. I was trying to
address that earlier in my comments that we've kind of – we have pretty large securities book. We were happy with the
rules that came out, and we don't see any problems becoming compliant in 2016 without any meaningful changes to our
balance sheet mix. So you shouldn't expect any type of significant change or increase in our securities book.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And just wanted to follow up to Ken's question, another institution had helped us
think about the potential incremental cost of funding your pension next year by giving us some guidance for every 25
basis point in increase in the discount rate that that would turn into an incremental cost of X, could you similarly help
us think about that impact next year?
<A - David J. Turner>: We will. I don't have that committed to memory. We do have some sensitivity in our 10-K
that would be a little helpful in terms of what the change in the discount rate does. So that would be a place that you
could go look. But I'll have List and Dana follow up on that.

Your next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Security (sic) [Wells Fargo Securities] (59:40).
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning, Grayson, thanks for taking my question. Just, David, maybe a question for
you. You noted 100 basis point increase in the curve would generate about $160 million of incremental NII. If I'm
reading the 10-Q correctly, that's up from about $111 million three months ago, could you give us a little more color as
to what the components were that drove that increase?
<A - David J. Turner>: Matt, I'm not sure what you're looking at. You should have actually seen it come down. We
had about 6% change in NII as a result of 100 basis point parallel shift, which was about $190 million the quarter
before coming down to about $160 million. I think is what that should have. We'll go back and take a look at that. But
we essentially took a little bit of our asset sensitivity off with trying to protect ourselves a little bit on the down rate
environment. It proved to be the right move given where we are today. But I think that it's really we're still pretty asset
sensitive at about 5% of NII, so we took one point off in round numbers from the second quarter to the third quarter.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay, my apologies, I'll follow up with List on that. And then just on fee revenue, a couple of
the other banks that have already reported have suggested even though it's very early days in the fourth quarter the
lower rate environment has actually generated some positive growth in refinancing volume. And I'm curious if you can
give us some color as to how you're thinking about the mortgage banking fee revenue line heading into the fourth
quarter?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I mean, absolutely we've been looking at the mortgage rates and the opportunity as rates
have moved to a more favorable position for that business that the refinance opportunity could accelerate. I would say

that we haven't seen that shift yet, but we do anticipate that if the rates continue to stay at this level that over the next
few weeks we'll see an increase in refinance. As you may recall, refinance has been a lower percentage of our
production than most of our peers, and so it'll probably have a more muted impact on us than some of the peers that
you're looking at. But we do anticipate an increase in refinance activity. But it also makes home affordability for the
repurchase better as well. So we think it's good for the mortgage business. I'll ask David, do you want to give any
specific comments on it?
<A - David J. Turner>: I think, one, we need to let this settle a bit and see whether the mortgage rates actually follow
and for how long. It takes a while for all that to get into the market. Clearly, if you're resetting 15-year rates in the 3%
range or below and 30 year rates in the 4% range or slightly underneath that, you'll see another wave of refinance
activity. If you look at our supplement on page nine, you'll see our refinance activity did pick up a bit in the second
quarter, sorry, the third quarter; we're up about 7% from where we were in the second quarter. It's hard to tell though
whether that's just really rate driven or normal activity coming through in the third quarter. So we are looking into that.
We'll give you better guidance as we see what the impact might be.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: That's helpful color. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of ABC (sic) [RBC] (01:03:43).
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Good morning. The first question is circling back to your comments about loan growth.
Clearly, on a year-over-year basis the loan growth has been very muted, and it's below the industry loan growth as
evidenced by the H.8 data we received from the Federal Reserve on a weekly basis. Would you say that the slower loan
growth is more due to your customers? You indicated some of your customers are still concerned about the operating
environment, or is it more your more conservative underwriting standards that you are using that maybe your
competitors are not?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think it's a combination of factors. I think one is that most of the loan growth over the
past several quarters has been in the upper end of commercial middle market and into the corporate space, which we're
very active there. But candidly the bulk of our business has been in the middle market and into the small business
owners. And we mentioned a moment ago, I think David spoke about it, we've not seen the strength of the small
business owner come back yet like we have other parts of the business.
So I think, one, is just the mix of our customer base has caused us to be a little bit more muted or more moderate than
some of our competitors. I think also given what this organization has gone through over the past several years, we're
just very disciplined, very prudent about credit underwriting at this juncture and so we would attribute part of our
differential between some of the peers to be that credit culture that we've tried to build at this company. And I think the
third issue and we alluded to it earlier. There were a number of one-off transactions in third quarter that we had not
anticipated and are not a normal part of our portfolio and that was a factor. And I think the last point was that we did
just see and I think many competitors acknowledge this as well is third quarter was more moderate than anticipated.
All that being said, again, we're pretty optimistic at this juncture given the way the last month of the quarter performed
and the way the early days of the next quarter are starting to perform. So we feel better today about where the economy
is heading.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Grayson, have you seen any evidence? Obviously, you guys monitor your customer base
very carefully, over the years that you're actually losing customers to competitors because they're being much more
aggressive in their underwriting standards.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: No, I would say that we think that our numbers would indicate very clearly, we're still
growing our customer base and still deepening the relationships we have with existing customers. And we spend an

awful lot of time not only analyzing transactions that we win, but also transactions we lose. And quite frankly we aren't
winning as many prospect transactions as we'd like to and that's probably true of every competitor we've got. We all are
wanting to win new customer relationships that make sense for the customer, make sense for us. I would say that we've
seen more non-bank competitors into our space than we've seen before. There's a tremendous amount of liquidity in the
marketplace, and so you do see not only competition from non-banks, but you see competition from the debt markets.
And that being said, we have to compete and we have to adjust and we're doing that. And our loan growth may be more
moderate than we anticipated, but we still have growth and we still anticipate growing our outstandings.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And then my other question is on the capital, obviously your capital ratios are very strong
with your Basel III Tier 1 number again over 11%. Do you guys ever see a day when you can give back more of that,
so that it comes down to a number you are more comfortable with? You look at your return on equity today on a stated
book basis and it's around – it's under 8%, your stock obviously trades at a discount to book suggesting you are not
earning your cost of capital. I know on return on tangible common equity you're up over 9%. But how do you get rid of
all this excess equity? When you look out over the next three years, let's say, because I know CCAR has a lot to do
with how much you can give back, and you are limited to maybe your earnings in a current year. But what do you guys
envision on how to get rid of that excess equity to get ROE up to a point where your stock can trade above book value?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yes, Gerard, this is David. It's a great question. And I'll tell you, I'd rather have that problem
than being on the other side of the fence.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: I agree.
<A - David J. Turner>: Which is where we were at times. So we do acknowledge that having excess capital is not
doing any good and that we need to have an optimal capital stack. That means not only in total, but the components that
make up that. And we will adjust that over time in both the components of the capital stack as well as the sheer number.
It's obviously a little more difficult to work given how we have to approach capital or at least how we perceive we need
to approach capital relative to CCAR. But how we manage our capital, that's our call, that's what our board does, we
have a whole process. And I do think over time you will see that, those capital numbers rationalize. It will be through a
combination of utilizing that capital to grow our business, which is really what we want to do when the opportunity is
there.
We talked about having the acquisitions of product lines, like we did our credit card portfolio a few years ago. We
looked at using that capital to buy non-banks. We've been looking at bank acquisitions when those opportunities arise,
and then returning it to the shareholders, so that we don't keep piling it up because we realize the return on tangible
common over time with the denominator continuing to grow becomes pretty difficult. So we will and do envision the
time where we can rationalize.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But I think you're looking at it in – I think we're in a transition phase. Our capital planning
process has gotten much more formal, much more sophisticated and our confidence in that capital [ph] planning
(1:11:04) process is much higher today and it continues to improve. And at the same time, we've, de-risked our loan
portfolio tremendously, and so we have more confidence in how our loan portfolio performs going forward. All those
are things that give us confidence in how to best deploy the capital and at what level to deploy it. As we get a better
economy, it would be our hope that we'd have more organic opportunities to deploy that capital. But I also think as the
economy recovers that we are going to have opportunities, as David said, to acquire and how you define what we
acquire will be mix of opportunities. But I think at the end of the day if those things don't prove to fruition then we
have the opportunity to return that to the shareholder in the form of dividends or buybacks. And I think that we're in a
transition, it's a little bit uncertain, but it gets more certain each and every day.
<A - David J. Turner>: Gerard, one last thing, you mentioned cost of capital. One of – our goal clearly is to reduce
our cost of capital and that comes with a good sustainable performance, solid performance quarter in and quarter out,
such that our cash flows are more predictable and we think we've done that, but the market's saying not quite yet. And
we hope over time the market realizes our sustainability of this cash flow to get our cost of capital down, and again
optimizing the capital stack would be another way to get that cost of capital down, and we'll do that.

Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.
<Q - Geoff Elliott>: My questions have already been answered. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. Just a quick question on margin. Can you give a little more color on the increase
in the interest bearing deposit costs in the quarter? It looks like a couple of items went up including your CD costs by
about 4 bps or so, I wanted to get a little bit of detail on why we are starting to see a lift in some of these deposit items.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, there's really no story there. I mean that could just be mix on a given customer, we have
run some tests to try and see what might happen to go a little longer on some CDs in particular, to see what the market's
acceptability to have some of those. That could be a piece of it. There's really not a – there's not a big story there or a
trend that you should expect going forward there.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But we have run some market tests. Obviously one of the risks we have is when rates go
up, what sort of pressure does that put on customer deposits and we've run a number of sensitivity tests in some
markets to be able to prove our theories, and so you will see some of that interest rate numbers individually go up as a
result of some of those tests. But it's temporary in nature and overall our deposit cost continues to remain stable.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay, all right. And then secondly also on the margin, on the securities yield, just want to
confirm that the bulk of that 11 basis points decline linked quarter, what drove that and how much of that was premium
amortization in terms of the bps impact on the yield? And then also curious about your new pricing or your pricing on
your new auto loan originations or spreads if you can't give us the upfront yields? Thanks.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, so the securities yield being down 11 basis points is obviously reinvesting in this lower
rate environment, but the premium amortization is also about half of that number. We did also shift out of our corporate
bonds as spreads changed and we think that that was the right thing to do. So you can see our corporate bond portfolio
will have declined. You asked about auto spreads. There is really no change there. Obviously it's a very competitive
environment [indiscernible] (1:15:31) in indirect auto. But we had about 7 basis points contraction during the quarter,
but we still feel good about that overall yield and spread that we have. I think you can just see those can change on
depending on what mix you're putting on the books, but our overall yield on that indirect, as you see in our supplement,
is [ph] 339 versus 346 (1:15:57) last quarter.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, as that market segments become more competitive, we have adjusted our pricing
strategies to ensure that we've got the right mix of tenor and rate, and that it's appropriately risk based priced. And so,
you will see a little bit of shift in yield as we sort of adjust our strategy because we want to make sure that we're staying
in the right part of that market.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay, thanks for taking my questions. I know the call is running long.

<Q - Dick X. Bove>: Hi, good morning. I'm sorry to ask you a question after such a long meeting. But I'm looking at
these peer to peer companies and considering the fact that apparently the GSEs are now going to buy mortgages that
have 3% to 5% down payments. And given your large, if you will, customer base in the, we'll say, the under-banked,
I'm wondering if a bank can get into the peer to peer business, number one, and number two, if this reduction in the
down payment to nonqualified mortgage levels allows some opportunity there?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Dick, you are real familiar with the markets we operate in across the southeast and we
think it's a valuable franchise because of those markets. But we obviously operate in some rural communities, where
the opportunities are a little different maybe than some of our peers see. And I do think that there are ample
opportunities in our market to be able to bank some customers that typically would not have qualified for mortgages
and we have been – we've been very methodical about the way we've approached that market and prudent about it.
Obviously if the GSEs are going to change the rules, we're watching that very closely. It would appear – we're reading
some of the same reports you are, appear that you are pretty close to the agreement on how to do that and what the rules
are on that. And I think we're very interested if we can understand the rules and agree what risk we're taking. If we can
make the economics work out on it then we're encouraged. And so I do think you're absolutely correct, it's an
opportunity for our franchise.
<Q - Dick X. Bove>: And the company I was thinking, I mean this lending club is about to go public, and I was
looking at the prospectus and they are charging up to 20% rates on people who have FICO scores in the mid 600s, and
they are not making the loans, they're shifting the loan, they are a facilitator, so other people make these loans, and they
are taking, in some cases, as much as 6% overrides for finding the loans. And I'm just wondering would a bank ever be
allowed to be a facilitator like that where it simply shifts the loans to other buyers and take the fee for finding the
customer underwriting the loan and sending it along?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, that's a great question and we have every one of these, if you will, the sort of
technology based lending solutions whether it's peer to peer or whether it's just a origination position, we've taken a lot,
we've taken a hard look at every one of them. And I think it's a good question. Quite frankly we've got a number of
competitors who – that their rules of engagement are different than ours. And so today in our environment, some of that
type of lending I just think we have to stay away from. But that being said, there's still a lot of opportunity in that space
and we've got a team of really talented people that continue to look at it. We think innovation is a big part of how we
bank the consumer going forward on both the deposit and the lending side, and some of these solutions that you're
seeing are going to play out and some of them aren't. And it's our challenge to try to figure out who the winners and
losers are in that space.
<A - David J. Turner>: Dick, this is David. You had mentioned really banking kind of funding somebody else, what
we would like to and are looking at is how those parties actually bring the customer to the table, so that those are our
customers where we can have a deeper relationship than whatever that one-off loan is. And so that really seems to be
the better alternative versus being a funding agent, if you will, for somebody else's customers. But as Grayson
mentioned, things are changing pretty rapidly and we have to be able to adapt and deal with this on a prudent basis, and
obviously within the confines of the regulatory regime that we have.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But a lot of financial products are moving out of traditional banking space, and we've got
to learn to compete with them, but compete under the rules that we operate under.
<Q - Dick X. Bove>: Anyway, thank you very much.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, that's our last question. And we appreciate everyone's participation, everyone's interest and we'll stand
adjourned. Thank you.
