Thanks, Trey, and good morning. During the first quarter, Baker Hughes delivered increased earnings in the face of
some challenging market conditions. This outcome is the result of solid execution across the enterprise, leading to
improved operating efficiency and accelerated delivery of innovative new products and services around the world.
Let me quickly share a few highlights. In Africa, newly-won work in Angola and Ghana is generating strong growth
and helping to extend our share in critical deepwater markets. In Nigeria, we are deploying our latest reservoir
evaluation technologies leading to outstanding results.
Performance in Africa has been excellent and helped us to offset some of the worst winter weather we have ever
experienced in the North Sea and Russia. In the Middle East, our people did a great job getting our Iraq operation back
to work safely and efficiently following the shutdown late last year. The resumption of activity in Iraq, along with
increased drilling activity in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Malaysia and Australia, resulted in record revenue for our Drilling
Services and Drilling Fluids product lines in the Middle East, Asia Pacific segment. The strong performance of these
product lines, coupled with the rebound of our Iraq business, contributed to improved results in this segment.
In Latin America, our relentless focus on the quality of our earnings resulted in steady profitability, despite the seasonal
drop in product sales. At the same time, we continue to align our business to projects where Baker Hughes provides the
best value, where we are becoming the company of choice to execute some of the world's most challenging projects,
from heavy oil production in the Andean, to complex well constructions in deepwater Brazil.
And in the United States, we encountered a decline in the well count caused by severe weather across the Rockies and
the Northeast. Despite this challenge, we were able to deliver improved operational performance, including increased
revenues and profit margins.
Although most of the North America revenue increase can be attributed to the seasonal peak in Canada, this
improvement alone doesn't account for the sequential increase in margins. The structural improvement in our North
American profitability was accomplished by executing our plans to enhance operating efficiency and by leveraging
strong demand for newly-introduced technologies, everything from highly-customized solutions for the ultra deepwater
market, to brand-new completions and production technologies tailored to onshore shale production.
Let me share an example. Last quarter, I gave you an advanced look at SHADOW plug. This is the Completions
product that incorporates nanotechnology to reduce the time and cost to complete an unconventional well. SHADOW
plug is performing well in the United States and Canada. In some cases, customers are ordering this product on spec to
secure access to this groundbreaking technology and ensure they aren't left behind in their relentless efficiency race.
And I'm encouraged by the demand signal we are seeing for this product, which is now gaining interest in international
unconventional plays.
SHADOW plug is just one of dozens of innovative new products and services recently launched, that is early in its
product lifecycle. And it's products like these that contributed to our first quarter performance and which will support
earnings growth going forward.
These new products are made possible by our Global Products and Services group, which continues to quicken the pace
of innovation and new product delivery. The solid performance of our Global Products and Services group and growing
momentum of our operating segments has been underway for some time, as evidenced by our 10% growth in sales and
25% growth in adjusted operating profit compared to this time last year.
Also during the quarter, we took actions to support future earnings growth. We strengthened our alliance with CGG and
announced an exclusive agreement to offer RoqSCAN technology. This service adds to our reservoir evaluation
capabilities and is designed to help our customers optimize production from shale plays.
In our Industrial Services group, we announced the acquisition of a complementary Pipeline Services business, which
will add a critical new inspection technology and expand our international footprint in the rapidly growing midstream
market.
And last week, we announced the acquisition of a software technology company, strengthening our capabilities around
remote monitoring and real-time data management. The addition of these new capabilities is part of our strategy to

continue innovating and integrating new products and services supporting long-term profitable growth.
Later in today's call, I'll share my outlook for our business going forward. But first, let me turn it over to Peter for
additional details on the quarter and our guidance on the near-term. Peter?
Peter A. Ragauss
Thanks, Martin, and good morning. Today we reported adjusted net income for the first quarter of $369 million or
$0.84 per share. Adjusted net income excludes $21 million in after-tax severance costs or $0.05 per share, and an
after-tax amount of $20 million, or another $0.05 per share, for costs relating to a technology royalty agreement.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.19 or 29%.
On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to Baker Hughes for the first quarter was $328 million or $0.74 per share.
Revenue for the first quarter was $5.73 billion, an increase of $501 million or 10% compared to the same quarter last
year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.05 billion, up $154 million or 17% year-over-year.
To help in your understanding of the quarter's results, I'll bridge last quarter's earnings per share to this quarter. In the
fourth quarter we posted GAAP net income of $0.56 per share. First, add back $0.06 for severance costs, which were
highlighted in the fourth quarter, that brings us to a fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.62.
Moving to the first quarter, add $0.09 for North American operations due to actions to improve U.S. profitability,
favorable mix in the Gulf of Mexico and the seasonal activity increase in Canada. Add $0.09 for international
operations due to our resumption of activity in Iraq, which was partially offset by the seasonal decline in year-end
product sales across all regions. Subtract $0.01 for industrial due to normal seasonality in the winter months. Add $0.03
for reduced corporate expenses and add $0.02 for lower taxes and interest expense. That brings us to adjusted earnings
per share of $0.84 this quarter. To get to GAAP earnings per share of $0.74, subtract $0.05 for severance and $0.05 for
costs associated with the royalty agreement.
From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin refer
explicitly to Table 5 in our earnings release, which excludes these two adjustment items.
Taking a closer look at our results from operations, revenue in North America was $2.78 billion, up $32 million or 1%
sequentially. Compared to the prior year, revenue was up $173 million or 7%, despite the rig and well counts being up
only 1% and 4% respectively. North America operating profit was $300 million, up $59 million sequentially. As a
result, our North America operating profit margin was 10.8%, which is an improvement of 200 basis points
sequentially. The increase in revenue is almost entirely attributed to Canada, which reached peak activity levels during
the quarter.
In the U.S. onshore market, activity was impacted by severe weather across the Rockies and Northeast, resulting in
reduced revenue. However, this was offset by increased activity and favorable mix in the Permian, which included
strong sales of Drilling Services and Drill Bits. Additional growth came from sales of newly-introduced Completions
and Artificial Lift technologies across North America.
Profitability was favorably impacted by the Gulf of Mexico due to a rich mix of sales late in the quarter. This included
the deployment of new drilling and wireline technologies. Additional profit gains were also realized from the seasonal
increase in Canada, further improvement in our U.S. Pressure Pumping business and improving operating efficiencies
across the region. These improvements in profitability, in particular, the strong contribution from the Gulf of Mexico
late in the quarter resulted in North America margins rising slightly above our most recent guidance.
Moving to International results, we posted revenue of $2.63 billion, down $136 million or 5% versus the prior quarter
and up $296 million or 13% compared to a year ago. International operating profit was $347 million, which is an
increase of $20 million or 6% versus the prior quarter and up $66 million or 23% compared to the same quarter of
2013.

Our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment delivered solid revenue for the quarter as the seasonal drop in year-end product
sales was almost entirely offset by the resumption of activity in Iraq. Likewise, the sequential improvement in
profitability for this region is also the result of reduced losses in Iraq.
Our Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian segment also experienced a seasonal decline in year-end product sales, as well as
foreign exchange losses in Russia Caspian. Activity was further impacted by cool weather conditions in the North Sea
and Russia. These reductions in activity were partially offset by favorable mix in the UK and growing profitability
resulting from newly-awarded projects in West and Central Africa.
In Latin America, revenues fell sharply due to the seasonal decline in product sales along with actions we have taken to
reduce our exposure to low profitability markets. However, the decrementals were minimal due to continued efficiency
gains across the region, as well as a favorable sales mix in the Andean geomarket.
For our Industrial Services segment, we posted revenue of $321 million, up $32 million or 11% compared to the first
quarter of last year, primarily as a result of growth in our Process and Pipeline Services business. Operating profit
margins were 8.7%, up 40 basis points year-on-year.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion, which represents a sequential
decrease of $199 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was in line with the first quarter of last year, as well as our
expectations due to typical seasonal cash requirements.
Total debt increased $122 million during the quarter to $4.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with a total debt to cap
ratio of 20%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $439 million, down $94 million compared to the most recent
quarter.
And finally, we repurchased 3.4 million shares on the open market during the first quarter, totaling $200 million. This
leaves $1.45 billion remaining under our previously announced authorization to repurchase shares.
Now let me provide you with our guidance for the remainder of 2014. Our activity outlook for North America is
relatively unchanged. During the first quarter the rig count increased 6% in the Permian. We expect continued rig count
growth throughout the summer and fall leading to an increase of about 10% in this basin over the course of the year.
This growth in the Permian is expected to contribute to a 4% increase in the overall U.S. rig count for the year with an
average rig count of 1,830.
The U.S. onshore well count on the other hand declined 3% during the first quarter due to the severe weather conditions
previously highlighted. Despite this drop in wells to begin the year, our full-year forecast has not changed and we
continue to project a 5% increase in the U.S. well count this year. Turning to the U.S. offshore market, our rig count
forecast remains unchanged and is still expected to increase 5% in 2014. In Canada, we continue to project a 5%
increase in rig count for the full year. During breakup in the second quarter, rig counts are expected to average about
170 rigs.
For the second quarter in North America, we expect the seasonal activity drop in Canada to reduce our revenue and
margins. Additionally, we don't expect the rich mix of business in the Gulf of Mexico to repeat in the second quarter.
However, anticipated activity growth in the U.S. onshore market and our improving operating efficiency are expected
to partially offset the reduction in revenues and operating profit. As a result, we expect only a slight decline in our
North America revenue and margins in the second quarter.
Looking outside of North America, our international rig count forecast has been revised downwards slightly from 10%
to 9% for the year. This is due to less onshore activity projected in Latin America, specifically in Mexico. The Latin
America rig count is now expected to only rise about 2% this year. For other reasons, our rig count forecast is
effectively unchanged and we still project healthy growth in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Africa.
For the second quarter, we expect seasonal improvement in our international operations and Industrial Services leading
to modest growth in revenue and operating profit for these segments. With respect to other items such as interest
expense, corporate costs and capital expenditures, our guidance remains unchanged from our last earnings call.

To summarize, for the second quarter, we expect a seasonal drop in our North America business to be more than offset
by gains in other segments leading to earnings growth similar to the first quarter.
At this point, I will now turn the call back over to Martin. Martin?
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Peter. As we look ahead this year, we see a number of positive trends unfolding. From a macro perspective, the
environment is favorable for the industry. In its April 2014 Oil Market Report, the IEA forecasts the demand for oil to
increase by 1.3 million barrels per day. This supports our outlook for oil prices, which we project to remain stable for
the year, averaging around $100 per barrel.
Taking a look at natural gas, U.S. working gas in storage is currently 1 trillion cubic feet below the five-year average.
Getting storage levels back to average before next winter's drawdown, would require an addition of another 3 trillion
cubic feet of gas. And that sort of addition would require injection levels to approach record levels every week between
now and then.
With gas storage at this level, prices are higher than many would have guessed only a few months ago. When coupled
with favorable oil prices, this environment fares well for our customers' cash flow and spending capacity. Therefore it's
not surprising that activity is increasing in most regions of the world.
In Asia Pacific, offshore rig counts have increased to the highest level seen since 2010 with strong activity in China,
Malaysia, Vietnam and Australia. In the Middle East, a similar story is unfolding in the onshore markets, including the
highest active rig count Baker Hughes has ever reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the month of March.
And in the U.S., after several months of declining well counts, we have finally rounded the corner with well count set
to rise led by solid growth in the Permian. The need for higher technology is also rising in the Permian with more
horizontal drilling, longer laterals and greater reliance on new products like SHADOW plug. This trend of increasing
service intensity is being replicated around the world. Wells are deeper and hotter. Completions are more complex,
production curves are declining faster and the aging midstream infrastructure is working well beyond its time. All of
these trends are positive for the service industry and play particularly well to the strength of Baker Hughes. Our
strategy is to leverage new technology development and our global supply chain to convert innovation into earnings.
I would like to highlight just a few examples of the strategy in action during the first quarter. I'm extremely pleased
with our continued success in Nigeria, where we worked with some of the world's large IOCs and partner with an
emerging group of highly capable, local independents to help enable energy production in this important market. The
key to efficient development in a high cost deepwater market like this is having access to fast and accurate reservoir
knowledge. And we're seeing a growing appetite for Baker Hughes' newest reservoir evaluation services.
During the quarter, we successfully deployed a series of latest generation logging while drilling services on several
projects. This included FASTrak which is our industry leading technology which provides our customers with
downhole reservoir analysis and high quality fluid samples during the drilling process. Also during the quarter, we
completed our first GeoWave walkaway downhole seismic service in Nigeria for a major customer. When incorporated
with surface seismic data, a comprehensive geophysical model can be produced, helping to define the boundaries and
volumes in the reservoir. Helping enable production on the world's most challenging projects like these requires the
very best in technology and the ability to execute.
Brazil is a perfect example. Since we helped enabled the first horizontal presalt well there years ago, Baker Hughes has
provided drilling services for the vast majority of deepwater wells in Brazil, including at least 80% of the presalt wells.
And today, we remain the go-to service company for the toughest wells.
During the first quarter, we successfully drilled the first of several development wells on a deepwater campaign, a
unique and difficult heavy oil play. The challenge was to place a horizontal wellbore within a short interval where the
rock formation is soft and interspersed with water flow gulfs. Achieving a tight build angle in such a short interval

while maintaining wellbore stability in this difficult drilling environment was considered by many to be beyond the
technical limits of the industry.
Our solution was the integration of several advanced technologies across multiple product lines. Working closely with
the customer, we assembled a team of well construction experts and engineered a system which integrated riserless
drilling equipment, advanced drilling services to provide geosteering, high technology logging while drilling services to
measure the formation, remote monitoring to detect water flow, and a unique drilling fluid formulated to maintain bore
hole stability when using a riserless system.
Through this integrated approach and close partnership with our customer, we were able to drill the undrillable, on
target, ahead of schedule and under their budget. When it comes to complex projects like these, Baker Hughes remains
the company of choice. This continues to be the case in the Gulf of Mexico.
As a reminder, last year, we drilled the deepest well ever. A couple of quarters ago, we performed the largest
stimulation job ever, and now we have installed the deepest subsea boosting system ever. For six years, we've partnered
with a key customer to engineer and test the solution for subsea production to be deployed on an ultra deepwater well
in 8,200 feet of water. The challenge is to maximize production while reducing the cost of interventions, which can be
extraordinary in this extreme environment.
The result was a solution which integrates multiple high horsepower ESPs engineered for this particular application and
sophisticated monitoring equipment, all combined within a horizontal booster cartridge. This configuration, the first of
its kind used in the Gulf of Mexico, provides the production and recovery rates necessary to make this project
economical, with a system that can be serviced with a light well intervention vessel instead of a costly deepwater
drilling rig. This reduces maintenance cost and extends production over the life of the well.
This project is another example of our growing leadership position in the emerging ultra deepwater frontier and
demonstrates that Baker Hughes is the partner of choice when executing the world's most complex production
solutions. From highly customized deepwater projects like this to multi-well onshore field developments, the demand
for Baker Hughes' production solutions is on the rise.
This quarter in the Middle East, we were awarded a five-year contract to supply and service 400 electrical submersible
pumps to a major client, making this the largest Artificial Lift contract we have ever been awarded in this region. In
North America, FLEXPump ESPs continue to gain share in unconventional plays as the intelligent alternative to rod lift
systems, providing our customers with better reliability, greater production, and lower maintenance costs.
Combined with chemical injection services and real-time monitoring under the ProductionWave banner, the number of
FLEXPumps sold during the first quarter alone nearly exceeded the total quantity sold all of last year. Not surprisingly,
the performance of FLEXPump has caught the attention of other operators globally.
In Russia, a customer measured FLEXPump power consumption versus the competitor's [ph] VFT (23:31). Power
meters at several well sites confirm that FLEXPump utilized 20% less power than the competitor's offering and, as
such, we secured an immediate order for units to be installed this year.
The need to increase production and recovery rates is universal and fundamental to the economics of energy
production. Baker Hughes is committed to be the world leader in helping solve today and tomorrow's production
challenges. To support this vision, during the quarter, we officially opened our Artificial Lift Research and Technology
Center in Claremore, Oklahoma. This technology center is the world's most comprehensive facility dedicated to
artificial lift research and testing. The facility includes its own dedicated substation to provide enough power to
concurrently operate six artificial lift systems, up to 2,800 horsepower each in a number of vertical and horizontal flow
loops which simulate the different pressures and temperatures, fluid types and flow rates that may be encountered in a
producing well.
The power and capabilities of this center are industry leading and designed to improve the reliability and performance
of artificial lift technologies. The research effort is being led by a team of 180 of the industry's brightest engineers and
scientists, who are focused on solving the most pressing production challenges, from boosting initial production in

unconventional wells to increasing ultimate recovery rates in the ultra deepwater frontier. Our continued investment in
Claremore provides Baker Hughes with unmatched capabilities and talents to design, test and deliver future generations
of production solutions beyond anything that exists today.
The common thread to the center and each of the other projects I just highlighted is innovation. Innovation is the
cornerstone of our strategy to create long-term shareholder value. It's been at the heart of Baker Hughes for more than a
century.
But it takes more than just innovation to win in today's marketplace. It also takes execution. Execution comes from
people, people working interdependently with a sense of ownership towards a common purpose. It's execution that is
accelerating the pace of new product introductions, it's execution that is delivering strong growth in Middle East, Asia
Pacific; more profit in Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian; and less risk in our Latin America business. And it's execution
that is growing our North American margins to mid-teens during the second half of this year, and this is just the
beginning.
The transformation of Baker Hughes is behind us and we've been marching down a new path of innovation and
integration. Today, we are focused on execution with a new found sense of purpose. In exactly three weeks, at our
upcoming analyst conference, we're going to show you what innovation and execution means for the future of this
company and why we have never been more excited about our role in shaping this industry.
And with that, Trey, let's take some questions.

Thank you, Martin. At this point, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for your questions. And to give everyone a fair
chance to ask questions, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and one related follow-up question. Larissa,
can we have the first question please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. The first question is from James West from Barclays.
<Q - James C. West>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, James.
<Q - James C. West>: Martin, you've had a great call on North America so far, or at least the U.S. market especially
so far this year in terms of the Permian leading the way, and now we're getting out of the winter weather and things are
getting better in other areas of the market. Do you think that we're at a point where pricing power starts to develop for
those product lines that have been somewhat out of balance and they could come back into balance here shortly, or
we're still playing more of a utilization and volume game in North America?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No, I think James, it's a little bit more of the latter than the former. There's some pockets
of, let's say, tightness in a couple of product lines and you highlighted one, but there's some where there's still some
spare capacity. So overall, I'd say that it's getting better, it's going in the right direction, but I wouldn't bank a whole lot
on a lot of pricing traction.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay. Do you think we could see pricing as we exit the year. Is that a fair assumption or is it
too hard to call at this point?

<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, my instincts tell me that it'll be a little bit better by the end of the year than it is
now.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay. Got you. And then just one follow-up from me, on the new ESP technology that you've
been highlighting for a couple quarters now. Where do you think – or I guess can you give us some – quantify some of
your market share gains that you've had with this technology? Obviously, it's innovative, it's been adopted very rapidly,
but how much of the market – or how much of the artificial lift market is it taking so far?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: As I said in my prepared remarks, it's about twice what we did all of last year and a third
– and we'll provide a little bit more insight to that in a few weeks, James, but a third of the sales in the first quarter –
which were substantial, sequentially, from 4 to 1, in terms of total volume, but a third of those were rod lift
replacements.

<Q - Kurt Hallead>: First thing on my mind here, I just want to make sure I heard correctly. Peter, you mentioned that
you expect second quarter earnings growth to be similar to first quarter, at least that's what I thought I heard. Can you
help clarify that?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, let me be absolutely clear. Don't forget in Q4, Iraq adjusted, we were at about $0.80,
right. So the starting point is $0.80 and we went to $0.84 this quarter and we would expect a similar progression into
Q2. We do not have another Iraq coming on line, like we did, relatively speaking, between Q4 and Q1. So $0.80 to
$0.84 to similar progression.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Thanks for that clarification. The other question I had was, Martin, when you talk about the U.S.
market and the opportunity set going forward, can you give us an update on where you think industry-wide spare
capacity is for frac right now? And as we progress into the second half of the year, how much additional absorption do
you think we may be able to see, given your rig count and well count forecasts?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a question we're all trying to figure out exactly. I would say that we're at around
10% across the U.S., a little bit worse in Canada in terms of spare capacity at this point. And a little bit to James' earlier
question, there are a couple basins where essentially there's no spare capacity and there's some that, of course, a lot
higher than the 10% within the U.S. market.
And in terms of going forward, very similar answer to the previous one, it's going in the right direction. In a couple of
those basins, there's customers working hard to try to schedule the fleets that they need to get the work done. But like I
say, in some of the others, there is plenty of capacity on the weekends and I think the markets from this point out with
our forecast, we may be more towards of better balance by the end of the year, less than 10%, I think the question is
how much capacity comes in. We just can't predict it any tighter than that.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. Then, I think you guys have given some indications to investors and ourselves about
hitting the mid-teens margin in North America. I wanted to get an update from you on your thoughts. Obviously, you're
well along that progression here at 11% for the first quarter, close to 11% for the first quarter, so can you give us an
update on your thoughts on that mid-teens target? And then in conjunction with that, Martin, maybe an update on
where you may stand in terms of 24/7 ops as a percent of your frac fleets right now?

<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. Let me take your last one first. We were around say 55% in Q4 of the stages
pumped around 24 hours. We got close to 60% in Q1 and we remain committed to getting close to 70% later this year.
In terms of your question around the mid-teens, we feel very, very confident as we have been – as we told you a couple
of quarters ago. I'd say you can pretty much put it into four buckets, Kurt. First, there is an increasing well count, as
you highlighted, and there is an increasing intensity on those wells, service intensity, given the increasing mix to the
horizontal sign and that'll play well into our well house.
Second, we had a good quarter in the Gulf of Mexico in Q1. I think it'll get better from here on out, and particularly the
second half as the mix continues to move more towards completions. Our three vessels in the Gulf of Mexico are fully
utilized and expected to remain that way.
Third, we're going to have continue improvement in the Pressure Pumping business for Baker Hughes. We're doing a
lot of the things we said we were going to do. It's moving in the right direction. Some of them go faster than the others,
but that business line is put together its sixth consecutive quarter of improving margins, and no reason that that's going
to stop.
And then lastly, I think most significantly is the absorption of some of the new technologies, whether it's AutoTrak
Curve, whether it's the cemented FracPoint, whether it's FLEXPump and ProductionWave, Kymera bits. These sell for
significantly higher margins than the products that they're obsoleting. And so, you put those altogether, no reason to be
anything but fully confident that we'll hit our target.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, that's great. Appreciate that answer. Thanks.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Byron Pope from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: Good morning. Martin, just following on your responses to that question on the North
American margin progression, and then thinking about the rig count forecast of U.S. onshore of 4% and U.S. offshore
of 5%. And with your technology uptake and your positioning in both the Gulf of Mexico and then the key U.S.
onshore basin, is it reasonable to think about the top line growth in those U.S. onshore and Gulf of Mexico buckets as
exceeding the rig count forecast in terms of how you guys think about it?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Simple answer to that is, yes, that's what I would expect.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: Okay. And then, you guys just had solid results in the Eastern Hemisphere for a while now. I
had thought about the Middle East/Asia Pacific region as potentially being the most robust top line driver for Baker
Hughes this year, but it sounds as though [ph] you're saying (35:37) meaningful traction in offshore West Africa in
your business model, and Russia continues to involve. So, as you think about your Eastern Hemisphere markets,
Middle East/Asia Pacific versus Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian, how do you think about the growth prospects in the
Eastern Hemisphere in those two regions and which one leads the charge this year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We have a pretty good rivalry going between those two super regions in the East, so I
don't know if I want to tip my hand to which one's going to outpace the other. But I'll tell you that both are really
coming along nicely and both of those super regions have some really nice work and opportunities ahead of them.
The Middle East is – and you can hear from everybody – being led by the Kingdom there, and we highlighted the
highest rig count that we've ever recorded in Saudi Arabia, and that's likely to continue. They're doing a lot of good
work, the gas business and the unconventionals, but we shouldn't forget there's other countries in the Middle East. The
UAE and Kuwait in particular, I think, are also increasingly trying to bolster their spare capacity.

China would be right there in the mix. But if we move further west, and as you've highlighted, particularly West Africa
has set up really nice for Baker Hughes over the last 12 months. We've got fabulous leadership from the very top all the
way down within the respective countries. We're indigenous, we're local, we understand the customers. The deal
markets there are really gaining traction as are the product lines. We have some very nice growth projected in Angola, a
lot of nice wins in deepwater.
As you move down around the horn, our position on wireline and drilling services and completions in both South
Africa as well as Mozambique are strong. So West Africa, as you highlighted, and the Middle East, and not only Saudi
Arabia, are going to be two – the biggest hot spots we have. That all said, as we've highlighted on previous calls,
Norway is still a significant revenue driver for this company, a big completions contract kicking in in the second half,
which will run for, well, five-year plus, and Russia has come on extremely strong in the last couple of quarters, both in
terms of top line and margins. So it's easy to find the ones that are really growth positive versus some of the soft spots,
if you will.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: So, Martin, the Permian obviously has been quite strong and likely stronger than
everyone's expectations, and still remains the main engine of growth. Can you talk to us a little bit about your
wherewithal to capture that growth in light of what appear to be pretty tight labor constraints and what labor constraints
are you confronting if any and what are you doing to rectify those?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a great question, Bill. So the Permian is at the heart of our North American
business. It has been for a long time on every product line. We're well situated, got great relationships with the
operators and the application of technology I think in the Permian, it's very ripe as these stack plays continue to surprise
to the upside.
And to your labor question, it's an issue for everyone there. I'll tell you that the Baker Hughes brand attracts a lot of
talent. It's for a variety of reasons, depending on whatever you're looking for. But if you're looking for more than a
Permian opportunity, if you're looking for a wide product line portfolio to participate in, it's a company you're going to
want to work for. And that's all the way down the food chain, from our field crews all the way to our management and
engineers.
The other thing I would put in there, Bill, is that we're getting a lot better at the efficiency side of the business on a
couple of fronts and the stimulation side the most, where we're still in the learning curve. And we're getting more stages
per day on a per head count if you will and per fleet, so attracting talent out there is a challenge for everyone. I think
we're doing better than most, and the ability to effectively and appropriately leverage that talent to get the work done.
It's going in the right direction, so I feel good about it.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. So my understanding is that you were, for a part of Q1, sold out in the Permian not
necessarily due to horsepower because of labor. But it sounds as if you don't necessarily have any concerns about
meeting the continued onslaught of growth because of the efficiencies that you're realizing.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Do I have concerns? I'm paid to worry about everything. So, I have concerns about
everything. But I can tell you that our folks out there are managing it pretty effectively and I'm not worried about us,
let's say, not being able to take care of our customers or generate our numbers because of labor.

<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And then secondly, with regard to your updated guidance, you upgraded your U.S.
land rig forecast, but you left your well count forecast the same, up 5%. And you referenced overall well count
declining year-over-year, but if you can focus on the horizontal well count for a second in relationship to the horizontal
rig count, and at least on our numbers, the well count increased by over 25% year-over-year versus a rig count increase
of 13%. So on that particular front, efficiencies clearly are being realized to a significant extent. Would you agree with
that?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes. I would. Completely.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Great quarter.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Thanks, Bill.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Jim Crandell from Cowen.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Thank you. Martin, I had a couple of questions about U.S. Pressure Pumping. Number one,
could you talk to the progress that you're making in differentiating your frac offering and your attempts to add more
technology in that operation? And then secondly, also on U.S. Pressure Pumping, how far are we along in all of the
self-help measures in Pressure Pumping to improve profitability. Are we getting toward the end of that or is there still a
fair amount you can do to improve profitability through internal means there?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay. Good morning, Jim. I would say that – let me take the second part of our question.
In terms of how much runway is left, it depends on the activity, if you remember when we started these initiatives, a lot
of it was redeploying the assets, building infrastructure. Now that's essentially completed.
On the other end of the spectrum, Jim, what's intimately perfectible is your contracts, your contract management, the
customer mix you're working for, and there, we're still in the early innings, but it's already paying dividend. And in
between, if we had issues around supply chain, improving logistics, freight, repair and maintenance, I'd say these are
half to maybe three-quarters where they need to be, but you never give up on being more efficient on any of those
elements.
The technology side, in terms of moving the margin, had a lot to do with self-help initiatives around what we call dry
on the fly and some other activities. Probably most of that was realized in the first quarter and all of it will be realized
in the second quarter as the units will allow. So, it's a continuum. Infrastructure and repositioning of fleet's completely
done and contract management and customer mix is still in the early stages and everything else in between.
And in terms of technology around Pressure Pumping, it's on a variety of fronts. Besides the self-help, implementation
of technology to reduce cost or improve efficiency, there's areas around fluid design, fluid chemistry. We're really
excited by something called Ultra Sorb, which is a proppant-like material developed by our own chemists and chemical
engineers and scientists, has crush properties similar to proppant, and yet has the ability to take care of the produced
fluid and reduce particulates and flocculation and things like that. It's a brilliant technology. It's in its early stages, but
you can imagine hacking the fractures with chemistry at the coal face, if you will, to prevent problems from occurring
in terms of precipitation. It's something that we're pretty excited about. You'll hear more about it in a few weeks.
And then lastly, Pressure Pumping is all about tying to other product lines. Now, I wouldn't want to be in that business
by itself because we see it as the ultimate connector between wireline, completions, drilling services, reservoir
evaluation, production engineering, and artificial lift. It is the center of our world in many ways, and it stimulates
technology in some of the other areas based on what we can do in fracking.
So, OptiPort, infinite number of stages that can be applied through coiled-tubing-activated sleeves, is rapidly evolving
and developing in itself because of what we're able to do on the fracking side. So, a lot of technology for fracking, but I
think the way to look at it is what fracking does for some of the other product lines.

<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: That was a good answer.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Did I answer your question?
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Thanks, Martin. Just as a related follow-up, and my second question has to do with Iraq. And
have you had enough experience now drilling in Iraq that excluding the possibility of sort of unrest in the region
hurting your operations there, do you have enough experience with the drilling of the wells that you're feeling confident
on your performance over there and your ability to make your so-called budget, I guess, or your expectations in terms
of the project as the wells are being drilled on a turnkey basis?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: The short answer to your question, Jim, is yes. The learning curve has been expensive
and painful in a couple of different ways, but our drilling performance has dramatically improved. I think what's critical
there, as I've said before, I have zero appetite for additional projects with the terms and conditions that we
unfortunately signed up for before. We won't make that mistake again. The terms and conditions, the pricing, the risk
profile, there has to be better alignment between the customer community and ourselves before we'll step into those
projects. Will we step into other projects like – in terms of lump sum turnkeys? Possibly, but it will be a completely
different contract than what we have today.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Great. Good. Okay. Very helpful, Martin. Thank you.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Great. Thanks. First, congratulations on the quarter. Very well done.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Thank you.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: So Martin, I'll just ask a technical question. On North America margins in Q1 and the
contribution from wireline technology, you obviously had a 200 basis point climb, could you give us a rough idea how
much that new wireline technology contributed to the quarter as far as the sequential gain?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Honestly, I can't. I can't quantify it for you, Angie. I can tell you that it has margins that
frankly are higher than probably any other product line when that particular technology is used, and you're talking
about the deep basin in the Gulf of Mexico. But in terms of its actual basis point contribution, given the size of the
business, I can't tell you offhand, I'm sorry.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: This is Peter. But the GoM was a big contributor to the sequential improvement in operating
profit and a lot of this wireline and drilling services technology was a big part of the GoM, so Gulf of Mexico.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then when you think about your strategy for North America
land in frac, at least for 2014, not 2015, but when you think through your strategy for the year, is it fair to assume that
you would be more focused on increasing your 24/7 operations or do you think you have an opportunity to redeploy
idle equipment?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a great question, Angie. And first and foremost, we use what we have currently in
the yard and ready to work, so utilization is the number one priority and we still have more opportunity there, a lot
more. And as I've kind of highlighted in a couple of the previous questions, we're being strained in one to two basins,
but three or four other basins, utilization isn't where it needs to be. So I'd say that's the first opportunity. In terms of
reactivating horsepower, we can do that, but I don't foresee that anytime soon.

<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. Okay. Good to hear. And then on the basins, as we've discussed, Permian is clearly
tight at the moment. Is there a belief that people and equipment will be mobilized into the Permian and other basins to
somewhat neutralize or equalize the tightness there, number one? And number two, do you see any other basins that
could become as tight and as large as that region, or is the market in the U.S. going to be fairly lopsided and very
basin-specific for the rest of 2014?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I would take your – I would say that the South Texas is following nicely along, could end
up in a couple of quarters where the Permian is now. And next to that would be your Northeast region and I don't think
we should forget about the Utica. I think it has the opportunity to surprise to the upside and absorb the capacity up there
relatively quickly. So, that's how I'd outline that. And I'm sorry Angie, could you – the first part of your question?
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Is equipment and people mobilizing into the Permian where we would equalize the tightness
there, therefore the tightness we're seeing today...
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Right.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Would start to become diminished?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Right. Equipment goes where it's loved the most, right? So, I think that's already
happening and yet the absorption, the appetite that the customers have are still exceeding. What can be done, I think to
the question that Bill asked earlier around labor, if you're Baker Hughes or if you're a couple of our larger peers, and
you need to staff up, we can do it. If you come in into the Permian and no one knows who heck you are and you don't
have an existing workforce, or a local representation, I think it's going to be hard for you to man that fleet. So, I'm not
so sure that there's a whole lot of downside risk to equipment coming from other basins into the Permian. It's not that
easy for some folks.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. Thanks. Thanks so much. I'll turn it over.

Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Jim.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: One other company this morning reported and they said that they're gaining market share in
domestic pressure pumping led by technology. You guys have obviously been rolling out more technology than we've
seen in a very long while. Should we expect to see the big three gain market share on the smaller guys or the big three
just swapping market shares among themselves?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: It's funny how everybody is gaining market share, isn't it?
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: I think it's great. And it's those other guys we got to look out for.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No, I know. But that's a very fair point. I wouldn't debate it, what was said. And we feel
confident with the growth in our business that we are gaining share on a couple of different fronts. And I've said this for
a long time, the integration of pressure pumping – you know, Jim, there was this first revolution around just cost, cost,
cost, the stage wars, efficiency. And I've been saying for quite a while that there's not a whole lot of juice that you're
going to get out of that lemon for much longer.
We got to drill smarter wells, better wells, perhaps even fewer wells and keep those recovery factors and EURs up in
those basins. And to do that, you need to have a first-rate frac fleet and organization, but you got to have a strong rock
mechanics organization, you got to have a world-class formation evaluation group, you got to have a completions
portfolio that can address every possible outcome and need. And then if you can plumb that well with artificial lift and
chemicals, you're going to gain share in every product line. So, I don't debate...

<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: So, the integrated model....it sounds like the integrated model....
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: The integrated model. Absolutely.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Is going to definitely take share from guys who just provide brawn and...
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's right.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Not the level of technology? Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: I kind of primed you for that question, but I appreciate that, Martin. Second thing, in Iraq,
Jim brought it up and you had said that because Iraq recovered, operating income hit record levels. Is Iraq profitable yet
or is this just a reduction in loss and if it's – where do you expect margins to go in Iraq over the rest of this year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I expect our margins in Iraq to continue to walk up. We are not currently profitable in the
country as a whole. The north part isn't large enough for us to offset the challenges we still experience in the southern
part of the country, but I expect that business overall to improve from here on out.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: As it was, Jim – as it was prior to the unfortunate episode in the fourth quarter of last
year.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Amen. Last question, if I could. We talked about performance incentive and
performance-based contracts seeming to gain steam. Does Baker play in that market?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Significantly, in virtually all key basins, completions contracts in the North Sea, drilling
contracts in Angola and Nigeria; of course, other parts of Latin America, outside of Brazil and an increasing appetite to
put skin in the game and align with our customers and again in North America and given that portfolio capability and
the opportunity to help them drill better wells, get those IPs up and EURs up. And it's not as easy to keep getting their
cost down, we're stepping into that category increasingly more, yes.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Excellent. Martin, thank you very much.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question comes from David Anderson from JPMorgan.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks, good morning. Just a quick question on your CapEx. It looks like it's trending below
$2 billion this year. How does that look for the rest of the year and is that an influence on the buyback program and size
of the buyback program, can you kind of comment on how, if they're related at all?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: We're still sticking to $2 billion in CapEx for the year. We were just a little bit late in the first
quarter. And I guess, ultimately they're related, but they're not directly linked in regards to the buyback program. We
generated record free cash flow last year, $1.5 billion. We expect to generate generous cash flow in 2014 and 2015 and
keep our CapEx pretty much in line with where we are today. So ultimately, they're related, but there's a lot of cash
being generated regardless of slight changes in the CapEx program quarter to quarter.
<Q - David Anderson>: So with that free cash flow growth, can we assume the buybacks program should also
increase kind of steadily through the year or is that – or am I reading into it too much?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: You're reading into it too much, but...

<Q - David Anderson>: Okay.

<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Martin, a quick question on the Gulf of Mexico. I'm not sure if I've heard you explicitly
talk about your outlook. I mean, are you still expecting rigs to come in to the market through the year? I know it's a
contributor to margins this quarter, can you comment a little bit on how you see that market developing this year and
into early next year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah, good morning, Dave. We took a bit of – and we've been proven right in terms of
what our rig forecast was going to be in the Gulf of Mexico. And it's right exactly where we predicted it and it may be a
little bit behind what some others predicted. And here on out, we expect it to grow a few more sequentially. So the Gulf
of Mexico will play a big role in our North American margin growth and a big part of that is the three boats that are just
about fully utilized. In March, they were and I don't see any reason why that's not going to continue as the – again,
partly because of rig count growth and the increasing shift towards completions.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Along those same lines, Martin, there was a comment in there about tubing conveyed
perforation services, been hearing something about that in onshore. I think that was related to offshore, is that correct?
And if it is correct, do you see that being a means for Lower Tertiary development, is that going to be one of the keys
do you think going forward?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I think it will be. For HPHT, ballistic devices in terms of blasting caps and so forth in
HPHT environments, if you can go with a different type of system, it's far superior, so I think it's going to be a big
contributor down there.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome.
<A - Trey Clark>: Thanks, Dave. I appreciate it. Larissa, we've got time for one last question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from Scott Gruber from Bernstein.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yes. Good morning. Just a quick question on the offshore markets, they're clearly seeing the
majors push down the rig rates there. Service companies never secured a whole lot of pricing power offshore post
-recession, but are the majors are coming to you guys and demanding pricing concessions on any product lines?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No, no, I can't say they are. There is quite a bit of discussion in the marketplace around
all these drill ships and so forth that are coming in. I got to tell you, the more the merrier from our side, Scott, just more
platforms, literally, to work off of. But in terms of, as I highlighted earlier in one of the questions, West Africa and the
Gulf of Mexico, in our markets, the services we play from pressure pumping to all of the others, 70% of the spend in
deepwater is between the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, with Brazil and North Sea behind that and the least being
Asia Pacific and the little bit in the Middle East.
And if we look at those two big basins or if you will, regions, West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, our deep dives have
told us that our customers are every bit is ambitious to carry out their projects through 2017. And in one particular
conversation I had, there was over 200 Lower Tertiary wells planned in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico alone between
the key players and that's not – I just don't see that going away.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: And you highlighted on the – in the previous response that the Gulf of Mexico is living up to
your expectations from a volume standpoint. Is the rest of the offshore markets largely doing so as well?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: All except our friends to the south. As I highlighted in our call, we had some great
performance, we continue to in Brazil. But the number of rigs working there on the drilling side have been shifted more

towards the production side. I expect and as well as I think some of the budget going on to land in Brazil. I think that
will come back later this year or early next year. But other than that, yeah, I'd say it's every bit as we expected, if not a
little bit better.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay. That's all for me. Thanks.
