MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q1 earnings call 2013. At this time all
participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, with instructions being
given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Phil Johnson. Please go
ahead.
Philip Johnson
Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I'm
Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are our Chairman and CEO, John Lechleiter; our
Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Jan Lundberg; our President of
Elanco Animal Health, Jeff Simmons; and Ilissa Rassner and Travis Coy from Investor Relations.
During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current
expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three
and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not
intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.

We're pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2013, as growth in key products and regions replaced lost
revenue and earnings due to the Zyprexa patent expiration. Lilly employees remain focused on advancing the pipeline
and on increasing productivity, while delivering results to put us on track to meet our 2013 financial guidance and to
meet or exceed our midterm financial minimum goals.
Let's start with a quick review of events that have taken place since our last earnings call. From a regulatory
perspective, the first two items I'd like to highlight were achieved in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. We
received approval in Japan for Tradjenta as add-on therapy to insulin, and we submitted the SGLT2 inhibitor
empagliflozin to both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for review of the
treatment for type 2 diabetes. We also submitted insulin lispro U-200 in the U.S. for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients.
And we're pleased to announce, after consultation with the FDA, we received Fast Track designation and have initiated
a rolling BLA submission for ramucirumab as monotherapy treatment for second-line gastric cancer. The first module
was recently submitted, and we anticipate that the final module will be submitted before the end of the year. Based on
the overall efficacy and safety data from the REGARD trial, we believe that ramucirumab has a promising treatment
profile in this difficult-to-treat patient population, and we look forward to completing the rolling submission.
In clinical news, for dulaglutide, our investigational GLP-1 receptor agonist being studied at a once-weekly treatment
for type 2 diabetes, we announced that the primary endpoints related to reduction in HbA1c were met in the Phase III
AWARD-2 and AWARD-4 studies. Furthermore, the 1.5-milligram dose demonstrated statistically superior reduction
in HbA1c from baseline compared to insulin glargine in both trials. We also announced that we have discontinued the
Phase III rheumatoid arthritis program for tabalumab due to lack of efficacy. The Phase III program for lupus is
continuing as planned.
On the business development front, Elanco announced the investment of approximately $100 million to purchase a
minority equity stake in China Animal Healthcare, one of the leading players in the animal health industry in the
People's Republic of China. The investment expands Elanco's commitment to China, with the goal of providing
innovative, safety-enhancing food production solutions to help meet the growing food demands and nutritional needs of
the Chinese people. And we completed the transfer of OUS commercial rights for exenatide to Amylin, Bristol-Myers
Squibb, and AstraZeneca. In other news, we completed the $1.5 billion share repurchase program that we announced
late last year.
To prepare for the upcoming loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta and Evista, adapt to changing customer needs, and to the
evolution of the U.S. healthcare environment, we initiated a restructuring of our U.S. sales force. The main component
of this restructuring is a significant reduction to our U.S. BioMedicine sales force, with the reductions focused on our
primary care sales force. In addition, the restructuring takes into account termination of our U.S. promotion of Livalo
and transfer of the rights back to Kowa Pharmaceuticals, as well as a small expansion of our diabetes sales force.
Finally, as part of our continued efforts to align global manufacturing capacity with long-term business needs, we
announced that we will close our packaging and distribution site in Giessen, Germany during 2014.
Now let's move on to discuss our financial performance. As we've done on previous calls, we'll focus our comments on
the non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insight into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes
certain items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. I should point out that our
non-GAAP results include ongoing costs, such as amortization and stock-based compensation.
Turning to the income statement on slide seven, you can see that total revenue was flat at $5.6 billion, as growth in key
products and regions offset lower revenue following the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa in most major markets
outside of Japan. Excluding Zyprexa outside of Japan, the rest of our revenue grew 5%. Gross margin as a percent of
revenue increased 70 basis points from 78.6% to 79.3%. The increase in gross margin percent was due to higher
production volumes and higher prices partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses.
This quarter's total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, was also flat. Within operating
expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 11% as a result of the company's cost containment
efforts. R&D expenses increased 17%, largely driven by higher late-stage clinical trial costs, including roughly $90

million of milestone payments to Boehringer Ingelheim for the U.S. and European regulatory submissions for
empagliflozin and about $60 million related to the discontinuation of the Phase III tabalumab RA program. Excluding
these items, R&D expenses grew only 4%.
Other income and deductions was a net income of $34 million in Q1 2013 compared to a net expense of $46 million in
the first quarter of 2012. Our tax rate was 15.5% this quarter, a decrease of nearly 9 percentage points from Q1 2012.
This decrease reflects the reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit for 2013 as well as the one-time impact associated
with the R&D tax credit for 2012 that was recorded this quarter. At the bottom line, our non-GAAP EPS increased
24%, to $1.14. This includes a benefit of $0.07 due to the 2012 R&D tax credit.
Slide eight shows our reported income statement while slide nine provides a reconciliation between reported and
non-GAAP EPS. As expected, this quarter we recognized approximately $495 million of income, or $0.29 of EPS, due
to the transfer of exenatide commercial rights to Amylin, Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca in all markets outside
the U.S. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Now I'll turn the call over to Travis.
Travis Coy
Thanks, Phil. As you can see on slide 10, our revenue was flat as the result of a 4% increase in higher prices offset by a
3% decline in volume and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. You'll notice that U.S. pharma sales
increased 3%, driven by increased price that was partially offset by lower volume. The volume decline was primarily
due to the loss of patent exclusivity for Zyprexa. This quarter our revenues in Japan were significantly impacted by the
weakening of the yen. The 13% decline from foreign exchange and a 3% decline due to the Q1 2012 bi-annual price
decreases were partially offset by strong double-digit volume growth of 11%.
As for emerging markets, which is embedded in rest of world, revenue grew 3% this quarter, or 6% excluding the
impact of foreign exchange. Within emerging markets, China continued to register double-digit revenue growth, up
11%, driven by strong volume growth of 18%.
Elanco Animal Health sales grew 2% this quarter. In the U.S. sales grew 9%, as increased demand for companion
animal products offset lower volume for food animal products. Outside the U.S. sales decreased 8%, driven by lower
volume for food animal products. The volume decrease in food animal products outside the U.S. was due to transition
stocking in 2012 associated with the Janssen acquisition as well as weakness in demand in many emerging markets that
was consistent with broader industry trends. Despite the slowing of growth this quarter, we continue to expect that
Elanco will deliver robust growth in 2013 and in the coming years.
Finally, the 18% decrease in collaborations and other revenue is due to the transfer of exenatide rights to Amylin.
Excluding exenatide, collaboration and other revenue grew 12% this quarter, driven by Tradjenta. Foreign exchange
had a relatively small impact upon our financial performance this quarter. Consequently, we have moved the slides
showing the impact of FX upon line items in our P&L to the supplementary section in the back of the deck.
Next I'll provide a brief pipeline update before turning the call over to Derica. Slide 11 shows our pipeline as of April
17. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted, with green arrows showing progression and red arrows
showing attrition.
As Phil mentioned, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we submitted empagliflozin to the U.S. and European
regulatory agencies. We are excited by the potential of the SGLT2 class for the treatment of patients with type 2
diabetes. We believe empagliflozin's ability to lower blood glucose via a mechanism of action that is independent of
beta cell function or insulin resistance could offer benefits for people managing their diabetes. As noted by the double
asterisk, we also initiated a rolling BLA submission for ramucirumab.
With respect to earlier stages of the pipeline, you'll see that we began Phase II testing of three potential medicines: a
biologic for chronic kidney disease, and two small molecules for cancer – a c-MET inhibitor and an FGFR inhibitor.

And we began Phase I testing of a small molecule for chronic kidney disease. In addition, we terminated development
of four molecules, two in Phase II and two in Phase I. In addition to empagliflozin and ramucirumab, we have the
potential to complete filings for three more Phase III assets this year and believe this pipeline positions us well for
growth post 2014.
Now I'll turn the call over to Derica to cover some of the key events for 2013, to review our financial guidance, and to
provide closing comments before we open the call for Q&A. Derica?
Derica W. Rice
Thanks, Travis. I'll begin my remarks with slide 12. Now, as we've mentioned previously, 2013 is an exciting year for
Eli Lilly and Company. Let me give you a quick reminder of the potential key events for the remainder of this year as
we continue to advance our pipeline and generate and share clinical data that will help you better gauge our growth
potential post 2014.
A number of potential external data disclosures remain this year. These include presentation of detailed data at the
American Diabetes Association from the AWARD-1, AWARD-3, and AWARD-5 trials of the Phase III program for
dulaglutide, and in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim for multiple Phase III trials for empagliflozin, both
potential treatments for type 2 diabetes. On June 24 we'll host an investor event to discuss these data.
In oncology, we could have presentation of data from the Phase III trial of ramucirumab in first-line breast cancer –
now, recall that the data we expect to receive in 2013 will be the final progression-free survival data and the interim
overall survival data – and, finally, presentation of data for the Phase III trial of enzastaurin as maintenance therapy for
patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
There are also several Phase III trials that may produce data in 2013, although presentation of detailed data at medical
meetings would likely occur in 2014. These include the initial Phase III trials of our novel basal insulin analog for both
type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the pivotal trial for our new insulin glargine product, ramucirumab as combination therapy
for second-line gastric cancer, our Phase III trial for necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for
first-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and the initial trials of edivoxetine as adjunctive therapy for major
depressive disorder. In total, we'll have Phase III data readouts or detailed data presentations on 8 of our 13 Phase III
assets.
As Travis mentioned, in 2013 we could have up to five regulatory filings: three diabetes assets – empagliflozin, which
has been submitted in the U.S. and Europe, dulaglutide, and our new insulin glargine product; and two oncology assets
– ramucirumab as monotherapy for second-line gastric cancer, for which we've initiated a rolling submission, as well as
enzastaurin for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Other key events to watch for in 2013 – we plan to initiate another pivotal trial for solanezumab in patients with mild
Alzheimer's disease, in August we'll have the U.S. District Court trial for the Alimta method-of-use patent, and in
December we'll lose U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta.
Now moving on to guidance, we're pleased with our solid first quarter results and are encouraged that we've been able
to offset the Zyprexa patent expiration through growth in other key products and regions. As mentioned in our press
release, we are not changing our EPS guidance for the full year. However, we are updating a couple of line items.
Effective July, we expect to see an increase in the Puerto Rico excise tax. This has the effect of increasing our cost of
goods sold and decreasing our tax rate. Given the dollar amount of gross margin, our gross margin guidance of
approximately 78% of revenue is unchanged. However, given the smaller dollar amount of pre-tax income, we've
lowered our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates by 50 basis points.
We've also updated our R&D expense and OID guidance. The range of R&D expense increased $100 million, offset by
a $100 million increase to other income. This change is due to the empagliflozin submission milestones that hit R&D
expense, not OID, as our original guidance assumed.

While all other line items, including EPS guidance, are unchanged, I do want to mention two factors affecting our
business. First, we've received updated information showing higher than expected utilization of our products in
Medicare Part D, thus increasing the impact of the donut hole coverage gap to Lilly. Second, significant devaluation of
the yen is reducing the U.S. dollar value of sales from our Japanese affiliate.
We anticipate that the headwinds from increased costs associated with the Affordable Care Act and the Japanese yen
devaluation will be mitigated by our continued focus to drive growth in our marketed product portfolio and by our
efforts to reduce expenses. As a result, we are not changing our revenue or EPS guidance for the year.
Slide 14 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2012 and the associated growth rates from
these numbers to our 2013 guidance. You can see that our GAAP EPS has benefited substantially from income related
to exenatide.
Now, in closing, we'll continue to focus relentlessly executing our strategy to replenish and advance our pipeline, to
drive growth in our on-patent brands and in key growth areas of Elanco, Japan, and emerging markets, and to drive
productivity gains across all areas of our value chain. We've designed this strategy to absorb the effect of our patent
losses, while funding the dividend at least at its current level as well as the R&D that will drive our future growth. This
has allowed us to return nearly $2 billion to shareholders in the last year, on top of the dividend.
Our financial performance this quarter positions us well to continue to meet or exceed our midterm financial
projections of minimum annual revenue of at least $20 billion, net income of at least $3 billion, and operating cash flow
of at least $4 billion.
We've submitted empagliflozin in the U.S. and Europe, we've initiated a rolling submission for ramucirumab, and we
have the potential for up to three more submissions this year – two more in diabetes and one more in oncology. And we
continue to generate and disseminate important data that will help investors and analysts better gauge our longer-term
growth potential, with much more data to come over the course of 2013 and 2014.
We believe this pipeline will drive strong growth post-YZ. We're confident in our strategy and in our ability to
successfully navigate our patent expirations and emerge with even greater strength and capacity to drive growth.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'll take your questions. Operator, first caller, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tim Anderson of Sanford Bernstein. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Bruce Badner>: This is Bruce Badner in for Tim Anderson. I have two questions, please. Your tax rate guidance
for 2013 is now 19%. Previously you had said that your tax rate would rise to the mid-20% in the 2012 to 2014
timeframe because of patent expiries. Is that mid-20% tax rate guidance still relevant for 2014? And my second
question is, you mentioned that you expect to have Phase III data for enzastaurin this year. Can you give us your
overall thoughts on the product?
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Bruce, thank you for the questions. We'll have Derica take your first question. Jan,
would you like to go ahead and take the second one then? Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Hi, Bruce. In regards to our tax rate guidance, just as a reminder, we said that, in our midterm
guidance that our tax rate would be no higher than the mid-20%s, meaning that's the maximum we expect it to go.
Fortunately, we've been very successful thus far and through the management of operations, as well as where our cash
is being generated, our income is being generated around the world, to be able to stay in that low-20%s.

As you see here in the first quarter, we're also benefiting from how the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit, both in terms
of the full effect of 2012 being recorded in the first quarter of 2013 as well as the resumption of the R&D tax credit in
the Q1 itself. So we still believe that we'll be able to stay below that mid-20%s at least, and we're also at the same time
well able to bring back sufficient cash to the U.S. to fund our U.S. operations.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Derica. Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: Right, so we are evaluating enzastaurin in a Phase III trial for diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma. And the aim here is to test for the potential to prevent relapse in patients following standard of care, which
is called R-CHOP, for this particular form of lymphoma. We have completed enrollment and are expecting data very
soon. And the primary endpoint is disease-free survival. If positive, we could potentially have an NDA submission later
this year.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Jan. Paul, could we have the next caller, please?
Operator
Next, from ISI Group, Mark Schoenebaum, your line is open.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum, MD>: Hey, guys, thanks a lot for taking my question. I really appreciate it. I think Animal
Health is in the room, correct?
<A - Philip Johnson>: Absolutely, we've got Jeff Simmons here with us. We've got the expert.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum, MD>: Okay, fantastic, so maybe I'll ask an Animal Health question, if I may. I saw in the
press release, it looks like your ex-U.S. growth slowed down considerably this quarter, and as you said, it was
consistent with industry trends out of a couple other companies. I was wondering if you could go into any detail,
specifically what's driving the ex-U.S. weakness, whether or not you think that's kind of one-time-ish or whether or not
you think we should be rethinking ex-U.S. growth rates in general. And then the second part to the question is – this is
a little bit off the beaten path, but obviously in China a lot going on with the bird flu. Do you anticipate this having any
impact on the Animal Health business over the near term or over the long term? Thank you very much.
<A - Jeffrey N. Simmons>: Okay, thank you, Mark. Thanks for the questions. I would say, overall, if you look at our
business and the Animal Health business, especially the food animal side OUS, we are operating in a business that is
cyclical in nature. Meat, milk, and eggs cycle relative to demand, and those cycles have now become a lot more global,
as there's more global companies connected to the supply and demand.
And you see this, every three to five years you see a cycle happen, and you see that with public meat companies as
well. Today, currently, meat supply is exceeding demand in certain parts of the world, and that's creating, we believe, a
driver in the slowing of this industry growth. Don't want to forecast the severity of it or the length of it, but we do see
this emerge relative to Q1 2013 versus Q1 of 2012.
I will speak on behalf of Elanco and say that, even despite this, we continue to see our strategy that's built on diversity,
that's built on companion animal – food animal therapy and productivity on the food animal side. We continue to
expect that Elanco will deliver robust growth for 2013 and in the coming years and exceed industry growth rates, as we
have the past five years.
Now, as we look at bird flu, I would say that, similar in nature, you see these different flus and different emerging
diseases occur. We had bluetongue in Europe a few years ago. We had a bird flu occur in Mexico a few years ago, and
this one in China. What we need to look for is does that do anything to soften the demand of key protein groups like
poultry and pork in markets like China. So this will be something that we will be watching and assessing. Our recent
investment in China Animal Healthcare will bring us closer to that marketplace, which will help us understand that
marketplace, which is a key marketplace. So the big impact is watching the impact that it has on overall consumer
demand.

Operator
Next we'll move to the line of Gregg Gilbert of Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Good morning. Jan, I was hoping you could walk us through the specific mechanics for
the ramucirumab rolling submission in gastric and why that path was decided upon. And then for Derica, it looks like
pricing negativity in Europe was quite good this quarter compared to prior quarters. I don't want to get carried away,
but is this inflection point, or are there some specific sort of one-time-ish things there? And lastly, if Dave's on the call,
U.S. Bio, the commercial footprint, is it rightsized for the foreseeable future, given your current products as well as
your expectations for -
<A - Philip Johnson>: Gregg, are you still there?
Operator
Apologies. Give us a moment.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Can you hear me?
<A - Philip Johnson>: Yeah. So we don't have Dave with us on the call, so I think we'll go ahead and have Jan handle
your first question with regards to ramucirumab, and then, Derica, if you can handle the last two?
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Great, thanks.
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: Right, so as you know, we have completed the REGARD trial for ramucirumab in
monotherapy in second-line gastric cancer, where we showed an improved overall survival. The Fast Track status has
been granted, and we have initiated a rolling submission, starting with the preclinical module, and the plan is to have
everything submitted before the end of the year for ramu.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Okay. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Gregg, in regards to prices, you saw in Europe we were down 1% in the first quarter. Typically,
we're somewhere in that minus 2% to 3%. That's about where we'd be. We did see in the first quarter an adjustment for
the transfer of exenatide rights outside the U.S. And then if you were looking back at the fourth quarter, you saw that
we had more of a 7% reduction, and that was really for the year, and that was driven by the impact of the Zyprexa
patent loss in Europe. But typically we're in that minus 2% to 3% pricing impact in the European region.
<A - Philip Johnson>: And then the question on if, with this action in U.S. BioMed, you feel that the commercial
footprint's rightsized going forward?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Sure. Clearly, we believe we are rightsized, Gregg, for the moment, given the mix and the
composition of the portfolio that we have in hand today. Now, as we look at the Phase III pipeline, and depending upon
what emerges, I think in the primary care we're fine. What you may find is that we may have to build some presence in
some new therapeutic areas where we haven't competed previously, such as autoimmune, going to the neurologists.
Those are all possible areas of expansion as we think about our U.S. sales force footprint. But at the moment, on the
primary care side, we think we're properly positioned.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. And, Travis, you had an add-on maybe to complement Jan's response?

<A - Travis Coy>: Yeah, Gregg, just to give you a little more detail on the rolling submission, we just need to
complete some typical product stability work. And as Jan mentioned, we do anticipate being able to complete that work
by the end of the year.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Okay, thank you. Paul, next caller, please?
Operator
From JPMorgan, we'll go to the line of Chris Schott. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much, just two questions. First, going back to Elanco, you mentioned these
three- to five-year cycles. Can you give us a sense of typically, when we see one of these, how long until growth
normalizes? Is this something that's going to take a couple quarters to play out, or something longer than that? And
maybe when you're talking about that, I wonder if you'd be interested in just giving us your best guess at what industry
growth might look at in 2013 versus where we've been historically. Final question, just shifting gears, just some quick
thoughts on the FDA's review of pancreatic abnormalities seen with the DPP-4 and GLP-1 category, just any thoughts
you might have there, appreciate it.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Okay, great. Thanks, Chris. We'll have Jeff obviously handle your first question, and then
either Travis or Jan, I think, will go ahead and handle the second one. Jeff?
<A - Jeffrey N. Simmons>: Thanks, Chris. Hard to predict on length of cycles and severity; I think you're seeing less
severe swings and cycles being a little shorter given the way that companies are able to impact their supply chain of
meat and swing to these demands much quicker. So I would say that I think you're going to see them last in a probably
shorter period of time and less severe, but it's hard to predict. And then I would say it's going be a challenge this year to
predict growth rates. Again, we're going to continue to look at robust growth rates and continue to exceed industry
growth rates, but I think this year will be a challenging year to predict the exact growth rate number at this time.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: Right, so the question about the pancreas effects of DPP-4s and GLP-1s have been
debated for some time. And we should remember first here that diabetes patients in general have the higher risk for
pancreatitis, and also then, in the label for DPP-4s, there is an increased risk of pancreatitis being mentioned. In relation
to dulaglutide, we are still analyzing the data, which will be presented at the ADA in June, but so far we have not seen
any established causal link between dulaglutide and pancreatitis nor pancreas cancer. We are carefully watching this
area, and as you know, safety is very high on our agenda.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Thanks, Jan. Paul, if we can go to the next caller, please?
Operator
From Cowen, we'll go to the line of Steve Scala. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you, just a few questions. First, just to be clear, does the rolling filing of ramucirumab in
gastric imply that the head-to-head study versus chemo will be part of the filing? Second, the ramucirumab breast
cancer trial I believe is done. Will you top-line the data in the first half of this year? And then lastly, the 10-K had
stated that the Alimta 2022 patent is now referred to as a vitamin dosage regimen patent as opposed to a concomitant
nutrition supplement use patent to conform to legal strategy. What should we glean on legal strategy from this change,
and why was it made so late in the process? Thank you.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Okay, Steve, thanks for the questions. I'll go ahead and handle these, and feel free to chime at
the table if you'd like. So as we mentioned earlier, you're seeing us now proceed with the submission of ramucirumab
in second-line gastric monotherapy without waiting for the data in that second-line trial. It'll get the regulators to
determine if the data that we have is sufficient for them to go ahead and opine. As we've mentioned in the past, we're

very encouraged by the data in this difficult-to-treat cancer and line of therapy, where there are no approved agents yet
in the U.S. and Europe.
In terms of the ram breast cancer timing, we have talked about having something in midyear or summer, are the two
different ways we've described it. Appreciate the question on trying to nail down a little bit more closely when that
might occur. We'll have to monitor, Steve, the actual occurrence of the events that are necessary to get the final PFS as
well as the interim OS. I would indicate it's probably not very likely that that would occur in time to lead to a top line in
the first half. But clearly we stick with sort of this midyear or summertime type of guidance that we've set for having
data internally, and then very quickly getting some kind of communication out to the Street would be our intention.
And then there's really nothing, I think, to read into the change in our SEC filing in terms of the way that the
method-of-use patent, the concomitant use of vitamin B12 and folic acid with pemetrexed is described. I think it was
just some shoring up of the language based on reviews with internal counsel.

From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to the line of Jami Rubin. Please go ahead.

Very good. From Morgan Stanley, we'll go to David Risinger. Please go ahead.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. So I was particularly impressed with the SG&A controls this quarter. It
seems like you may be rationalizing the sales force earlier than I expected with the main patent expiration pressures
from Cymbalta and Evista next year. So this quarter, the expense level for SG&A was $1.65 billion. Should we assume
that that reflects the appropriate level of spending, or do you plan to take the run rate of SG&A down in the near term,
Derica? And then just one quick financial question, for the China Animal Health deal, how much incremental annual
revenue does that add, and how much does that move the needle for your overall global animal health business, please?
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks for the questions, David, and we'll have Derica handle both those.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Okay. David, in regards to SG&A, just to remind you, in the guidance that we provided at the
beginning of the year, it included the actions that you've seen, culminating in terms of us announcing here today in
terms of the U.S. restructuring of our sales force. So all of these things have been contemplated in the forward-looking
statements that we've made. In regards to kind of the future, we believe we have, again, the right sales force footprint to
accommodate the portfolio mix that we have at the moment.
The biggest key is going see how the pipeline plays out and the future impact it has there. You would expect that, in
terms of as we progress through the year and we march closer towards December 11 when we lose Cymbalta, that you
will see a further pullback on some of our promotional activities behind Cymbalta, such as DTC. But until that, when
exactly that will happen we'll not disclose, and we're constantly going to monitor the effect that it's having. And
obviously, as we also get into the fourth quarter, you'll see us beginning to have to deal with either both returns reserve

for Cymbalta, and you could see wholesalers beginning to destock. So these are the kinds of things we'll be monitoring
as we progress through the year to understand what our promotional mix should be behind that brand.
<A - Philip Johnson>: And, Dave, in terms of the revenues that we'd be bringing in from the investment in the
Chinese Healthcare company, Animal Healthcare company, we don't anticipate at this time, based on the structure and
the minority stake that we've taken, that that would lead to equity accounting and therefore any particular impact on our
financials. I also would say, if you look historically, on your first question, SG&A is typically significantly lower in the
first quarter of the year than it is in the second, third, or fourth quarters.
If you force out our SG&A guidance for the full year, subtracting then the SG&A for Q1, you'll see that we still do, in
total, expect you're going to see higher levels of SG&A spend on average in these next three quarters than you saw in
the first quarter of the year. Again, we'll go ahead and monitor our progress, both on rightsizing our detailing and
marketing activities as well as progress we make on cost controls, and update guidance appropriately as we go through
the year, but currently we still are expecting that $7.1 billion to $7.4 billion SG&A for the full year.
Paul, if we can go to the next caller, please?
Operator
Yes, we've got Jami Rubin back from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay, I'll try that again. Thank you. Just – I may have missed it, but did you update us on the
solanezumab trial design, your new Phase III trial in moderate patients? And if you haven't, when might you update us?
And then, secondly, a question for Derica, I was wondering if you anticipate any impact from sequestration. Alimta's
obviously a very big drug that's reimbursed through Medicare Part B, and as you know, the 2% price cut has been
applied across the board, and wondering what you plan to do to make sure that these hospitals are not diverting sales
away from Medicare Part B to hospital-based products – I mean if you plan to discount it, et cetera, if you're expecting
any sort of impact at all. Thanks very much.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great, Jami, thanks for getting back in queue, and thanks for the questions. Jan, if you want to
go ahead and take the first question on the update for the sola trial. And maybe we'll actually have, Travis, you
comment since you're close to that, and then, Derica, feel free to chime in if you'd like on the second.
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: Okay, let me just start by saying that we are going to test mild Alzheimer's disease,
not moderate patients then. That is based on the previous data then from EXPEDITION1 and 2, where it was the pooled
mild patient population that actually had a significant benefit, particularly on cognition and a slight effect also on
function. But what we are doing currently is that we have ongoing discussions with the regulators globally to prepare
them for EXPEDITION3, which we plan to start then during Q3, and that is what we can say for the moment.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Yeah, actually, before we go on to the next part of Jami's questions, so Jami, clearly, at some
point prior to the first patient visit, we'll be posting the study design to ClinicalTrials.gov, and I think we'll be looking
for an appropriate way to either reactively or proactively, depending on the timing of this, discuss that trial design with
those of you in the investment community that are interested in more details. Travis?
<A - Travis Coy>: Hey, Jami. We do understand that sequestration has introduced some challenges for oncologists
with regards to treating patients that sit in the Medicare system. At this time, we are not seeing a significant impact to
our Alimta sales. But obviously we're going to continue to monitor that situation, and we'll continue to work towards
making sure our patients have access to Alimta.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Okay, thanks. Paul, if we can go to the next caller, please?

<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Oh, thanks very much. So as I look at the P&L overall, I'm wondering if you guys could
talk a little bit about comparisons versus some of your peers as it relates to the inclusion of amortization, if you've done
any studies of how much is incorporated or included in Lilly's P&L versus others. There's obviously a pretty wide
spread, and what I see as a wider spread between your operating cash flow and your adjusted earnings versus some of
your peers. So maybe you can just kind of give us a little color on that, Derica. And then, separately, can you just
update us on any of the Phase II products that you see rolling through the back half of this year or going forward that
we should be particularly focused on? Thanks very much.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Seamus, thanks for the questions. Derica's actually had the IR team here looking at some
of those P&L comps, so I'll take a first stab at the first part of your question, and then, Jan, if you'd like to do the
second. So increasingly over the last few years, we've seen the situation change. Prior, you'd have a minority of the
companies that would be excluding from their non-GAAP results things like amortization expense or stock-based
compensation. I think, as you're well aware, that list of companies has continued to grow and probably now constitutes
the majority of our peers.
We continue to believe that if analysts want to know the cash generation that we've accomplished in a given period,
there's already a financial statement that gives you those details and that making those kinds of adjustments to
non-GAAP EPS are not necessarily what we would view as the right way to use non-GAAP.
But, again, we're very cognizant that other companies are doing that and we've tried to make sure that in our SEC
filings we provide information so that analysts can see how much that amortization expense was for us in a given
period. In the past, I believe we've only been doing that in our annual filing. I think going forward, you'll see that we're
doing that also in our quarterly filings as well. I think this quarter it was probably somewhere in the $170 million or
$180 million, but need to consult with our Q to see the exact number. $150 million I think was the number, yeah.
Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg, Ph.D.>: Okay, here is an update on some of the programs in Phase II, and let me start with
[ph] the second (42:03) receptor antagonist, which is an oral agent in type-2 diabetes, where we have Phase IIb data
showing then glucose lowering, et cetera. So that's a next-generation agent, but potentially for the oral part then of
type-2 diabetes. And we will present some further data this year on this agent. The next one is blosozumab, a
monoclonal antibody against sclerostin, which has been shown to be a very potent anabolic agent, and we will present
some data in May for this agent. It has unique anabolic-building properties also compared to current products on the
market, like Forteo.
The next one is our oral BACE inhibitor, beta secretase inhibitor, which is in Phase II trials, actually then preparing for
a Phase III with dose-ranging and also looking at some safety aspects. This, as you know, the beta secretase is an
intriguing target which recently has been associated by genetics then to be protective against Alzheimer's disease
dementia, and we hope to mimic this then by this oral agent. And finally in the oncology area, we have a CDK 4/6 oral
agent which is being tested in various tumors, including mantle cell lymphoma, where this mechanism has been
particularly implied for driving the tumor growth.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Jan. Paul, if we can go to the next caller?
Operator
The last caller in the queue is Marc Goodman of UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes, good morning. So, Derica, can you help us quantify the impact of the donut hole and the
yen devaluation that you had mentioned earlier? And, second, with respect to following up to Dave's question about the
SG&A and what was in the quarter/not in the quarter, and the changes in the reps, was that impactive in the first quarter
or should we assume that that's going to start in the second quarter because you just announced it recently? And then
third question is, can you talk about the DPP-4 market? There seems to be a slowdown in prescriptions there over the

past couple of months. Wondering how you view that market and how you think about the SGLT2s positioning in the
diabetes space. Thanks.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Okay. Marc, thanks for the questions. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: I'll take the first two, Marc. In regards to the impact of the yen as well as the Affordable Care
Act and the donut hole, the yen, as you saw if you look at our Japanese growth, the devaluation cost us 13 percentage
points in growth. And so unless you see movement in the yen to appreciate, then you would expect that that's going to
continue for the remainder of the year. In regards to the impact of the donut hole, and really more holistically the
Affordable Care Act, we're probably seeing an impact somewhere in the $100 million to $150 million higher than we
had anticipated when we started the year. And to your third question in regards to the U.S. restructuring, you should
anticipate seeing the impact of that restructuring probably more likely in Q3 versus Q2.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Travis?
<A - Travis Coy>: And, Marc, with regards to I guess two more questions, so I think you've got a total of five in there,
so that's good work. One, for the DPP-4 market, yeah, we are tracking the same data you are with regards to TRx. We
are, as you mentioned, beginning to see a slowdown in the overall market. But we are very encouraged by the progress
we've made with regards to Tradjenta. We're now seeing around 20% new-to-brand, which is comparing favorably to
Onglyza, and we'll continue to work towards increasing access for that product.
With regards to the positioning of empagliflozin within the diabetes treatment continuum, as I mentioned in my
prepared remarks, we're encouraged by the independence of both beta cell function and insulin resistance for that
mechanism and believe that the SGLT2 class is an encouraging class, as we've filed in both U.S. and European
regulatory agencies. So we believe that we'll have a very strong positioning, and particularly due to that mechanism and
potentially in combination with other products.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Just to be clear, Ilissa had mentioned to me when Derica was talking about the additional
$100 million to $150 million impact from the Medicare Part D donut hole, just to be clear, that's for the full year as we
talk about changes to what we've had in our previous guidance. We would have had obviously a much smaller impact
than that in this particular quarter.
And, okay, are there any other callers?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: By the way, we – in regards to, Marc, you'd also – for the restructuring of the U.S. sales force,
we actually accrued our provision for that in the fourth quarter of 2012.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Yeah. And as you think about the yen impact, recall that that particular geography contributes
over $2 billion of revenue for us. And at the rates, as Derica mentioned, that are currently there, you're probably
looking at a 15% to 20% devaluation depending on where the yen heads from here, so obviously you're talking about a
$300 million to $400 million headwind at the top line on revenue, again, for the full year.
Paul, do we have any more callers that have joined the queue?
Operator
Yes. From Morningstar, Damien Conover, please go ahead.
<Q - Damien Conover>: Great, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask a question about some of the recent
announcements of expanding the insulin manufacturing facilities. As you get ready to launch your next generation of
insulin products, wanted to know how much you can leverage your current manufacturing capacity and how much you
have to potentially build out for these next launches. And then, secondly, Sanofi has talked about having a biosimilar
version of its own Lantus. And just wanted to hear your comments on if that were to come through, just how that might
change the context of the market. Thank you.

<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Damien, we'll have John take your first question. I'll go ahead and take the second one.
John?
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: Damien, we've talked in recent months and years about manufacturing investments on two
aspects of our insulin portfolio. One is the active ingredient manufacturing process, which is the biosynthetic piece.
Investments that we've made and development strategies that we began to put in place a number of years ago will
enable us to essentially use the existing footprint that we currently have in place for manufacturing the active ingredient
that goes into Humulin and Humalog to not only continue to manufacture those medicines, but also our novel basal
insulin and our insulin glargine product without appreciable additional investment, there's some additional investment
required, but it's far less than if we had to build a new plant, and enable us to meet what we expect to be demand for
those products through the decade.
Now, we've recently – very recently, announced a further expansion in our drug product manufacturing part of the
equation, which is essentially additional capacity for manufacturing cartridges. That really reflects growth in demand.
We now manufacture those cartridge products both in – or we will be manufacturing them both in the U.S. and in
Europe. And even as we drive productivity from those operations, I think that's going be more of a function of market
demand. As new products come to market and there's a greater demand in countries like China for these products,
you're going to see us continue to make those kinds of investments. But those are relatively smaller capital investments
than investing in a plant to make new API.
<A - Philip Johnson>: Great. Thanks, John. And, Damien, in terms of Sanofi being involved in doing their own
biosimilar version of Lantus, I can't say that we're aware of specific plans that they talked about to do that. What we are
aware of that you may be referring to is that they're developing a more concentrated form, evidently, of Lantus, and
they've stated publicly I think that could have a different PK/PD profile, time-action profile, and they've highlighted
that as one of their later-stage development programs.
In the past we have said and I think we continue to believe that the overall glargine molecule will continue to be widely
used throughout this decade. We would expect to be able to play quite competitively given our manufacturing expertise
and capacity, our device expertise and capacity, and then obviously our commercial presence within that overall
glargine space.
But we would anticipate that branded Lantus, whether it's the current formulation or potentially this more concentrated
form should it get to market, will probably have roughly half of that overall glargine market would be our best estimate.
We then expect to compete very well in the novel insulin space hopefully, if we can get approval of our novel basal
insulin analog that aims to actually improve upon the characteristics and the benefits provided to patients from the
current basals that are available.
Paul, do we have any other callers on the line now?
Operator
There is a follow-up from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes, thanks very much. So just going back to the SG&A question, and you've provided a lot
clarity for 2013, so that's much appreciated, I'm just trying to understand going forward for 2014 directionally whether
the SG&A is likely to go down in 2014 or be flattish. So that's what I'm after to understand what the incremental
SG&A reductions are for 2014 to offset the revenue declines of Cymbalta and Evista. So, any color on flat or down in
2014 would be much appreciated.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Hi, David. This is Derica again. We're really not in a position to give specific guidance for
2014 at this stage. I still believe the biggest determinant of that is still going be what emerges from our pipeline.
Clearly, we'll be in a position this year to potentially submit up to five products for regulatory approval. Depending
upon the outcomes of those submissions and when we receive approval, there could be incremental spend that would be
behind some of those brands if we're successful. But until we know that, it's very difficult to predict at this stage.

What I can say is that today with the actions we've taken and that we've announced here most recently, we're very
consistent and in line with both the near-term and the medium-term guidance that we have put out there in terms of the
actions that was necessary to make sure that we meet those minimums of $20 billion in revenue, $3 billion in income
and $4 billion in cash flow. And we see our actions as very consistent with that, and we're actually a little bit ahead of
what we thought we'd be at this stage.
