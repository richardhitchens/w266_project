Jan Bennink
Okay. Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It is a pleasure to host the Sara Lee Fiscal 2011 Q4
Earnings Call this morning. I will start the meeting with taking you through an update of where we are with the spin.
Marcel will follow with a deep dive into the businesses and after which Mark will take you through the key numbers.
First of all, let me take you, I mean, through the update of the spin in the page one. I would say that we are very, very
happy with the things as they're going at the moment. They're going according to plan and we see no obstacle to
successfully get us to the end date within – for the two parent companies by the first half of fiscal – first half of
currently, sorry, 2012.
Let's have a look at what we have done so far and talk about the things we're still working on. First of all, looking back,
I think the portfolio of what we've done and what we've announced is five divestments of our non-core businesses. First
of all, the H&BC divestiture, you see completed at 98%, we're debating is it 98%, is it 99%. I think we're basically
there. It was at the tail end of the divestiture.
North American Fresh Bakery, very good news, I think, we expect the closing in September. I think, there's an awful
lot of debate about it, but that's what we can announce today. The Refrigerated Dough, which we announced two days
ago on the 9th, Ralcorp buying our refrigerated dough in the U.S., I think the price for which we've got for that, we're
very pleased with that. I think it is a great business and it will be in good hands with Ralcorp.
So, that is the first real announcement after closure of our businesses on Ralcorp. French Refrigerated Dough, it's in
progress, we've announced in June that it was up for strategic review. We've in the meantime seeing a lot of investors
and a lot of people who are interested in the business and we're making good progress towards an announcement in that
somewhere in the Q1, Q2.
The same is for Spanish Bakery and I think we are very pleased with that, I mean, we've been looking at that for a long
time and I think we've announced now today that we will divest the businesses and also there we have seen a lot of
interest and we expect an announcement for that in Q1 and Q2. We have announced an acquisition last time, the closure
has in the meantime happened, I mean, the business has been integrated completely into the budget. I think that is a,
although a small acquisition an important acquisition, and I think both the businesses as well as the people are very
pleased with how the things are happening over there.
So, I think that is a first and most important thing is the divestments, clarity of where we're going and a first build for a
new business. In terms of corporate structure, I think we have identified a net saving of about $130 million, which will
be kind of coming to fruition in the next two years. Now, if you take our headquarter costs and remember we had a lot
of discussions in our calls about our headquarter costs, what will happen with our headquarter costs and if you look at
the numbers, they're currently around $115 million.

So, if you take the $130 million net savings, which we'll have over the next two years, that is in a way offsetting
completely our headquarter costs, which we are currently having. And on top, we will have some more, so the $115
million in headquarter cost plus another additional $15 million happening in the next two years. We are working very
hard on changing the organizational structure for both companies to make them entrepreneurial, lean. And I think we
are well under way, we are not finished yet, I think it's a work in process, I would say Meat is probably ahead of
Coffee.
The announcement of Maria Henry as the CFO for the Meat business has been very well received. She is already
starting to work, I mean, her first three weeks are behind us and I think she's delivering a very nice new vision to what
the business should look like. And Coffee the same, I think we're looking at structuring our businesses. We're looking
at how to get faster to market, innovation processes and the top management structure. We're in the process, I think,
between now and late October, November we'll be fully staffed and it is very clear where the organization is and will
be.
So, also there in terms of the organizational structure, we're well under way. It is a longer process than you potentially
would see in some other businesses, but I think we want to be absolutely sure that we've set up the business for success,
with the best management we have in place. In terms of financial separation, the financial statements they're being
prepared, I mean, there is a lot of work being done on separating everything, I mean, that is a work stream which is on
track, a lot of work for a lot of people, while that's on track and there's no major hurdles foreseen. We're still awaiting
the IRS private letter ruling, important, and as I come back later that will probably happen somewhere in the fall be it in
October, be it in November, but somewhere in the fall of this year.
In terms of business performance, I think that we delivered solid business results. And if you realize where we've been
going through this fiscal, between the speculation in the first half of the fiscal, between the organizational changes, i.e.,
the divestments, all the kind of turmoil which we have created by going to a spin, I mean, in the insider, that is a lot of
insecurity we're creating at the business. And on top and last but definitely not least, is the commodity cost increases, of
be it $700 million, $680 million. That is an unprecedented number which I, in my career, have seen. And coffee, of
course, has been hit the most.
And all those three elements together and still having delivered the business results as we are, I think is a major
achievement. Just imagine that if you go where you normally talk as a trade and you talk to the – you go to the trade
and talk about business building ideas, I think, our year has been filled with talking about price increases. So, rather
than talking about business building, we've been talking about price increases. And it doesn't help your business and,
despite that, I think the results which we have delivered gives me a lot of confidence of where we would be going after
the spin or even in the next 12 months.
And then, if you go to the next page, I mean, 2012, the year of transition. We're not ready yet and I think it's probably
unfortunate, there's a lot of moving parts and I know you don't like that and we don't like it either. But we're doing our
best to do things as quickly as we potentially can. So, are we ready, everything will be stable this year? We cannot say,
yes. I mean, so it is the year of transition, we're well on the way. We'll do our best to make it as quickly as possible to
make your numbers comparable, easy, not have anything going and everything changing all the time. So, the year of
transition, but we feel very good about it.
What are we going to do in the rest of the time between now and the spin? And if you go to the next page, I think we
have a clear, clear, clear objective. What we want to do is we want to create two simpler, faster and much more
entrepreneurial pure-play companies than we currently have. What does it mean for Meats? Now, Meat has been
having and going through a very positive last two years. Forget the last year for the moment because with all the raw
material cost increases, it is not really a year where you can look at the trends. But it's a dip rather than a trend. I would
say that for Meats, we're working on accelerating top-line growth with continuous margin improvement. That's
absolutely the objective and I think, so far, everything I've seen, our objective is a very achievable one.
For Coffee & Tea, if you look at the past, I think margins of the Coffee & Tea business has always been very good. The
top-line growth has never been as good, I mean, it's been 1%, 2%, 3% and that's real top line growth, forget for a
moment the price increases in order to cover commodity increases as we see this year. I think you see a trend, we see a

dip this year and then we continue to grow the business. What we want to create is create top-line growth, which is
above industry average at historical margin levels. So, I think that is the clear objectives, that's how we're working at
the structure of the business, that's how we're working at the top-line of our business.
If you move to the next page, what are we doing for that in terms of improved growth? I think, first of all, and it is short
term, we are still looking and we give ourselves a kind of a deadline to Q1 October to really look very, very continue to
look in depth for what we want to do with our countries, what we want do with our products and kind of is there still
things we can optimize within the portfolio as we currently have it. So, that's a work for the next two to three months,
and that's what we are focusing on to make sure that we are completely achieving our objectives in terms of that clean
portfolio for pure play.
Another thing, which is incredibly important, is accelerating our innovation process and improve the route to market
for our new products. We have set up a program and I think within the turmoil, as I've said before, there's how to create
positive energy and I think the positive energy as we put a project in place, Energy in Motion, we've created four teams
in both companies, both in Meats as well as in Coffee, we've taken our high-potential people and have them report
directly to the CEO of the businesses as well as to myself. And their only purpose is to make sure that we have
innovations coming up, starting as of the Q3, Q4 of this year and an innovation pipeline which will make us feel happy
for the next three years.
And I have to say, being two months into the project, we see enormous progress. I'm very, very pleased with what I'm
seeing, and I think you will see, as an investor, you will start seeing things hitting the shelf as of Q4 of this year and
then hopefully going forward we'll see a lot more interesting things. And we've talked about, last time about the Coffee,
there's some sales, I think there's a lot of good stuff coming up.
Increased marketing spend is another way to improve growth. I mean, you can rest assured, we're not going to spend
more marketing just to spend more marketing. We're going to spend more marketing when we think it is reasonable, it
will not go for the dilution of our margins, it will just go to make sure that when we say something, well, part of it will
go to marketing spend and it will go against the products which we think can deliver additional role and additional
profit.
Looking at our cost and balance sheet structure, we're not finished with looking at our fixed cost. We said that we have
a net saving of $130 million. We will continue to look whether we can reduce our fixed costs even further beyond the
targets we've set. So, that is an ongoing project and I think there, we still see room for improvement.
And that is SG&A savings, I want to make a very clear split on one side SG&A savings and on other side gross margin
savings, because SG&A savings are easy to identify, for gross margin savings, that is a bit more difficult because often
they get into the P&L in a different way. But that's two different projects, two different work streams. Improve gross
margins, we are looking on our procurement optimization and we've been looking into our -- the way you buy, the way
how we buy, our buyers, everything. We're happy, but I think there is definitely room for improvement.
We're looking at reduction of variable costs by an ongoing program, and for those of you who are unfamiliar with the
record we have in Project Squeeze, that is exactly the process we're putting in place in currently in both Meats as in
Coffee, to make sure that we have additional savings in terms of packaging, in terms of way we go to market on an
ongoing basis. So, this is a yearly program where we look at reduction in our variable costs.
Mix management, we have made our reporting much more transparent for people into the organization to make sure
they can follow up margins and as a result, looking at product mixes and looking at country mixes and pushing the right
products, although it sounds very basic and elementary, I think will be embedded within the organization. So, we'll
push the high-margin products more to get our mix management better to a better margin at the end.
Appropriate price increases, as you've seen, we've done a lot of price increases. We have so far implemented all the
price increases which we need to cover the costs in both Coffee and Meats. And the price increases looking at the raw
materials at the moment, there is some tailwind potentially in the Coffee business, where the coffee prices were almost
$3.00 going now to $2.40 in terms of per kilo, so there is possibilities in terms of being less aggressive on price
increases, but we'll do whatever we think is necessary.

Working capital reduction, it's not the key priority at the moment, there's lots of things happening. But as of January
next year, we will start a working capital reduction. We're currently – and I'm looking here working capital only at the
operational part, which is stocks, receivables and payables. We're currently, as a percentage of net sales, at 12% to
13%. That is far, far, far higher than I've worked with. And I think our objectives are getting that down to levels which
are more in line with what I'm used to, which is around 5% to 0%, will be in place as of January and we'll achieve that
not immediately but this is a process we're putting in place. IRS private letter ruling, as I said before, will happen in the
fall. And as a result, the optimization of our balance sheet with additional operating structure will also happen in the
fall.
Then if you go to the next page, organization, we will be, we're estimating to be completely finalized with our
organization, which is from top to bottom, by December and so people can really start working on making the things
happen at the moment of the spin. So, that's December. Implementation, a little bit contrary to what we said before,
we'll have the Investor Days not one in November, not one in February, but what we'll do is we'll have the two Investor
Days in February and that's where we will give the total strategy, the names of the company, the financial guidance,
capital structures and the organization of both company at the respective Investor Day. So, that will be where you will
get the full and very transparent guidance of both of the companies and we have a lot of information then that we can
really share with you and hopefully the first results of – positive results of the businesses will be in then and by Q1 and
Q2.
The launch, as we said before, of the two Newcos, in the first half of calendar year 2012. That's according to the spin,
that's everything about the spin. I think Marcel will take it over now and will talk about the – additionally about the
businesses and will take a deep dive in the businesses. Okay. Marcel?
Marcel H. M. Smits
Okay. Thank you, Jan. Good morning to everybody on the call. Let me start with a quick review of the key points of
fiscal 2011. We are, of course, satisfied with the fact that the results came in at the high end of the updated guidance
range and you will have seen that there is a little complexity in the fact that since we gave that guidance, our North
American Refrigerated Dough business, which we sold to Ralcorp, went disc ops [discontinued operations], and you
would have seen in page five of our press release where we bridge our results to our most recent guidance issued in
May.
On a full-year basis, our adjusted net sales rose 5%, driven by pricing and mix, together up 8%. Our full-year adjusted
operating income declined 2% and that's obviously not what we were planning for when the year started, but it's not a
bad outcome against a background of having to absorb nearly $650 million of commodity cost increases. We've made
significant progress on reducing our corporate expenses and they came in almost $100 million lower than in fiscal
2010. And Mark will give you some details on that later. Despite the 2% decline in operating income, our adjusted EPS
increased by 16%, mainly as a result of the share count reduction.
Let me just zoom in on the commodity cost increases and remind you that we started the year expecting around $200
million of headwinds. That number settled at $646 million, fairly close to our most recent estimates. Faced with this
challenge, we've been very clear on where we felt the priorities were. The first priority is to protect the long-term health
of our margin structure and hence our ability to innovate and support the brands.
Not cutting our MAP spending to the bone is one element of protecting the long-term health of the business and
pushing through price increases is the other. In pushing for price increases, we've been willing to take short-term risks
on the volume side and we've been quite upfront about that. And meanwhile, we've pushed extremely hard to take as
much cost out of the system as we could in order to protect our bottom line.
Now, in all, we've seen a small decline in operating income and margin, as I've just said. It's not something to brag
about, but it was absolutely the right thing to do. In fiscal 2012, the commodity price increases that we have seen to
date will, of course, annualize and that means that we have another $500 million of cost increases ahead of us. Now,

the good news is that in North America Meats, all the required price increases in order to deal with this are already in,
and in the International Beverage business, we still have a bit of work to do in terms of price increases, but mostly
we're done and we expect to be fully done by the end of the first quarter.
Now, this slide shows our price progression throughout the year. The figures speak for themselves. In North America,
you will recall that as of the third quarter, our price increases and lean savings fully compensated the commodity cost
increases and that was a major milestone which was repeated in the fourth quarter. In International Beverage, this
milestone will be reached in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Now, where does that leave us for fiscal 2012 guidance?
These are the figures. We're shooting for a significant increase in both the top line and the bottom line. EPS will
increase with a higher percentage than the operating income, again, as a result of lower average share count.
Let me draw your attention to a couple of the bullets down below. We have excluded International Bakery from the
guidance and the prior-year figures for obvious reasons and the same, of course, is true for our North American
Refrigerated Dough business. For the sake of simplicity, we are expressing this guidance based on the assumption of a
spin at the last day of the year. We're targeting the spin to take place a couple of months before that, but the table would
become very complicated if we would reflect all that.
These figures are comprised of our North American Meats business, our Coffee business and, of course, our corporate
expenses. Run rate of corporate expenses in the order of magnitude of $110 million to $120 million, and as Jan has
explained, these costs will fall to the wayside after the spin. Well, actually, they will disappear. We have a fair amount
of people and resources dedicated – vastly dedicated to the spin which no longer will be needed and actually they will
be absorbed by the two businesses.
But in our plan, these increments that will be absorbed by the businesses will be offset with cost savings from the
restructuring that we are pushing through. As said, these figures are for the company as a whole. We're going through
quite a few portfolio changes. The environment is very turbulent and we're right in the middle of pushing through some
of the restructuring. But some of the benefits we're making confirmation of where exactly they will fall and in our plan
for fiscal 2012, we have all of that neatly allocated but we will wait to see how things fan out in detail and expect to
give you separate guidance later in the year.
Let me quickly address what we've previously told you regarding fiscal 2012. Excluding North American Refrigerated
Dough, we told you we would have tailwinds of approximately $0.15. Our guidance now projects an increase of $0.14
to $0.20. We have some puts and takes from where we were a couple of months ago, but for the most part we're still
tracking to plan. We have one material difference and that is stranded costs, which are going to be higher, and that's in
part attributable to the H&BC transaction and the North American Fresh Bakery transaction coming through later than
anticipated, and in part, this is the result of additional dispositions, such as the International Bakery business.
Apart from that, our guidance range reflects increasing marketing investments in our plan and, of course, volume risk.
Now, enough said about guidance, let's go into the business segments. Let me start with North America; first, our Retail
business. For the second straight quarter, pricing actions coupled with productivity gains enabled the business to offset
commodity increases in the quarter. Sales grew by 4%, driven by more than 8% increases in prices.
Volume was down, in line with a decrease in the third quarter and that requires some perspectives. Given our position
as market leaders in most categories and given our strategy to protect a healthy margin structure, we have mostly been
at the forefront of price increases. And that leads us to being less competitive from time to time, at least temporarily. In
some categories, we've seen only a small impact on the volume side and the slide enumerates success in Jimmy Dean, a
recently good performance in Ball Park. In other categories, we did suffer from a volume point of view, with some of
our competitors either taking a different perspective on commodity cost realities and others perhaps seeing an
opportunity to recover some ground. Be that as it may, apart from the 4% sales increase, we delivered a large increase
in operating income despite the volume loss. In part, that was driven by lower MAP spending against an unusually high
expenditure in the last quarter of fiscal 2010. The rest is the result of cost saves and margin increases.
Meanwhile, in fiscal 2011, we completed the implementation of SAP in our meat plants and, of course, we
commissioned the new Kansas City plant. Both of these actions will help us in 2012. This is an overview of the figures

by quarter, in fact, it is for reference purposes. So, I won't dwell on it too long, but let me just call out a couple of items.
Sales grew in all quarters, which is shown in the second line of the slide.
On the pricing line, you can see the prices gradually increased as the year progressed and our volume figures were
negative in last three quarters for the reasons that I've just explained. In terms of operating, our adjusted operating
margin, down below, we ended up with 11.1% for the year. Let's then turn to North American Foodservice. First of all,
I'd like to remind you that these figures exclude our North American Refrigerated Dough Business, which went disc
ops. But they still do include our North American Foodservice Coffee business, which as of fiscal 2012 will move over
to the Coffee & Tea business.
And let me just say that we're very pleased with the way the year has played out for this segment. You'll remember that
last year, we lost two foodservice contracts, which has been a drag on performance in every quarter and, fortunately,
that's now behind us. But as the year progressed, we saw performance climb back up. In our last quarter, sales were up
9% and for the year as a whole, we were up 3%. In the last three quarters, we've seen increases in operating income and
for the year as a whole, we're up. We did well in terms of recovering commodity cost increases and we did well in our
Meats, Frozen Bakery and our Liquid Coffee business, which are the areas where we see the most value creation. In all,
we're very pleased with the way this segment has played the year.
And these are the financials, note the increases in sales in quarter three and quarter four. And also, please note the
increases in adjusted operating income in the last three quarters. Now, with that said, on last year's business
performance, let me just look forward for our North American business. First, on the volume price and commodity cost
equation; long-term, the definition of success, of course, is to increase share, sales and operating income. And in 2011,
we've had to make trade-offs and we've played our part in securing the long-term health of our categories where we
have leadership positions.
For 2012, we feel good about the innovation that we have in the pipeline, which is the long-term remedy against having
to make too many trade-offs. And as the year progresses, you will increasingly see a range of new products hit the
market. We feel good about the fact that as we start the new year, we have all the price increases in place to deal with
the commodity costs as we currently see them in the forward markets. We have some headwinds from stranded costs
following the disposition of North American Fresh Bakery and Refrigerated Dough, but we also have meaningful cost
saves coming through and that means that we have some firepower to, where necessary, dial back at a tactical level on
prices wherever we need it in order to protect our share.
That's for 2012. And if I take a longer-term perspective, we will drive growth through continued investment behind our
four key brands, Hillshire Farm, Jimmy Dean, Ball Park and Sara Lee. We aim to gradually increase MAP spending,
Jan has already talked about it, and we're working to skew our portfolio more towards the premium end of the meat
spectrum. The Aidells acquisition was a good example of where we would like to go.
Now, let me know then turn to the International Beverage segment, which will largely make up our Coffee & Tea
company. The headline, of course, is again commodity cost increases. We've made a ton of progress to deal with the
situation, in Q4, our price increases were no less than 14.7% on average. That's pretty unprecedented, but still, it wasn't
enough. As you see here, we're still one quarter away from offsetting the commodity price increases and this is on a
dollar basis; it will take a while to get back to our percentage gross margins.
Adjusted sales increased by 14% in the quarter, mainly as a result of the price increases but also slightly flattened by
the increase of our Brazilian green coffee export. The volume decline in the quarter was 9% and that needs some
explanation. It broadly breaks down into three issues, first an easy one. We stepped out of a private label contract in
France, which was loss making and which we can do without in the longer-term manufacturing plans. Secondly then in
Brazil, we were ahead of the competition and that's caused a volume hit. We bit our tongue and I'm pleased to report
that meanwhile this has been corrected or this has corrected itself and competition has followed us.
Brazil, of course, has a lot of volume at relatively low prices. So, if you have a down quarter that really moves the
needle. The last item then is the Netherlands, where fourth quarter volume declines breakout into two components.
Firstly, we had a market decline, which is attributed to the weather being unusually warm in the spring and early

summer. Now, I have to say that I'm always a bit wary about weather explanations, but the fact that we saw a reversal
coming through in rainy July gives comfort. I guess, the jury is still out.
The second issue then is pricing. We're now selling a 500 gram packet close to €5, which is a hard pill to swallow for
the frugal Dutch and hence we've lost some share to the other game in town, private label. We have good management
in place in the Netherlands and we are completing our discussions on what the way forward is, we have great
innovation and ideas for the medium term, which we're now linking back to more tactical ideas for the short term. An
item to watch, but I'm confident that we'll get it fixed.
Meanwhile, our L'OR EspressO continues to perform very well in France and initial results in the Netherlands, Spain
and Belgium reaffirm the growth potential of this product. The product is now available in over 15,000 stores in
Europe. In Brazil, the launch of Senseo in São Paulo and Rio is showing promising results and the integration of
Demasco is ahead of plan with better-than-expected synergies in growth. In Australia, we reached a record-high value
share in instants, behind successful new product launches.
While not on this slide, I'm going to cover that nevertheless. It's one of my personal favorites. The new Excellence
machine we showed you at CAGNY for the liquid foodservice business is doing very well and with more machines
added to our machine line, we're becoming more optimistic about volume prospects in our liquid business.
These are the financials. Can I just call out again the prices which read 14.7% in the last quarter. Notable is further
MAP, which slightly increased for the full year. The fourth quarter we were down, but remember in fiscal 2010, we
launched L'OR EspressO in France in the last quarter. Going to the operating income line, we're down and also our
margins are below what we're used to and, partially, that's attributable to the currency mark-to-market impact. But that
said, it's clear that we have work to do.
As I look forward, as I've just done for Meats, let's do it now for Coffee. Let me just start again by addressing again the
volume price and commodity cost equation. We have to recover commodity cost increases and we're on track to hit that
milestone in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. That will help. Meanwhile, from what we've seen since the start of the
New Year, we're confident that the fourth quarter volume decline is not an indicator of underlying trends for the
reasons explained. And in the short-term, we'll continue to get lift from the innovations that we're rolling out such as
L'OR EspressO, new machines coming through Foodservice, Senseo in Brazil, they're all in place.
So, we feel okay about the prospects for making a decent step in 2012. With that said, we need a leap, and in that
context, let's go back to what we discussed in Paris on the occasion of the Deutsche Bank Conference. Jan on that
occasion talked conceptually about where we needed to go. He talked about reigniting roast and ground, about claiming
our fair share in instants, about new technology, about tea, about foodservice, and all supported by a redesigned
marketing and R&D organization and process. That was a conceptual conversation. Meanwhile, we've made lots of
progress, we're now two or three months later and I'm pleased to report that these concepts are starting to shape up into
plans.
Jan and I were present in an output meeting of the Energy in Motion teams and we're both very excited about what was
presented. Now, the trick is to take it to next level. We got it from a concept to a plan and we have to take it from a plan
to execution and get it to market. It will take a couple of quarters and for obvious reasons we can't show you too much
of it ahead of time, but it bodes well. I'd like to quickly cover the performance of the International Bakery segment. It's
a tough patch and I commend the management teams who are leading these businesses, but the decision to exit from
our French and Spanish business is the right one. This is not for us, there will be others who will do better.
Operationally, not much has changed since what we said in May and you see the tough market conditions in Spain have
manifested in declines in adjusted net sales and operating income in the quarter. We consciously decreased prices in
Spain in an attempt to reverse or at least slow down our performance declines. We suffered on the bottom line and I can
only take consolation from the fact that competition doesn't seem to have a good time either. The restructuring
activities to transform the sales force to independent operators that we've talked to you before, has been meanwhile
agreed and will provide meaningful benefits

We pushed them forward, even though the benefits will accrue to whoever buys the business. We're pleased to say that
there have been a number of people out there who have expressed a strong interest. They understand that while we'll
going through a rough patch, we've been doing exactly the right things in terms of lowering our cost base and
positioning ourselves strategically.
Our French business is doing okay, under some price pressure, but still very profitable and it, too, has attracted
significant interest from parties who have synergy potential. The financials, then, came as no surprise, you see the
pricing impact and the resulting operating income decline. And with that, we've done all the segments.
Let me now hand it over to Mark to walk you through some of the details of our financials and I'll be back for closing
remarks in a minute.
Mark A. Garvey
Thank you, Marcel. I would now like to walk you through the fourth quarter and full-year results in a little bit more
detail. On this slide, you can see adjusted operating segment income for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 with the
comparisons of the same periods in fiscal 2010. Total adjusted operating income was $189 million for the fourth
quarter compared to $135 million last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income was $809 million compared to
$827 million in fiscal 2010. I want to point out that the $809 million is not directly comparable to our latest guidance,
due to North American Refrigerated Dough moving to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter. This business
contributed $42 million of operating income to discontinued operations in fiscal 2011. Therefore, including refrigerated
dough results puts us within our guidance range.
As an adjusted operating segment income level, the results for the year were primarily impacted by commodity costs,
which were not completely offset by pricing, particularly in the International Beverage Segment as well as volume
softness in North American Retail and International Beverage and continued weakness in International Bakery due to
price competition in Spain.
If you combine the results for North American Retail and Foodservice, adjusted operating segment income was
basically flat in North America versus last year, as growth in Foodservice offset a slight decline in Retail. We are very
happy to report that corporate costs, including commodity mark-to-market and intangible amortization, came in $117
million lower than last year. This included a decline in core corporate costs versus fiscal 2010 of $94 million, as Marcel
referred to earlier. Core corporate costs are lower primarily due to the impact of head count reductions, lower employee
benefit costs, and some smaller items, such as the sale of the company plane during the year and lower franchise taxes.
Now let me turn briefly to currency mark-to-market. Rising green coffee prices continue to be a significant factor
impacting the performance of the International Beverage Segment during the quarter and full year. As we have
discussed with you previously, our coffee commodity costs do include adjustments for currency mark-to-market each
quarter.
On this slide, you can see the impact by quarter for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we
had a currency mark-to-market gain of $7 million compared to a gain of $1 million in the same period of fiscal 2010,
therefore a positive delta of about $6 million. However, in the full year this delta led to a $55 million drag on the
International Beverage results.
The next slide quantifies in more detail the primary drivers of the year-over-year changes in adjusted operating income
from fiscal 2010. Pricing net of commodities were a negative $25 million in the fourth quarter, including the $6 million
benefit from currency mark-to-market, as just discussed. Project Accelerate contributed $29 million in savings. And
MAP investment was $44 million lower due to very heavy investment in last year's fourth quarter behind several new
product launches.
Lean savings, commodity mark-to-market gains, as well as lower pension costs drove additional operating income and
were somewhat offset by a lower volume mix result and costs for Kansas City and our SAP implementation in North
America. A similar theme is evident for the full-year results, with pricing net of commodities at a negative $178

million, Project Accelerate contributing $87 million, and slightly lower MAP investment of $16 million.
Now let me turn to earnings per share. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.19 for continuing
and discontinued operations. As you are aware, there were a number of events during the quarter as we ramped up the
activity for the creation of two pure-play companies. Firstly, the completion of the sale of the shoe care business
resulted in a gain of $0.22, which is included in our reported earnings under discontinued operations. There were also
some tax adjustments in the quarter, primarily related to discontinued operations. In addition, there were costs incurred
related to Project Accelerate, spin-off related activities, and exit and severance actions in our business segments, as we
continue to work down stranded overhead and prepare the businesses for spin.
This brings us to adjusted earnings per share of $0.24 for the fourth quarter, $0.20 of which relates to continuing
operations and compares to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.07 in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2010.
For the full year, adjusted EPS was $1.05, with $0.78 from continuing operations, which compares to $0.67 in fiscal
2010. Once again, I would like to point out that these figures exclude North American Refrigerated Dough, which
contributed $0.01 to EPS for discontinued operations in the quarter and $0.04 for the full year. Again, when you
include Refrigerated Dough, that would bring us to the top end of our guidance range for EPS.
Now I would like to give you a different perspective on how the fiscal 2011 results break down between what will be
the new Coffee & Tea company and North American Meat company. Consistent with our fiscal 2012 guidance,
International Bakery is excluded from these numbers. In addition, the North American Beverage results are included in
the Coffee company numbers. The total of both North American Meat company and Coffee company results less
corporate costs match the fiscal 2011 results that are provided in the guidance table and reconciled at the back of the
press release.
As you can see on this slide, on a pro forma basis, the new Coffee & Tea Company had revenues of approximately $4.1
billion in fiscal 2011 and North American Meat Company had revenues of $3.9 billion. Additionally, Meat Company
accounted for approximately $418 million of operating segment income excluding significant items; and Coffee & Tea
Company came in at $481 million. Corporate costs including amortization and mark-to-market were approximately
$107 million. And this brings the operating segment income on a combined basis to $792 million, which you will
recognize from our guidance table.
Now let me turn to cash flow. Cash flow from operations came in at $447 million for the full year, which is at the top
end of our guidance range of $400 million to $450 million. We ended fiscal 2011 with a gross debt balance of $2.7
billion and a cash balance of $2.1 billion. This of course differs to our prior guidance, as we had previously assumed
that our North American Fresh Bakery transaction would have closed by fiscal year end. As we have discussed, this is
now expected to occur in Q1 of fiscal 2012.
I would also like to give you some information on our estimated fiscal 2012 year-end cash and debt balances. At this
time, we expect the end-of-year cash position to be approximately $300 million and the gross debt to be approximately
$2.3 billion. And for simplicity, this assumes that the spin-off occurs on the last day of the fiscal year. And it also
assumes the completion of sales related to all announced strategic reviews, the payment of the $3 special dividend, and
the payment of the repatriation taxes for which we have already provided. We will provide you with regular updates on
our expected year-end cash and gross debt positions as we progress through fiscal 2012.
I am also very happy to share that we had a positive swing of almost $500 million in our pension funded status. A year
ago, we were underfunded by $450 million. As of fiscal 2011 year end, we have a pension surplus of approximately
$40 million. Yet I should point out that the $450 million is restated to exclude Fresh Bakery and North American
Refrigerated Dough, which are both now discontinued operations. The improvement in funded status is driven
primarily by the strong performance of the plan's assets during the year.
Now I would like to give you an update on Project Accelerate. First, let me point out that consistent with our fiscal
2012 guidance, all numbers for Accelerate have been restated to exclude past and future costs and benefits attributable
to International Bakery and North American Refrigerated Dough. On this basis, we now expect cumulative benefits for

the project of approximately $250 million by the end of fiscal 2012. This includes incremental benefits of $73 million
achieved in fiscal 2011, which took the cumulative benefits to $190 million. Therefore, incremental fiscal 2012 benefits
are expected to be approximately $60 million for continuing operations.
The fiscal 2012 benefits are largely attributable to the implementation of SAP in the North American factories and
restructuring and outsourcing in Coffee & Tea. Cumulative charges through 2011 were $165 million and there are
minimal additional costs in association with Accelerate expected in fiscal 2012. We are very pleased with the success
of the Accelerate program, which has enabled us to consistently drive cost efficiencies throughout our business. Going
forward, costs and benefits for Accelerate will no longer be separately disclosed, as they partially overlap with the
overall cost reduction program referred to earlier by Jan, which I will now discuss.
As Jan mentioned, we are looking closely at both Meat company and Coffee company to determine additional cost
saving opportunities as we prepare for the spin. To-date, we have identified savings in fiscal – which will come through
in fiscal 2012 and 2013 incremental to fiscal 2011 in the range of $180 million to $200 million. These savings include
the additional $60 million of savings from Project Accelerate, which I just discussed.
Now, these savings will enable both companies to offset stranded costs resulting from the sale of businesses such as
International Bakery and U.S. Refrigerated Dough of approximately $50 million to $60 million. In addition, these
savings will effectively enable both new companies to absorb any new corporate costs they will require as stand-alone
companies.
As Marcel referred to earlier, corporate costs are expected to be approximately $110 million to $120 million for fiscal
2012. We fully expect that these costs will either disappear in fiscal 2013 or will be absorbed by the two new
companies and mitigated as a result of the savings achieved. The savings identified include head count reductions at
corporate and the business segments, rationalization of manufacturing capacity and reductions in office space.
In fiscal 2012, we expect to incur one-time costs of approximately $425 million, of which approximately $300 million
relates to restructuring initiatives including reductions in force, the recently announced closure of our Paris, Texas
plant, downsizing in the North American headquarters and the reset of existing global contracts. In addition to the
restructuring costs, we expect to incur approximately $125 million of transaction-related costs in fiscal 2012, as we
execute activities in support of the spin.
And with that, I will hand it back to Marcel for some closing remarks.
Marcel H. M. Smits
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, let me just keep this real short. When we announced the plan to split the company into two
separate legal – or separate listed entities in January, we had in mind two things: one, unlocking the value as a result of
going through the process of actually creating two separate companies and some portfolio reshuffles. And I'm pleased
to say that process of unlocking value is now in full swing, we are fully in execution mode.
Execution is going well and we are anticipating that we will be ready in the early part of calendar 2012. The other core
belief that we had when we announced the split was that we'd create two better companies than we had before. And that
was all about not so much about unlocking value, but about creating value. I think the really exciting thing is that we're
actually seeing that happening inside the two companies.
So, people are becoming more pragmatic about costs, I think there's more dynamism around innovation. And as I said,
we have talked about that conceptually, it's gradually transforming itself into plan, it will take a while before it comes
into execution, but we're getting there. So, we're doing well and fully executing on the unlocking side of value and
we're very confident that both of the companies will actually create a lot of value, they'll be more nimble, more focused
on their respective market opportunities and we have every confidence that they'll both do great.
And with that, let me just open it to questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Terry Bivens, your line is open, and please state your company name.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: I'm from JPMorgan. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Hi, Terry. How are you?
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hey.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Quite a performance on the pension there, I wish you guys could manage for my 401(k). Two
things are really, Marcel and I guess Jan as well, as you look into the Coffee business over in Europe, can you give us
some indication of how far along you are in securing a senior management team there?
<A - Jan Bennink>: We are very close and I would say that in the next two months it will be signed, sealed and
hopefully delivered.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: So, you are in pretty active part, I --
<A - Jan Bennink>: And I gave myself a little bit leeway by saying November. But I think we'll be earlier.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Talk about upon leeway, which is just giving up.
<A - Jan Bennink>: You asked me for it. I feel confident about it.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay. And I have one question on the French market in particular. Who is gaining and losing
share there in France? Is it a Nespresso or your L'OR EspressO?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Terry, we are gaining share. We are doing well in the French market. We've lost some
volume as a result of the private label contract. But overall, we're doing well and the reason why we're doing well is
because we keep doing well with L'OR EspressO. So, that turns up in the market share figures in the retail market,
that's not an entirely fair view, of course, because L'OR EspressO is a part of the retail market but that then sort of
ignores the Nestlé sales outside the retail market.
If you look at it over a slightly longer-term horizon then you can see that, let's say, three or four year period and you
don't just take the retail market in terms of what goes through supermarket and the hypermarkets but you include what
we guesstimate to be the sales of Nespresso, then clearly, Nestlé is winning, we're holding share and others are losing.
That is an overall top-line picture and the fact that we're holding share in what would have been the core market for
Nespresso is a testament to the fact that we've done well. We've come with Senseo a couple years back, that's doing
well. We've come with L'OR EspressO, that's doing well, we've come with a whole range of innovations. We have our
brands, we support our brands and we have been doing quite well in France.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Nestlé has expressed a view that it's going to be a protracted process, settling the legal issue
there, what's your view of that? And then I'll pass it along. Thank you.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes. That could well be the case. So, let me just reiterate what we've said in the past.
Before we launched this product, we went through three years of preparation and so far, we see the playbook playing
out in line with what we anticipated. That is, if anything, a testament to the fact that people who did the preparation did
their homework extremely well, because they were accurately predicting what would happen. So we're confident on the
fact that we're not infringing anybody's patents, we're confident about our legal position and we're also confident that
we're on the right side of the consumer. Consumers like the broader availability of the product, and so that makes us
confident that in the end, we will prevail. Shall we go on to the next one, Terry?

<Q - Terry Bivens>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow and please state your company name.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Bank of Montréal. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Good morning.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Very quick question, when was your pension fund status calculated?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: At the very end of the fiscal year, Ken. So it's always done at the end of the fiscal year, so
July 2nd or 3rd, I guess. I'm sure you're asking the question in relation to what's happened to the equity market --
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: That is the question. Yes, I'm assuming it's not as funded.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Well, I'm sure it is not as good today as it was at the end of the fiscal year. But let me give
you a perspective in North America. We have three major pension funds, North America, UK and Netherlands. We're
fairly limited in exposure to equities in our North America funds, it's about 10%, 15% I think, it's about over 30% in
Netherlands and about 15% to 20% in the UK.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Okay.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: If I can add some color to that, Ken, and you will remember that about a year ago, we
added another $200 million in to the North American fund. We then took a decision to limit our exposure to the
downside. We have no benefit from an upside would equity markets do extremely well, so there is no reason why we
should have taken exposure on the downside. If you do that, that means that your ongoing pension expense and the gap
increases a bit. We took that decision, nevertheless, because we don't want to have the exposure to fluctuations of the
equity market as much as we can. We're in full control of that in the UK and the U.S., where there's about two-thirds of
our pension exposure. In the Netherlands, the trustees are more at arm's length, so we have less control over that and,
therefore, in the Netherlands we have a higher exposure to equities than we have in the U.S. and the UK. So, a lot more
granularity, hope that satisfies your question.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: I appreciate it. My other question is, as you go through a legal structure of the
organization, have you found anything in terms of the tax implications, be it the repatriation, anything that you could
share with us? Obviously, you've changed the way you're going to spin it, but is there any sort of implication that we
should glean from as you guys go through the legal structure of the organization?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: I think what we have today is that we've said in the press release, look, we've had
expenses discussions with the relevant authorities in the relevant jurisdictions over the last few months. We now know
a lot more and that has led us to take and say, we are confident in that we will end up with an effective tax rate for the
Coffee business which is going to be below 35%. We have in the end decided to put that statement in, but you'll
appreciate that we want to conclude the discussions with the relevant authorities before we talk about that in the public
domain.
If only as a matter of courtesy we should just go through all of that and pin it all down, and once we have it, we will
immediately, at the appropriate timing inform the market. And the other piece of news is that what we have today, as
we've said, we reckon that the response from the IRS private letter ruling request will come in the fall. So, we're sitting
on quite a bit of progress, we're becoming – on the basis of that progress, we're more bullish, but we want to complete
the discussions with relevant authorities before we update the market.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: And there is no change to repatriation as well? I saw it in the press release, I just wanted to
confirm.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes. No changes to repatriation. Yes.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English. Please state your company name.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey, good morning, guys, Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Thanks for the question.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: I hope everyone is doing well, two quick questions. First, I want to make sure I fully understand
the amount of earnings power that has been moved out of fiscal 2012 income statement with the reclass of the bakery
businesses. Let me walk you through my math and tell me if and where I'm wrong here.
Fiscal 2011, in looking at the tables you guys have disclosed, it looks like you had $0.07 of earnings power. Looking at
Project Accelerate, you previously had a midpoint of around $95 million. You're lowering that to $60 million. That's
another $0.04 by my math. And we had a planned amortization step down of around $20 million that I think is assigned
to the business. That's $0.02. So I cume them and I get to $0.13. Am I thinking about it correctly?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: The Accelerate number is correct. The amortization is correct. The $0.07 for bakery, I think
that's both bakery and store brands you might be including there because I think...
<A - Melissa Napier>: Yes.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: ...store brands are $0.04 and bakery is $0.03, I think, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Yes, yes, I'm cumeing those. Okay, thank you. That's helpful, so $0.13. The next question is
regarding these stranded costs and MAP expectations. How much of those costs and when do you think you can work
down, that $50 million to $60 million? And what is assumed in your guidance in terms of MAP step up for fiscal 2012?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: I'd speak to the stranded costs. Our expectation is that stranded costs would effectively not be
there once we get to 2013. So we've got $180 million to $200 million of savings initiatives, as you've seen, Jason.
You'd expect that come through roughly 50:50, I would say, between fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013; $60 million is already
coming through in 2012 because of Accelerate. And then I think on MAP, Marcel, do you want to comment on that?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes. Let me just be precise on the stranded cost. It's not all going to disappear in 2013, but
it's going to be compensated by savings...
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Correct.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: ...in the system. So we have a gross number of $180 million to $200 million of costs that
we're taking out, approximately $50 million to $60 million for that we need in order to offset the stranded cost. And
then we have a net benefit of $130 million.
Now in terms of MAP spending, yes, what we have said is in the long term, we are strong believers that the MAP
spending of both companies should go up. We have built that into our plan, and we have on purpose not included that
in the guidance table, Jason. If things go well, if our volumes do well and we can afford more than otherwise, then I
think it's the overriding proviso as the year progress and we see new innovations coming through, I'm sure that we'll all
look at them and say hey, is this some stuff that is worth putting significant money behind because the overriding
proviso used to be that you don't spend any money behind stuff that isn't worth it. So as the year progresses and we're
confident that our volumes do well and that we have relevant innovation to advertise behind, we will put significant
resources behind them.
<Q - Jason English>: Thank you, I appreciate that. I'll pass it on.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Serotta. Please state your company name.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Good morning. I'm from Wells Fargo.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Good morning.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: I think Marcel and Jan both mentioned the need for further pricing in coffee. I'm wondering
whether you could provide some detail about the pricing environment in some of your key markets, given the pull back
in green coffee from, as you pointed out, above $3 to the $2.40 range today.
<A - Jan Bennink>: If you look at the pricing, we have implemented and discussed with most of the trade our price
increases. So I think we're in the process of fully materializing them, but the price increases needed to cover the raw
materials are being negotiated or being in place. What do we see in the market? I think we see in the market, up until
now and this is I'm talking up until two weeks ago, we see that normally when we increase our prices, the private labels
and others follow us, so there is a clear indication that they follow us.
As Marcel said in his discussion, there are two elements. It's them following us and the price difference in absolute
euros. So they're following us, they're doing it. So far we haven't seen a reverse trend. We don't expect a reverse trend
because, if you look at margins there are still some significant opportunity to just go back to the margins we were. So
we're looking at some price increases if necessary, or the green beans prices go down sufficiently, we'll recover our
margins as such. But no price decreases; you've seen nothing in that realm, and so far all the indications are that people
follow us.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes. I think, Eric, people are still hurting from the price increases that have come through.
So even if the green coffee prices come down a bit, and they have come down a bit overall in recent times, everybody
says that's fine, but that means we have a little less hurt, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you all of a sudden are
saying that we're now starting to make enormous amounts of money. Everybody is still recovering in the market from
the price increases that did gradually come through last year.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay, that's helpful. And on an unrelated note, has any consideration been given to the sale of the
North American Frozen Bakery business, the namesake Sara Lee piece?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Look, we've gone through a whole range of portfolio choices. And there are
considerations as to how strategically well positioned businesses are, how integrated they are with the rest of our
business, the complexities of taking things apart. We have a fairly full load of disposition activities. We are shaking up
the tree quite violently. So that particular one, we've said let's not touch that one.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay, thank you. I'll pass it on.

relative to at least what the rest of I guess the analyst side believes and my belief, which is single-serve has been
growing really fast, gaining share, and you've made comments saying you think your roast and ground business and
instant business can grow much faster than what they've done in the past.
I'm just trying to get a sense of how do you think that's going to play out over the next three to five years globally? Do
you expect roast and ground to grow faster than single-serve? I'm just trying to understand how positive you are about
roast and ground and how that's going to play out globally. Why will consumers start or go back to roast and ground
more so than they have in the last five or ten years?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I think if you look at it, there is definitely a trend, if you look at overall consumer trends, that
people want to go back to beans. I think beans is the ultimate in good thinking. There would have been some articles I
think also even in the FT somewhere in April – May about how people are trending back to beans. If you look at our
just not the ground part, but the beans part is growing very significantly in our portfolio. If you look at what Starbucks
is doing, if you look at what other smaller players actually are doing in the roast and ground market and I look even like
smaller players like Stumptown in terms of the coffee business. If I look at Starbucks, what they're launching in terms
of their total roast and ground, I think there will be an overall trend that people go back to beans; people will go back to
the value of the beans. And it is up to the marketeers and up to the companies who run it to make it work.
So far, it has been handled by Starbucks for a great deal, even in the retail. It has been handled by smaller players. And
I think if you look at us, they're definitely in the markets where we will play. I expect the market to start picking up.
That will also be for single-serve, so both the roast and ground branded business as well as the single-serve will
continue to grow.
Will single-serve continue to grow as fast as it is currently? I'm not so sure. I think it will be a mix of both. Just look at
the shelves for your roast and ground, how people segment the market, how they market the product. Again, as I said
before, for us it's like a brick pack. We say it is dark roast, that's it; one segment, one variation, nothing else. If you
look at the possibilities you can do, just go to Stumptown if you're in the U.S. Just go to Starbucks to a lesser extent,
but there are lots and lots of possibilities where we're looking at. And trends are there, will they grow? How much will
they grow, and will they grow everywhere? I think it is a wherever the companies do their work, it will, and wherever
the companies do not do their work, it will be a bit less. But the more I see, the more I'm convinced of what I said in the
beginning.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: If I can add some quantitative perspective on that, the conventional wisdom is the
single-serve grows and roast and ground declines, and you've just alluded to the possibility that roast and ground would
grow faster than single-serve. We don't see that coming anytime soon, but we do challenge the conventional wisdom
that roast and ground is destined to decline. And there are interesting segments, subsegments in all markets that we
participate in which actually would support that belief that it's not a given that roast and ground is a commodity and
therefore it can only decline.
<A - Jan Bennink>: I don't think the market – the coffee market itself, I think rather than declining, I think that you
will see an uptick.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: And one just follow-up on coffee, what's your view on coffee prices and how far hedged are
you in terms of your $500 million projection for cost increases in 2012?
<A - Jan Bennink>: Coffee prices, I think in terms of what we think, is that it will remain a difficult market. They're
currently at $2.40 versus they were at $2.90. They have dipped a little bit. They came up a little bit, but we continue to
think that the prices will be staying up high. I think Starbucks has said exactly the same and we think the same thing.
We are covered and we have extended our cover of our raw material prices actually. So we've been going a little bit
more for security to avoid volatility, and we've covered ourselves at a good level. But we feel comfortable and we are
farther out.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Perfect. Thank you. I'll pass it along.

Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Tim Ramey. And please state your company name.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey>: It's D.A. Davidson. Good morning. Jan, you mentioned sort of benchmarking your
experiences fairly versus some of the other companies where you've served in the past. And I just find these unit
volume gains pretty alarming and I wonder how you feel about them. I get that it's a tactical decision to protect margin,
but we also really don't see that from the other participants in the coffee business in particular.
<A - Jan Bennink>: You see it to a certain extent because if you look at private labels, they have increased their
prices. So they have protected their margins as well. So everybody sees and feels the same thing. So do you play a
complete volume game? Are we completely out of our mind in terms of do we go and price up until we have no market
share? Of course not, we play it very reasonable. We see and since we are the leaders in all the markets where we play,
we'll have to guide the market to where we think it is right. So far, they've followed. If all of a sudden people start
having a decrease in their prices and we're losing things, we will look at that, of course.
I think the other part is our task to innovate in the market. So, if you have prices which you currently have and you
have good margins, and at the same time you give an additional benefit to the consumer, then I think you can easily
keep your prices up and even increase your prices if necessary. We talked about single-serve. If I have a single-serve,
which doesn't look like a private label which is very different and which gives the consumer an added benefit, I can
price up for that.
So I think that is the whole game. Currently, it is between now and six months, it is making sure that we don't make any
mistakes. After the six months when innovations come in, I think we can have a very, very nice play between
innovation and renovation of our product, relaunches of our product, and giving the consumers a benefit. Now it is like
playing the game and doing something with promotions and keeping the ship afloat in the best possible way. But it is
not – we're not completely blindfolded in terms of hey, I'm going for margin, margin, margin and I feel very happy
with half of the market share and great margins. We're playing it safely.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey>: And if I could just follow up quickly, never, never argue with the Dutch on a price
assumption. But your euro assumption for guidance is $1.44, which is certainly higher than where we're at right now.
What can you tell me that you know about the direction of the euro that perhaps the market doesn't?
<A - Jan Bennink>: That's for the Irish person.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: There's a lot a volatility there, and I think we just picked the rate that we felt was reasonable.
Obviously, that's something that's variable. If that changes after the first quarter, we'll update you, but there's no magic
to it in there.
<A - Jan Bennink>: It's when we put the whole thing together, it's bumping up and down.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey>: Yes.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: As of this morning, I think we were $0.02 off.
<A - Jan Bennink>: I think $1.42.
<Q - Timothy S. Ramey>: Okay, thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Katzman. And please state your company name.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hi, it's Deutsche Bank. Good morning.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning, Eric.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I've got a couple of questions. I guess first up, just to bridge the gap here because it seems to
me that this is the difference between what the market was expecting versus what your guidance is, you've got this $60
million of Project Accelerate savings. And then you've got the additional corporate overhead moving away. Is that
maybe in addition to the discontinued operations not being included in the guidance, the timing of the additional $0.10
plus or so of share depending upon how much the standalone companies have to absorb within corporate?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: I think that's a reasonable way of looking at it, Eric. Obviously, the discontinued operations
between store brands and assuming International Bakery will be in the first quarter are around $0.07 alone there. And
we've adjusted Accelerate because some of those were to be with International Bakery, so that's an impact as well. And
I think in terms of what you said on the stranded overhead results are reasonably accurate.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And so again not to beat this, but Jan, when you see the standalone entities, the two
companies will absorb it, do you mean that you think that that completely goes away or that there's a certain, like I
don't know, maybe 1% of sales of the $8 billion for the two companies that that $80 million is what they need to spend?
<A - Jan Bennink>: It will go away. We will absorb it by other savings, but there will not be these costs, but the
overheads will be absorbed by the entities and the costs will not be visible in the P&L.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Can I be more precise about that? We have $110 million to $120 million. A chunk of that
will go away because people and the support functions are no longer needed because a lot of people are now partially
or fully dedicated to the spin work. So that's chunk number one.
You're then left with expenses that will be going into the two segments. Those expenses will, after the spin, so if we
assume that the spin happens in early calendar 2012, those expenses will then after the spin be offset by the ongoing
savings program. And the net result is that the corporate expenses of $110 million to $120 million in 2012 will go
away.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Got you. Okay. Second is, I'm not exactly clear on – I know you set up the liability on the
repatriation. But you have $900 million-plus still coming in from the Bakery sale. You're now going to get, let's assume
after tax, I don't know, $400 million or $500 million from the Refrigerated Dough. So, the amount of cash that you
actually have to repatriate given that those two proceeds are coming in the U.S., the amount of cash that you actually
have to repatriate is minimal to pay the $1.7 billion special cash dividend. So I'm not exactly sure why we should still
assume that much leakage on a repatriation when it seems like you're going to have most of the cash here domestically
to fund it.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Let me just make a couple of observations. When we talked about the repatriation, we
assumed the $3 dividend and we had already the North American Fresh Bakery deal in, so nothing has changed that.
What has changed is the proceeds of the Store Brands business, Refrigerated Dough business, we call it Store Brands,
which is about $550 million. Then we have restructuring expenses, order of magnitude $300 million. And then of
course, we have to make sure that we end up with a structure where both companies have a reasonable amount of debt.
If we'd leave all the cash in Europe, we'd end up with a meat company which would be heavily indebted and a coffee
company which would have very little debt. That's not what we're playing for. We want both companies to be solid
investment grade. And that means that we also have to push some money over to – I mean we have to bring some
money home.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then the outlook here is that you've yet to assume any proceeds from the sale of
the bakery operation in any of these numbers?

<A - Mark A. Garvey>: No, Eric, the year-end cash debt numbers, I have assumed proceeds for the actual bakery
numbers in there.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: For the International Bakery?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: The International Bakery, absolutely for the International Bakery. So basically, what I said
was any businesses that are currently under strategic review I've assumed in those modeling to give you the end-of-year
cash debt balances that we have certain proceeds for those. Obviously, we don't want to disclose what we think those
are going to be.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: It's a fiendishly difficult calculation. And in order to save you all a couple of hours of
work, we have decided that we'd give you a year-end debt and cash position. And there are portfolio changes in there,
there is restructuring expenses and there is the operating income. There's taxes, both from repatriation and transaction
tax, and we've rolled that up in the number.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then you said of the $450 million in restructuring, that $300 million is cash?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: I would say $300 million to $350 million will be cash, Eric. It's going to depend on a number
of things we're working through.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: After tax.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: After tax.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: This is the after-tax number. So there is a...
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: That's right. It's around $300 million.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: So there are two components there, one is the tax effective gross number and also there are
some write-offs inside that gross number.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: That's right.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: That's why you get to $350 million.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Correct.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then last thing, on to Jan, the outlook for the Coffee company, it sounds like
you're pushing, obviously, the top line to get that moving. But at the same time, is it your intention now to try to get –
basically to get back to the percentage margin that the business has historically delivered or the dollar margin, I'm not
sure which you're referring to, and then grow from there?
<A - Jan Bennink>: I'm always referring to percentages. I'm the man with the percentages, as I'm known here in this
business now. So I'm talking to the percentage margin.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. All right, I'll pass it on. Thank you.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Thank you.

<A - Jan Bennink>: Good morning, Robert.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Good morning, just two questions. One is, I'm still confused about why the guidance is
significantly below consensus, maybe about $0.14 or so, $0.15. Half of it I attribute to the Refrigerated Dough sale. But
the other half, I'm trying to understand what you're telling us. Is it because of some stranded overhead, or is it an
amortization expense? Or is it also just because look the volumes are coming in lighter than you thought? It's a tougher
economic environment. Is there anything fundamentally changing in your outlook for the next 12 months versus where
your guidance was before?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: I think it is a combination. So the market has gone through the disposition of the
Refrigerated Dough business, the Bakery Business impact that has on Accelerate. At the bottom end of the guidance
range, we have taken into account volume risk. So it's a combination of those. I don't necessarily recognize that we
would be off $0.15 from where the market would, so that's higher than what I have in my head.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Consensus was $1.07, but I don't think people pulled numbers out for Dough.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: I think, Robert, obviously, that did include around $0.07 for the two businesses, International
Bakery and Refrigerated Dough.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Sure.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: I think we've talked about additional stranded costs that are coming through. When you add
those to our disposition, it's around $50 million to $60 million, so that's certainly a hit for us as well. I think we talked
about MAP investment. We are planning to have more MAP investment this year. We'll do it the right way, but that's
also in our numbers.
And Marcel mentioned volumes. I think, we've been cautious around volume. We're clearly putting some significant
price increasing through, so we're being cautious in terms of our top line and volume as well.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. And let me ask a follow-up on MAP. If you're really planning for an increase in MAP
spending, but it sounds like all the innovation is delayed until fiscal 2013 or at least you really do have a different
marketing plan for coffee that's going to take some time, why would you increase MAP this year? Wouldn't you want
to wait until all those new products are launched in 2013?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: There are a number of new initiatives. So the Energy in Motion teams have been working
on numerous brand propositions. We've looked at Senseo. And a lot of that will hit either at the very back end of 2012
or 2013. Meanwhile, there is innovation going on. We have a pipeline of innovation. We have L'OR EspressO that
we're rolling out. We have a pipeline of innovation in the North American business that we've already alluded to. As
you will remember, in the fourth quarter of 2010 we did a number of pressure tests, so we know that for a number of
products, we still have penetration gains that we can make in North America as a result of higher support levels. So yes,
the plan has been built around let's try and get to higher support levels. But obviously, we'll have to see how the year
plays out because we also have some volume risk.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Right. But I mean, as Marcel said, L'OR EspressO is something where we see a lot possibilities,
and this is a great innovation for the retail market. And we're pushing that substantially, so I think you will see in the
Coffee business some significant increases in MAP behind that innovation.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: L'OR EspressO, we have in Brazil, we have innovations coming.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Senseo, so there is a range of innovations coming through.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Thanks a lot.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane and please state your company name.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi, good morning, it's Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Hi, Bryan.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just one question, in the press release, it indicates just more of the operating profits in fiscal
2012 would come in the second half of the fiscal year versus the first half of the fiscal year. And just given how
sensitive the market is right now to expectations, if you could give a little bit more color on: A), just maybe some
proportions how much, sort of what the first half will look like; and then second, just some of the some of the pieces
that will affect the first half. I'm assuming the MAP spending will be up. It sounds like you're going to absorb some of
the higher costs associated with the work you have to do relative to the spend, just some color in terms of kind of first
half, second half, I think would be really helpful.
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yes, Bryan, I'll give you a flavor for that, we're not going to give specific by quarter,
obviously, but to give you a flavor, I think we talked about pricing a little bit earlier. We feel pretty good in terms of
where we are on North America in terms of pricing going into the year. We know we have some catch up, we're still
working through on Coffee, we've said by the second quarter we should be caught up in terms of that. So, that's
obviously going to have somewhat of a lag effect.
The stranded overhead will start coming through as soon as we get some of these deals closed, and we expect to close
North American Bakery pretty quickly, we should close Refrigerated Dough business, we would hope in short order as
well. And some of the benefits from savings will be tend to come towards the back half of the year than the front half.
So, that is going to have an impact in terms of seeing some of this positive news coming through in the latter half of the
year. And from a MAP investment, I don't think we specifically talked about when it's going to fall, but I expect more
of it as well potentially coming through with some innovations in the front half of the year, but we'll certainly see how
it works in the back half.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: So, on year-on-year basis in the first half, is it potential that your operating profits would be
down in the first half?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: That's – if you don't mind, we have given a signal that people should not take the total
operating income increase and then divide that by four and apply that to every quarter. That's what we've said and we'd
like to leave it at that. So, otherwise, I hope you don't mind, but otherwise we're going to get ourselves into issues of
selective disclosure. We have obviously thought about what we wanted to write in press release and I think we should
leave it for that.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Yes. Yes. No, I totally understand. And then just one last question in terms of the cash
outlays, I guess, just following up on the Eric Katzman's question, will – how much of the cash outlays that you're
expecting in fiscal 2012 will occur before the split? So and I know some of this is, I guess going to be linked to the
timing of when special dividend gets paid, how much closing some of these deals, the cash taxes exactly when they get
paid. I'm just trying to get a sense for should we expect that a lot of these items will get paid even the charges
associated with, I guess, executing the split, will a lot of that cash actually get paid out pre-split, so by the time we get
to the two separate companies being independent companies, a lot of that stuff is behind it or will some of that get
pulled over into this post-split time period?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yes. Brian, in terms of, again, in terms of the cash debt number we gave you at the end of
fiscal year 2012, that assumes of course, we paid the special dividend and that assumes that we paid repatriation tax, et
cetera. And we paid substantially the cash associated with restructuring charges prior to the spend and for the most part
we would expect that to hold true.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Okay. Just in terms of logistics, because I think we have seven people in line, if you can
keep your questions to the key questions and we'll try to have another 15 minutes until a quarter 'til eleven, somewhere
in there.

<A - Jan Bennink>: I'm going to be on the road next week, so --
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: And so really the key questions, so I would like to talk to as many people as possible. But
we keep it to the key issues. So, I know it's complicated thing, so we're going to try and help you out because there are
so many floating parts that's why we spent more time than we would normally do on the call and just to help you out in
making your modeling correct. So, I think, we'll move to the next question.

Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Alexia Howard. Please state your company name.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Good morning. Yes, it's Sanford Bernstein.
<A>: Hi, Alexia.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Hi. Two questions, first of all, private label encroachment in Senseo in the Netherlands, what's
the stages of that, how is that going and how is it changing your thinking about the – potentially moving Senseo to
more of a closed system rather than an open system? That's question number one. Second thing is the $180 million to
$200 million of cost savings next year, could you give us a little bit more detail around that? Particularly around the
resetting of the global contracts on the outsourcing of the back-office functions. How much is that, how much is
attributable and what plans do you have of maybe reducing the size of the corporate headquarters? Are there plans to
rationalize manufacturing space? Just a little bit more detail on how that breaks down.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Okay. We will take those two questions. I think I will take the private label one. So far and if you
look at private label shares, private label in specifically Holland have not increased. I mean, so, yes, there is a pressure
in terms of price, but we have not lost market share significantly in our single-serve. As I said before, in my kind of
what we're going to do with the new innovations or with the innovations, it is clear that we're looking for making this a
much more attractive single-serve business than it currently is. So, there will be a significant difference versus private
labels in the next 9 to 12 months. And it will be looking very different. Can we close it? I mean, who knows. I mean,
we're working to make it sure that it is a very, very interesting business going forward. We believe in it and that's a
great business. And on the cost I think --
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yes. I'll give you just a flavor of the cost and on some of these amounts, of course, we're
estimating at this point, because we still have quite of bit work to do just to get to where we need to. So, you mentioned
a number of areas. First one related to global contracts and then I'm really referring to our primary IT service contracts
that we have across the corporation, which are now one Sara Lee contract. We will need of course to break those down
into separate contracts for the new companies. That's going to take some negotiation to sort of work through that. And
the objective of course is that we end up with lower comps for both companies at the end of the day. But there may be
some costs in terms of moving out of what are now long-term contracts.
From a cost perspective, we're working through function by function on each corporate department in terms of what we
will need in the new companies. As a result of that, we are really taking an approach of being as lean as we need to be.
And we know now where we actually need to be in both companies for both corporate functions. So, I'm building in
what I know will be certain costs to restructure those, again, which will give us the ability to mitigate those corporate
costs coming through and absorb as we talked about earlier.
And on the manufacturing side as well, we're starting to make some decisions, you saw the Paris, Texas plant we just
announced. We continue, both in North America and Europe, to look across our manufacturing footprint to determine
what we need from a long-term perspective and again we're probably going to make some calls on that over the next six
to nine months as well.

<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: And the last item I think is the cost savings within the segments. The North American
business has been making a number of announcements recently as to how they're going to set themselves up. And all of
those announcements have led to fairly meaningful FDE reductions that we're pushing through. So, it's corporate center
which is partially disappearing, it is infrastructure, that's a big component. Thirdly, then is within the segments, there
are cost savings being pushed through, in particular on the North American side and then, lastly, and that's the smaller
item is cost benefits from manufacturing.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Thanks, Alexia.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Thanks, Alexia.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Growe. Please state your company name. Chris, your line may be
muted.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Melissa Napier>: Yes. We can hear you, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Thank you. Sorry for that. I just had two quick ones and my first question was just to
understand a little better around the pricing you have in place today in relation to the cost inflation in fiscal 2012, the
cost inflation, that incremental $500 million, is that primarily in Coffee? And then, again related to that, is the pricing
in place to offset that full amount of that $500 million of cost inflation or is there more that needs to come through
fiscal 2012?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Chris, it's – the majority is in Coffee. I'd say maybe about 60% or so. 60%, 65% is in Coffee.
The only place where we haven't put the pricing through is Coffee. We still have another quarter. This quarter we're
actually putting our pricing in place for Coffee, so that should be done by the time we finish this quarter. So, that's why
we said that by Q2 we should have fully priced through what we see right now as commodity inflation.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: In North America, all of the price increases that we need in order to offset the commodity
cost increases as a result of the annualization of the increases that we've seen so far have been announced. So, we have
no further plans or further announcements in North America.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. That's helpful. My last question then was just in relation to product mix and just
looking at the few of the businesses like North American retail, where that has weakened, I just wanted to get a better
sense of what you see on for product mix in some of your businesses. It looks like it was still quite strong in Coffee but
is the pricing goes up in anticipation that would weaken it as well?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: No. In Coffee, the mix figure that we've been reporting as a function of in particular L'OR
EspressO, because that's very few tons for lots of value. So, that gives us a nice little element of mix improvements. We
tend to look at volume and mix combined, because frankly it's fine if we sell lots of L'OR EspressO, very few tons for
lots of value. In North America, yes, it goes up and down a little bit by quarter. That's more current events, I don't think
there is a real trend line there. There's an overall gradual trend to move more to higher priced products. But that figure I
think will go up and down a bit. Generally, it should be positive, but it's not sort of a consistent picture, which I think
you are likely to see from the Coffee business given the fact that we have a lot growth in single-serve and L'OR
EspressO.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thanks for your time.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Thank you.

Thank you.
<A - Melissa Napier>: I'm just going to say just for a quick time check. I think management has about five more
minutes and I think we've still got some people in queue. So if there is anyone in queue that we don't get a chance to
speak to, Investor Relations will be around all day to take any follow-up questions.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Dickerson. You may please state your company name.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Consumer Edge Research. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Hi, Robert.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Just couple of very easy and short questions. One, CapEx, I didn't hear any guidance on CapEx.
Do you have it?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Yes, so CapEx for fiscal 2011 came in at $355 million and we haven't given specific
guidance. But could you expect it to be a little bit higher than that. Now we're working through some Energy and
Motion projects that may towards the end of the year be some things we want to invest in before we have the spin, but
from a modeling perspective, assume around $370 million right now.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, perfect. And then, it looks like your interest expense guidance is flat year-over-year and
as Eric said earlier, after all the cash discussion, your year-end cash balance obviously seems a bit low. I was just
curious would there be, if you did see the right opportunity, with respect to Meats and bolt-on acquisitions, would you
consider potentially tapping the debt market even before the spin were to occur or are there certain restrictions that you
can't?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Well, we have a limited amount of bandwidth. The problem with acquisitions of course is that
they never come with timing that is suitable for everyone to buy. And so, we're very focused on executing the spin at
the moment, do we completely close everything down? No, we wouldn't, but we're – more than anything, we're focused
on everything that we've announced today until getting it implemented.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. Perfect. And then just to clarify the timing of the special dividend, is that – I mean, it's
still online for I'm assuming – is there any additional color around that? Are you thinking basically early, early calendar
2012 or should we expect any kind of late calendar -?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: What we've said in the past is that it will come after the closure of the Fresh Bakery
transaction. We have noted the preference for everybody to, I think, have dividend ASAP. There is a small possibility
that by putting it a bit later, we can achieve some further structuring benefits and those structuring benefits would be
very much to the benefit of the shareholders. If that were the case, then we'll go down that path. But we have noted the
preference from everybody to get that money fast.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Gregory Chwatko. Please state your company name.
<Q - Greg J. Chwatko>: Thanks. That's Goldman Sachs. Just had a couple of quick questions of clarification around
the year-end gross debt balance and cash balance. Those numbers would be the combined each of the separated entities

at that point, the combined debt and combined cash at each of those entities?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: Yes. That's correct. Yes.
<Q - Greg J. Chwatko>: And then also, as far as the indications around the intended leverage at each of the entities, I
believe you've mentioned two times as a target area to be pointing towards. Are you looking at that as net leverage or is
that gross leverage for the entities?
<A - Mark A. Garvey>: Just for clarity, again, our goal is for both entities to have solid investment-grade ratings.
That's we're working towards and the actual coverage would be gross debt, two times.
<Q - Greg J. Chwatko>: Got you. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Baumgartner. Please state your company name.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Good morning. Telsey Advisory. Jan, Marcel, thinking about International Beverage, in
Europe specifically, you called out the weather issues this spring. But was there any volume weakness on the Continent
really attributed to the retail price increases, number one? And then, secondly, I guess segment volume down 9% in the
fourth quarter. Is there any way to parse out how much that decline would attribute specifically to exiting the French
private label business?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: The French private label business is just over a percentage point.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Okay. And then, any color on the – ?
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: That's why I was saying the jury is still out. We have not taken very significant price
increases. So far, we don't think that market, overall market volumes will decline significantly as a result.
<A - Jan Bennink>: No, we don't.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: And so, we've seen a decline in the Dutch market, which is a high consumption market.
And if you sit there and you think what is this now attributable to the fact that prices have gone up a lot or is this
attributable to the fact that it's been very warm? We've had had those discussions and, as I said, I'm always a bit – I'm a
bookkeeper so I'm a bit skeptical by nature about weather explanations. That said, we've seen in July, when the weather
was warm that we actually saw market actually came back. So, there is a credible story to be told about, yes, that did
have an impact.
<A - Jan Bennink>: How much I think is very difficult to say, just 50-50. It's a bad summer so far in the northern
European countries and we saw weather has an impact for sure.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Thank you.
<A - Marcel H. M. Smits>: I've been in the past associated with the ice cream businesses where it was often used as
an excuse. So that's why I tend to be very cautious with that, okay? Last question?
<A - Melissa Napier>: Yes. I think we have time for one last question.
Operator
At this time, I am showing no further questions.
<A - Melissa Napier>: Okay.
<A - Jan Bennink>: Isn't that perfect?
