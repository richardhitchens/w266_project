MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today's call is being
recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please
go ahead, sir.
Charles E. Triano
Good morning and thanks for joining us today to review Pfizer's fourth quarter and full-year 2015 performance as well
as 2016 financial guidance. I'm joined today as usual by: our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO;
Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development; Albert Bourla, President of Vaccines, Oncology

Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements and
that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the statements. Factors that could cause actual results
to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as on our reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
Discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Current Report on Form 8-K dated today.
Also, today's call is not intended to and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for
or buy securities of Pfizer or Allergan.
We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. With that, I'll now turn
the call over to Ian Read. Ian?
Ian C. Read
Thank you, Chuck, and good morning everyone.
We finished 2015 with strong financial and operational performance. For the full year we exceeded our 2015 revenue
guidance and met the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. And we achieved our first year of operational
revenue growth in five years. Frank will take you through the numbers. Before he does, I have a few brief comments
about what is driving our performance, some thoughts regarding where we expect to see pipeline advancements during
the year, and I'll close with a few comments about Allergan.
Throughout the year and especially in the fourth quarter, our business executed flawlessly despite a challenging
operational environment. We ended 2015 with solid momentum in both developed and emerging markets. Specifically,
in developed markets, during the year we gained incremental market penetration, driven by continued success of
products that are early in their lifecycles, including Prevnar 13 in adults, Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz. And we saw steady
growth in key inline products in 2015, specifically Lyrica in markets where it remains patent protected.
And during the year in emerging markets, we saw operational revenue growth, primarily due to the performance of
Prevnar, Lipitor, and Enbrel, as well as from the addition of legacy Hospira products.
The integration of the Hospira business into Pfizer's Global Established Pharma business is on track, and we look
forward to this business being an attractive potential growth driver. This acquisition is indeed proving to be an
excellent strategic fit, and we're seeing the expected value contribution to our GEP business that we anticipated.
Frank will speak to our 2016 guidance in a moment. We expect to deliver operational revenue growth in 2016. Our key
growth drivers will continue to be Ibrance, Eliquis, and Xeljanz. And we believe that Prevnar Adult global revenue will
be comparable to the strong results we achieved in 2015. Additionally, we believe our near-term pipeline will help
accelerate this ongoing growth forward.
In looking at the year ahead, we expect our businesses will continue to execute well. They are competitively positioned
to win in their markets and are performing strongly against their competitive set.
Regarding the pipeline, we anticipate advancing many of our Phase 3 programs during the year. For bococizumab, we
reported today that the first of our six Phase 3 efficacy studies achieved its primary endpoint, and we expect readouts of
the remaining five bococizumab [ph] lipaglyn (4:52) studies during 2016.

For ertugliflozin, this year we and our partners Merck will begin to deliver results from our comprehensive Phase 3
clinical program. In 2016, the alliance expects to submit applications for regulatory approval in the U.S. for both
monotherapy and two fixed-dose combination tablets using data from eight clinical trials.
For dacomitinib, we expect results in the second half of the year for a Phase 3 study in first-line EGFR mutant
non-small-cell lung cancer and will discuss our regulatory status with the FDA.
For Xeljanz, in the first half of this year we expect top line results for our Phase 3 program in psoriatic arthritis, where
we believe Xeljanz can potentially fill a significant unmet need in the psoriatic arthritis market where non-biologic
DMARDs do not have proven success and where there are currently few alternatives for patients who have inadequate
responses to anti-TNF therapy. In addition, in the first half of the year we anticipate a decision from the FDA for our
once-a-day daily Xeljanz formulation for rheumatoid arthritis, and we remain on track to refile our application for RA
in the EU.
For Ibrance, we expect to see the top line PALOMA-2 study results in first-line advanced breast cancer in combination
with letrozole. And we have an April PDUFA date for second and third-line treatment for advanced breast cancer based
on the PALOMA-3 data. We could also see a regulatory decision for Ibrance in the EU by year end.
Additionally, in the oncology business, we have a PDUFA date this year in the U.S. for Xalkori in ROS1
non-small-cell lung cancer. And we expect to file for approval of elotuzumab for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the
U.S.
And in immuno-oncology, we now have a broad portfolio of compounds that we believe has the potential to support the
development of a strong, deep, competitive market position. We now have five immuno-oncology assets in the clinic
and expect have up to 10 in the clinic by the end of 2016. As a result of our partnership with Merck KGaA, as of the
end of 2015, we had 28 ongoing clinical development programs for avelumab, with seven of them being pivotal
registrational studies. We anticipate some of these studies will give us potential registrations in areas like Merkel cell,
ovarian, bladder, gastric, and lung cancer. Of these seven studies, we expect to present data in Merkel cell this year and
to see data from the other tumor types in the following two years.
And we continue to believe that the winners in this space will be those that have a breadth of portfolio assets to support
rational combinations. We have a range of assets to combine with avelumab when compared to other companies' assets,
and we've already initiated six combination studies with avelumab.
In 2016, we expect to see data from: 4-1BB in combination with Keytruda and in combination with avelumab in
various tumors; 4-1BB in combination with rituximab in lymphoma; a combination of lorlatinib, our next-generation
ALK inhibitor, with avelumab in ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer; and data from Inlyta with avelumab in
renal cell carcinoma. Finally, we may see data from OX40 as a single agent this year. Taking all this into account, we
believe we are well on our way to being a leading player in this space.
And now a few comments about our proposed combination with Allergan; we're excited about bringing two great
companies together that have a strong strategic fit. The transaction is about accelerating growth potential in our
Innovative businesses and strengthening our Established business and more efficiently allocating our capital around the
world. We are confident that we are taking the appropriate steps so that we can achieve the key milestones needed to
complete the transaction, and continue to expect close in the second half of 2016.
Since the announcement, we have been working closely with Brent Saunders and his team at Allergan, and have been
delighted by the engagement and rapport that is occurring. We see a number of potential opportunities after closing as
we continue to learn more about each other's portfolio. For example, we see complementarity in inflammation and
gastroenterology, and we will have a broader presence in cardiovascular disease with Eliquis and Bystolic.
In neuroscience, Allergan's work in Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and major depressive orders will be highly
complementary to Pfizer promising early work in such areas as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Duchenne's muscular
dystrophy. When you look out over the next few years, we expect both companies will contribute several potential new
drugs to launch.

We also continue to be excited about the international potential. And by coming together, we are enhancing category
leadership throughout our complementary inline portfolio and a combined pipeline with great late-stage and mid-stage
assets across each of our key therapeutic areas. Both companies bring a great deal of scientific and product expertise to
the proposed combination and a shared philosophy in our approach to research and development.
Upon the close of the transaction, the combined company will be an influential player in the industry with a
competitive product portfolio with several leadership positions, a robust pipeline, compelling capital structure and
financial position, and aligned cultures that are based on ownership and entrepreneurial spirit, creating shareholder
value, and meeting patients' needs.
This combination is about investing in our business. It's about accelerating our existing strategy while preserving our
options of splitting the company into an Innovative business and an Established business, if we determine that is the
best way to unlock the most value for our shareholders. By the end of the current quarter, our integration teams will be
fully engaged, and we anticipate announcing post-closing leadership positions. Throughout the year, we will continue
to keep you updated on our progress.
In summary, we're looking at the year ahead. We have a sound strategy and a strong business. Our outlook and
financial guidance for the year takes into account the benefit of anticipated positive organic growth from key products
as well as the impact from foreign exchange. We have a solid portfolio of market-leading inline products, a healthy
pipeline. We expect to further strengthen the growth potential of the business with the pending addition of Allergan.
We will continue to have the means by which we can create value for our shareholders and bring innovative medicines
to patients by producing expected top line growth, progressing key pipeline assets, pursuing strategic business
development, and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.
Now I'll turn it over to Frank for additional details on the quarter and our 2016 financial guidance.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone.
As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the
acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's full-year financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015
include four months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and three months of legacy Hospira international operations.
Financial results for the fourth quarter of 2015 include three months of legacy Hospira global operations. By
comparison, financial results for full year and fourth quarter 2014 do not include any contribution from legacy Hospira
operations.
Now moving on to the financials; fourth quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $14 billion and reflect
year-over-year operational growth of $1.9 billion or 14%, mainly driven by the addition of legacy Hospira operations;
the continued strong performance of products that are early in their lifecycles such as Prevnar 13 Adult, Ibrance,
Eliquis, and Xeljanz; Lyrica primarily in the U.S.; and 5% operational growth in emerging markets, mainly from legacy
Hospira operations, Prevnar 13, and certain other products.
Reported revenues continued to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $934 million or 7%. Excluding the
inclusion of legacy Hospira operations of $1.2 billion, the negative impact of foreign exchange, and to a much lesser
extent, the inclusion of $35 million of revenues associated with vaccines acquired from Baxter, Pfizer standalone
achieved operational growth of $646 million or 5%, while at the same time absorbing a $720 million negative
operational impact from product losses of exclusivity.
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53 versus $0.54 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to
an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales; adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of
$1.8 billion or 21%; $0.07 due to foreign exchange; and the continued product losses of exclusivity in certain
geographies. These were partially offset by revenue growth of certain new, inline, and acquired products; a lower
effective tax rate; and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 125 million shares versus

the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share
repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July.
Reported diluted EPS was $0.10 compared with $0.19 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors
and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, increased purchase accounting adjustments,
acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges and asset impairment charges versus the prior-year quarter, and
non-recurring charges related to pension settlements, which were partially offset by the non-recurrence of a charge
associated with the global strategic alliance formed with Merck KGaA in November 2014 to jointly develop and
commercialize avelumab, lower charges for certain legal matters, and a lower effective tax rate.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by approximately $934 million or 7%, and
positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by
$435 million or 5%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by
approximately $0.07 compared with the year-ago quarter.
Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments, in the fourth quarter Global Innovative
Pharmaceutical revenues increased 10% operationally year over year due to the strong performance of recently
launched products, including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz in the U.S., and the strong performance of Lyrica in the U.S.
and Japan.
Income before taxes increased 17% operationally due to the increase in revenues and a 5% operational decrease in cost
of sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.7 percentage points operationally because of lower
royalty expenses and increased alliance revenues with no associated cost of sales. IBT was unfavorably impacted by a
4% operational increase in SI&A expenses as a result of additional investment in Eliquis, Xeljanz, and Chantix, and an
11% operational increase in R&D, reflecting investments in our late-stage pipeline, primarily for bococizumab and
tanezumab.
Fourth quarter VOC revenues increased 38% operationally, reflecting operational revenue growth in each business.
Global vaccine revenues grew 53% operationally, driven by a 102% increase of Prevnar 13 U.S. revenues due to strong
uptake among adults. Global oncology revenues grew 61% operationally, driven by Ibrance in the U.S. and to a lesser
extent by Sutent and Xalkori globally. And Consumer Healthcare revenues grew 4% operationally due to Nexium
24HR in the U.S.
Income before taxes increased 33% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues with an associated improvement in
gross margin, which were partially offset by a 66% operational increase in SI&A expenses as a result of higher
promotional expenses in the U.S. for newly-launched Consumer Healthcare products, Ibrance, and Prevnar 13 Adult;
and the 46% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased costs associated with our oncology programs,
primarily our alliance with Merck KGaA and Ibrance.
Fourth quarter Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues increased 5% operationally, mainly due to the previously
mentioned inclusion of legacy Hospira revenues contributing $1.2 billion, which was partially offset by the loss of
exclusivity and generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. and certain other developed markets, Lyrica in most
developed markets in Europe, and Zyvox in the U.S. Emerging market revenues were flat operationally, which
reflected the positive impact of the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and continued strong growth in China, offset
by declines in certain markets in the Middle East.
Income before taxes declined 12% operationally, reflecting: the unfavorable impact of a 4.7 percentage point
operational increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to the inclusion of Hospira operations and the
impact of losses of exclusivity; a 24% operational increase in SI&A expenses, driven in part by the addition of Hospira
operations; and the 53% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased legacy Hospira development programs.
We exceeded the top of our guidance range expectations for 2015 reported revenues by approximately $400 million.
Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 18.5% versus 18.7% at the low end of our guidance range due to
increased alliance revenues and sales volumes. And we exceeded our expectation for our effective tax rate on adjusted
income as a result of a favorable change in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We met our expectations for adjusted

R&D expenses and achieved the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS.
Adjusted SI&A expenses of $14.3 billion were higher than our guidance range due to increased expenses for recently
launched products such as Prevnar 13 Adult and Ibrance, other inline products, and certain Consumer Healthcare
brands.
We recorded adjusted other income of $409 million versus our expectation of approximately $500 million.
Finally, reported diluted EPS was $1.24 versus our expected range of $1.37 to $1.43, mainly as a result of increased
purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and restructuring charges primarily related to the acquisition
of Hospira, the negative impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, and non-recurring charges related to
pension settlements.
Now I'd like to walk you through the 2016 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS, and adjusted
diluted EPS relative to our 2015 actual results. First, it's important to note that our 2016 financial guidance excludes the
impact of our pending combination with Allergan. Our 2016 reported revenue guidance range reflects anticipated
strong growth of certain new, inline, and acquired products that is partially offset by an anticipated $2.3 billion
negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity.
I want to point out that within this range and consistent with our previous comments, we expect full-year Prevnar 13
Adult global revenues to be comparable with its full-year 2015 global revenue level. We expect adverse changes in
foreign exchange based on mid-January 2016 rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared with actual foreign exchange
rates in 2015 to have an additional $2.3 billion negative impact on reported revenues, including an estimated $800
million negative currency impact related to Venezuela. Consequently, we expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the
range of $49 billion to $51 billion.
Reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS guidance also include the negative impact from product losses of
exclusivity as well as an expected $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange rates and the $0.07 negative currency
impact related to Venezuela. As a result, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.67, and
adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30.
In addition, I want to remind everyone that guidance ranges for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS incorporate $5
billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2016, which consist of our previously announced intention to execute a $5
billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. These repurchases are expected to more than
offset the potential dilution related to employee compensation programs.
In summary, if you exclude anticipated foreign exchange impacts, including the negative currency impact related to
Venezuela, full-year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance midpoints are 7% and 10% greater than actual full-year
2015 levels respectively. The remaining elements of our 2016 financial guidance are set forth on this chart.
Now moving on to key takeaways, we had a very strong financial performance in 2015 and we achieved operational
revenue growth every quarter, including 14% operational growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, we
achieved 6% operational revenue growth that was mainly driven by new products that are early in their lifecycles, and
we achieved this growth despite a $3.2 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity. Our full year 2016
reported revenue guidance range of $49 billion to $51 billion absorbs a $4.6 billion combined negative impact of
product losses of exclusivity, adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, and the negative currency impact related to
Venezuela. And the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an anticipated $0.16 negative impact from foreign
exchange, including Venezuela.
We announced our proposed combination with Allergan and continue to expect the transaction to close the second half
of 2016. And we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. In 2015 we returned $13.1
billion to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, and we expect to execute a $5 billion accelerated share
repurchase program in the first half of 2016. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholders returns
in 2016 and beyond.
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.

Thanks, Ian and Frank. Operator, can we please poll for questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Good morning and congrats on the solid finish to the year, so a couple of product-specific
questions, if I may. On the Prevnar franchise, you've posted strong 4Q numbers. Could you just talk about your
expectations for the trajectory going forward? On Ibrance, there has been a lot of discussion about abemaciclib or
Lilly's abemaciclib and the potential there for a threat to Ibrance. What's your view here? And then just lastly on
biosimilars, can you update us on the status of your biosimilar candidates and when we should expect any data
readouts? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Colin. I'll ask Albert to manage Prevnar and Ibrance and then I'll pass it over to John
for the biosimilars.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Thank you very much for the question, Colin. Let me provide some insight to help you
understand the situation moving forward. In the U.S., obviously we have done an excellent job with the capital
opportunity. We have achieved 86% market share, 92% at retailers. We have 90% awareness of the recommendation at
healthcare practitioners. And as a result, of the 45 million adults eligible at the time of the recommendation for
vaccination, we have already captured about a third of them.
Now, while many adults remain, this cohort is more difficult to capture, as the low hanging fruit is gone. It will require
more innovative strategies, but we all have in place. But even if we assume a similar or higher penetration rate this
year, it will be on a much smaller pool of adults. However, we expect this would be mitigated by Europe, which has a
very different growth profile. Even with prices lower than the U.S., the demographics are very favorable with a much
larger eligible population. And we have already received pneumonia on our label in 2015, and we are working to obtain
broad recommendations, and following that, reinvestment from the authorities. Now this will be phased likely over a
two-years window period, because in Europe this is done country by country and sometimes region by region within
the same country. But all in all, we expect very strong growth in Europe next year.
Now let me move on Ibrance and your question about competition, or particularly Lilly's drug. Look, Lilly's drug,
while in the same class, is for an [ph] initial (27:01) indication. The refractory patient population for which they have
received regular designation is a very small population with few options available. In fact, the average refractory
patient undergoes seven lines of treatment, so they are in high need.
Now speaking generally on competition, there is only limited clinical data in the public domain, and we need to see
more efficacy and safety data to make comparisons. What I can tell you is about our strategic position. We are the only
company with a registered product in the U.S. and six other countries and an accepted file in Europe where we may
obtain registration as early as next year. We have very good clinical experience with the product. Ibrance has been
prescribed by 5,000 physicians in more than 20,000 patients. And so far feedback is very positive, particularly on
patients' quality of life.
We are having a very heavy clinical program. We have two pivotal studies in first-line metastatic breast cancer, two
studies in recurrent metastatic breast cancer, and three in early breast cancer: PENELOPE-B, PALLAS, and PALLET.
Ibrance is part of 88 investigational initiated trials, approximately 50 in breast cancer and 38 in other tumor types. So as
you can see, we are investing heavily to stay ahead of the competition.

<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Albert. I think just on Ibrance, you mentioned next year for Europe. You meant this

<A - Albert Bourla>: Sorry.
<A - Ian C. Read>: That's all right.
<A - Albert Bourla>: I apologize.
<A - Ian C. Read>: John, go ahead.
<A - John Young>: Okay. So thanks for the question on biosimilars, Colin. So we're obviously very excited of being
able to bring together the combination of Hospira's current inline biosimilars which are already in the market. We have
three assets, as you know, which are already in the market in Europe, Nivestim, Retacrit, and Inflectra, and to bring that
together along with the legacy Pfizer monoclonal antibody pipeline plus some additional assets that Hospira have. So in
total when you look at the pipeline, we have nine distinct biosimilar molecules in different stages of development:
infliximab outside of the EU, adalimumab, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, rituximab, pegfilgrastim, ranibizumab,
denosumab, and ustekinumab.
So overall we have a very strong pipeline. A number of those assets are in Phase 3 late-phase development, and the first
data set that you'd be seeing from our Phase 3 studies would come from the legacy Pfizer infliximab program, where
we would expect to produce data from our Phase 3 towards the end of this year.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thank you, John. Thanks, John. Operator, can we please move to the next question?

Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Frank, your gross margin for 2016 is better
than we expected considering you're integrating a lower-margin business in Hospira and losing exclusivity on some
high-margin products. Can you help us understand what's driving that and how we should think about – and should we
expect additional margin expansion going forward given that your Innovative business is growing at a faster rate?
And then on Hospira's contribution this quarter, it doesn't seem to reflect much revenue synergies. Obviously, it's too
early. But how should we think about Hospira's contribution next year and possible revenue synergies going forward?
Thank you.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Alex, on the gross margin, let me run the numbers and then I'll answer the question. So
we ended the full year at 18.5% in terms of cost of sales, so I'll do the cost of sales. The reciprocal, obviously, is gross
margin. We guided for next year cost of sales number of 21% to 22%. So if you take the midpoint of that 21% to 22%,
just to make the math easy, that's 21.5% from our 18.5%. That's a 3%, 300 basis point increase in our cost of sales as a
percentage of revenues. By the way, that's being driven by a few factors, one of which clearly is Hospira.

In terms of I think your question, which is why it wasn't even more, I think the answer is our ongoing productivity and
cost reduction initiatives. When you think about our factories, our manufacturing capabilities, we really manage that
from a cost perspective. First of all, we focus then on quality, service, and cost. If you think about that as a triangle,
quality is at the top of the triangle, but there are four major buckets. There's the number of facilities. There are the
numerous quality initiatives we have within each facility. There's the purchasing that we can get from a leverage
perspective. And then finally, there's the center cost that resides outside of the factories. We manage all four of those
very aggressively basically to manage our cost structure in manufacturing. But that gives you a feel for what the
numbers were and why they are what they are.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Please, John.
<A - John Young>: So thanks, Alex. So obviously, again, we are very excited by the opportunities afforded us by the
combination of our two businesses. And I think I've talked about biosimilars already and the opportunities we see in
that marketplace, so let me just touch briefly on sterile injectables. Obviously, it's a very – it's a large, it's a growing
market. It's somewhere between $50 billion to $70 billion currently globally. And one of the features of that market is
it's very concentrated, particularly in the U.S., but also in a few ex-U.S. markets such as Western Europe and
particularly China.
So one of the things that we're very focused on is going to be revenue synergy. We obviously have a strong commercial
presence in China and also in the hospital segment in developed Europe and emerging Europe. So essentially the lag
time since September when we closed this transaction, we've been focused really on making sure that we have our
blocking and tackling in place, to be very systematic with our highest value molecules that really meet market needs
most appropriately, to be very focused on registering and bringing those molecules to market.
And the biggest opportunity that we have in China that is going to take time, as you are very well aware, drug lag in
China is a significant issue. But we're very encouraged by the progress that the CFDA are making to accelerate access
to important new medicines in China, but that will take time. But we do see opportunities both in the short term as well
as medium/long term to deliver significant growth ex-U.S. to the sterile injectable business and the combination of
Hospira's portfolio into our commercial footprint.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, John. And, operator, let's see if we can get Jami Rubin back.

The next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you, sorry about that, gentlemen. I don't know what happened on my end. But anyway, just
a few questions. Frank, can you tell us what your Venezuela revenues are? I guess we and consensus were surprised by
the size of the hit. Can you all hear me?
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Yes, we can hear you, a little static-y but we can hear you.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay, sorry about that. Anyway, so, Frank, if you could, just provide more color on Venezuela.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: And why such a big hit; and then, Ian, just a couple questions for you. Just back on this whole
breakup thesis and the timing, I think investors initially were disappointed by the timing that you laid out at the time
that you announced the Allergan deal. I think you said you would make a decision by the end of 2018. I just want to put
out there that the stock has pulled back quite a bit since you announced the Allergan deal. And I would think despite –
clearly the market is excited about this. But I would think that that would – the difference in value, the even growing
gap in valuation between where your stock is and an SOTP [Sum of the Parts] should help you to accelerate your
decision to move in that direction. And if you could just comment on that, please.

And then just thirdly on revenue growth, clearly there have been tons of pushes and pulls in your numbers, mostly
currency and patent expirations. Can you remind us when you expect, and this excludes the acquisition from Allergan,
but when you expect your reported revenue growth – or just talk about operationally revenue growth, when we should
start to see a positive inflection point? Because when I look at my models, revenues have been in decline for many
years. And some of that is divestitures and spins, but really since 2013 we've had revenues flat to down. When is that
going to change and what's going to drive that change, just talking from Pfizer's standpoint? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Let me just do the revenue growth first. As I said, 2015 was the first year when we saw revenue
growth. 2016 we expect it to be – operationally now, Hospira, we expect it to be – Hospira and Allergan we expect it to
be flat, and that's because we had a huge growth from adult vaccine in 2015, and we'll hold that franchise but we won't
grow it again. We'll have good growth from our inline products and our newly launched products, but we still deal with
a couple billion of LOEs.
So I think you can begin to see as we launch – as we begin to get more traction with more clinical trials on Ibrance, as
we begin to see the ertugliflozin launch, as we begin to see our next wave of products get approved, you'll see us
returning to very robust growth. But obviously, Jami, one of the reasons in doing the Allergan deal was in fact to ensure
that we had robust growth in our Innovative business, so we're aware of that issue.
Now vis-à-vis the breakup timing, number one, I'd point out that while the stock is down, I don't think it's specifically
down more than the DRG. In fact, I think it's roughly the same as the DRG. And in fact, given the arb pressure that one
would expect in the stock, I'm actually – while I never like to see the stock go down, it certainly was expected to come
under pressure from the arb community.
Now the breakup timing is an issue of we are focused on integrating this company and the two companies together, and
we have laid out the four questions that we need to answer, and I think any shareholder would want those questions
answered. So can we run the businesses successfully inside Pfizer, either as a turnaround – we bought Hospira, you've
seen the sterile injectables, you've got the biosimilars. You're beginning to see if you strip out the LOEs, a stabilization
of the core business which we expect to return to growth. But that being said, we can run it well inside Pfizer.
Can it be run better outside Pfizer? Is there trapped value and can we unlock the trapped value in a tax-efficient
manner? These are very serious questions. These are very large companies. And I think that by the end of 2018, we will
be well-positioned to make that decision in the best interest of our shareholders, and frankly don't particularly see a
way of short-circuiting that just because of the amount of work that has to be done in integration and getting the
transaction with Allergan right. I do understand your wish for a more speedy decision, but I think we're taking the right
approach for shareholder value here.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Venezuela?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yes.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Jami, Venezuela revenues that were, I'll call it, initially projected for 2016 were about
$800 million, roughly the same size as 2015. And if you look at the adjustment we took, we changed the exchange rate
from VEF 6.3 to the dollar to VEF 200 bolivars to the dollar. We went to the SIMADI rate for Venezuela. That change
in the translation is what causes the adjustment that we made for 2016. And we thought that the timing of that
adjustment was appropriate given oil prices, given what's going on in Venezuela economically, given the dollars that
are coming out of Venezuela. We thought the timing for this was appropriate. But it's really the VEF 6.3 to VEF 200 to
the dollar conversion that's really causing the adjustment to 2016.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Jami, ongoing, when Venezuela passes through this crisis and they reestablish a normal economy,
we would expect Venezuela to grow back to be in the $200 million to $300 million to $400 million – between $200
million and $400 million a year. So the actual delta medium term is the $400 million between what was an overvalued
currency. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Hi, three questions, please; two of them very short. Firstly, perhaps you could just outline the
sequential growth for China [indiscernible] (40:32). Second, do you anticipate a third notice from the Treasury on
inversion? And obviously, [ph] we are numbered as Stephen noticed (40:40). But how restrictive do you see any notice,
if it does impact your potential to complete the Allergan transaction?
And then finally, just returning to abemaciclib, the patients in the ongoing Phase 2 trial, which they intend for an
accelerated approval, have not seen palbociclib in an early line of therapy. Is that an approvable setting given the
design of that trial, given the fact you are approved for that indication, or does that in your view preclude any
regulatory approval for the drug? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, I'm going to do the notice first. We at the moment understand that the Treasury are working
on formalizing and regulating the first two notices they issued, which are not in many ways applicable to our
transaction as we're at the below 60% ownership. I really can't speculate if there's going to be a third notice or not. We
feel confident the transaction is fully within the U.S. law and fully within accepted interpretation of that law and expect
the transaction to close in the second half of next year. With that, I'll go to growth for Frank, and then I would ask
Mikael to talk about palbociclib.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: And it was China. On China for the quarter, China grew 10%. Full year, China grew about
10%; nice numbers, somewhat moderated from 2014. In 2014, China grew at about 15%, so we saw some moderation
in the growth in China. That said, Andrew, we remain very bullish on China. It has an increasing population, increasing
personal wealth. The government is committed to healthcare. We see increased spending in the government, and the
GDP rate is still very healthy, not as high as it's been in the past but still quite healthy. So we remain very bullish on the
China market on a going-forward basis.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Mikael?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, thank you, Andrew, for a good question here. Two things; first, I want just to point out
that abemaciclib [abema] is somewhat different from palbo and the Novartis CDK drug in that it seems to be less
selective and has a different adverse event profile, likely due to hitting multiple CDKs, particularly being reported
significant GI issues, so it's a different profile. And we, as Albert very well pointed out, have been extremely pleased
with the stable profile that allow patients to benefit from Ibrance with very good tolerability.
Now you asked about these late-stage population studies by Abema and how that population in the future will evolve.
We anticipate as Ibrance is having a very nice uptake in the marketplace in first-line metastatic and some also more
advanced lines, and hopefully with the PALOMA-3 approval, Ibrance is likely to be used in multiple lines. Hence,
monotherapy with another CDK will of course have the potential to face a patient population that have seen a CDK
inhibitor. And that's why we are developing a strategy for how we can see patients benefit from a drug like Ibrance at
various stages with different anti-hormonal, and we're also now studying Ibrance in triple therapy. So I think you can
see that multiple drugs is likely to be the preferred as patients become more advanced.

<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Hi, good morning. Just again on the biosimilar front, I know there have been a couple
questions, but just a couple more if I could. One is specifically on Enbrel, and if you can, discuss in terms of 2016 how
you're viewing the impact of biosimilars to your performance for that product.
And then second, now that Hospira has closed, I'm just wondering. I guess this is a question for John or whoever wants
to jump in. In terms of the value of having a biosimilar business under the same broad umbrella as your Innovative
business so you can leverage that commercial infrastructure, whether it's oncology and autoimmune disorders, does it
in any way maybe make more sense then to keep Pfizer a single entity as opposed to splitting up and then needing to
rebuild the commercial infrastructure for your biosimilars in those similar areas where you do have Innovative
products? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Let me – I'll ask Geno to talk about Enbrel and any impact to biosimilars in Europe.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Sure. So the first biosimilar for etanercept has been approved in Europe. And we've been
watching the situation very closely and evaluating adoption of biosimilars across each of the countries throughout
Europe for a while now. Our overall expectation is that there will be a somewhat modest impact in 2016.
The biosimilar landscape is clearly still developing. There are different approaches taken by different countries, and we
have a very clear, detailed roadmap for how to address each of the dynamics that exist in these different countries. So
we're fairly confident that we're going to continue to have a strong Enbrel business throughout Europe. We think that
new patients would be probably most at risk of being exposed to the biosimilars, and hope that the availability of
lower-cost biologics will expand the market. So overall, we see this as, again, a modest impact to our business in this
initial period of time.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And then, Vamil, a very interesting question on the connectivity between the biosimilars and the
other space. I would say that that would be taken into account if there was any such linkage that was positive in our
TSAs the way we set up the separate companies to ensure that overall we maximize the value of that between both
companies in the contracts we would sign if we decided to split. Thank you.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Ian; next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: A couple questions. First, apologies if I missed the explanation, but the 2016 guidance
includes roughly an incremental $4 billion in revenue and $0.08 in earnings from Hospira, implying down to
significantly down underlying sales for the legacy Pfizer and flattish to down EPS. And it seems that generic exposure
and currency cannot be the explanations because the predicted $4.6 billion hurdle in 2016 from these factors is well less
than the $6 billion-plus predicted in 2015 at this time last year. So actually, the comparison on generic exposure and
currency is improving and more than offsets the year-over-year increase in Pevsner. So any thoughts on that would be
appreciated.
And one more, how should we think about the long-term outlook for Sutent, particularly given the competition from
immuno-oncology agents? Do you think Sutent will soon become a declining asset, or do you see growth in the future?
Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: I'll ask Albert to talk about Sutent and its possible combinations and the other studies we have
really out on Sutent. and then I'll ask Frank to come back on your questions about growth rates.
<A - Albert Bourla>: We remain very confident in our position in the RCC, especially that includes both Sutent and
Inlyta because they are very well known by physicians and other stakeholders. There is an approval in RCC for
immunotherapy, but this does not affect Sutent. It is in the second-line. Sutent is used primarily in first-line. And we
have also, as we have previously disclosed, we are starting Inlyta plus avelumab and Inlyta plus other PD-1 inhibitors

very aggressively so that we can see even better results in monotherapy in RCC second-line.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Frank?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Steve, let's see if I can answer the question. So just first, we don't give a specific number
for Hospira revenues for 2016. But that said, I believe I can still answer the question. So the way I think about this is if
you went to the midpoint of the guidance prior to foreign exchange and Venezuela, which was part of the basis of your
question, the midpoint of the guidance would be $52.3 billion, just to use the midpoint. If you take $50.3 billion,
compare that to the $48.9 billion that we printed in 2015, all now at the same foreign exchange, so purely operational,
that's an increase of about $3.5 billion. We said – Ian said when he answered Jami's question that revenue excluding
Hospira on a year-over-year basis was essentially flat operationally while absorbing $2.3 billion in LOEs for 2016.
The other data point I think to help answer the question is, remember we did $1.5 billion in Hospira sales this year. So
when we say that the bulk of the growth is from Hospira, you understand it's incremental growth on top of the $1.5
billion that we printed in 2015. So that's how I think – that's how you get to the numbers we said and why we said
operationally the numbers were essentially flat if you left Hospira out of the equation.

Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. How are you doing? Thanks for being so clear on the communications on
the quarter. I have one question that's been danced around that maybe let me just ask it again and hopefully I won't
annoy you, but I'll try again. So first is do you believe that there's anything, Ian, under the current U.S. statute that
would allow Treasury to block and/or materially delay the closing of the AGN deal? So I'm not asking if there will be a
third proposed notice. I'm asking you if under the current law, do you remain I guess very comfortable that there's
nothing that Treasury legally could do to block the deal or to materially delay it like into 2017 when there will be a new
Congress and a new President.
And then I'd also just for Frank perhaps, just like you talked a little bit about your leverage ratio, if my math is right,
the leverage ratio of the combined company, the NewCo should it close, would be around one times. By my math, you
could take that to maybe three times without affecting credit ratings in a big way. I'd like to hear – but that's my math
and I'm not very good at math. So I'd love to hear your general thoughts around leverage ratio of the NewCo and where
you might be willing to take that should the deal close. Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mark, and thank you for the compliment on the priority of the communications. We
strive to make them clear. So on your question, which I don't think we danced around, under current law, I do not
believe there is any reason why this deal will not close, full stop.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Mark, let me run some numbers. So on leverage, just let me run the Pfizer numbers based
on third quarter. We haven't issued a balance sheet yet for the fourth quarter. We'll do that when we file the 10-K. We
had about $37 billion of cash and investments. We had about $39 billion of debt, short and long-term debt. So to your
point, call that one-to-one essentially.
What we said when we announced the Allergan deal, what I said was we could take the leverage ratio, to your point, up
to about 2.5 to three times. Then obviously, once we took it there, we'd want to see what kind of rhythm that created
relative to the company, the operations supporting the company. It's that we'd take it there but that we'd still want
access to commercial paper. We'd be willing to take a one notch downgrade, but we would still want to have access to
commercial paper. But in terms of your math and your calculation, that 2.5 to three times, that's right. That's basically
what I talked about when we announced the Allergan deal. So your math was good

Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes, a few things. One is can you tell us what the key products are in Venezuela, if there are
any massive ones that we need to be hitting the model on? Second, Frank, maybe you could go through some of the
push/pulls on SG&A and how you're thinking about the spending this year. And then third, can you just give us an
update on the IL-6? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So key products, I don't think there are any outstanding products. Probably Enbrel is the biggest
product that contributes. John, would you want to add anything to that?
<A - John Young>: Yes, I think Enbrel is the biggest product. I think in addition to that, we have a portfolio of mature
Established products. So Lipitor and Norvasc would be other key products for us in Venezuela. So really just think
about the basket of Established products that fit in that marketplace.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: The SG&A?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yes.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Mark, on SG&A, let me just talk to the quarter, and then I'll talk to the rhythm of the
numbers. So if you look at the quarter, we had big spending in SG&A. It was $4.6 billion all in. Three major factors
there, one obviously the inclusion of Hospira, which added a couple hundred million. Two was sequentially, if you
think about the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we had a lot more selling days in the quarter. So
internationally we had six more selling days. Domestically we had two more selling days. So sequentially, Q3 of 2015
to Q4 of 2015, we had more selling days. So obviously that helps revenue. It also increases the spend on our line items.
And then we had, obviously, as I alluded to in my comments, increased promotional spend in many areas of the
business.
Now, if you take that $4.6 billion and you annualize it, times two is what, $9.2 billion, times two is $18.4 billion. If you
look at the guidance we gave for next year on SI&A, it's $13.2 billion to $14.2 billion. So you can't take that Q4
number and annualize it. You get to a number that's nothing close to what our guidance is for 2016. It was just a
combination of the Hospira numbers, the selling days, and then the increased spend in the quarter. But when you look
at it for next year, we've got a number that on an annual basis is significantly lower than what that annualized number
would be.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And, Mikael, do you want to discuss IL-6?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, thank you for your question. So we tested our IL-6 antibody in lupus and Crohn's. And
while the antibody did show some activity, we found that the overall profile did not compete as well as many other real
interesting immunology agents and other opportunities we have in our very rich pipeline of 90 clinical programs. So
this is part of prudent portfolio prioritization within Pfizer.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thank you, Mikael. Operator, if you can, move to the next question, please.

Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions and for all the clarity that you've given on the 2016 guidance.
Ian, first question on the timing around the breakup, I think you've indicated that integration of Allergan is very

important. You've also indicated that you've had time to look even deeper into the Allergan portfolio. As you think
about integration, can you give us some more commentary around how you're thinking about mapping out integration?
Some look at Wyeth and look at the massive amount of synergies that you were able to extract that of the Wyeth
transaction and are somewhat puzzled as to why you can't do that here, so any commentary around that.
Two additional questions, one on CDK-4/6. This one is for Mikael. Mikael, when you look at pre-clinical models, is
there any argument or hypothesis around a drug that has to be given intermittently that it might have less efficacy than
one that's given on a continuous dosing? And is that supported by any pre-clinical models?
And then the last question just has to do with Xeljanz, obviously a very important asset for you. not only in the U.S. but
on the EU timing for filing, I think you indicated you wanted to have that filed before the end of the year. Just any
update on what Europe is looking for within that filing to secure approval in Europe. And then on psoriasis in the U.S.,
any developments there and on the modified release from a regulatory standpoint. And then, obviously, with Enbrel
seeing generic competition, what have you done with your infrastructure in Europe to still keep some infrastructure in
place to support Xeljanz if and when it gets approved?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, so let me just quickly the last one first. We still have very strong expectations for Enbrel in
Europe, as Geno was discussing. We're not removing our support from Enbrel so we expect to have full support for
Xeljanz when it launches in Europe. There was somewhat of a slippage from, as you say, the end of the year to the
beginning of this year on the Xeljanz application in Europe. We wanted to get it right and make sure that it was the best
shape we could, and these things happen. So there was a slight slippage on time on that. Mikael, do you want to deal
with his hypothetical on CDK-4/6?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, thank you for the questions. Of course, always we'd caution, you can't speculate on things
that haven't been studied in humans in comparative aspects. But we think it's important to hit CDK-4/6 hard for breast
cancer. And when you do that with high doses, you will get efficacy on the tumor, but also see some neutropenia, and
that's why we chose the intermittent schedules. Particularly, it seems very effective for combination therapy with
multiple agents such as anti-hormonals in breast cancer. For other tumor types, we may explore various schedules for a
various combination of drugs. But for breast cancer, we think this shows some schedule with the combinations we have
studied is very effective and works well.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Geno, do you want to deal with the other questions that John asked on Xeljanz?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yes, John, I think the question in the EU, as Ian already alluded to, we're now expecting our
filing to be in the first quarter of this year. We're actually meeting with rapporteurs at this point. We did generate
additional data on immune function as a result of the discussions that we had with the regulators in the first submission.
So we feel that we have a strong package, that we have responded to the information requests that they had, and we're
just tidying up the last few details and expect to put that filing in imminently.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And psoriasis, there's a question on psoriasis.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: On the U.S., so psoriasis, as you probably know, we received a Complete Response Letter
from the FDA on psoriasis. We have provided a backgrounder to the FDA, and we expect to meet with them also this
quarter to follow up on the components of the Complete Response Letter. And once we know in more detail with their
issues and concerns are, then we'll determine the best way forward from there.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Frank, do you want to deal with the...
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Synergy number?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yes.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: We said when we announced the deal more than $2 billion. We gave you the timing in
terms of when we would get that. A couple of comments, John, to your question. I think first, why more than $2
billion? Why not a higher number? I think these are two companies that have done a lot of the cost reduction front,
significant reductions at both companies, I think efficiently run companies. Two, not a lot of therapeutic area overlap,

which is always a trigger for synergy opportunities. Third, if you look at the Allergan cost of goods sold, two-thirds of
that, from my perspective, from a synergy perspective, was unaddressable. It's their Anda business and then royalties,
so really not a lot we could do there.
But all that's said and done, and we're working now with the Allergan teams, with Brent, with Bob Stewart, with Tessa
[Hilado]. Ian, myself, our leadership team here at Pfizer, we've already launched a couple of operational teams. We're
starting to dig into this in much more detail. If there's more there, please know we're going to get it and we'll tell you
about it. So I think on the synergy front, just more to come.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And, John, the [ph] process of (1:02:27) this deal was not huge cost synergies. It was about driving
revenue, growth in the Innovative business, driving reasonably young portfolios, taking the products internationally,
and then getting excellent capital allocation over the world. So we will get the synergies we can get, but our focus is on
growth, and a lot of the questions on the call have been about growth, so this is part of the solution to that, and also on
really good capital allocation. Thank you for the questions.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Ian; next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bernstein.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Thank you. If I could go back to the revenue guidance, the midpoint is about $2.5
billion below consensus. You flagged FX as a major headwind. I know that we spend a lot of time trying to incorporate
FX and I imagine consensus does too, yet that's still a very big delta. So my question on this is when you look at
analyst models, are there particular revenue line items for products, for divisions where you think consensus is too high
unrelated to foreign exchange?
Second question, you mentioned the 4-1BB with Merck and showing combination data with Keytruda. That's Phase 1
data, so as such it's unblinded. I'm wondering if you can give us a preview of the tumor types you think are most
promising and also any preliminary safety findings.
And then last pipeline question, last year you mentioned having an oral PCSK9 approaching human development, and
I'm wondering if that is now in the clinic. When I look at your pipeline chart, I see a new compound has been advanced
into Phase 1.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Frank, if you could deal with the first question.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And Mikael with the remaining two.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Tim, let me run the numbers and then I'll answer the question. So your numbers are
right. So consensus numbers, give or take on revenue for 2016, about $52.4 billion; the midpoint of our guidance $50
billion. The math there is roughly the $2.5 billion that you alluded to, just to nail the numbers.
I think two major pieces in terms of the gap. One is, clearly the Venezuela adjustment we made in 2016 wouldn't have
been in the $52.4 billion, so that's an $800 million adjustment. That would take a $52.4 billion to $51.6 billion. And
then I think when you look at the line items, I think the big difference, if you would ask me to point out one single
place, it's Prevnar 13. [ph] significant (1:04:58), and the growth expectations in Prevnar 13 in 2016 versus our
modeling for 2016, where I said in my comments and Albert punctuated in some of his detailed remarks about we're
expecting that to be essentially comparable to 2015 levels. Those are the two things that I would point out that make up
the majority, a big piece of the difference in terms of your $2.5 billion.

<A - Mikael Dolsten>: So thank you for asking about 4-1BB. And as you know, we believe that combination therapy
will move the immuno-oncology field to the next level. We are very pleased with the 4-1BB monoclonal antibody that
we have. We have started it in combination with rituximab in lymphoma and with PD-1 Keytruda in a small study
across various tumor types and now also initiated a combination study with avelumab.
The 4-1BB antibody, the Pfizer antibody, shows very good tolerability when combined with other biological agents,
and its clinical performance suggests also very interesting favorable clinical activity on top of other biologicals such as
rituximab and PD-1 Keytruda. We will share the data from this first cohort this year, likely at ASCO.
We are quite excited about 4-1BB and also OX40 that's in our pipeline, and you will see 4-1BB avelumab data likely
late this year as well as OX40 mono data and early next year several doublets and triplets, which makes me very
enthusiastic as I look forward how we advance this strategy of combination therapy. We have an oral PCSK9 in Phase
1. It's too early to have any definitive interpretation of that data, and we also have a PCSK9 vaccine in late pre-clinical
development.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Mikael; next question, please.

Your next question comes from Richard Purkiss from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Richard J. Purkiss>: Thanks. I had a couple of questions for Mikael. Just on Ibrance, can you flag any upcoming
data for tumor types outside of breast cancer that we should look out for? Also, can you update on how well the
adjuvant breast cancer studies are enrolling? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Mikael, would you like to...
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, I could say a few words. So as Albert alluded to, there is a large number of Ibrance
studies, the great majority by investing in initiated research, so we will have to see as these studies reach out – report
emerging. I can say that we also have sponsor-led studies outside breast. That includes pancreatic cancer and head and
neck, and we're also looking at triple therapy in breast cancer. I remain optimistic and excited about Ibrance
performance and think we will see interesting data sets coming from several of these new tumor types.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Enrollment is going well?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes, actually I can only add here that likely the mantle cell lymphoma and the head and neck we
may see data even this year. And then many of the areas that Mikael discussed, including also lung, we may see next
year.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Okay, thanks, Albert and Mikael; next question, please.

Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
<Q - Geoff Meacham>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Good morning.
<Q - Geoff Meacham>: Thanks for taking the question; just a couple of quick ones. On bococizumab, given Pfizer's
experience in cardiovascular, I was just curious what your thoughts with what demand trends were, looking
peripherally at the PCSK9 class today. I know a lot looking forward depends on outcomes data, but just curious about
whether there's a tipping point and physician adoption.

And then just on biosimilars in the U.S., I just wanted to get your guys' view on where you think the FDA is with
respect to extrapolation when we're looking at the upcoming Remsima panel next week. Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Geno, any comments on that?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yes, I think I would just reinforce the comment that you made. It's been our contention all
along that this class becomes a real class in managing these patients with the cardiovascular outcome data. We'll be
seeing either late this year or starting next year; our program is advancing nicely. We have, as you know, two
cardiovascular outcome trials. And the ASPIRE II trial, which is in the high-risk patient population, we've now reached
the point where we've discontinued screening. We're almost completely enrolled, and that trial is moving along very
rapidly. And the ASPIRE I trial will be completely enrolled by the end of this year or early next year. So we're looking
forward to these data and the impact that we think they're going to have on the marketplace.
<A - John Young>: So on the Inflectra AdComm, as you know, it's scheduled for February 9, next week. I think it
would probably be premature to speculate on the view that the FDA will take. We certainly think that this will be
extremely informative as to the FDA's views and perspectives on extrapolation. I think obviously the product is being
filed by Celltrion, so specific questions about the AdComm really should be directed to Celltrion. But what I would say
is that while we obviously await the resolution of the Advisory Committee and certain other factors, we're certainly
moving ahead with the preparation for our launch plans in 2016.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Geno and John; next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes, thanks very much. I have three questions. First, Ian, besides the likelihood of closing,
what do you think investors most under-appreciate about the Allergan merger?
Second, I guess these are two financial questions. One is with respect to Enbrel ex-U.S., could you just give us a sense
for the percentage of revenue that is in countries where biosimilars are launching in 2016, so that we have a sense for
the percentage of Enbrel revenue that's exposed to biosimilar threats? And then finally, Frank, if you could, just run
through the cash flow outlook for 2016, the operating cash flow, and then the planned use of funds. Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: The question on Allergan, our interactions with the shareholders, both sell side and buy side, have
been very positive. I don't think in reality there's anything underappreciated other than the Street's perception of risk
around the close. I would direct you back, of course, to the excitement I have about the products that Allergan has that
they just launched, about their Phase 3 products both in depression and in diabetic gastroparesis, and they just got
Breakthrough status. So the combination of our information, knowledge, and our TAs with Xeljanz around their area,
our JAKs around their expertise in that area, I think perhaps the Street is right now hung up on this close issue. So bio...
<A - Geno J. Germano>: David, on the question regarding percentage of Enbrel business potentially exposed to
biosimilar competition, I don't have a figure off the top my head. I would say more than 50% of the ex-U.S. business
would be in the European Union, where we expect to see biosimilars. We're not expecting to see it in Japan, Australia,
and several of the Latin American countries. But I would say it's more than 50% of the business.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: And then the last question was on 2016 operating cash flow. The way I'll answer this,
Dave, is if you look at our operating cash flow through our three quarters, it was about $10 billion. We expect the
fourth quarter to be healthy in terms of the operating cash flow for the year. And then obviously 2016, we expect – we
want to obviously continue to grow that operating cash flow number.
And then in terms of the uses, from my perspective the uses of how we deploy our capital haven't changed, obviously
investing in our business, returning capital to shareholders. As I mentioned in my remarks, we returned $13.1 billion to
our shareholders in 2015 through a combination of dividends and share buybacks, and obviously looking at some
bolt-on acquisitions if those make sense. So no change would be how I'd answer the question on capital allocation.

<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Frank; next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks, also a three-parter. First, Frank, what level of detail should we expect in the proxy in
terms of your long-term projections, similar to the Pfizer-Wyeth documents, or any differences and any caveats you'd
like to order or to let us know about before folks start slapping accretion percentages on those numbers?
Secondly, going back to something you said earlier, taking your leverage to 2.5 to three times for NewCo, and if you
were to apply that capital to buybacks, that would create EPS accretion that's far beyond what you've suggested. So I
just would like your thoughts on what you'd be doing with that leverage, or is that just a hypothetical?
And third for John, do you still see the benefit of the Hospira Device business alongside the Drug business as you
originally thought? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. John, could you deal with Hospira first, please?
<A - John Young>: Yes, sure. I think we would say that in the Hospira Infusion Systems business, which comprises
pumps, consumables, large-volume solutions, we believe we acquired a very valuable asset that provides novel
capabilities in an adjacent area, and it adds significant value to customers and to patients. We are committed to
ensuring its success in the short, medium, and longer term.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, Frank, on the leverage and then the long level of detail.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: On the proxy, so I think on level of detail, we'll be providing revenue details, EPS details.
We projected out I believe it's several years, five years. So there will be information out there relative to projections on
the company.
On the leverage number, the 2.5 to three times, in my mind that's what's possible. In terms of what we did on buybacks,
we tried to provide information when we announced the deal to give you all the data you needed so that when you
connected the dots you could model what the buyback numbers would be. So we started out with the accretion/dilution.
We said neutral in year one, modestly accretive in year two, more than 10% in year three, and high teens in year four.
We gave what the beginning share count number of the combined company would be. It was 10.6 billion shares. We
said we'd have 5.9 billion shares and Allergan would have 4.7 billion shares. And then we gave the tax rate, which was
17% to 18%. So with those data points, we thought we provided the information that you needed in order to model
what the buybacks would be. And then just to the 2.5 to three times, clearly there could be some extra juice if we took
the leverage ratio up to that level.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Frank; next question, please.

Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Schott>: Great, thanks. I just have two quick ones here. First, just more broadly on emerging
markets, can you talk about the growth outlook here, maybe on China, just given the current economic environment
we're seeing? Has there been any change in your growth expectations there?
And then the second question for Ian, I know you guys have a very large deal pending right now. But how are you
thinking about business development given the recent volatility and valuation reset we see in the market? I guess what's
the size and scope of assets that you could be interested at this point given the upcoming Allergan transaction? And
maybe how quickly post the Allergan transaction could the company start considering larger deals if there was an

attractive opportunity in the market?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. John, do you want to talk about China?
<A - John Young>: Yes, sure. I think as we always say, Chris, on the emerging markets, we're always going to see
courses, of course, in volatility, but at the same time we continue to expect to see growth numbers in the mid to high
single-digit range.
Frank has already talked about China. We continue to be very positive about the prospects in the short, medium, and
longer term in China. It's obviously not just the world's largest country, with 1.3 billion – 1.4 billion population, but we
continue to see a strong government commitment to expanding access to quality health care. We're very encouraged by
the steps that we see the government taking in the regulatory environment to really enhance quality standards in the
marketplace. Whilst there are a few headwinds, GDP growth is slowing but still positive, still mid-single-digit
percentages, we are seeing some pressure on pricing. But overall when you put all of those factors together, we
continue to see China being a very positive growth driver.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, John. And on BD, Chris, we see it would be more focused to smaller deals than larger
deals right now. But once we close, we'll look at the opportunities, and we know we still have substantial flexibility.
And of course, it will be measured against the alternative uses of that cash, which right now are scheduled for buybacks
and the accretion equation. So we'll make the decisions that we believe are best for shareholders, and we'll take into
account what the assets are priced at, at the time that we close.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Chris, the only thing I'd add is we, Pfizer standalone today generate a lot of operating cash
flow. The combined new company we said by 2018 would be generating in excess of $25 billion a year in operating
cash flow, so the new company will generate significant amounts of operating cash flow.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Can we take our last question please, operator?

Your final question comes from Manoj Garg from Healthco.
<Q - Manoj K. Garg>: Hi, it's Manoj. Thanks for taking the question, a couple on the pending Allergan transaction
and one on next Tuesday's panel on Allergan. One, maybe if you can, just highlight. What are some of the levers that
would dictate whether the deal would close in the early second half of 2016 versus later in the second half. Two is just
for Frank on the $2 billion synergy number. If you could, just quantify as we fine-tune our pro forma model if that's a
gross number or a net number.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. So on the levers, Doug Lankler, could you indicate what you see the levers are for the
close?
<A - Douglas M. Lankler>: Sure. So, Manoj, we're working closely with the regulators. We're pleased with the
progress that we're making. We like the standpoint from the complementary nature of the businesses. And as a result,
we continue to expect to close the transaction during the second half.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: It's in that number.
<A - Douglas M. Lankler>: The synergy number is in that number.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Right, yes.
<A - Douglas M. Lankler>: He asked whether it was a gross or net, and the answer is it's a net number.
