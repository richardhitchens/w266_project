With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ford Credit's CFO, Michael Seneski. Michael?
Michael Seneski, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Molly. Today's presentation will cover Ford Credit's profit, credit loss performance; funding and liquidity
highlights, including our outlook for 2013; automotive cash, debt and liquidity; an update on our pension; and then
we'll wrap things up with a summary of the year.
Let's start off with Ford Credit's operating highlights on slide two. Ford Credit had another strong year with pre-tax
profit of 1.7 billion and 414 million for the fourth quarter. Net income for the year was 1.2 billion and 268 million in
the fourth quarter. Managed receivables were 91 billion at year-end, up 6 billion from year-end 2011. Compared to the
third quarter, managed receivables were 4 billion higher. The growth for fourth quarter and full year was driven
primarily by increases in wholesale receivables and net investment in operating leases.
Full year charge-offs were 136 million, down 65 million from 2011. Fourth quarter charge-offs were 49 million, down
3 million from a year ago. The full year loss-to-receivables ratio was 16 basis points, the lowest since we started
tracking LTR more than 30 years ago. The ratio was 22 basis points for the fourth quarter. At December 31, the
allowance for credit losses or reserve was 408 million or 44 basis points of receivables. The paid distributions of 600
million for the year, managed leverage was 8.3 to 1 at December 31, 2002, unchanged from year-end 2011. Also at
year-end, our equity was $9.7 billion.
Slide three provides an explanation of the change in Ford Credit's fourth quarter pre-tax result compared with 2011 by
causal factor. The $92 million decrease is primarily explained by lower credit loss reserve reduction and lower
financing margin, as higher yielding assets originated in prior years run off. And as shown in the memo, Ford Credit's
pre-tax profit was 21 million higher than the third quarter.
Slide four provides an explanation of the change in Ford Credit's full year results compared with 2011 by causal factor.
In line with expectations, the $707 million decrease is more than explained by fewer leases being terminated, which
resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain, as well as lower financing margin. For full year 2013, Ford Credit projects
pre-tax profit of about equal to 2012, managed receivables at year-end in the range of 95 billion to 105 billion,
managed leverage to continue in the range of 8 to 9 to 1, and distributions of about 200 million.
The next several slides will be discussing annual key metrics as they relate to asset performance. The normal quarterly
data slides have been included for your reference in the appendix. Slide five shows our annual credit loss metrics for
our worldwide portfolio over the past five years. Our charge-offs were down from 2011, primarily reflecting lower
repossessions in the US and lower losses in all international regions, offset partially by lower recoveries in the US. The
loss-to-receivables ratio is about one-third lower than 2011 and is the lowest on
record. Reserves and reserves as a percent of end-of-period receivables are both lower than a year ago, as well as from
the third quarter 2012 reflecting the decrease in charge -offs.
Slide six shows the annual trends of our US Ford and Lincoln retail and lease business, which comprises about 70% of
our consumer portfolio. The upper left box shows the stability of our average placement FICO, reflecting our
commitment to maintaining consistent underwriting standards through all business cycles. The rest of the metrics on
the page give you a sense of how the portfolio is performing. Over 60-day delinquencies remained flat. Looking at
repossessions, similar to our loss-to-receivables ratio, our repossession ratio for 2012 was a record low at 1.35%.
Severity of 6,900 in 2012 is in line with prior years, and charge-offs and the loss-to-receivables ratio decreased from a
year ago, reflecting primarily lower repossessions offset partially by lower recoveries. Fourth quarter metrics, as I
mentioned, shown in the appendix are broadly in line with prior quarters and full year.
Slide seven shows the annual trends of the lease residual performance for our US Ford and Lincoln brands over the past
five years. As we've been highlighting, lease return volumes in 2012 were about 30% lower than 2011, reflecting
primarily the lower lease placements in 2009. For 2012, lease return rate was 62%, up 6 percentage points compared

with 2011, reflecting a higher mix of 24-month contracts. In 2012, our auction values for 36-month vehicles continued
to increase, up $995 per unit from 2011 and up $580 per unit in the fourth quarter. The increase primarily reflects
higher contented vehicles. Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was 14.7 billion at the end of 2012, up
from 11.1 billion in 2011.
With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.
Neil Schloss, Vice President and Treasurer
Thanks Mike. Turning to slide eight, we will walk through our full-year 2012 funding highlights. The biggest news this
year was that Ford and Ford Credit achieved investment grade from Fitch, Moody's and DBRS. In addition to getting
back to Blue Oval, these events have had a meaningful impact on our unsecured credit spreads. We completed our 2012
funding plan issuing 23 billion of public term funding, which includes over 9 billion of unsecured debt. We issued our
first public investment grade unsecured debt transaction since 2005. Additionally, we launched an unsecured
commercial paper program in the US, which has grown to about 1.7 billion.
We ended the year with about 31 billion of committed capacity. Our liquidity remains strong and we will maintain cash
balances and committed capacity that meet our business and funding requirements through economic cycles. Our
funding strategy remains focused on diversification and we plan to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels
and investors. We remain focused on maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet.
Slide nine shows our trends in funding of our managed receivables. At the end of 2012, managed receivables were $91
billion. We ended the year with about 11 billion in cash. And securitized funding was 48% of managed receivables,
down from 55% at year-end 2011, which reflected the FUEL note exchange and a greater mix of unsecured debt given
our improved credit spreads following our upgrade to investment grade. We are projecting 2013 year-end managed
receivables in the range of 95 billion to 105 billion and securitized funding is expected to be in the range of 42% to
47%. We expect this percentage will continue to decline going forward.
Slide 10 shows the public term funding plan for Ford Credit, excluding our short-term funding programs. As I
mentioned earlier, we completed 23 billion of public term funding in the US, Canada and Europe, which includes 9
billion of unsecured debt and about 14 billion of securitization. For 2013, we project full year public term funding in
the range of 17 billion to 24 billion, consisting of 7 billion to 10 billion of unsecured debt, 10 billion to 14 billion of
public securitization. So far this year in the public markets, we have issued 1 billion of unsecured debt and 2 billion of
US wholesale securitization.
Turning to slide 11, we highlight Ford Credit's 2012 year-end liquidity. Ford Credit's sources of liquidity include cash,
unsecured credit facilities, FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines, and other asset-backed bank capacity. At
year-end 2012, we have 42 billion of cash and committed liquidity sources, down about a billion from the third quarter.
Utilization of our liquidity totaled 21 billion and capacity in excess of eligible receivables was 1.5 billion in the fourth
quarter. Total liquidity available for use continues to remain strong at almost 20 billion, down about a billion from the
third quarter and about 3 billion higher than a year ago. We continue to be focused on maintaining liquidity levels that
meet our business and funding requirements through economic cycles.
Slide 12 summarizes our automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the fourth quarter. Automotive debt at
the end of the year was 14.3 billion. We ended the year with net cash of 10 billion, 200 million higher than a year ago,
and automotive liquidity was 34.5 billion, 2.1 billion higher than a year ago.
Not included on the numbers on the slide is the $2 billion 30-year automotive debt issuance that we've completed
earlier this month. This was the first US public issuance in about a decade and took advantage of favorable market
conditions to issue low-cost, long-term debt. The proceeds will be used to redeem about 600 million of 7.5% callable
debt with the remainder being contributed to our pension plan during 2013 to support our de-risking action. This action
is consistent with our mid-decade target of automotive debt levels of about 10 billion.

Slide 13 provides an update on our pension plans. Worldwide pension expense in 2012, excluding special items, was
1.2 billion, 300 million higher than 2011. Special items charges of 400 million, including 250 million associated with
our US salary bond to enter [ph] a lump sum payment program. As we previously announced, the program started in
2012 and will continue through 2013. To date, we have settled about 1.2 billion of our pension obligation. The 2012
special charge reflects the acceleration of previously unrecognized losses in the plan proportionate to the obligations
settled to date.
In 2012, we made 3.4 billion in cash contributions to our worldwide funded pension plans, up 2.3 billion compared to
2011. This includes 2 billion of discretionary contributions consistent with our previously announced de-risking
strategy. For 2013, cash contributions to funded plans are expected to be about $5 billion globally, including
discretionary contributions of 3.4 billion.
Worldwide, our pension plans were unfunded by 18.7 billion at year-end 2012, a deterioration of 3.3 billion compared
with the year ago, more than explained by lower discount rates. Asset returns in 2012 for the US plans were 14.2%
above our expected long-term rate assumption. Going forward, our expected long-term return assumption for the US is
7.38%, down 12 basis points from a year ago.
And now let's close with a summary of 2012. Total company operating profit was strong with a pre-tax profit of 8
billion, net income was 5.7 billion. Ford generated positive automotive operating-related cash flow for the third year in
a row. At year-end, automotive gross cash was 24.3 billion and liquidity was 34.5 billion. Ford and Ford Credit
returned to investment grade with upgrades from Fitch, Moody's and DBRS.
Ford Credit had another strong year with pre-tax profit of 1.7 billion. Managed receivables at Ford Credit were 91
billion at year-end, up 6 billion from the prior year and up 4 billion from the third quarter. Full year charge-offs were
136 million, down 65 million from 2011. We completed our 2012 funding plan issuing 23 billion of public term
funding. Ford Credit liquidity remained strong at almost $20 billion.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Molly to begin the Q&A session.
Molly Tripp, Manager, Fixed Income Investor Relations
Thanks, Neil. With that, we'll start the question-and-answer session. Chenal, can we please have the first question?
Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Doug Karson, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Doug Karson, Analyst
Yes, guys, thank you. I had a question about the non-cash amortizations that are going to be a drag in 2013, looked like
they were a positive in years earlier. And if I went through some of those on the equity call, I want to kind of get a clear
understanding of how it'll impact the cash flow.
Michael Seneski, Chief Financial Officer
They're non-cash, so they would -- so those are reasons why we're giving guidance that our cash flow will improve
versus a year ago and our profits are flat.

Doug Karson, Analyst
Right. So we're going to kind of have outperformance in cash flow because it's a non-cash drag. I think we have
mentioned those.
Michael Seneski, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It would be non-cash and profit, I guess.
Doug Karson, Analyst
Correct. You kind of mentioned those. I'm not really certain on the amortization of the assets. I mean, how is that a
positive that's going away or stand there?
Michael Seneski, Chief Financial Officer
So, Doug, we previously impaired the assets involved in our North American business and the impact of that
impairment, which was favorable to our depreciation and amortization expense, ran over a number of years. In the last
year, that had an impact to us 2012, so that favorable effect goes away in 2013. So it shows us a higher amortization
expense in 2013, but it doesn't impact our cash flow.
Doug Karson, Analyst
Right. All right, I got it. I understand that, now it makes sense. The CapEx plan for 2013, would you guys repeat what
that was?
Michael Seneski, Chief Financial Officer
About 7 billion.
Doug Karson, Analyst
7 billion. So about 1.5 billion higher than 2012?
Michael Seneski, Chief Financial Officer
Correct.
Doug Karson, Analyst
Okay. And I guess the final question would be on the funding side. I was a little bit surprised to see that the unsecured
funding is kind of flat year-over-year from 2012 to 2013. I mean do you think there's any kind of risk to the upside for
unsecured funding at Ford Credit or do you feel very comfortable with that 7 billion to 10 billion?

Page 6 of 12
I think 7 billion to 10 billion is a range that we feel pretty comfortable with, now given our receivable forecast and the
run-offs. And it will -- at those levels will allow us to continue to walk down our securitized funding as a percent of
total consistent with the longer-term objectives. To the extent that the market -- to the extent that spreads improve and
relative to securitization, we will continue to have that flexed, but I think that's why we gave pretty good sized ranges
around both securitization and unsecured.
Doug Karson, Analyst
And then my last question -- thank you for that. The under-funded pension, obviously, grew. It looks like
internationally, it's at a pretty large number now and with rates where they are, you just had a 30-year sub-5% coupon.
Would there be any interest in financing some of that under-funded pension with debt, are you going to kind of go with
free cash flow?
Michael Seneski, Chief Financial Officer
Well, I think from our perspective, the whole goal of funding the pension plan is a balanced approach, which obviously
we took advantage of low rates and a good mark-to-market to raise what we've done, which in essence increased --
allowed us to increase our pension contributions. So it's going to be a combination of cash, the debt we've done, interest
rates over time going up globally and that will get us to the point where we feel comfortable and we'll obviously
manage the assets accordingly, as Bob said earlier.
Doug Karson, Analyst
All right, great. That's it from me. I appreciate it.
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Dan Colonna, UBS.
Dan Colonna, Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Just to piggyback a little bit off of Doug's question on the pension. I think, correct me if
I'm wrong, the mid-decade target for pensions to be mostly dealt with. I'm not exactly sure if that means no
under-funded status or a small under-funded status, if you can clarify that, that would be helpful. And also I think the
target is to get automotive debt down to 10 billion and with the issuance I guess we're closer to 16. So if you can just
help walk us to how we should think about the buckets of getting auto debt down by about another 6 billion plus the
pension situation, that will be helpful. Thank you.
Michael Seneski, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, let me take the second one first, which is the debt walk-down. And included in the 2 billion that we raised, we're
calling about 600 million of 7.5% callable debt. That will actually happen in the first quarter. So net is an increase of
1.4. And then if you look at the maturity profile, we've got the DOE loans that will continue to amortize. We've also got
a couple of other government loans from the EIB that mature in, I think, 2015, as well as the converts, which become
callable in 2014. And then there's some other things that we've got as well that we can do to get our debt levels down to
about 10 billion by mid-decade.

Neil Schloss, Vice President and Treasurer
On the pension side, clearly the results in 2012 and the change in funded status in 2012 was driven all by discount rate
reductions and when we had good asset returns, we put contributions and the discount rate change more than offset the
good news that we would have gotten from asset returns and cash.
Dan Colonna, Analyst
That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on Europe and the change in the outlook and guidance. I think the original
expectation was for 1.5 billion and now it's 2 billion. And I guess there was some confusion that all the non-cash drags
were not, I guess, well known to the market, but it seemed like the delta in your guidance really came from the market.
Can you just walk us through what's happened since October and is it strictly a volume-driven assumption that caused
the loss or was it a worsening of pricing? Thanks very much.
Stuart Rowley, Vice President and Controller
Yeah, Dan, this is Stuart. So let me try to respond to that. So our previous guidance for Europe had been a lot equal to
2012 and as you saw, we lost 1.750 billion in 2012. Our guidance was in excess of 1.5 billion. Our latest guidance for
2013 is for a loss of about 2 billion. So that's a deterioration of about 250 million and the items that Bob referred to in
the call, the single -- the largest factor is related to our outlook for industry volume in Europe.
In October, we guided for industry volume at or slightly below the 2012 level, which was 14 million units, but that was
in the high end of our range of 13 million to 14 million. Our latest outlook is to be in the lower end of that range of 13
million to 14 million units and that's consistent with what we saw as a running rate in the second half of last -- sorry,
the fourth quarter of 2012 that saw in Europe we ran at about 13.5 million units.
So we've taken down our outlook for the industry volume and that's the largest contributing factor to that reduction in
our guidance for 2013 and that's now baked into our numbers. Two other items that we called out were the impact of
pensions, so the discount rate that we used at year-end was slightly more unfavorable than we had estimated back in
October.
So as a result, our recorded pension expense in 2013 will be higher than we estimated. That is a non-cash pension
expense and then finally, the recent strength in the euro impacted our business. It was just a translation of the result
from euros into dollars and also have some negative operating effect. So they were the three principal factors, but the
major one being the lower industry volume.
Dan Colonna, Analyst
Great, that's helpful. And then last one for me is to the delay of the Mondeo that Bob talked about on the equity call,
was that a market-driven related decision or was that having something to do with any other issues?
Stuart Rowley, Vice President and Controller
No, that was a decision that we made when we concluded to propose to close our Genk facility. The new Mondeo,
which is the Fusion equivalent, was due to launch in Europe in the first half of 2013 in Genk and we concluded to
change [ph] that plant to launch that vehicle in Valencia. Given the employee consultation process that we will -- that
we are going through and the time taken to relocate that product to Valencia in Spain, we deferred the launch of that
vehicle by about a year.

The Mondeo is our largest passenger car vehicle in Europe, and as a result, a new Mondeo is typically a significant
driver to profitability in Europe. So one of the decisions we made as part of our transformation plan in Europe was to
push that back a year. So that was obviously a difficult decision to make and it's one of the investments that Bob
referred to. It's a penalty that we are -- that we will see in 2013, but we'll support an improved business structure and
improved results in the long term.
Dan Colonna, Analyst
Great, it's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.
Brian Johnson, Analyst
Good morning. I actually want to ask some Credit earnings questions having been on the equity call. As you go forward
to next year, you have managed receivables going up, but in terms of the puts and takes keeping earnings flat, I'd like to
get your thinking on a few drivers; one, net interest margin; two, lease depreciation, lease residuals how does come in;
and then three, both the charge-off rate and then the impact, potentially weaker news car prices on that, obviously the
spec [ph] lease as well. And therefore, where you might think you want to wind up in end-of-period receivable --
end-of-period loan loss reserves?
Michael Seneski, Chief Financial Officer
Okay. That's a multi-part question, Brian. I think the bottom line is, as you look at our results, we ran a 16 basis point
LTR this year, by far the lowest we've seen on record. And as you think about that going forward, our 10-year average
is closer to 67 basis points. We obviously don't see it increasing to that level in 2013. But we do see credit losses
increasing. Remember -- if you remember the second quarter of 2012, we ran an 8 basis point LTR. We don't think
we'll see that again. So when you look at our profit call, it is primarily driven by an increase in credit losses, which
provides headwind against the managed receivables growth.
Overall, we expect margin to be pretty flat and from a residual perspective, we don't expect much year-over-year news
either. And from a credit loss reserve perspective, that's going to go up because the credit losses are increasing, plus the
receivable levels are increasing. So the headwinds are solely in the credit losses and reserves versus the growth in the
receivable.
Brian Johnson, Analyst
Okay, that's helpful. And on the net interest margin, just maybe because I haven't talked for a while, just help us
understand how overall the low rate environment fits in with where your net interest margin spreads are. We're
certainly hearing noise out of the broader banking segment about the difficulty in making spread income now.
Michael Seneski, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I think that's been one of our themes all year long is that we've got a lot of higher yielding assets that continue to
roll off the portfolio and we continue to put on a little lower yielding assets. I do think that the year-over-year level in
margin is going to be a lot lower next year and hopefully, we can start to turn the corner. The other thing that we're

keeping a good focus on is our operating cost. If you look at our income statement, you can see we brought our
operating cost down over $70 million worldwide in 2012, which helps lead to one of our key goals is to be one of the
most efficient in the business. So we're doing everything we can to stabilize that net interest margin despite the external
environment.
Brian Johnson, Analyst
And in terms of stabilizing, is it involve reaching deeper either into this near-prime and subprime or your credit mix,
judged by the FICO scores kind of is constant, so that's not --
Michael Seneski, Chief Financial Officer
As I say every quarter, we've maintained our underwriting standards. Three out of every four subprime customers who
buy and finance a Ford vehicle are financed by Ford Credit. So that lets us know that our standards are very consistent
and we are there for the dealers, we are there for our customers, we are there for the Ford division. So we have not seen
a change in any of our standards.
Brian Johnson, Analyst
Okay, thanks.

Our next question comes from Brian Jacoby, Goldman Sachs.
Brian Jacoby, Analyst
Thank you. I have a question more on the automotive side around the CapEx. Historically, if we look back a while
back, the actual depreciation and amortization used to be somewhat close to CapEx and over the last several years,
you've been spending out more than the D&A and it's now again reflective of a lot of the new product we've seen and
so forth and it makes sense. But I guess for this year, for 2013 you're still -- what looks to be a pretty big jump in
CapEx and how should we think about sort of that relationship between CapEx and D&A?
I mean last year, D&A was about 67% of CapEx. I mean should we think about it in a similar vein and I guess at some
point, is this the new norm where CapEx will probably continue to outpace depreciation and amortization or as the
product cycle, I guess, matures, could eventually those two start to get a closer together again?
Stuart Rowley, Vice President and Controller
So, Brian, this is Stuart. So you are correct that CapEx was higher than depreciation and amortization expense in 2012.
CapEx will be higher in 2013 and our guidance was about $7 billion and again it will exceed the depreciation and
amortization expense. Of course, there's a lagging effect between CapEx and amortization. We are at a higher running
rate of capital investment.
That's the investments in our new products capacity in North America, and our growth in Asia Pacific, as well as some
investments to execute our revised manufacturing footprint in Europe. So over time, depreciation and amortization will
follow that new level, but it will lag over a number of years. We haven't provided a guidance for depreciation and
amortization as a percent of CapEx, but it's a lagging effect.

Brian Jacoby, Analyst
Okay. And then just another cash flow question and directionally, if you can give us some idea on this. I understand
you're not going to give specific guidance, but when you think about your auto operating-related cash flow being higher
in 2013, how should we think about the working capital component of that? Maybe it was a big use this year, obviously
Europe again in 20 -- or I should say last year was a big use. In 2013, we're going to see production lower in Europe,
but obviously nice increase in North America. Directionally how should we think about the working capital component
there?
Stuart Rowley, Vice President and Controller
So I think you should think of working capital as being favorable -- as favorable compared to 2012. As Bob mentioned
on the call, we did have some higher inventories at year-end than would be normal, given some of our launch activity.
We also had some units at our Genk facility in Belgium at year-end. So they would not be normal levels of inventory.
Going forward into 2013 in terms of the payables impact, higher production in North America would be favorable. In
the fourth quarter of last year, of course, we had a low production in Europe, as we took our sub-levels down, so that
would have been a negative impact, but generally I'd say favorable relative to 2012.
Brian Jacoby, Analyst
Okay, great. That's it from me. Thank you.

Our next question comes for Itay Michaeli of Citigroup.
Itay Michaeli, Analyst
Great, thanks, good morning. So just wanted to expand further on Brian's cash flow question. It seems like CapEx is 1.5
billion of the headwind, but you do have the 1.2 billion of non-cash expenses to add back. That's still a net $300 million
headwind to cash flow year-over-year, assuming earnings are flat. So just the question is what gives you the confidence
maybe going back to working capital timing differences. The cash flow can indeed be higher just given the CapEx
spread for the year.
Stuart Rowley, Vice President and Controller
I mean, yes, I think all your observations are correct. They are the elements. And in total and net, we are projecting
improved operating-related cash flow in 2013 compared to 2012.
Itay Michaeli, Analyst
Okay. Is it safe to assume that you think the operating-related cash flow can cover the pension contributions in the
year? Is that a good way to think about how you got to the 5 billion of pension, or are those two not very related?

We haven't given any guidance to the total cash flow. We've provided some of the elements that we expect. So we don't
have anything further to add on that.
Itay Michaeli, Analyst
Sure. And just lastly, I guess, on going back to CapEx, is any more color you can provide about where these
incremental investments are going, just given that you've gotten past some of your major global launches and the
markets and the global industry is growing at a lesser pace in 2013. So why this sort of 1.5 billion jump, maybe where
that incremental capital is going forward, the returns and things like that, so we could think about that in the long run?
Stuart Rowley, Vice President and Controller
Well, we've talked about our plans to maintain leading -- class leading levels of product freshness in North America.
And so our product-related investments are continuing in North America to just sustain the levels of performance that
we've seen in the market here. We did execute some capacity increases last year and this year we've announced that we
(inaudible) introduced the Fusion (inaudible) funds here in North America. But North America is a piece of it and then
of course in the Asia Pacific, Africa region we have seven plants under construction. Some of those are in a joint
venture activity, so not coming out of our operating-related cash flow, but some of them are wholly-owned facilities
and they include our new facility in India and our investments in Thailand. So those will be -- there are other effects
obviously elsewhere and they are some contributors.
Itay Michaeli, Analyst
Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks so much.
