So to begin with, our 12-week third quarter fiscal 2015 operating results for the quarter, earnings per share came in at
$1.17 a share, a 9% increase over last year's third quarter earnings results of $1.07 a share. A couple of factors that
impacted our third quarter earnings comparison year over year; first, FX. As compared to a year ago in the third quarter
this year, the foreign currencies where we operate weakened versus the U.S. dollar, in fact in all countries, but
primarily in Canada, Mexico, Korea and Japan, resulting in our foreign earnings in Q3 when converted into U.S.
dollars being lower by about $33 million pre-tax or $0.06 a share than these earnings would have been had FX rates
been flat year over year.
Second item of note, IT modernization. As with the past many quarters, our major IT modernization efforts are ongoing
and will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through this fiscal year and certainly into next
year, especially as new major systems are placed into service and depreciation on those begin.
In Q3, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $19 million pre-tax or
seven basis points – five basis points without gas deflation and FX.
And third note, LIFO, last year in Q3 we recorded a $12 million pre-tax LIFO charge. This year in Q3 we had a $7
million pre-tax LIFO credit, which benefited Q3 this year by $0.01 a share. And last item of note, while we enjoyed the
benefit of strong year-over-year gas profits in the first half of the fiscal year, both Q1 and Q2. In Q3 it was additive, but
only by $0.01 a share, so pretty much back to normal this quarter. Although the next quarter it'd be a little bit of
tougher comparison.
In terms of sales for the third quarter, total sales were up 1% and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure came in
at down 1%. For the quarter, sales were negatively impacted as you well know by gasoline price deflation. That
represented about a 350 basis point negative impact. And by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar year
over year, that impact was a little over 300 basis points.
So excluding gas, the reported plus 1% U.S. comp number increased in Q3 would have been a plus 5% and the reported
minus 6% international comp figure excluding gas and FX impacts would have been plus 7% such that the total
company comps reported at minus 1% for the quarter, excluding gas and FX would have been plus 6% for the
company. One other item of note on sales, looking at some of the preliminary reports by analysts out there, it looks like
the suggestion was that May might have gotten off to a weak start. That's not the case. The first couple of weeks of
May are just fine.
And in terms of new openings after nine new locations in the first half of fiscal 2015 including the relocation of Wayne,
New Jersey, we opened four locations in Q3, one in Quebec, Canada, one in Merida Mexico, which was a relocation
and one in Culiacán, Mexico. And we've also converted our existing Bedford Park, Illinois warehouse into a business
center, so a net of two additional locations in the third quarter.
All told, that puts our fiscal 2015 opening schedule so far through the third quarter at 10 net new locations. And next
week kicks off a very busy fiscal fourth quarter expansion, which includes openings next week in Wichita, Kansas;
Mobile, Alabama; and Rochester, New York. These are the first three of 14 planned new locations for the fourth
quarter, including four additional new U.S. locations. One new location in each of UK, Taiwan, Korea and Mexico and
three new warehouses opening in Japan this August. We will most likely end the fiscal year with 24 net new openings
and 687 Costco's worldwide.
We had originally planned to be closer to 30 for the fiscal year. However, several of these had been pushed into early
fiscal 2016 due to timing and construction issues. In fact, between September 1 and the end of the calendar year 2015
or the first four months of fiscal 2016, we expect to open somewhere between 15 and 18 new warehouses, so a very
busy seven-month period ahead for us.
Also this morning, I'll review with you our e-commerce activity, our membership trends and renewal rates, our recent
common stock repurchase and dividend activities, and of course, additional discussion about margins, SG&A and other
items in Q3.

So for our third quarter results, in terms of sales; sales for this year's third quarter, the 12-weeks ended May 10 were
$25.52 billion, up 1% from last year's third quarter results at $25.23 billion. On a reported comp basis, Q3 comps were
down 1%, but up 6% excluding gas deflation and FX. For the quarter, our minus 1% reported comp was a combination
of an average frequency increase of about 3.5% and an average transaction decrease of minus 4% for the quarter,
recognizing that that minus 4% is reported excluding FX and gas that minus 4% average transaction would have been
plus 2.5%.
In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region – excuse me, in terms of sales by geographic region for the U.S.,
the Midwest and California were the strongest. Internationally in local currencies, Australia, Mexico and Taiwan posted
the strongest results. In terms of merchandise categories, sales performance for the quarter, in the third quarter within
food and sundries, overall low to mid singles, deli low reported, mid if you take the FX out. Deli and frozen were the
relative standouts. For hardlines, the departments with the strongest results were hardware and garden. Consumer
electronics comps were slightly positive excluding FX. Within the low single digit softlines comps, the men's apparel
and housewares were the standouts. And in fresh foods, meat and deli were the strongest.
Now moving to the line items of the income statement. Membership fees, we came in at $584 million or 2.29%. That's
a 4% increase and a seven basis point increase and a $23 million increase versus last year's third quarter. Again, these
numbers are impacted, of course, by FX. The $584 million number, had FX been flat year over year that 4% dollar
increase would've been 7%, up instead of 4% reported. In terms of the membership, we continue to enjoy strong
renewal rates, 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide, and also continuing increased penetration of our
Executive Membership.
New member sign-ups in the third quarter were slightly down year over year. This has to do essentially with timing of
four openings in Asia last year, two in Japan and two in Korea, which generate typically larger-than-normal sign-ups.
In terms of number of members at Q3 end, Gold Star 33.2 million at Q3 end, which is up from 32.7 million 12 weeks
earlier at Q2 end. Primary Business, the same at 7.0 million. Business add-ons the same at 3.5 million. So all-told, we
ended the quarter with 43.7 million member households, up from 43.2 million, and including extra cards, 79.6 million
at Q3 end versus 78.7 million just 12 weeks earlier.
At May 10, Q3 end, paid Executive Members came in at 15.7 million, an increase of just about 250,000 since Q2 end
or about 21,000 a week increase in the quarter. As I've stated before, Executive Members continue to grow. They're
currently approximately 36% of member base and approximately two-thirds of our sales.
In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, business continues strong at rounding up to 95%, Gold Star around 90%, and
so total again the 91% and worldwide 88%. Our reported gross margin for the quarter was up – on a reported basis up
47 basis points from a 10.62% last year, up to 11.09% this year. Now that 47 basis point increase is at plus
9-basis-point increase without gas deflation.
If you jot down a few numbers as I always ask you to do, we'll have four columns. The first two columns will be first
half of 2015 as reported; second column would be first half of 2015 without gas deflation, and then Q3 2015 and Q3
2015 reported and without gas deflation for third and fourth columns. The line items, first one will be core
merchandising.
For the first half, reported we were up two basis points, for the first half without gas deflation it was down 17 basis
points. For Q3 reported was plus 23 basis points and without gas deflation minus 10 basis points. Ancillary businesses
plus 34 basis points and plus 29 basis points for the first half. And for the third quarter plus 23 basis points reported and
plus 15 basis points without gas, 2% Reward minus three basis points and minus one basis point, and for the quarter,
minus six basis points and minus 3 basis points.
LIFO, plus two basis points and plus two basis points, and for the third quarter plus seven basis points and plus seven
basis points. Other was plus three basis points and plus three basis points for the first half and zero and zero for the
third quarter. Anyway, for total for the first half we were up 38 basis points and without gas deflation up 16 basis
points. And reported for the third quarter we were up 47 basis points and as I just mentioned, plus 9 basis points on a
without gas deflation basis.

Now again as you can see, when these numbers core merchandising gross margin was up 23 basis points year over year
and down 10 basis points without gas deflation. This is primarily a function of improved year-over-year gross margins
within our ancillary businesses. Recorded gross margins in food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods as a
percentage of their own sales were up 10 basis points year over year, with food and sundries and softlines being up year
over year and hardlines and fresh foods being down year over year, but the net of the four on their own sales was up 10
basis points. So a good margin performance in the core. Ancillary and other business gross margins were up 23 basis
points and 15 basis points without gas deflation in the third quarter.
We basically enjoyed fairly broad-based strength within all of our ancillary businesses with year-over-year gross
margin improvements in gas, optical, hearing aids and food courts, as well as improved year-over-year sales
penetration within pharmacy, e-commerce and travel, which all contributed to the ancillary gross margin improvement.
The impact from sales to our Executive Membership represents a six basis point hit to the margin or three basis point
hit without gas deflation. This is good. It's the 2% Reward feature, which reduces sales and the fact that as more
members switch to Executive Member we think that's good for us long term. LIFO, as I mentioned, a $7 million pre-tax
benefit this year compared to a $12 million pre-tax charge last year for a $19 million or seven basis point
year-over-year positive variance to gross margin. As I've said many times, whether these numbers are up or down on
LIFO, it's really part of the margin in my view. Overall, we think margins are in good shape.
Moving to reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentages in Q3 year-over-year were higher by 25 basis points coming in at a
10.11% of sales this year compared to a 9.86% in last year's third quarter. But again better or lower by 10 basis points
excluding gas deflation. In terms of SG&A, again, we'll do the same four columns. First half 2015, both reported and
without gas deflation and Q3 2015 both reported and without gas deflation. First is operations. We were plus six basis
points and plus means good or lower, plus six basis points reported and plus 23 basis points without gas deflation in the
first half year over year. We were minus 16 basis points and plus 14 basis points without gas deflation the plus 14 basis
points. Central, minus six basis points and minus four basis points for the first half and minus 10 basis points and minus
six basis points for the third quarter reported without gas deflation. Stock compensation minus eight basis points and
minus seven basis points for the first half and plus 1 basis points and plus two basis points for the third quarter.
Quarterly adjustments were not an issue. It was zero across the board. In total, we reported for the first half minus eight
basis points or higher by eight basis points. And in fact it was better or lower by 12 basis points, so plus 12 basis points.
Reported for third quarter was minus 25 basis points or higher by 25 basis points. Again, lower or plus 10 basis point
without gas deflation.
The operations component again was – again a minus 16 basis points. Within operations, excluding gas deflation,
payroll and benefits represented 10 basis points of that year-over-year improvement. So good expense control on
payroll and stuff and benefits. Our central expense was higher year over year in the third quarter by 10 basis points, six
basis points without deflation. Again ongoing IT modernizations represented about seven basis points of that or five
basis points without gas deflation and FX. So that's a big chunk of that. Equity compensation, a little bit of a benefit
there. That fluctuates based on when people hit their 25-year, 30-year, and 35-year tenures, where some of those are
accelerated, as well as of course every October we do the annual grant.
Next on the income statement line is pre-opening expense and no real big issues here. $16 million last year in the
quarter, $14 million this year. So this expense item lower by $2 million. We have four openings in each of Q3 2014 and
Q3 2015. All told, operating income for the third quarter came in at $821 million, higher by $84 million or 11% from
last year's operating income figure of $737 million.
Below the operating income line, interest expense came in at $31 million this year versus $25 million during last year's
fiscal quarter. This increase is a result of the $1 billion of senior notes issued during the second quarter in conjunction
with the recent $5.00 per share special dividend.
Interest income and other was lower year over year by about $3 million, coming in at $9 million this year versus $12
million a year ago in the quarter. Actual interest income for the quarter was lower by a million of – a million of that $3
million was actual interest income. The other component is principally, which is about minus $2 million year over year,

is principally relates to marking-to-market forward FX contracts used by our foreign operations. Sometimes that's
positive by a little and sometimes that negative, a pretty small negative this time. These swings of course are caused by
change in the U.S. dollar relative to those currencies.
Overall, pre-tax income was higher by a little over 10% year over year or higher by $75 million in the third quarter
coming in from last year's $724 million in the quarter to this year's $799 million. In terms of income taxes, our
company tax rate this quarter came in at – right at 35.0%. That compares to 33.9% in the third quarter. Compared to
last year, our effective tax rate has gone up due to lower year-over-year percentages of earnings coming from our
foreign operations. This lower penetration is primarily due to foreign exchange as well as strong U.S. gas profits
compared to last year, although, they're only slightly stronger.
Overall, reported net income of $516 million this year in the third quarter represented a 9% increase as compared to the
$473 million net income figure last year in Q3.
Now for a quick run-down of other usual topics. The balance sheet, of course, is included in this morning's press
release but a couple of balance sheet info items. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories, reported was 100%, up
from 99% a year ago. Payables of course the net number include construction payables not just merchandise payables.
If you look at just merchandise payables against inventories, this year was also up 1% or a little better, at 90% this year
versus 89% a year ago.
Average inventories per warehouse, we're up on a reported basis about $180,000, coming in at $13.2 million per
location versus $13.0 million a year ago, up about 1%. But again, without FX inventory levels per warehouse if FX had
been flat year over year would have been up about $570,000 or up about 4% per warehouse. This increase was pretty
much spread over many departments, some of which have resulted from the increased flow of backlogged inventories
from the West Coast port slowdown. That's pretty much behind us and we should see a little of that burn off. Overall
our inventories are just fine. As I mentioned in the second quarter earnings report, midyear physical inventories came in
as good as they ever have.
In terms of CapEx, in the first quarter we spent $555 million, in Q2 an additional $612 million, and in Q3 $421 million,
for a year-to-date total of CapEx of $1.6 billion. Given that a couple of the units have been pushed into the fall, the
current estimate for CapEx this year is somewhere in the $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion range. That compares to last year's
fiscal 2014 expenditures for the whole fiscal year of right at $2.0 billion.
In terms of Costco Online, we continue to operate it in four countries, U.S., Canada, UK, and Mexico. For the third
quarter, sales and profit were up nicely. Sales were up 18% in U.S. dollars for the quarter, and again excluding FX. In
our e-commerce business in local currencies, sales were up 21%.
Next on the discussion list is expansion. As I mentioned, in terms of net new openings, we opened eight in Q1, none in
Q2, two in Q3, and 14 anticipated for Q4 net, so that would be 24 net increase for the year. As I mentioned, somewhere
in the 15 to 18 more in the last four months of calendar 2015, which would be the first four months of fiscal 2016. For
fiscal 2015, again, these 24 would represent about a little over 3.5% unit increase, so probably about a 4% square
footage increase, and at Q3 end we ended with total square footage of 96.7 million square feet.
In terms of common stock repurchases, in Q1 we started buying back a little again. We had $18 million in purchases. In
Q2 it was $92 million in purchases for that 12-week quarter. And for the third quarter, that 12-week quarter, we did
$124 million in purchases, having purchased about 839,000 shares. So again, in terms of an annualized basis, we're
doing more in Q3 than we had in the previous two quarters; year to date 234 million shares.
In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend per share increased with a May dividend payment from 35.5% (sic)
[$0.355] to $0.40 a share for the quarter, a 12.7% increase. This $1.60 a share annualized dividend represents a total
cost to the company right at $700 million a year. This regular dividend of course was in addition to the $5.00 a share
special dividend, which totaled $2.2 billion to our shareholders. That was paid on February 27. It was announced in Q2,
but paid in beginning of Q3.

And with that, Brittany, I'll turn it back over to you for Q&A. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
You're welcome. [Operator Instructions] Your first question does come from the line of John Heinbockel with
Guggenheim.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: So, Richard, two questions about gross margin. Number one, so the gas benefit
moderated, but you still had a pretty good performance out of ancillary. So were there some other non-gas ancillary
departments that were particularly robust, really up quite a bit in gross? So that's number one.
And then two, if you look at core merchandise, ex-deflation, so you're still down there. I know you're making some – I
think you're making some investments. Can you talk about how you think about tying gasoline windfall or gasoline
benefit or ancillary benefit to investments in price? And is one of those the idea of pass along less meat inflation
because you've got some gas wind at your back?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: First of all, all the ancillary businesses were good this quarter. They've generally been
good. Sometimes one's a little lower year over year, but all in we're up. Gas was a very small benefit year over year this
quarter for gas profits versus the first two quarters, as we mentioned in those first two quarters. And again, that will
cycle over the next three quarters where we had strong Q4 a year ago and strong Q1 and Q2 earlier this year. So those
could be tougher comparisons.
In terms of investing in price, that's what we do. It's not a scientific function here. It's an art form. And we're always
going be competitive. Frankly, I can remember over the past several years when we talked about just when poultry
prices were skyrocketing. There were some fiscal years when just that one item was $30 million or $40 million of
margin reduction year over year, $0.05 or $0.06 share to the company, when we had no gas impact. So we do what we
do, when we do it, when it's the right thing to do for our company from a competitive standpoint. Certainly having
strong gas profits makes it a little easier, but I wouldn't say – we don't use a certain percentage of it. We certainly don't
use all of it, but certainly don't use some fixed percentage either. We just do what we do each quarter in all the
competitive departments. I think I answered all your questions. Did I miss anything?
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: I was just curious about meat in particular. It's been very inflationary. It's a big
category for you. That strikes me that that's one where you may have delayed putting some pricing through.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, but that's such a front-and-center category, when you see ads in the paper every week,
particularly holiday weekends for Memorial Day or July 4th, or Christmas or Labor Day, you name it. And so we're
always going to be tough on that. Historically, when commodity prices are going up, we're the first to not have them go
up as much. And when they're coming down, we're going go down as fast as we can.
I think one thing that has helped offset it is a little bit over the last few years is in this tough economy, we're the ones
that are – I remember right after the economy got hammered in late 2008, there were some fiscal quarters in calendar
years 2009 and 2010 where we were upwards of a third of all the prime meat sold in the United States, when usually
that was nothing or very little because it all goes to restaurants and hotels. So we have a customer that when prices
come down, we can sell it and that kind of stuff. And on organic, we can protect our margin a little bit because
everybody else is trying to make more and we try to make fair, and so all those things.

By the way, the other comment, you had a question you asked earlier about the core being down 10 basis points. It is,
recognizing core margin on core sales was up 10 basis points. The fact of the matter is, is all these things there are 12
buttons that you have push in, and this one pushes that one out as it relates to what's going on penetration-wise, sales
penetration-wise. So again, we're never going to – we're going to do what we do competitively first and foremost. And
knock on wood, at the end of the day it comes out pretty good.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: All right. And then just lastly, again on the topic of mix here, so if you think about
KS, just remind us. The margin spread, and I know it will vary by item, but margin spread KS versus a branded
product, KS penetration. And then is the KS margin itself staying pretty flat over time? As you get a benefit you pass it
along, or is KS margin actually getting a little bit better?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Of core merchandise, Kirkland Signature is about a quarter of our sales and increasing.
Hopefully, it will continue to increase to some higher level. I would say again, if I think back of some of the big
volume items, paper goods, we have some KS of order, we have some KS items that are several hundred million dollars
or more of sales a year. Some of the low-hanging fruit originally was those are typically very competitive branded
items, where we can show great savings and still make a better margin.
It ranges all over the board. The difference between KS margin and branded margin could be sometimes as much as
half a dozen percentage points, and sometimes one, zero to two. And part of that's price-point driven. If the right
margin on something was – to get to some margin percentage was 11.39%, you can well bet it's going to be 10.99%.
But when it goes the other way, we're not going to go up past some percentage point because we're pretty disciplined
on that.
So overall, I don't think – if it's changed, it's changed very little because most of those, the big wide ones have been
done so many years ago. So now the only extra of that is just a little extra penetration. But I would say that's a
declining, probably a slightly declining penetration because new stuff is all over the board in different items.

Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simeon A. Gutman>: Thanks, good morning, Richard, one follow-up on gas. This quarter it looked like there
was a slightly different dynamic at play where wholesale prices were rising different from the prior two, yet retail
prices went up a bit – national prices. I don't know how your prices trended, but you still eked out a little bit of a
benefit. Did you do anything different to manage it? Did you typically – you typically lag, I guess, the market. But
were you more cognizant of the interplay between wholesale costs and retail prices this quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Nothing out of the ordinary, no.
<Q - Simeon A. Gutman>: Okay. And then my follow up is on investments and SG&A spending, I think we ask this
once a quarter, regarding the timing in terms of when investments crest and when we should start to see those
investments dwindle?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: In terms of IT?
<Q - Simeon A. Gutman>: Correct, yes.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think if I go back 2.5 years ago, we felt that some – it was probably sometime in early
2016. Maybe I'm off by a half a year or a year, so maybe it's a little longer. The good news is, is the denominator in that
calculation keeps getting higher too, the sales denominator. But we're just starting to see some of those big projects,
and we've got several of them be installed, and that's when you start that amortization of those items. So we'll still see it
eke up a little bit over the next – certainly the next four quarters, maybe six. It's hard to predict, maybe it's seven, I don't
know yet. But it's going as planned, and part of the plan in a tongue-and-cheek way was, whenever we think it's going

<Q - Simeon A. Gutman>: And when you said 2016, are you referring to calendar or fiscal?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I'm referring to fiscal, but it could be a little longer than that. But if it is, it's coming
down, these are smaller – in my view, smaller – they're going to be smaller year over year, higher SG&A basis points,
than they have been. But you'll have to wait and see guys. Things are going along. Knock on wood, the things that

Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Hi. Meredith Adler from Barclays. Hi, Richard. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit
about what you're seeing in terms of inflation in chicken and eggs because of avian flu.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know completely. I do know that there was a requirement in California in terms of
something related to eggs that caused egg prices to come up, and if you want to follow-up with me, I'm happy to find
out. I just don't know off the top of my head.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Well then maybe more theoretically, I do actually – it has to do with giving the birds – the
hens bigger cages, and that meant there was a shortage of supply. I learned that from another retailer yesterday. But
what is your philosophy about chickens and rotisserie chicken pricing? If you see a big increase, are you going to do
what you've done before, which is just maintain your retail price?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We'll have to see. I can only tell you what history has shown us is, is that when others were
raising their chicken prices from $4.99 to $5.99, we were willing to eat, if you will, $30 million, $40 million a year on
gross margin by keeping it at $4.99. And that's what we're – that's what we do for a living.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Can you talk also just more generally about food inflation, both in the U.S. and outside the
U.S.?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: On the protein side, it's been involved for various reasons. Pork was volatile because of a
virus that reduced the supply. I'm trying to think, beef, as I understand it, in an 18-month transition where the – when
grain prices, when feed prices skyrocketed, a certain part of that 18-month cycle of growing cattle was reduced as
people – as farmers sent them to process sooner, because it was too much – it cost too much to feed them. And so we're
going through that cycle of limited inventory there, and then there's also higher demand overseas which has been muted
a little bit by the stronger dollar.
So again, it's just like predicting anything. You never know what it's going to be until it gets there. When I look at
overall, looking just down the list of most deflationary and inflationary items in the last month, you've got some beef
items on there for sure, in the 8% to 20% range year over year. On the deflationary side, again, it's all over the board.
There's some – nothing that stands out in terms of big trends. So I think overall proteins are up a little more than they
had been three and six months ago in terms of that expectation. And the expectation – the off the cuff comment from
one of our senior buyers on the fresh foods on the pork, beef and poultry side was, as they come down a little bit you
can be assured that they're going to go back up. And as they go up a little bit, you can be assured they'll come back
down. So again it's hit and miss.
I get back to my comment I made on this call. When these types of prices are going up, we're going to try to hold off as
long as we can. And when they're going down, rest assured we're going be the first out there lowering them. But it's a
very competitive field out there. We're benefiting I think a little bit with increasing organic, and that's fresh foods in
general not necessarily protein. But I think that trend of benefiting from that should continue from the standpoint that

Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Steven Zaccone>: Yes, good morning. This is Steven Zaccone on for Oliver today. Thanks for taking our
questions. Looking at international, can you provide an update where you guys are versus your long-term potential?
Currently international is about 30% of your store base. Could that get to 50% over time? And then we understand
France is the next country you guys are going to enter. Any other new markets you're looking to consider?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, international is going to most likely continue to grow if you think about it on a base
of about 480 U.S., we're opening 12 or 14 a year this year. And about half in the U.S. and half internationally where
that number of openings internationally on a smaller base of total international right now is a lot bigger. And that will
continue. And I think even the percentage of annual openings each year will continue to grow outside of the U.S. as
that's limited. If anything, I'm probably – versus our expectations five years ago, there's probably more openings in the
U.S. still than we had anticipated. So that's good news for U.S. But we'll still see more grow internationally. Could it be
50%/50% one day? Probably. I'm not sure when, but it will keep growing.
<Q - Steven Zaccone>: Okay. And then I guess specific, we'd like to get your views on the competitive environment.
Some of your traditional warehouse competitors are struggling. And then conversely, there's a lot of new grocery
concepts that are emerging. How do you guys see the environment changing? And then do you think there's an
opportunity for Costco to eventually have a like a new store concept or a modified store concept? Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's always a competitive field. I mean there's some great supermarket chains out there both
nationally and regionally. We still respect our direct competitors. I think we began – one of the good things about our
concepts from my view is, is that I look at organic. It started off small. It's still small relative but growing faster. And
there's certainly more supply of that out there. And it's where we shine in terms of quality and value. And I think that's
nothing but a positive for us going forward at this point.
I don't see us doing – many years ago we tried a smaller box size concept in the 72,000 square foot range compared to
the – probably back then the average Costco was in the 135,000 square foot to 140,000 square foot. We're building
Costcos in the 155,000 square foot range now in terms of thousands of square feet. I don't see us trying a smaller box
any time in the near future, because we've got plenty going on with the regular size box.
I mentioned on the call earlier, we converted the Bedford, Illinois, unit from a warehouse club to a business center.
That's our 10th business center. I think the last five of those 10 business centers were over the last four or so years, five
years. We'll probably open a couple of three of those a year going forward, as they've started to perform better. But
again we'll see. That's pretty much what we have going on at this point and so far so good.
<Q - Steven Zaccone>: Okay, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.
<Q - John C. Parke>: Good morning. This is actually John Parke on for Chuck. I guess can we dig into the core
margins by category a little bit and I mean it seems like the 10 basis point improvement as a percentage of own sales is
the best in a few quarters. So kind of what drove that performance I guess in the food and sundries and softlines
categories?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Food and sundries, softlines was a bigger improvement year over year than food and
sundries. Frankly, I don't remember if it's because it was a weak comparison to last year. Foods has a much bigger
penetration mind you. Food and sundries is our biggest core category. And nothing – there's nothing specific. Again, I
think that we feel that we're able to make a little more margin mostly by buying better and keeping a little of it, but
passing more of it on.
When we look at our competitive price shifts versus our direct competitors, if anything the gap is improving, is getting
bigger a little bit, not a lot. So it's not like – and so in our view we're as, if not more competitive, while still showing
some improvement in the core. But – and as many of you know who have known us for a long time, we can make a
little more if we wanted to, and sometimes if we need to. And sometimes if we need to we don't, because it's the right
thing to do. I think we feel at this point quite comfortable with where our margins have been. And hopefully that will
continue.
<Q - John C. Parke>: Got it, thanks. And then just switching gears a little bit, can you provide an update on some of
the digital initiatives you guys are doing, like e-commerce, Tmall with Alibaba, Google Express and Instacart?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. Well, pretty much the same as a quarter ago, we're certainly testing in six markets
with Google and probably a few other merchants with Google, with Google Express shopping. Instacart has expanded
to more cities with their announced capital raise a few months ago. And there's a couple other smaller ones in some
regional markets. And so that's good. We are agnostic and we're working with all of them. We like to sell merchandise,
and we'll see where it goes.
In terms of Tmall, I think we've got 160 items on there and it's doing quite well. We don't disclose numbers on it. It's
still small of course, but I'd say certainly significantly better than we expected to start with. And the good news is it's
getting our name known over there, and as more stuff is shipped in and more to Kirkland Signature name than the
Costco name, frankly, and that's good too.
In terms of other digital initiatives, I know we did one thing in a small – in one of our smaller regional markets with
Groupon, but relatively small. Good results, but small impact, small geographic impact. And that's pretty much it at this
point. We planned an e-commerce – again we're currently in four countries. In the next 12 months we'll be in two more
and probably a 7th if you will, the third of three more will be probably a year and a half, two years out. And so it looks
like that's a business that's more profitable as a percent of sales than the core business. It's still relatively small. It's big,
it's $3 billion plus, but it's I'm happy to say over the last probably 10 years or so 2.5 years or 2.75 years we've seen
year-over-year increases right around 20%, 18% to 20%, which is mostly comp and so that's been pretty good for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning, Richard. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You've been putting up
such great traffic trends for so long. I think some of that's been due to the improvement in your fresh, rolling out more
gas station. How long can that continue? What's your expectation on the sustainability of the recent traffic
performance?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We cross our fingers and hope it will continue. I mean we're out there every day trying to
get new items and new exciting stuff and lower some more prices and organics has helped. Gas helps. We're still
certainly as many new locations that can get gas, get it, which is more than the company average. And there's still
several out there, existing locations that we're fighting hard to get gas stations, or buying land next door, or appealing
the 12th appeal out there ourselves in one city I can think of.
But at the end of the day, that's what we do. So fresh, in my view, fresh foods, gas, Executive Membership, opening in
new geographic markets outside the United States, all those things are net positives. I remember when the economy

kind of crashed in late 2008, I remember at the end of calendar 2009 when we had a full year of 4% – a little – right
around 4%, maybe 4.1% or 2% frequency increases, I remember warning everybody that if it's 0 in calendar 2010 that's
a 2% compounded, which is better than our historical average because how can we sustain that? We're now six years of
a little over 4% compounded. In my view, anything in and around that range, we will continue to try to do but there's
no predicting it.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: And you're not – are you seeing any differences in the month-to-month, like more
variability...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Where the variability has been of late is Easter fell two or three weeks different year over
year, so it's kind of like you need to look at an eight-week average, the two-month average or eight or nine-week
average not just a given week because the numbers are a little screwy trying to compare them when there're things like
that. Same things with Memorial Day, which is I think a week different.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay. And then on the return of cash, you've been stepping up activity to be in the
market over last couple of quarters. Should we expect that to continue? It sounds like you also like the special dividend
so how are you going to balance out the activity? Thank you so much.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think what we've said in the past is, is that generally speaking we generate more cash than
we spend on ramped-up CapEx, although ramped-up CapEx will be our first and foremost directive. We do have a little
debt to pay down. We are cognizant of the fact that I think as a board to be shareholder – be pro-shareholder and having
done now – we have two data points for special dividends but two points is not a trend make, but it worked pretty well
and we'll see what the future brings. I think in terms of stock buy-backs I think as I mentioned in the past, we'll
continue to buy sometimes on a regular basis, sometimes periodically. But we don't know – as long as we feel good
about the long-term of our company, we don't know when we're going to be completely right or a little wrong.
And so if we buy over a longer period of time on a regular basis, we generally like that way to do it. And we certainly
picked up in last couple of quarters and there's no reason to change that, but we'll see what tomorrow brings.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay, great. Thank you so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning to you. First off all, any initial thoughts on the transition
process as you move away from AmEx to your new credit card deal, whether there's any friction in that process? And
when do you think you'll get visibility or maybe we'll get visibility on how the economics impact the offer in your
financials?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Right, there's not a lot we could say at this point. Needless to say, we're excited about it.
I'm not excited about the transition because there's work to be done, but we're getting through that. And there's really
not a lot that we're going to be able to say about the new program other than, needless to say, we wouldn't have done
this unless we felt it was better for our members. And just like when we price goods, the old adage was for every dollar
we save we give $0.90 to customer. That's not a fixed formula, needless to say, but we're going give most of it to the
member. And it's a lot and we'll let you know next March or April.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: That's very helpful. Second question, just thinking about the U.S. comp ex-gas that
you reported and trying to square it with the monthly data that comes out, I know that the months don't align with the
quarters necessarily, but I think you had two seven basis points and a four basis points and the straight average of that
will be around six basis points. And you printed five basis points. So what would account for the variability in the U.S.
comp ex-gas that we saw for the quarter and the months that comprised most of it?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Without even looking at it, it's two things. It's going to be rounding and it's going to be the
months don't align with the quarters. Part of February was the end of Q2 and part of it's the beginning of Q3. The same

thing with May, the first two weeks of May. I'm sorry. The first week of May was part of Q3 and the next three weeks
are going to be part of Q4. I did mention earlier in the call because we did see a comment or two, I don't know if one of
those was from you, but that there was some – someone suggested perhaps May was getting off to a weak start, and
that's not the case.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Got it, that's helpful. And then finally, Spain, if you could, just give us some early
thoughts on what you are seeing and just lessons learned if you will going forward as you think about Europe more
broadly.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Basically, as I've said when people have asked, sales are a little less than we had planned
but growing nicely. And membership signups are just fine, probably a little stronger than our original plan. And the
renewals so far are good. So recognizing our first opening there was where we could get open first, in terms of timing.
That's Seville and we're excited about being there. Our next two openings, which would be later this calendar year and
early next calendar year, will be two units in Madrid, which is a bigger market. And so it's again a little bit lower sales
than originally planned, but membership signups are good and actually a little better than planned, so we'll be fine.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: And cost of doing business and the whole cultural dynamic you're finding is in sync
with what you expected?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, it's as expected. The good news is, whatever the labor issues are or policies, we know
that we've got great product and services at the best prices, and people seem to like it. And as it relates to any
restrictions on labor or whatever or closing in some countries, in one country in Asia we have to close two Sundays a
month, as do other big boxes. So the good news is it rains on everybody. And we think, all things being equal, we've
got a good competitive stance.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to follow up on the traffic question a little
differently. So if I look at the trend, so last August traffic inflected by about 100 basis points to 150 basis points from
the prior rolling average. If I look at the March – April period together, it looks like it decelerated back down to 3.5%.
So I guess what do you attribute the acceleration and then recent deceleration to? And does it line up at all with how
your gallonage comps changed over that period as you had widened the gap out versus the market bringing price down
more slowly?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: If I knew the exact answer, I'd retire and just give that out on a consulting basis. Some of it
I think has to do with gas. When prices fall dramatically, we get a lot more press. But then I remember when prices
were very low, we were getting bumps in gallonage like we had never seen before, in the low double digits on a
gallonage comp basis. So nothing is that predictive. I think the last couple of months, I remember several weeks ago we
were looking at a several-week period. And again, frequency had come down like you say to that – from something
above 4% to something below, in the mid to high 3%. And we were saying, is this the beginning of that? And then the
next week it was back up, so it's really not predictable.
If you asked me six years ago and today, is 4% sustainable? No, but we're going to keep working at it. One of the
things that could help it go in a positive direction, adding gas stations to existing units, not just in the U.S. and Canada,
but elsewhere. We have a couple – two or three of our – in Australia, one or two. I think three and a couple more
coming. We're going to open them up in a couple other countries. Again, it's little relative to the whole pie, but it's lots
of little things. That's one of them. Fresh foods I'm convinced is still going to be a driver going forward. Opening new
warehouses in new markets that are much less saturated markets will help that number. So I think all Executive
Membership penetration increasing will help that number.

What won't help the number is that it's a hard number to sustain. And I'm pleased to say that for 6.5 years we have, and
we'll see what tomorrow brings again. We feel pretty good about what we're doing, and all those things should help.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Yes, absolutely. And I think we all agree like that 3.5% to 4% is sustainable. Did you
see – what were gallonage comps because I think if you look back to past prior to the gas price drop, they were running
mid-single digits. They had I think revved up to about 15%. Have they come back down to closer to 5% in this most
recent quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I honestly don't have that in front of me. We generally don't give that out. We probably – it
comes out occasionally when it went above 10%. I don't think it's above 10%, but it's certainly positive. I just don't
know off the top of my head.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Understood, understood. And then as you think about lapping the gas margin benefit
in the upcoming quarters, I guess you don't guide but you have a lot of positive things going on underneath in the
margin structure, core margins, you're getting better payroll leverage than you had prior. So I guess what's the degree of
difficulty in terms of actually seeing margin expansion as you lap those, I guess, two big quarters where you had tens of
basis points of gas benefit?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Are you talking operating margin?
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Yes.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Look, we're up against – Q4 of last year was the first in a while of outsized gasoline
profitability. It should be pretty good this quarter, but I don't know if we get all the way to – I don't think we get all the
way to where we were last quarter. And then as I mentioned in Q1 and Q2, they were outsized to some extent. Again,
Q3 is not even a factor other than the factor is it's virtually nothing versus it was bigger in those three fiscal quarters. So
that will be a tougher comparison.
Mind you, we've also got hit by it seems like $0.04, $0.05, and $0.06 quarter on FX. At some point, the dollar is going
to slow down in strength and maybe even reverse a little bit. I don't know when and if and when, maybe it's another
year of FX weakness for us first. And but at some point I think that impact will mitigate. So the good news is as some
of these outsized gas quarters have been equally hurt by outsized FX hits just because of the stronger U.S. dollar.
Maybe there are a couple of quarters in there where you get both hits. But as long as we're – we're really worried about
driving frequency, driving sales, unit sales as well. And having good strong membership signups and renewal rates, and
all those things are good. Again, we recognize that looking at some metrics there may be a couple of tough
comparisons in the next several quarters, but that's what we do.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: And then just one last follow-up. You have had 10 basis points to 20 basis points of
payroll leverage these past couple of quarters despite a total reported comp that was hit 600 basis points, 700 basis
points by FX and gas. So your leverage point seems a lot lower now, so should we expect that to continue as you go
against these – the tougher gas margin comparisons? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The only thing – by the way, that 10-plus basis point is payroll and benefits because a
chunk of it has also been healthcare and not this quarter but a couple of recent quarters before this quarter, a little bit of
workers' comp benefit too. By the way, what helps those numbers also is increased foreign expansion. There is a – just
on benefits which is primarily healthcare, medical, dental and vision in a larger extent. There are U.S. versus other
countries, in some countries there is 40 basis points to 60 basis points of delta just on that SG&A item because
healthcare costs into the U.S. are so much higher than everywhere else.
And then payroll, our $22 or just under $22 an hour average in the U.S. we have comparable premiums above other
retail in each country, but in some countries that comparable is $11 or $12, not $22. So increasing penetration in some
of those countries help. So we've got some of those things helping us irrespective of everything else. I think, again, we
focus on payroll and benefits which is whatever, 70% of SG&A, 60% plus of SG&A more than anything. And if we
can drive sales, that helps a lot. And what also helps those numbers fortunately is increased penetration outside the
United States. But last couple of quarters we also benefited on healthcare in the United States as we started to see a few

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Good morning, and thank you, Richard, for taking all those questions. I want to just follow-up
on comments you're making around international margin. We will find out more details in the 10-Q around the specific
performance of Canada and international margins in this period versus the U.S? But just speaking broadly and
historically, you've had a 150 basis point to 200 basis point gap, favorable gap, in your international markets versus the
U.S. As we think about your continued expansion where there may be some impact with cannibalization as we think
about your move into Europe, the relationship that you have with Alibaba, with Tmall or any other external factors
regarding competitive changes or labor cost in some of these markets outside the U.S., how do you feel about the
sustainability of these high 3% to 4.5% margins in those markets? Is that sustainable or do you think that will over time
contract closer to the U.S.?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: If I were a betting person, it's going be higher than the U.S. I think what I've said in the
past is, is that ultimately some of the highest profitable countries will come down a little, but still going be higher than
the U.S. There's just so many moving parts to that question in terms of what. I think when we go into a new country, by
definition we lose money first two years as we did in Japan many years ago. Then when we went from 9 units to 20
units in about a two-year period in Japan, we cannibalized the hell out of the existing units. We've now started to see
that improve and we're going to – the rest of this calendar year we'll open four more in Japan and several more in the
future.
So I think that at least for the foreseeable future we'll see stronger profitability percentages outside of the U.S. But
hopefully we can see the U.S. number improve a little too. But having an increased sales penetration outside the U.S.,
which has a higher than U.S. profitability, should help a little. And again that's why we say that statement in the
beginning of this thing. Whatever we say today we don't have to update tomorrow, until we talk to you again in the
quarter. Overall, I think that those trends will continue. But when we open in a new country by definition, we get hit a
little bit, but it's a little bit on a much bigger company today too.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Understood. And just regarding the store count and growth, I missed some of your comments,
and I apologize, but I know that I think the new forecast for 24 – is for 24 store openings this year with some slipping
into the first quarter. What would that – at this point in time, what would your crystal ball say around fiscal 2016
openings given this slippage, would it still be around 30 store openings as you think about next year?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I would say 30 or low-30s. What's going to happen just like this year, I think if I go
back to the beginning of time we're going to be in the 30s or the low 30s inevitably. Ten or 12 of those are in the last
six weeks of the fiscal year. We're pushing for it. We're trying. Inevitably things happen, whether it's cold weather or
you've got to wait for the ground to thaw out, or some other roadblock with one of the permits to get open. And so there
are lots of different reasons. But when we start, this is kind of our best guess stretch effort and inevitably a few fall out.
I think a few more than we had planned fell out into next quarter, but it's a matter of months. It's not a matter of
reducing something that fell out of bed completely. That happens less frequently. So I think given the 30-plus number
this year came down to an actual 24 gives me a lot more confidence next year's 30, low-30 number is much more
achievable. But if we do 15 to 18, even if we only do 15 in the first four months that gives me pretty good confidence
we'll get to 30 for sure. But for sure is a guess until we get there next year.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Understood. Thank you. Good luck.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, Richard, a couple of things. Just back to the sales, to make sure I'm thinking about this
correctly, your April sales release allows you to kind of calculate the 11-week sales growth number for the quarter was
something like up 0.8% and then the quarter full 12 weeks was up 1.1%. So it seems pretty clear that May started off at
least on a pretty healthy note relative to how trends had been for the rest of the quarter. Is that the right way to look at t
it?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's consistent with what I said at the beginning of the call about the first couple of weeks
of May are just fine.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, good. The other – Executive Membership rollout, you're currently I think in four
countries. Can you remind us how you're thinking about that, what would it take for you to kind of start introducing
that into some other countries?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Needless to say, we like the Executive Membership program. In our view we need at least
a core base of units to do it, because you want to go out there and not just – well the 2% Reward is certainly an
important part of the Executive Membership program. So are many of the Executive Member services and other
benefits. And we need more than a few units to do that. And – but we like it, and if we could have it everywhere, one
day we will. And – but we want to be a little bit more true with more locations in the market.
Certainly in the UK with something in the mid-20s and Mexico in the low to mid-30s number of units, and certainly
Canada and the U.S. With Japan, 20 going to 24, that – just looked at how many unit we have. And I'm not suggesting,
I don't know if we have plans currently to do it, right now our plans are to get much more openings into these countries.
And the country that passed those four with the most units right now is Japan, and that trend will continue. So we'll see.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. And then lastly, just the gas mix in the third quarter, what was it as a percentage of
sales, and what was it a year ago? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I believe it was about – somewhere between 9% and 10% for this quarter. And I'm
guessing, we're looking it up as we speak, but I'm guessing it's somewhere in the 11% range maybe. Maybe 12%? 9%
this year, 11% last year, rounding.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.
<Q - Kelly A. Bania>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First is just housekeeping. I don't know if I
missed this, but can you talk about your membership fee income growth excluding the impact from FX?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. I think, again, dollars assuming flat FX was up 7% for the quarter, which is – I think
– and seven basis points, so overall a good number. I think again, that's partly the fact that sign-ups are doing pretty
good, and partly rental rates continue to be good. And partly, conversions to Executive Member. When I look at all
those components, the one thing that continues to surprise me from a number of years ago, the number of new
Executive Members, which is a combination of new sign-ups and a higher percentage of new sign-ups being to the
Executive Member in those countries, than it had been historically and conversions. So that's continuing to be probably
a little bit number than I would have guessed. Anybody who's wanted it already has it. But I think we're doing a better
job of communicating to the member why it's a good deal.
<Q - Kelly A. Bania>: Got it, that's helpful. And then, Richard, you mentioned organics a couple of times already. Just
curious if you could talk about what the run rate is for that business at this point in terms of dollars that you're doing in

organic foods, and what the opportunity is really. You mentioned supply maybe a little bit challenging. What are you
doing to work around that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: First of all, I think it was about six or nine months ago I had mentioned that it was about
$3 billion up, kind of a double in the past two years. I guess that at least has a four in front of it now, given just
extrapolating that. And probably the challenges are still out there, although they're becoming less formidable because
we like everybody else – there's more organic supply and producers doing it. And we're pretty good at getting out there
and working with suppliers both here and around the world to commit more to it, whether it's raising eggs or ground
beef processing or produce. And so it's going to still – it should still drive sales and drive incremental sales.
I've given a couple of anecdotal examples over the last couple years. One of note was when we have – when we
introduced organic fresh ground beef, 80% of it was to existing members that like us but never bought ground beef
from us, because they're organic ground beef buyers. And so it had the benefit of being incremental – mostly
incremental business to us at a little better margin at a greater savings, versus our competitors, because it's organic. And
so that will continue to be nice, but it's – again, I put it under that category of the good news. It's a lot of different things
and certainly that's one of them.
<Q - Kelly A. Bania>: Great. That's helpful. And then if I could just also ask about produce supply in the quarter.
Some complaining about a tough growing season. Maybe a little bit of impact from the ports. Did you see any impact
from that? And if so is it getting better now or just any color there?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The remarks I always get from our fresh foods buyers are, as soon as something good
happens and something doesn't – something bad happens. The only impact in terms of sales from the port – the port
issue was exporting. We do a great business and Asia is an example and Australia. While a lot of that fresh stuff is sent
on – is air freighted anyway, whatever incremental was required was air freighted as well so it probably impacted
margin a little bit to the negative and supply a little bit to negative overseas. Other than that, I know berries, which is a
big business for us is very dependent on what's going on with weather and crops and that was hit a little bit in the last
couple of months. But notwithstanding that, our fresh margins were actually quite good in the last month or two.
<Q - Kelly A. Bania>: Okay, thanks. That's helpful.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi, Richard. I know the new member sign-ups were impacted by the club openings in Asia last
year, but I guess a little bit bigger question, a bigger picture question, could you give us some insight into the portion of
new member sign-ups that are coming from the younger demographic versus the long-term historical mix at Costco?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I know it's more – I don't have the numbers completely in front of me. In our view it's two
reasons. It's organic and it's a couple of the things we did like Living Social, which was a lot more of that. But actually
our – the gap between our average age member and the U.S. average age has actually been reduced a little bit. I think
we've historically been a couple of years older than the average U.S. And now it's a little bit less than that. So all I
could tell you is it's trending in the right direction. We're not terribly concerned about it at this point. We are seeing
younger people join us and certainly we know that some of the things that we're doing like organic is a part of that.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: That's great because clearly Costco's getting business from other retailers that are hurt by
e-commerce, but you'd think that younger demographic, the millennial might be converting to e-commerce at a faster
rate. So...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, they may be but not everybody's going to sit at home and do everything. I may be in
a small group here but I actually enjoy going to Costco and I know a lot of people do. And it's kind of hard to get gas
delivered to you. And if we can get you in the parking lot, that helps. So ultimately it is value. We recognize that
convenience is a value and we're not the best at some convenience items. We're not going to be the company that

delivers two different cereals to your doorstep at 7 AM as long as you order by 10 PM the night before or soon by 3
AM in the morning probably. But we'll sell to some of those people and more importantly there's a lot of reasons to
come into Costco.
So we have a unique value proposition. I think we benefit while all – first of all, we'll get some of the e-commerce
business in addition to the extent that all of us every brick and mortar loses something to e-commerce incrementally.
We probably lose at least so far a little less incrementally, but we're also gaining incrementally on market share and
other things. So all those things help us. But I can tell you is we don't have our head in the sand but we're not going to –
we know there are certain things we can't do as well. But what we can do really well is value in terms of quality and the
things that we sell and we'll keep doing that.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Yes, it's clearly working. Other question is the 2% Reward impact in the fiscal third quarter,
minus three basis points versus minus 1 basis points in the first half all ex-gas, I'm assuming that FX may be partly
contributing to that because of smaller penetration outside the U.S. but is there anything else that's causing that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That's it. Mind you, any basis point or two hit to that number means an increasing
penetration to that group. Not only new Executive Members but Executive Members shop more frequently and buy
more.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Exactly. All right, thanks.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think they're two of the three Asia countries, Korea and Taiwan I believe.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: And so where does that put you overall in terms of the total number of countries that you'll be
operating in on e-commerce?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We're in nine countries, mind you, one location in Spain and seven in Australia. So we're
nine countries. We currently are in four, so that will put us at six of nine.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Michael David Montani>: Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask about IT modernization. You obviously

we're at in the process and timeline of the rollout?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: A little tongue in cheek, the biggest benefit is we haven't screwed it up. Look, we probably
felt that we should have been modernizing for a number of years. We were really good at keeping stuff cheap and
band-aided. And we also recognize that if we're going to try to double our business in the next 10 years, and that's a
round – it's not a plan, it's just 7% compounded for 10 years is double. But going into more countries and doing more
things, then we need better systems. And because first of all we're going to outgrow – we were starting to see the seams

of some of the existing systems. So first and foremost, it was a necessity.
Secondly, as a very simple example, our membership system, there are two ways you can change your mailing address
or your phone number or anything else, or add on or take off a business add-on member. You call an 800 number, or
you come into the membership desk. Soon you'll be able to do that online. I recognize we're not the first to do that, but
there's a lot of things like that. We think that there's big savings in transportation management, and a lot of little things
like that membership thing. If you think about it, if we've got 40-plus million member households, only a small
percentage of those have to want to change their address or move, or change the members on it, or change a phone
number. And you can think about how many millions fewer of things can be done online instead of talking to
somebody at Costco.
We're seeing some benefits at the membership desk, but we're just rolling it out. So I'd say there's still more cost than
benefit. The big benefits are going to come when we get the depot and transportation management systems, when we
get the buyers on the new system after I'm sure a little bit of indigestion. That's still a year and a half out. That's the
culmination of other modules that are going into place soon. Let me just look here at one other thing.
In service so far, a new payroll system, which is not a big benefit, but it was a big necessity. The membership and
point-of-sale systems are new and there are some efficiencies in the point-of-sale. Both inefficiencies and
enhancements to be able to do all the things we and other retailers are doing with security and things like that, data
security.
Pending again the big ones, the main accounting system will go in next year. Merchandising will shortly follow. And
again, the depot management system will be a little earlier than that I believe. But any big benefits from it will be at
least a year out, maybe more. We're starting to see some little benefits from some of the things we've done. But the big
news is that it's working so far, costing more than we expected, taking a little longer than we expected, but it's working.
<Q - Michael David Montani>: Great, thanks. And then to follow up on categories just for a minute, in consumer
electronics, you guys I think were up a little there, which is impressive given the West Coast port. Can you give us
color on TV units and ASP and just what's driving the strength?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't have that in front of me. I think for the last few months, TV sales have been up
slightly on average in terms of dollars. My guess is, again, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but ASPs have
probably come down a few percentage points. We tend to sell bigger ticket TVs and the newer ones, the bigger screens
as an example. But if anything, I'd guess that the dollar number is in the low single digits, low to mid-single digits. And
the ASP represents a low single to maybe upper middle digit number. And it fluctuates a little every month. I'm sorry,
that's what I can recall.
<Q - Michael David Montani>: Got it, thanks. And the last question I had was just more conceptual, which is if you
think about some of the competitive set and what they've been doing, one change that a competitor has done recently is
rolling out buy online, pick up in club, and it seems to have made a material impact on their business. Can you just talk
a little bit about the puts and takes that you guys would have from a labor model standpoint as well as cross-shop
treasure hunt standpoint of potentially doing something like that?
And the follow-up to that is, another competitor has got a beta test this summer with $50 shipping. I understand that's
Google Express and so forth. But should we expect any kind of direct response to that, or is it wait-and-see in how you
think through those two things?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: There's no current plan for any direct response to it. We do in our business centers deliver
to businesses, not to homes. But again, what we're doing so far is working pretty well for us.
Your one comment or suggestion that the incremental buying when somebody's actually in-store, it's huge. We want
them in store. And when you order online, there's a cost and a convenience in terms of just ordering and picking up.
We'd like not to have to do that, and so there are no plans right now given how we're performing. We always monitor
what others are doing. There are a lot of things that others do from giving away memberships more freely or more
discounted to advertising in newspapers. I'm sure they work, but it's nothing that we want to do at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. Thanks and thanks for letting it go so long. I'll be quick. I just wanted a
housekeeping item. I know you said the renewal rate was 91% in the U.S., Richard?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: U.S. and Canada.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: U.S. and Canada. Do you have the exact number? I know we think it was like 90.7% last
time. I was just trying to understand where the...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's still rounds up to 91%. We try to just keep – it's about the same.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Maybe mills better, but it's about the same.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. Second question, when you do the tech and some of the updates, I know you said the
membership desk and whatnot, obviously the ancillary businesses are going well. But the constant feedback we get
from people, members, is gosh, I didn't really realize Costco did travel or car buying programs or garage doors or some
of the other stuff you guys do. How do you envision maybe getting the word out better to the membership base over
time? And then that's my last question.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think that's a good point. Word-of-mouth is certainly something that we rely on a lot. I
think we do a better job today, even in the Costco Connection. And again, our marketing – the membership marketing
department is starting to test a few things, whether it's on different Internet sites and what have you. But don't expect us
to be paying to go advertise or marketing anywhere. It's working fine for us.
Clearly, travel is one of the best kept secrets out there. It's huge savings, incredible positive feedback from our
members. And I personally hear, both from people like yourselves to friends, when they say they had no idea and they
couldn't believe how much they saved. So we're getting better at letting people know about that stuff, but we're not
going to go crazy. It works for us the way we do it. And the goal is to try to keep getting you in the door, because when
you're in the door you're going to buy a bunch of stuff and see those garage doors and air conditioning units as well.

Your final question comes from the line of Cristina Fernández with Telsey Advisory.
<Q - Joseph Isaac Feldman>: Hey, guys, it's Joe Feldman on. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to follow
up again on the inventory. I know you commented that you did the physical inventory and everything was pretty clean.
But again, this was the first quarter in, like, the past three or four where inventory growth did outpace sales growth, and
presumably some of that's the FX, but I guess I was wondering if you could talk about that a little bit, if there's any
driver there, if there's any one area of the inventory that maybe be a little heavy?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: You know what, it really is across categories. Maybe a little higher in some of those
categories that come by boat, a ship from Asia. By the way, when the slowdown was solved, that was just the
beginning of a two or three-month period of catching up and backlog. And so bringing in some seasonal items, not
having some patio furniture as an example right after – we were fine through Christmas because we, like other retailers,
were able to get some of that stuff in a little earlier than planned. So the good news is I think because we're in seasons
early, out seasons early. We were all a little later, but we were just fine.

I think – I'm guessing again, we'll wait and see until the fourth quarter end. I'm guessing you'll see that trend reverse a
little given – ex-FX, given that some of it had to do with that. We haven't seen any change in markdowns at all related
to the having a little extra inventory as these containers were catching up.
<Q - Joseph Isaac Feldman>: Got it. Okay, thanks, guys, and good luck with this quarter.
Richard A. Galanti
Thanks, everyone, and have a good morning or afternoon.
