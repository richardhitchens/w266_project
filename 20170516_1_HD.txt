Now, before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by
our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the
release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Today's presentations also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our
website.
Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig A. Menear
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $23.9 billion, up 4.9% from last year.
Comp sales were up 5.5% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 6%. Diluted earnings per share
were $1.67 in the first quarter.
We were pleased with the start of the year, as we executed within a more-normalized spring environment and navigated
a tough weather comparison, with weather-driven demand that we saw in the first quarter of last year. All three of our
U.S. divisions posted positive comps led by our Southern division.
On the international front, both Canada and Mexico posted another quarter of positive comps in local currency. The
power of our interconnected retail strategy continues to gain traction in our international businesses, as digital sites in
both countries were recently updated, driving sales growth and positive response from our customers.
Turning back to the U.S., we saw a broad-based growth across our store, as both ticket and transactions grew in the
quarter, and all merchandising departments posted positive comps. Our commitment to new and innovative products
continues to be a contributor of our ticket growth.
Our merchants collaborate with our supplier partners to bring innovative and exclusive items to market that deliver
value for our customers by saving them time and money. As Ted will detail, the extension of lithium-ion battery
technology into the outdoor power category is an excellent example of our ongoing focus on innovation, and we
continue to see great sales in this category.
Another engine of growth for our business is the Pro customer, as Pro sales once again outpaced DIY sales in the
quarter. We recognize that Pro customers have needs that go beyond our traditional in-store offerings, and we believe
that the work we are doing to strengthen our sales support, assortment, and fulfillment for this customer base continues
to resonate. For example, our in-store tool rental business helps our Pros more effectively run their business.
In many cases, a partnership with The Home Depot can translate into business for our Pros, as we can connect to them
with our do-it-for-me customers through our Pro referral platform. We continue to see significant opportunity to help
our Pros manage and grow their business, while driving higher product pull-through and strengthening our relationship
with our do-it-for-me customer.
Another component of our overall Pro strategy centers on Interline and the MRO customer. Use case one, the rollout of
Interline's catalog of products to Home Depot stores, is now live in over 1,500 U.S. stores. We continue to roll out use
case two, which enables Interline customers to shop Home Depot stores using a swipe card that is linked to their
Interline account. Interline sales growth outpaced the company average in the quarter, and we remain very excited
about the opportunity that Interline provides.
The power of interconnected retail creates growth opportunities for The Home Depot. As we invest in this area, we are
seeing a positive response from our customers in the form of improved customer satisfaction scores and increased sales.
In the first quarter, our online traffic growth was robust, and our online sales grew approximately 23%.

Our supply chain continues to be a source of strength for our business. The flexibility and nimbleness of our supply
chain is a competitive advantage. This is particularly evident during our busy spring selling season, when regional
weather conditions vary, resulting in spiky demand patterns. Operationally, nimbleness and flexibility carries over into
our stores. This spring, MET, our Merchandising Execution Team, helped us drive productivity by reducing
merchandising set times by 25%.
In store, associates efficiently manage freight flow within the store, while remaining focused on providing strong
customer service in the aisle. And we hired over 85,000 new associates to ramp up for spring sales, with a simplified
application process, reducing the time it takes to complete an application by up to 80%. The success of our first quarter
is a result of each and every one of our associates. And I'd like to thank them for their hard work and dedication to our
customers. Looking forward, we plan to continue this momentum.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ted.
Edward P. Decker
Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We had a great first quarter driven by continued strength across the store.
Our Pro business was particularly strong and outpaced the company average. We also saw excellent growth in our
online business, as online sales grew approximately 23%.
All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. Appliances, lumber, and flooring had double-digit comps
in the quarter. Tools, electrical, plumbing, decor, and kitchen and bath were above the company average. Indoor garden
was in line with the company average. Building materials, millwork, hardware, lighting, paint, and outdoor garden were
positive but below the company average.
In the first quarter, total comp transactions grew by 1.5% and comp average ticket increased 3.9%. The increase in
average ticket was positively impacted by a number of things, including customers trading up to new innovative
products. Commodity price inflation in lumber, building materials, and copper also positively impacted average ticket
growth by approximately 75 basis points.
Looking at big ticket sales in the first quarter, transactions over $900, which represent approximately 20% of our U.S.
sales, were up 15.8%. A few drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were appliances, flooring, and roofing.
In the first quarter, sales with our Pro customers outpaced the company average, driven by both our high-spend and
low-spend Pros. We saw strong comps in several lumber categories, wire, commercial and industrial lighting, and
gypsum. In addition, the core of the store performed well, and we saw strength in several maintenance and repair
categories across the company. Classes that outperformed the company average included several flooring categories,
tool storage, power tools, and a number of bath categories.
As Craig mentioned earlier, our customers respond to new and innovative products. A perfect example is the customer
response we are seeing with our new lithium-ion battery technology in outdoor power. We've partnered with the best
suppliers to put together a lineup of tools that has the long-lasting power and runtime to get the job done without the
hassle of gas and cords, even with a lawn mower.
Our exclusive assortment of EGO and Ryobi cordless mowers can handle a standard-sized yard with just one charge. In
addition, for those customers that prefer gas power, we've got a powerful lineup led by Honda and Toro that includes
13 of the top 15 rated self-propelled gas mowers on the market. And all of these are retail exclusives to The Home
Depot.
Our spring Black Friday event was a success. Our associates drove excitement around special buys in our stores and
online, and our customers responded. We saw increased traffic both in-store and online, and strong comps in categories
like mix-and-match patio, outdoor power tools, mowers, and chemicals.
We strive to balance the art and science of retail. With our interconnected retail strategy, we are continually improving
the customer experience by striving to create frictionless shopping across all channels. For example, our new simplified

and expedited online checkout process reduces customers' checkout time by an average of 20%.
In addition, we are leveraging our digital assets and big data to better know our customers, and in turn, better meet their
needs to targeted online offerings and localized online experiences. For example, our refreshed mobile app personalizes
the users' homepage based on location, customer segment, and shopping patterns. We are pleased with the customer
engagement in response to these enhancements, and we are seeing increased conversion rates.
Now, let me turn your attention to the second quarter. We continuously introduce innovation and value to save our
customers both time and money. A great example of this is the new PPG TIMELESS exterior stain and sealant. This is
the first PPG-branded product offered at The Home Depot, and it's their most advanced and durable line of wood care
on the market. With enhanced oil technology, improved resins, stronger UV absorbers, and better water repellency, this
product provides outstanding outdoor protection from the elements. PPG TIMELESS exterior stain and sealant is
exclusive to The Home Depot.
Another exciting new product is the Ring outdoor cam with motion-activated floodlight. This is the first high-definition
security camera, with built-in floodlights, two-way talk, automated recording, and a siren alarm. The best part is that
this product is easy to install and connects directly to your mobile device, so you can monitor your property anytime,
anywhere. This product launched exclusively at The Home Depot.
In addition to all the new product offerings, we are gearing up for our upcoming events in the second quarter. Be on the
lookout for our Thrill of the Grill, Memorial Day, Father's Day and Fourth of July events, where we will be offering
more great values and special buys for our customers.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol B. Tomé
Think you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $23.9 billion, a 4.9% increase from last
year. Our total company comps or same store sales were positive 5.5% for the quarter, with positive comps of 5.8% in
February, 4.3% in March, and 6.2% in April. Comps for U.S. stores were a positive 6% for the quarter, with positive
comps of 6.3% in February, 4.6% in March, and 6.8% in April. The cadence of our monthly comps was impacted a bit
by weather and by the timing of Easter this year versus last year. Adjusting for Easter on a like-for-like basis, our U.S.
comps were 2.9% in March and 8% in April.
Two more comments about our first quarter sales growth. First, for activity purposes, we record comp sales when
tender is accepted. And we record sales revenue when the transaction is completed. The difference is known as deferred
sales. Compared to last year, our deferred sales grew by $116 million. As a result, our reported sales growth was less
than our comp sales growth.
Second, versus last year, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by
approximately $71 million. Our total company gross margin was 34.1% for the quarter, a decrease of 9 basis points
from last year. As expected, the modest decline in our gross margin was primarily driven by a change in the mix of
products sold.
For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect our gross margin to decline by approximately 15 basis points from what we
reported in fiscal 2016. In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 59 basis points to
20.1%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth, along with continued expense control.
In the quarter, our expenses were roughly $18 million under our plan, albeit some of the variance was due to timing.
While our expenses grew at approximately 39% of our sales growth rate in the first quarter, for fiscal 2017, we now
expect our expenses to grow at approximately 43% of our sales growth rate.
Our operating margin for the first quarter was 14%, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Interest and other
expense for the first quarter was $241 million, up slightly from last year. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was
35.2% compared to 36.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The year-over-year change in our effective tax rate was

driven largely by a new FASB stock compensation accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2017.
For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.3%. Our diluted earnings per share for the first
quarter were $1.67, an increase of 16% from last year.
Now, moving to some additional highlights. During the first quarter, we opened two new stores in the U.S. and one
new store in Mexico, bringing our total store count to 2,281, and selling square footage to 238 million square feet. Total
sales per square foot for the first quarter were $394, up 4.6% from last year.
Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $13.6 billion, up $390 million
from last year. And inventory turns were 4.8 times, flat to last year. Accounts payable grew by $427 million
year-over-year.
In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 8.5 million shares of outstanding stock. For the
remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding stock using excess
cash, bringing total anticipated 2017 share repurchases to $5 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending
long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 32.3%, 310 basis
points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2016.
To wrap up the commentary on our first quarter financial results, we were pleased, as sales and earnings were better
than we planned. Looking ahead, while U.S. GDP forecasts are mixed, housing continues to be a growing asset class.
And our sales thus far in May have been very good. But relative to our plan, we do anticipate some foreign exchange
pressure.
So, today, we are reaffirming the sales growth guidance we laid out on our fourth quarter earnings call. For fiscal 2017,
we expect sales to increase by approximately 4.6%, with positive comps of approximately 4.6%. For earnings per
share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. Given our first quarter expense performance, we are lifting our earnings
per share growth guidance. For fiscal 2017, we now expect diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately
11% to $7.15.
So, we thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Catherine, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. Good morning. In looking in different markets across the country, can you tell us
if you're seeing a broadening across markets, meaning if there were some of the laggards out there, are they speeding
up? And then are you seeing any moderation in some of the faster improving markets?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: We actually look at the variability of our markets. And in the quarter, our variability
narrowed about 40 basis points year-over-year, which was pretty consistent with what we saw in Q4.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: And that narrowing, I guess, can you elaborate if that's a function of the fast getting
slower, or some of the slower, improving and getting faster?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No, it's really – we're not seeing a big change in the regional sales, other than where we have
some weather impacts.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then my follow up on flow-through, which has been pretty strong and
consistent. And it's a function of both the gross margin and the SG&A. We know the guidance for the rest of the year.
Thinking really towards the end of this year into next year, anything sort of good guys or bad guys to think about that
impacts it going forward? And we know, this year, gross margin a little weaker because of just mixed headwinds. But
as you look out a little bit longer term, are there anything positive or negative we should think about?

<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Simeon, good morning. No, nothing at this point. And, as you know, we have an Investor
Conference coming up in December. And we'll give you a lot more color about our point of view for fiscal 2018, 2019,
and 2020.

Operator
We'll continue on to Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Deferred revenue was bigger this quarter than it's been in the past, recognize that next
quarter. To what degree is that a leading indicator of the business, given the nature of the sales that are in that number?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah. There were three big drivers of the deferred revenue growth year-on-year. One, you've
heard commentary about our dot-com sales growth, up 23% year-on-year. Not all of those sales are completed at the
time that we take the tender. Our dot-com sales now make up 6.6% of our total sales. We also saw growth in our
services business. Our services business grew faster than our company average. And Ted called out flooring as an
example. Those were the two biggest drivers of the deferred sales increase.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Is it a leading indicator for the next few quarters, given what's going into those
numbers?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We would anticipate continued strong growth in those categories.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay. And then my follow-up question is on the e-comm business. Obviously, you're
doing really well through that channel. To what extent is it validating that consumers increasingly want to buy the
home improvement products through the online channel, and subsequently going to expose you to greater and greater
levels of competition?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, I think the interesting thing for us is over 45% of our orders on homedepot.com, the
customer is actually choosing to pick up into our store. So, they're finding it incredibly convenient to blend the
channels and utilize all the assets that we have.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Is that percentage changing at all, Craig? I think you mentioned that it's 50%...
<A - Craig A. Menear>: It's been growing for the past 12 months.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay. Thank you so much.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes.

<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: I had a follow-up question on big ticket comps in the quarter. It seems to be one of the key
bright spots here, where it accelerated up 15.8%, I think you said. You mentioned a couple categories. Do you think
that reflects an acceleration in market share and maybe some of the benefits from company-specific initiatives and the
Pro focus, or how do you balance that with also maybe an acceleration in demand trends overall?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, I'll start and let Ted comment on this. I do think it's an acceleration of the customer's
willingness to spend in big ticket projects. We're seeing strong remodel business with our Pro, but then it's also
categories that we've invested in as well.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Yeah. I'd add to that, that it's really all the above. The customers responding to the product
and the innovation. Certainly, there are some very big ticket items like appliances where we had double-digit comps
again. But across the whole portfolio, as I've mentioned before, we track the purchase patterns from OPP up the line
structure. And we continue to see a willingness and a response from the consumer when we're showing great value on
innovative products at higher price points. And then services is going quite well. Those obviously are bigger ticket
items. And our Pro customer, which here, you get a much larger items per basket, where you're driving a project, and
that's been very healthy as well.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Okay. That's helpful. And then to follow up on gross margin, mix has been the primary driver
of the slight decline. Can you maybe speak to some of the other underlying drivers that you've talked about in the past,
whether it's the productivity and supply chain work, and then the partial offset from investments in price? Are you
seeing a change in the pace for either of those items?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, let's talk about supply chain first. Supply chain did contribute 1 basis point to the gross
margin expansion in the first quarter. That's after 3 basis points of pressure coming from higher fuel cost. Again, spiky
demand that we had the first quarter, we were very pleased with our supply chain performance in the first quarter. In
fact, expenses were under plan. So, that was a good news story. And some of the other drivers, it's all part of the
portfolio that Ted and the merchants run. And it's working just that way we want it.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Yeah.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.
<Q - Keith Hughes>: Thank you. Question on some of the categories, the double-digit categories, specifically,
flooring. Could you just highlight what's – it appears to be well above the industry. Could you talk about what's
working there, what's allowing it to gain share?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Well, we have a nice mix there. The hard surface flooring had been much stronger over the
past couple years. And we've done a lot of work in our showrooms with hard surface flooring, particularly, with tile and
laminate. But recently, vinyl plank has been taking off. So, luxury vinyl plank manufacturers are now putting a solid
core in the product, so you can get much greater use cases of that vinyl product. And the efficacy of it and the look is
getting better and better, and that's selling very well. And then soft flooring, soft flooring is not dead. And we've
simplified a go-to-market model.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Long live carpet.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: And we're seeing terrific strength with our soft flooring categories.
<Q - Keith Hughes>: And you're referring to the whole house installation price? Is that what you're referring to in soft
flooring?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Yeah. Yes.

<Q - Keith Hughes>: Okay. Second question regarding big ticket in general, as referred to, very good in the quarter.
How much did the lumber inflation play into the big number you reported there?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Lumber was a little more than half of that 75 basis points.
<Q - Keith Hughes>: Okay, a little more than half. Okay. And that 75 points, is that on the full-year comp or just on
the growth of the – or I guess it would be the same, actually, on the full-year comp or the growth of big ticket?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: That was only on the average ticket growth for the company.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Right.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: In terms of the performance of big ticket categories, it was more driven by appliances...
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Flooring.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: ...and flooring.

Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Nice quarter. Congrats.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: So, couple questions here. First off, not to be nitpicky here, but if you – just a question on the
cadence of comps in the quarter. So, Carol, you called out in the U.S. business, I guess, adjusted for Easter, March was
2.9%, and then April was 8%. So, as we think about that, I assume that 8% reflected picking up some of the business
that may have been lost or didn't happen in March because of weather. And how should we think about then maybe a
more normalized run rate there?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Right. So, Brian, it was a little choppy in terms of the cadence, and we do think that was
weather. If you look at our transactions, our transactions in March were actually under 1% growth year-on-year, and it
was all weather-related. And when the weather improved in April, the sales came back.
So, we always talk to you about the bathtub effect of the first half. We had a bathtub effect in the first quarter. We did.
And so, as we think now about the first half, we would think that the first quarter will be slightly stronger than the
second quarter. And that the comps for the first half will be about the same as the comps for the back half.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Got it. That's helpful. Then the second question I had, it's probably a follow-up to a prior question,
but with regard to online sales, we have seen a nice tick up here. Craig, you called out, I think, you said 45% of the
online sales now are buy online, pick-up in store.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Right.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: The other point, so, I guess, the remaining 55%. Is there any color you can give on what people
are actually buying online? Has it surprised you in any way? And maybe then there's a comment on the profitability of
those sales versus in-store sales. Thanks.

<A - Craig A. Menear>: Well, let me address the last part, and then Kevin Hofmann is here, who runs our online
business. I'll let him comment on the sales patterns. When it comes to the profitability, it's actually – this whole
customer engagement is becoming a blended element between online and in-store. And the customer is choosing, in
some cases, to start the shopping experience online, they finish in-store, or they might vice versa, start in the store and
actually finish online. And so, with 45% of the orders being picked up, it is truly a blended effort. And we look at it that
way. And our merchants manage it as a total portfolio. So, they see an entire blended mix of sales for the business. And
that's actually how we run the business. So, we don't focus on it individually by itself.
<A - Kevin Hofmann>: And then, Brian, from just a sales perspective, certainly, we see strength across the store. Our
bath business has been doing very well. Our flooring business has been doing very well. Plumbing, power tools, all
doing very well. And not to ignore the core building materials products. We see great [ph] visit traction (30:37) of Pros
shopping online, looking for inventory levels, looking at pricing. And that's been working very, very well for us as
well.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
And Chris Horvers with JPMorgan, please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Following up on just how you think about guidance. So, there was this swoon
in the late summer last year. I was curious if you had any retrospect on what drove that? And as you just think about
modeling the business, is the growth in the market the growth rate, and so, compares don't necessarily matter, or do you
think maybe as we lap through that pause, like it seemed to happen in the late summer, where you would expect to pick
up some extra this year as we approach that?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I think we've all kind of talked this out a lot. We think the Pros went on vacation, and good for
them. They were busy, they got more work than they know what to do with, and they took some time off, and then they
came back hard at work. And to your point, should we ignore compares? I don't think you should ever ignore a
compare but, clearly, there's demand that's being created by this housing market that is very strong. Home prices up
year-on-year over 5%, housing turnover over 4%, and aging housing stock, household formation. We see growth in
private fixed residential investment every quarter. It's still a long way to go to reach back to the mean or 4.5% of GDP.
So, a lot of good momentum in our business.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: So, I guess, then, playing devil's advocate on it, I mean, the compares do ease.
You talked about a pretty normal spring. It doesn't sound like there was any pull-forward into 1Q out of 2Q on the
spring business. So, why isn't this a 5% to 6% growth business through the balance of the year?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: So, a few things. First, as I mentioned, we've got some currency pressure coming our way. We
estimate that currency pressure to be $250 million. Second, it is the middle of May. And it's a little early to start
thinking about listing for the full year. But as I said, sales, so far, in May has been very good.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I think one other comment would be, Chris, that while we had a great indoor garden business
with power equipment, the outdoor garden business in the first quarter really hadn't come alive. And you saw that in the
flatness of our ticket, $50 and under. There were parts of the country where it was pretty wet for people to be out
preparing their landscape for planting, and so, I think that was a factor as well.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: And then my follow up is, if there's anything to – as you think about different
cycles that you've all seen in this business, the traffic number for this quarter, ticket continues to lead, which is very
encouraging, but at the same time traffic matters. How are you thinking about that in the context of the cycle? Thank

you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Ted's got some really great data on traffic. You might want to share that.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Yeah. So, we look at the contributors to our transactions by obviously all the different price
breaks. And as Craig just said, it is an outdoor garden story on the transactions, so to why we'd be a little conservative.
You obviously have to get some good weather into Q2 to drive that outdoor business. Q1 wasn't particularly good or
bad, it was a more normal spring. We are not concerned that there was much, if anything, pulled forward, so we are
expecting that business to come in outdoor garden.
And when you talk about the bigger trends, and we've often mentioned the 40 classes that we track from the prior peak
in 2006, that we still have 12 of those 40 top classes of goods that have not recovered to the peak. So, those tend to be
the much bigger projects, involving a lot of millwork and building materials. So, while we're seeing a lot of strength in
that business and very robust, I called out roofing as a double-digit driver, but that whole portfolio you're generally
looking at adding square footage to get the big project-driven projects, and we're looking forward to that coming.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: That sales opportunity, by the way, is $1.3 billion.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Understood. Thanks very much, guys.

Thank you. We'll continue on to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks so much, and good morning, everyone.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: So, your online business seemed to reaccelerate from the trend that you saw all of last year.
I'm interested in what you think drove that business, whether it was the tilt towards big ticket or changes that you made.
And also, for the past couple of years, online growth has been strongest in the first quarter. It seems almost like the
seasonality is changing. And if you could talk about if there's any rhyme or reason to that, it'd be helpful to understand
that.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, Matt, as you know, this is an area that we've been investing in. And so, I think the
investments that we're making is improving the customer experience. And I'll let Kevin talk about the specifics.
<A - Kevin Hofmann>: Yeah, Matt, we've been very focused on improving the experience across the whole shopping
funnel. And we made a really large site redesign last fall. We upgraded our mobile app substantially, and those have
paid nice dividends for us. From a seasonality perspective, I just think you're seeing core categories that we tend to be
strong in online penetrate well in the first quarter, and that's what's driving the growth.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Matt, if I could add a couple of numbers.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Yes.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: The business were up 15% year-on-year. Our conversion rate increased 13 basis points
year-on-year. So, if your business are up, and your conversion is up, your sales are going to grow. And a lot of that is
because of the site experience improvements that Kevin and team have made.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: That's terrific. If we think about that, I'm sure you have data on customer aging. You can
probably tell from the kind of products that they're purchasing and the kind of products they're engaging in. If we think
about online transactions, is there a sign that the millennial customer is disproportionately patronizing the enterprise
online, or is it more evenly distributed across age groups?

Thank you. We'll now hear from Kate McShane with Citi Research.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Thank you. Good morning. My question is centered around any potential bankruptcies in the
space. And if a bankruptcy were to happen, how does that play out for your business? And how would it change what
you're already experiencing in appliances, if anything?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, we clearly have invested to disproportionately take share in categories that we
overlap with key competitors, who have been having their challenges. And we're going to continue to focus on trying to
capture as much business as we can. It's in categories like appliances, it's tools, hand tools, storage. There's multiple
categories that we overlap in businesses, where we think we can continue to grow share.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: There's an appliance retailer that recently announced store closing...
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Right.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: ...and basically going out of business. And we're seeing sales coming our way in an
environment where they're liquidating the store. It's very interesting.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: That's really interesting, actually.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah, very interesting.
<Q - Kate McShane>: Thank you. And then if I could just follow up, a bit granular. But I know you've highlighted
that millwork is an opportunity but it's still trending below the company comp average. What is holding that category
back? And do you have any expectations on when that comp could accelerate, and what could drive it?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: As I mentioned, these are much larger projects. You can replace an exterior door to refresh
your look or wear and tear. But if you're going to be getting into a number of interior doors, add windows, et cetera, to
your house, you're generally doing a much larger remodel, and one that would likely add square footage to the house.
And we're confident, while that business hasn't come roaring back just yet, it's healthy. But with the price appreciation
Carol mentioned in housing, this is where people are going to be much more confident to invest in their home, with the
confidence that, that investment will be rewarded with a higher home value. So, I mean, very bullish on the state of
housing and the likelihood of these much larger projects getting underway.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Guys, this is really a fascinating, to me, anyway. There are 76 million owned households in the
United States, and of those, there are only 3.2 million that have negative equity in their home. And you go back to
2011, 11 million of those households had negative equity in their home. So, as the analysis shows, that since 2011
homeowners have enjoyed 113% increase in wealth, if you will, coming from home price appreciation, so on average
$50,000 per household. So, you can imagine at some point, to Ted's point, they'll take that value out and do a bigger
[indiscernible] (41:06) total remodel.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: And I think the other part is where there's 3.8 months of supply of inventory and housing on
the market compared to historical norm of 6 months. I think that actually leans into people thinking about remodel
versus move as well.

We'll now hear from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Thanks a lot, and good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: My question's around the Pro business. Maybe you could provide some color on the degree of
outperformance relative to DIY this quarter relative to recent quarters. That would be helpful.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Should I jump in?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Sure.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I'll be happy to jump in. So, our Pro business grew twice as fast as our DIY customer in the first
quarter.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: It was pretty balanced between our big ticket Pro and our small-spend Pro as well.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: That's helpful. As it relates to Interline, specifically, you talked about some improvements
with the use cases, and those starting to roll out and get some traction. As you anticipate the balance of the year from
those use cases and the others you're working on, would you expect a further acceleration at Interline growth?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: We are very pleased with the growth that we're seeing in Interline. And in use case one, for
example, I mentioned that we're at 1,500-plus U.S. stores now and actually seeing sales ahead of what we anticipated
with that. So, yeah, we're excited about the opportunity with Interline, as we go forward.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: The sales growth rate was higher than the company average in the first quarter. It's less than 2%
of our sales, so you can't see it in the top line yet, but we will see it as these use cases gain traction.

We'll now hear from Matt McClintock with Barclays.
<Q - Matthew McClintock>: Hi. Yes. Good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew McClintock>: I was wondering if we could talk about the power of innovation at driving both ticket
and total sales. What product categories would you say over-index on innovation, or what you would call, the benefit of
innovation, to those product categories?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Well, there's actually a ton. I'll call out maybe some of the most exciting and
technologically savvy. But when you look across the entire store – we've got to distribute a monthly report of all the
great new innovative product. And it's fascinating to go through. This is a 200, 300-page report of product every month
that's calling out. It could be lightweight drywall, it could be something as simple as cutting plywood into 4x4 panels to
have that precut item for a project.
But, certainly, on the more techy innovative side, the lithium-ion battery technology has to be one of the largest. We
have a full riding tractor, a Ryobi tractor, available for sale that – I've ridden it. You can cut your lawn on a

battery-powered tractor. Craig mentioned the outdoor power. We have the power and the runtime of gas on blowers,
and trimmers, and hedge trimmers. We've seen it in portable power for many years now, and it's now accelerating in
outdoor power.
And then the second one is LED lighting technology, and not just the individual A-line bulbs, but you're now seeing
integrated LED in your ceiling fans, in your light fixtures. And that's really what's driving our commercial and
industrial lighting that I called out, as having such strong comps. Because now, you're getting that integrated fixture.
You're getting all sorts of really attractive design elements powered by that incredibly thin lighting form factor. But it
goes on. Our life-proof carpet and our pet-proof carpet, where technology enables us to offer lifetime stain guarantees
on the product. So, really across the whole store, just super exciting, great innovative product that customers are
responding to.
<Q - Matthew McClintock>: Thanks for that. And, Carol, if I could ask one follow-up. Just inventory turns for the
quarter were flattish year over year. How should we think about inventory as we progress through the remainder of the
year? Thanks.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes. Well, on an unrounded basis, inventory turns were slightly better than last year. And for
the full year, we're expecting inventory turns to be up year-on-year, a few tenths.
<Q - Matthew McClintock>: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now hear from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Hi. Thanks, guys. Just one more e-commerce question. Have you guys ever – I'm sure you
have, and it's probably been asked. Just to go over it again, what percent – what categories in your store do you think
lend themselves best to online? And in particular, I'm curious about how the appliance business does online. Is that
something that you think can work through that channel? Thanks.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: So, yeah, I think we shared a number of years back that we looked at all of our categories and
had segments of the business that we felt would lean more towards the digital world. Those things would be products
that were smaller cube, more dense, higher value, would lend themselves to that type of business. And so, things like
faucets and power tools, for example.
What's interesting is that we've been in a position to be able to not only grow that business online, but we've also been
able to grow those categories in-store at the same time. And so, that's something that we see as a real advantage in our
business. And then other categories that maybe the customer actually starts online, but they may finish in the physical
world would be things like flooring and kitchens. And so, the research is done there, but many times the customer still
wants to come in and talk to one of our associates and maybe go through some product and questions that they may
have about the process. So, it's really something that we've been watching carefully. But we've been incredibly
fortunate that we've been able to grow both channels really across categories that we think lend themselves to the
online business. [indiscernible] (48:01) customers look a lot online before they actually come into the store and shop.
<Q - Michael Baker>: So, just a follow-up there. Do people actually transact for appliances online? And then the
second follow-up is have you ever quantified, like x percent of your products are in that first bucket of lend themselves
well to online?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No, I mean, customers do go online, and some customers buy online, just like some
customers buy patio online. They're comfortable doing that without living in it. But, again, the majority of our business
in those kind of categories are in-store. And we haven't spent a lot of time trying to quantify.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.

Thank you. We'll go to Alan Rifkin with BTIG.
<Q - Alan Rifkin>: Thank you very much. You said that your average ticket growth of 3.9% was boosted in part by
new product introduction. Curious, like for a given product, what is the duration of like that that can help contribute to
average ticket? And what does the pipeline look like for new products in the future? Then I do have a follow-up.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, it really varies by category on what the cycle is in terms of product innovation.
Historically, you could think about a product in a 36-month kind of timeframe. Today, there's categories that that
cycle's way shorter than that. So, it varies quite a bit.
<Q - Alan Rifkin>: Okay. Thank you. And then, certainly, you got very solid expense growth in the first quarter,
which led you to take the full-year ratio from 49% down to 43% after getting 39% expense growth in Q1, which is one
of your lower revenue quarters. If you take that together with the fact that comps ease going forward, it would appear
that the expense leverage in the following three quarters could even be better than what we saw in Q1, which would
maybe lead to a number that's even below 43%. Is that a correct line of thinking on my part?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Alan, as you know, we put out guidance based on our point of view on the business, and we
always try to do better. If I look at the next three quarters, I would say, the expense growth factor will be slightly higher
in the second quarter, and then lower in the third and fourth quarter, principally because of year-over-year comparisons.
But we do like to put out numbers that we can beat.

<Q - Greg Melich>: Great. Thanks. I had a couple questions, kind of follow ups. Carol, you mentioned that May was
very, very good, right?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
<Q - Greg Melich>: I know, last May, there were some, I think, it was Memorial Day shift that meant you were doing
sort of a 3% or 4% depending on how you look at it. When you say very good, is that a two-year or three-year stack?
How should we think about that in terms of very good and exit rate? Is very good better than April?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I just look at our performance versus our plan.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Always versus the plan.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Always versus plan.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Correct.
<Q - Greg Melich>: And then the second question, maybe sort of a follow up broader speaking, there is a lot going on
in the industry, a lot of change. And, Craig, I think you answered being positioned to help the customer and take that
share. Could you talk a little bit maybe about the positioning in terms of how you work with vendors? It seems like
you're getting a lot of innovation in product, maybe from some of those vendors that might be thinking differently
about there are other ways of getting product to market. Could you help us understand that side of the equation, maybe
Ted as well, especially given online growth, et cetera, as to how the vendors are working with you?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, I'll start with a comment and turn it over to Ted. I mean, this is an area that we have
focused hard on for the past eight to nine years. During the downturn, one of the things that we clearly saw was that if

the customer was going to spend money in 2008, 2009, 2010, it was going to be largely around new and innovative
product. And if that product could help them save time or money, they would definitely step in, even in those tough
economic times. So, this has been a focus that Ted and the merchants have had in a big way.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: We have a huge focus on collaboration with our supplier partners, and we appreciate that
we have to win together. And two things we always want our partners to know is that when they're looking for volume,
there's no better place than The Home Depot. No one is going to drive their volume and their productivity at their
production facilities like The Home Depot. And the second thing, and you notice all the exclusives I called out in my
prepared remarks, no one can launch a product like The Home Depot. And we want to continue working and
collaborating with our partners, driving their volume, and introducing their innovation.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Right. And then, Carol, I have one follow up, bit of housekeeping. What was private label credit
penetration in the quarter? And you talked a lot about strength, consumer from housing, I'm just curious how the credit
dynamics are looking to you guys?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes. We were very pleased with our performance in our private label credit card. The
penetration grew year-over-year by 20 basis points, now stands at 22.6%. And we see that the sales on our private label
card for our Pro, the growth rate was faster than the company average.

Yes ma'am. We'll go to John Baugh with Stifel.
<Q - John Baugh>: Thank you. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Most of my questions are answered, but I was
curious on the Southern division comment being the strongest. Is that due to weather compare, or demographics, or
both?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Well, the Southern division did have the benefit of the $70 million in storm sales
year-over-year in Louisiana. There's still some recovery benefit going on there, so that was part of the driver of the
Southern division's outperformance.
<Q - John Baugh>: And any calendar issues to be aware of, Carol, for the coming quarter or the year? Thank you.
