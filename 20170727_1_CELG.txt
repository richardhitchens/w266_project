Mark J. Alles
Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate the opportunity to
review our second quarter operating results with you and to discuss the meaningful progress we have made advancing
multiple strategic imperatives expected to add to our opportunities for longer-term growth.
Our second quarter results were outstanding and a strong indicator that our constant focus on operating excellence and
innovation has us extremely well positioned to achieve or exceed our full-year 2017 financial targets and continues to
support our 2020 outlook.
Given the significant momentum of our blockbuster medicines and the expanding leverage of our business model, we
are raising our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.25 to $7.35, up from our previous target of
$7.15 to $7.30. Following my comments, Peter will provide a complete review of our Q2 results and outlook for the
full year.
Our multiyear strategy to build, strengthen, and expand our hematology and oncology franchise is delivering and
accelerating. During the first half of the year, we made excellent progress advancing our portfolio of late-stage clinical
trials, which Michael will highlight later in the call.
We continue to expect FDA approval of IDHIFA by the August 30 PDUFA date. This important new medicine will
offer a targeted subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia a desperately needed new treatment option and add a
third product to global myeloid disease franchise.
At the beginning of this month, we significantly enhanced our oncology franchise by establishing a collaboration with
BeiGene and acquiring the rights to BGB-A317, a PD-1 antibody in development for solid tumor cancers. BGB-A317
is a vital addition to our research efforts focused on cellular immunotherapy. It joins our growing pipeline of
T-cell-targeted therapies, including our PD-L1 FUSION program in hematology with our partner AstraZeneca,
JCAR017 for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, bb2121, our BCMA-targeted CAR-T program, and CC-93269, the T-cell
bi-specific antibody targeting BCMA that we acquired from EngMab late last year.
At the same time, we are making remarkable progress in protein homeostasis, deepening our understanding of the
function proteins play in disease. We continue to leverage our scientific leadership in this area to establish new
collaborations and advance key programs. During the quarter, encouraging clinical data in lupus supported the
announcement of CC-220 into Phase IIb development for this large and dramatically underserved patient population.
Our novel cell mod for AML, CC-90009, continues to progress through Phase I development. We are also preparing to
file an IND for CC-92480, a differentiated cell mod specifically designed for the treatment of patients with multiple
myeloma.
To extend and diversify our protein homeostasis platform beyond our current programs in cancer and inflammation, we
recently decided to expand our FORMA collaboration to include a specific focus on neurosciences. This complements
the work we are doing with Evotec to screen our cell mod library across a range of neuro-degenerative diseases. These
programs add to the three INDs filed during the first half of the year and represent just some of the significant
investments we continue to make to build and diversify our high-potential pipeline.

Just four years ago, positive Phase III data for OTEZLA in psoriatic disease supported and accelerated our strategic
decision to build a global inflammation and immunology franchise. Today, Terrie will review how our second quarter
results and accomplishments have OTEZLA, already a blockbuster, well positioned for sustained high growth. Terrie
will also highlight the progress we are making with other potentially transformational therapies in late-stage
development for patients with multiple sclerosis and patients with serious inflammatory bowel diseases.
Midway through 2017, we have achieved or advanced a number of the ambitious goals set at the beginning of the year.
We remain committed to discovering, developing, and commercializing medicines with the greatest value proposition
for patients, healthcare systems, and society. This cycle of innovation provides the fuel for us to build opportunity and
optionality expected to drive our growth now and for years to come. Scott will conclude our call by providing his
perspective on the tremendous progress we are making and by highlighting the significant milestones remaining for the
second half of the year. These are truly exciting times at Celgene.
Thanks again for joining us today, and please welcome Peter to the call.
Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.
Our first half results have been excellent on the top and bottom line. Once again, Celgene delivered great results with
operational excellence, and we continued to invest in our business, most recently through the strategic collaboration
with BeiGene to deliver a novel anti-PD-1 antibody for solid tumors. Growth across the portfolio continues to come
from volume, with strong duration, share and uptake trends.
Our managed care strategy for OTEZLA is beginning to deliver, as Terrie will tell you later. Our continued focus on
operating leverage allows us to raise our full-year 2017 adjusted EPS and operating margin guidance. We now expect
our operating margin guidance to increase an additional 50 basis points to now approximately 57.5%, which drives
adjusted EPS to be in the range of $7.25 to $7.35 per share that Mark just mentioned.
Turning to the Q2 performance, net product sales grew 19% year over year to nearly $3.3 billion. We saw strong
growth across the portfolio, particularly from REVLIMID, POMALYST, and OTEZLA. Volume continues to be the
main driver of our growth, with 16 of the 19 total percentage points of growth coming from product volume. There was
a modest contribution from price, partially offset by foreign exchange. We expect some further foreign exchange
headwinds to continue in the second half of 2017 and into 2018, as we move past our more favorable foreign exchange
hedges from prior years. All of this of course has been anticipated and factored into our near and long-term guidance.
Our performance on the bottom line continues to be strong. Adjusted earnings per share reaccelerated and grew 26%
year over year. The main driver of bottom line growth continues to be operating income, which contributed $0.46 of the
$0.38 per share increase. Financial factors, on the other hand, including tax rate, had a negative $0.08 per share impact.
OIE was negatively impacted by impairments recorded on equity positions, and also hedging-related expenses
impacted the bottom line.
Turning to the P&L, the adjusted operating margin improved 490 basis points year over year to 59.5%. R&D spending
increased year over year, but not quite at the same rate as revenue growth. The timing and pace of clinical activity is
expected to increase in the second half of 2017 as we initiate pivotal programs for key pipeline assets and make
go/no-go decisions for proof-of-concept trials on early-stage assets. We continue to see great leverage from SG&A on
our established commercial and global support infrastructure.
We ended the quarter with $10.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, and we continue to have the flexibility in our
business with strategic collaborations, as we've done in the first half of this year, and to bring value to shareholders
through share repurchases.
To round out the view of our financial performance, we also carefully assessed our return on invested capital
performance. The methodology we use examines our ROIC both including and excluding cash balances in our capital

base. As you can see, our steady growth and P&L performance has consistently increased our ROIC metrics, only
interrupted by occasional key strategic pipeline acquisitions.
Our acquisitions in recent years have focused on exciting pipeline assets that further build our foundation for long-term
growth, success, and returns to shareholders, albeit on a delayed basis given their pipeline nature. The largest of these
acquisitions, for example, is the 2015 Receptos acquisition. Note the ROIC growth since that acquisition does not yet
include commercial contribution or ROIC benefit from ozanimod, which we expect will begin to have a positive effect
in the next few years.
So now let's turn to the 2017 guidance. Based on our operational excellence in the first half of 2017 and our expectation
for this momentum to continue, we are increasing the expected operating margin by 50 basis points to approximately
57.5%. and please note this full-year outlook represents a 250 basis point increase over our 2016 full-year actual.
Additionally, we are increasing our expected adjusted earnings per share to a range of $7.25 to $7.35 per share. Other
guidance items remain unchanged, a great quarter.
Thank you, and I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael.
Michael Pehl
Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone.
The Hematology & Oncology franchise had an excellent second quarter. We delivered a strong sales performance, with
16% year-over-year growth and an impressive 7% sequential growth. In addition, we made great progress with our near
and mid-term pipeline.
REVLIMID continues to have outstanding performance, with increases in share and duration across key markets.
POMALYST/IMNOVID grew significantly through increasing treatment duration across all geographies. Finally,
ABRAXANE remained stable overall, with continued leadership in pancreatic cancer around the globe.
We are awaiting U.S. approval of IDHIFA, our oral targeted IDH2 inhibitor for relapsed refractory AML in August.
We made significant progress in the quarter with our near-term pipeline and future growth drivers, completing
enrollment into four Phase III trials.
We're very excited about our collaboration with BeiGene for BGB-A317 in solid tumors, which significantly
accelerates our solid tumor strategy and broadens the potential of our growing immuno-oncology portfolio.
And finally, we made great progress toward initiating multiple pivotal programs, from marizomib in glioblastoma,
bb2121 in relapsed refractory myeloma, JCAR017 and CC-122 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, luspatercept in
front-line low-risk MDS, and durvalumab in myeloma, MDS, and AML.
REVLIMID sales in the second quarter increased 20% year over year and an impressive 8% quarter over quarter. In the
U.S., we had an excellent 26% year-over-year and 10% sequential growth. U.S. growth in quarter two was mostly
volume-based, driven by further market share increases in newly diagnosed myeloma and the continued increase in
treatment duration.
REVLIMID growth outside of the U.S. was 9% year over year and 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth rate
was impacted by the Russia tender we had in Q2 2016, as we would see twice the same year-over-year growth without
the impact of last year's Russia tender. Year-over-year and sequential international volume growth was 17% and 4%
respectively, driven by the strong increase in newly diagnosed myeloma market share and treatment duration in the EU,
Japan, and Canada.
We've seen over the past quarter some volatility in international sales patterns for REVLIMID. As we have explained
previously, this was driven by distributor buying patterns, including the Russia tender and clinical drug supplies.
However, when we correct for these factors and look at the true in-the-market sales trends, we see the steady progress
of increasing volume and net sales that matches the strong uptake we are seeing in newly diagnosed market share.

The international markets have not reached peak share in the newly diagnosed non-stem cell transplant segment, and
we also have not had enough time yet to see the full impact of duration. In addition, we are just initiating stem cell
transplant maintenance launches in countries with reimbursement, and see reimbursement and uptake of novel triplets
in relapsed refractory myeloma in multiple European markets. All these drivers will ensure continued growth in 2017
as well as through 2020.
We are awaiting the results of our [indiscernible] (15:03) indolent lymphoma trials, including AUGMENT in relapsed
refractory indolent lymphoma and RELEVANCE in front-line follicular lymphoma by year end. We are pleased with
the rapid complete enrollment of our [indiscernible] (15:14) ROBUST trial in first-line ABC diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma, and expect data next year.
Finally, we are preparing to submit an sNDA for RVd in first-line transplant and non-transplant patients in the U.S. in
the first quarter of 2018. The slight delay versus previous plans was due to additional regulatory authority data review
requests.
POMALYST/IMNOVID net sales continue to grow across geographies, with 23% year-over-year and 7% sequential
growth. In the U.S., POMALYST net sales grew 30% year over year and 12% quarter over quarter. As I mentioned
during the first quarter call, the underlying demand for POMALYST in the U.S. is very strong, and the second quarter
saw 7% sequential growth in prescriptions. POMALYST continues to maintain a leading share in third-line patients
and duration is increasing. We believe that the recent FDA approval of POMALYST in combination with
daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma will be a key driver for our POMALYST performance.
Outside of the U.S., POMALYST/IMNOVID continues to grow, with 13% year-over-year growth and 2% sequential
growth. Importantly, international sequential volume growth was 6% outside of the U.S., driven by strong
third-line-plus share and continued duration gains in all geographies, including Europe and Japan. Finally, as
mentioned on our Q1 call, the Phase III OPTIMISMM trial in combination with bortezomib second or later treatment
lines completed enrollment, and we expect data in 2018.
ABRAXANE continues to maintain stable demand overall. ABRAXANE net sales grew 2% year over year and 8%
quarter over quarter. ABRAXANE U.S. sales decreased 8% year over year. U.S. ABRAXANE clearly maintained its
leadership position in pancreatic cancer, but we are seeing the impact of quarterly buying patterns and increasing use of
novel agents in non-small-cell lung cancer and breast cancer. Outside of the U.S., ABRAXANE grew 25% year over
year, with continued growth in pancreatic cancer.
We anticipate multiple growth drivers in future for ABRAXANE. We expect results of the APACT adjuvant pancreatic
cancer trial to be available by the end of 2017, and the pivotal ABRAXANE/ TECENTRIQ combination trials in
non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer will read out in 2018.
We are very excited about the recent announcement of our new strategic immuno-oncology collaboration with
BeiGene. As outlined in our press release, we are acquiring worldwide rights outside of Asia excluding Japan to
develop and commercialize BGB-A317, an advanced clinical stage PD-1 inhibitor for solid tumors. We believe that
BGB-A317 is potentially differentiated and provides us with the ability to combine a checkpoint inhibitor with our
broad immuno-oncology portfolio in order to accelerate the development of best-in-class I-O combinations for multiple
solid tumor indications.
BGB-A317 complements our growing I-O solid tumor portfolio, enabling us to target selected tumor types through
activating T-cells and macrophages, enhancing T-cell function and depleting inhibitory T regulatory cells.
In hematological malignancies, we feel that the I-O portfolio of Celgene is equally uniquely positioned through our
existing IMiDs and future cell mods, our ongoing FUSION PD-L1 development program with our partner AstraZeneca,
our accelerating CAR-T and bi-specific T-cell engager programs against BCMA and CD19, as well as the opportunity
to activate macrophages in T-regulatory cells in targeted malignancies.
In summary, we had another great quarter for the Hematology & Oncology franchise. We had excellent sales
performance and we achieved many key clinical milestones. Near-term growth drivers are in place. We are expecting

U.S. approval of IDHIFA in IDH2 relapsed refractory AML in August. And we are actively working with commercial
payers in the U.S. to ensure patient access to IDHIFA immediately following approval.
For REVLIMID, we are just at the beginning of our stem cell transplant maintenance launch and are awaiting data by
year end for our two Phase III trials in indolent lymphoma. We completed enrollment in four Phase III trials for
REVLIMID, luspatercept, and CC-486, and we are preparing to initiate pivotal programs for many additional assets by
the end of this year.
Finally, we're working to maximize the potential of BGB-A317, a single agent in combination with targeted agents,
chemotherapy, and our novel and differentiated I-O pipeline assets through our comprehensive global solid tumor
development plan that we look forward to sharing with you in more detail later in the year.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Terrie.
Terrie Curran
Thank you, Michael, and good morning.
Q2 was an outstanding quarter for Celgene I&I, highlighted by significant sequential growth for OTEZLA. Q2
OTEZLA performance indicators continued to strengthen and market share and prescriber adoption increased
significantly in both U.S. and internationally.
We announced positive results from RADIANCE, our second Phase III trial for ozanimod in MS, and are on track to
file the U.S. NDA by year end. We are very pleased with the progress of the program and look forward to the data
being presented in an upcoming major medical meeting. Additionally, progress continues for GED-0301 and other
important pipeline programs.
Global OTEZLA net sales for Q2 were $358 million, which represents growth of 49% year on year and 48% versus Q1,
revenue being driven by continued gains in treatment adoption, geographic expansion, and improved market access.
With reimbursement now secured across key European markets and Japan, uptake is accelerating rapidly. Ex-U.S. sales
have more than doubled versus last year.
In addition, we have advanced multiple future growth drivers for OTEZLA, namely initiating enrollment of the Phase
III scalp psoriasis trial and completion of enrollment in both Phase II study in ulcerative colitis and Phase III trial in
Behçet's disease. As a result of continued strong commercial execution, we anticipate continued revenue growth
through the second half of the year and expect full-year revenue to be in the lower half of the guided range.
In the U.S., OTEZLA experienced a rebound in revenue, underpinned by strong brand fundamentals. We saw an
increase in script volume and continued to command a significant leadership position for new-to-brand share in both
psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Additionally, while it is early, we're pleased to see accelerating growth in the plans we
have contracted with to remove biologic step edits.
In two markets where OTEZLA was recently launched, France and Japan, uptake is already exceeding competitive
benchmarks. In France, we achieved a differentiated access position that enables physicians to prescribe both within
and beyond the hospital setting, resulting in OTEZLA surpassing all recent launched analogues in the category.
In Japan, unlike biologics, OTEZLA can be prescribed by community dermatologists, which is fundamentally
disrupting the treatment paradigm. In just three months since launch, OTEZLA has gained 38% of new-to-brand switch
patients in this setting.
Now turning to ozanimod, the global multiple sclerosis market is substantial, with a current value more than $22
billion. As of 2016, oral therapies represented nearly 40% of the market value, and that segment is expected to continue
to grow, fueled by the introduction of ozanimod. Today the market is composed of multiple blockbuster brands.
However, each therapy is associated with significant tradeoffs. Substantial unmet needs remain for an oral therapy that
balances efficacy, safety, and tolerability.

We're highly encouraged by the results we've seen in both the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE pivotal trials for ozanimod
in RMS. The studies achieved efficacy endpoints demonstrating improvements in annualized relapse rate, the number
of T2 and gad-enhancing MRI lesions compared to AVONEX. Safety and tolerability findings are consistent with prior
studies and continue to support a differentiated profile. Disability progression versus AVONEX was not significant due
to a lower rate of progression across both treatment groups in the trials. As a reminder, no oral therapy has
demonstrated a disability advantage versus an active comparator to date.
Ozanimod has the potential to offer a unique combination of high-end oral efficacy with a favorable safety and
tolerability profile versus established disease-modifying drugs. Given its emerging clinical profile, we expect ozanimod
to compete broadly for market leadership.
In summary, Q2 was a quarter of significant advancements and strong growth in the I&I franchise. OTEZLA continues
to gain momentum in the core segments of our business while accelerating geographic expansion and driving future
lifecycle growth opportunities. We remain focused on progressing our next-generation growth drivers, ozanimod and
GED-0301, and look forward with anticipation to multiple data readouts in the next 12 to 24 months.
Thank you for your attention. I'd now like to turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Andrew Smith
Thank you, Terrie.
As the team just highlighted, we've made tremendous progress against most of the key milestones we identified at the
beginning of the year. The growing momentum across our businesses and increasing leverage inherent in our operating
model has us well positioned for the remainder of 2017 and beyond.
Coming off 20% year-over-year growth and a $2 billion quarter, we are expecting numerous catalysts over the next
nine months to propel REVLIMID's next wave of growth. These include the ongoing launch and reimbursement in key
geographies for the transplant-eligible maintenance indication, data from our AUGMENT and RELEVANCE trials in
lymphoma, and the sNDA submission of RVd in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, targeted for the first quarter of
2018.
Additionally, we have completed enrollment in Phase III studies across six distinct diseases and five different assets
during the first half of 2017. Three of these trials involve new therapies, CC-486 in AML as well as luspatercept in
MDS and beta thalassemia.
In the coming weeks, we expect FDA approval of IDHIFA, our targeted therapy for patients with IDH2 mutated AML.
Last week I was with our partners at Agios and our hematology commercial teams. They are energized and ready to
launch. IDHIFA will be our eighth commercial product and first of what we expect to be many products originating
from our collaborative research model.
We are seeing tremendous momentum in our I&I franchise as we continue to expand the utilization and access of
OTEZLA globally. Importantly, the first half of 2017 saw the delivery of two positive pivotal trials for ozanimod in
RMS as well as continued strong execution of our pivotal IBD programs, GED-0301 in Crohn's disease and ozanimod
in UC.
While our teams around the world are focused intently on delivering our near-term objectives, we continue to invest to
grow our business for the long term. In the next five months, we plan to initiate pivotal programs for a number of
potentially transformational novel late-stage assets, which are expected to drive our growth through 2030.
Importantly, the BeiGene transaction provides us with both a local commercial partnership for China and a PD-1
inhibitor already in advanced clinical development for various solid tumor indications. BGB-A317 will be a
cornerstone for novel immuno-oncology combinatorial development across our portfolio of assets. The deal is expected
to close by the end of the third quarter. We are very excited about the opportunity for BGB-A317 and our entire I-O

Operator, please now open the line to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey, thanks. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to ask on the BeiGene
deal, of course new recently, and how that might change your interest in not only your early-stage assets for I-O but
potentially looking externally as well. So I guess maybe you could expand a bit on the clinical strategy for BeiGene and
whether or not you have sufficient assets here to develop a big enough I-O platform. Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, Michael. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So let me start by saying that we are really
excited about having the opportunity to develop this asset, as it is extremely well characterized. It's in late-stage clinical
development, and more than 500 patients have been treated. And it may also offer the opportunity, at least from
pre-clinical models, to be differentiated, and clinical data will show that.
We think we have a great opportunity to use this asset to bring forward our I-O strategy and our solid tumor strategy.
As we think that through deep translational work and understanding of the tumor but also the immune system, we will
be able to come up very tailored and very thoughtful and logical combinatorial therapy. In that sense, I think our
pipeline is extremely well positioned, as we cannot just go for activating T-cells. We can also alter T-cell function. We
can go after T-regulatory cells. We have the opportunity to activate macrophages. And then, of course, we are really
working heavily on cellular immunotherapy. So what we think is that we have all the ingredients for a very thoughtful
and science-led approach and going into the right patient segments with the right combinatorial approaches.
What you heard us saying is the plan that we are starting to work on is going be very comprehensive. It will have
monotherapy, combinatorial approaches where we're also, of course, looking into potential targeted therapies,
chemotherapy, and thoughtful I-O/I-O combinations. We're not ruling out any combination at this moment of time, but
we feel we are extremely well positioned with the pipeline that we're having.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: So just to follow up, do you think by ASH we would have a plan laid out for what studies you
had started and the timelines on that?
<A - Michael Pehl>: I think we are confident that we can provide a very thorough update to you at ASH, yes.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Perfect.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Michael, hi. It's Mark. Just to follow a little bit on Michael's great description of where we are
and what we're thinking, it's very clear that this year so far, the PARP class has become really well established in
multiple solid tumors as maintenance therapy, for example, in ovarian cancer and some other really encouraging areas.
When we think about the ability to take BGB-A317 into all of our internal combinations that Michael spoke so nicely
about, it's very clear to us that the landscape for combinatorial work across multiple parties, including now the PARP
class, comes into focus. So we're looking forward to closing the deal. As Scott pointed out, we're not yet closed, but I
do think by the end of the year we'll have a comprehensive research approach that is fast to market, differentiated, that
learns from everything that's going on today, even today, and that clearly mechanisms like PARP will be included in
that program.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Thanks, I think you mentioned it. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas, Ph.D.>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask you a little bit about
CC-220's strategy in lupus, and now you've announced I think CC-122 in MS. Maybe give us some thoughts. I know
lupus is a really hard market, but give us your thoughts on the data. And what gives you the confidence that Phase III
will be successful and how you think it could be positioned in this space? Thanks.
<A - Terrie Curran>: I think CC-220 is a novel oral immunomodulatory compound. I think lupus, there's a large
unmet need for – there really are no treatments in this area. I think if we look at the clinical data, we're very encouraged
by the Phase IIa program. It really was a dose-blending study to look at three escalating doses, and we're really
encouraged by the results that we see in all of the components of the trial there, and very pleased that we're now
moving into Phase IIb.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: So if I can just comment as well – thank you, Terrie. That particular Phase IIa study was
quite data-intense. We looked at a number of different endpoints from a number of different angles. It was very
encouraging across the board. It's an early study, but we certainly saw activity on a number of different endpoints, and
we're very encouraged by what we saw. There seemed to be coming out of that Phase IIa study a nice benefit/risk
profile. All the them need to be confirmed in later-stage development, and so we're moving there. But you're right. It's a
very complex disease but one in which there's tremendous unmet medical need, and I think we have some pretty
exciting initial data.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Your line is open.
<Q - Christopher Raymond>: Thanks, just a two part question I guess on REVLIMID ex-U.S. So it looks like you're
guiding to French reimbursement in front-line use this quarter. I'm just curious if you could clarify. Has there been a
measurable expanded access program? And could we expect any true-up for that once the reimbursement is
formalized?
And then maybe an extension of that, you give a really nice chart of patient share progression in the front-line
non-transplant setting, but I think you said before and I think you said on this call that Europe is still a big duration
opportunity. Could you maybe provide some detail there? What's the average duration in the U.S., and what's the gap I
guess between Europe and the U.S.? Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, Raymond. This is Michael. Thanks for the question – Chris. Starting with France, before you
get reimbursement, there is some access opportunities in France, but they are limited, so by no way comparable to a
situation where you have a price and you can promote.
So we see some very limited uptake at this moment of time in France, but of course we expect a very marked change
once reimbursement has been gained. We are confident that we can achieve this in Q3. We are working very closely
with the payers. Of course, it's a large segment, and we have I think very constructive discussions about that. So the
slide that you, by the way, also saw is a composite, and it has France in there without reimbursement at this moment of
time. So we think that's going to change very nicely once we have achieved that.
When we're thinking about treatment duration, which is another major opportunity, we are at this moment of time
roundabout 14 to 15 months in Europe. And just don't forget, the change of treatment duration of REVLIMID as
compared to second-line is something that needs to build up over time. So we're been launching one to two years ago
starting with Germany, and then we got other reimbursement countries. What you see with the 14 to 15 months is still
very much driven by treatment duration that we traditionally saw by second-line, and we need to overcome this once

the countries have been getting reimbursement in order to get to these longer treatment durations that we see in the U.S.
Our treatment duration is way above 20 months.
The other key element, just to round it, is the triplets, which of course are much more used in the U.S. at this moment
of time. But Europe is picking up, and we got reimbursement of triplets in a couple of markets, so we're going to see
this effect coming in Europe as well. Over time, I think treatment duration will become very similar.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Porges from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Thanks very much for the question and congratulations on the very strong results. I have a
question for Peter or perhaps Scott. Spectacular operating margin performance in the quarter and the guidance going
out to high 50%. And when we look ahead, you have two CAR-T programs, two checkpoint antibodies, multiple
programs in new indications such as inflammatory bowel disease. Are you confident that you can maintain your
operating margins at this range and still fund all those opportunities, or should we be cautious about that outlook?
Thanks.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Hi, Geoff. It's Peter. Let me take it. First, I'll talk to the financial outlook, and Scott maybe
can add some comments after. First of all, thanks for the question.
And I just would remind everybody that we really made a focus on building the pipeline. And in all of our projections,
we've indicated while it's not precise that we would seek to have research and development as a percentage of revenue
be roughly maintained as we roll forward. That's a high priority for us, and of course we add to that all the other
external collaboration efforts with all our portfolio partners. So if you think about it and you think about our guidance,
let's say just through 2020, and obviously it can go beyond that, we're seeing very stout, very strong high teens at least
top line growth. So it means our R&D budget is growing at least that fast as we go forward.
Additionally, we have talked a lot about that we've got 18 late-stage trials that are wrapping up and reporting out. And
while there's certainly some carry-forward work in a lot of those programs, it's not quite the same scale probably as
spend. So in a sense, we have some of our existing R&D budget probably opening up.
So I think we are very comfortable, quite frankly, in being able to support all the programs that you mentioned and
others. I think that the ones you mentioned are obviously very high profile, highly visible. I would say that a lot of
work that Rupert and the franchise have been doing just a little bit earlier when I commented on actually opening up
pivotal trials and so forth, it is really exciting for us going forward.
I think we'll continue to see nice P&L leverage from SG&A. Obviously, you've seen that already, and that's while
we've been building out the I&I commercial footprint in Europe and now also in Japan. And so obviously, the leverage
we get is tremendous. And while we still have more build-out in the GI space and MS, I think the math will work that
the G&A leverage and the leverage of our existing commercial infrastructure will allow SG&A to continue to be very
efficient.
And then obviously as we get to the back end of the decade, you might start to see a little bit of additional cost of goods
as a percentage of sales as we launch some of our newer PARPs because some of them, as you know, are proteins or
oligonucleotides or CAR-T and so forth, and they may have slightly higher cost of goods. We've put that all into our
guidance and certainly feel very comfortable that certainly through 2020 and beyond we're in great shape on margin. I
do think we probably got to the high-50% in Q2 a little faster than we thought. But as I mentioned, we do expect to see
a little step up in R&D, the pace of spending, let's say, in the second half. All of that's been factored into our guidance.
So thanks.
I think overall, it's an exciting time. I think we are building up capabilities at the same time as we're executing on these
programs. We've made a lot of key additions to our organization, and we feel very good about everything from the

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric Schmidt>: Thanks. I think this might be for either Scott or Michael. I think it was Scott who said he'd been
spending some time recently with the folks at Agios. So this question is just on the upcoming approval of IDHIFA. Can
you give us a sense of the size of the market opportunity there and what your approach might be on commercializing
the drug? Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: So thanks for the question, Eric. We really wanted to start with our excitement about the ability to
bring our first partnered asset from our distributed research model to approval and also, by the way, our first asset with
a companion diagnostic. The other thing that of course is very exciting for us is the fact that relapsed refractory AML in
particular is a patient population where their medical need is very high.
Talking about the patient population in specific, IDH2 mutated relapsed refractory AML is our starting point patient
population, so the relapsed refractory AML population that exists, and around about 10% to 15% of these patients have
this mutation. And the way to move forward from a strategic standpoint here, apart from of course having a great
launch in a patient population with a high medical need, is in parallel developing IDHIFA in first-line AML. Now
different to relapsed refractory AML, this is going be a combinatorial strategy. We have two Phase II trials ongoing,
one with 7+3, the other one with VIDAZA. They're going to both read out by the end of the year, and that allows us
then to make decisions about our future development program.
The true commercial opportunity for this asset is really in this population and through long treatment duration. But it's
great to have this very first exciting step for those patients with monotherapy in relapsed refractory AML, and we're
very confident about our launch preparations.
<Q - Eric Schmidt>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike King from JMP Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael G. King, Jr.>: Good morning, guys. Let me add my congratulations on the solid execution, another
question regarding growth in duration of therapy. I just wondered if – I know it's not your product, but the ASPIRE
label for KYPROLIS and the improvement in PFS that was seen over VELCADE, just wondering about your thoughts
about perhaps uptake of KYPROLIS in more early-stage regimens, triple combinations, and what effect that may have
on future duration? Thank you.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, this is Michael. I think this is an interesting question in the context of the fact that in the U.S.
in particular but now also in Europe, triplets are really gaining a lot of traction. And of course, not all triplets are
created equal. If you combine an IMiD with a proteasome inhibitor, that serves certain patient populations. If you
combine an IMiD with an antibody, other patient populations may be served well.
I think as a general comment, what you can achieve by combining an IMiD with either a proteasome inhibitor or
antibody goes way beyond what you can achieve with doublets, positive for patients, but then certainly also positive for
us as a company because REVLIMID treatment duration increases big time. And the same, by the way, is true if you
combine pomalidomide with other assets.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoff Meacham>: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question, and I also want to offer my congrats on the quarter. Just
on ozanimod in MS, I wanted to get any updated perspective that you guys have on the commercial strategy.
Obviously, we're going to see data later on this fall, and I suspect you're going to probably have the ability to talk a
little bit more openly about it. But I just wanted to get what's on the critical path commercially pre-filing? And then
when you think broadly about the MS opportunity, Biogen just recently discussed having value-based pricing, so
maybe just give your perspective on the long-term pricing in the market. Thanks.
<A - Terrie Curran>: Thanks, Geoffrey. So I think first of all, we're on track to file by the end of the year. I think
from a market opportunity, we really do see the MS treatment paradigms favoring increased use of oral therapies, and
there is an unmet need for MS indication for an oral therapy that's both efficacious and tolerable. And what we see is
that ozanimod may offer a differentiated profile that balances efficacy, safety, and tolerability relative to oral therapies
that are currently in the market.
So this feels like a space that really is the sweet spot for Celgene. There's a small prescriber base. About 3,000
physicians in the U.S. prescribe 80% of treatment. So what's on the critical path for us right now is really establishing
both our medical and our commercial organization, engaging with the market access folks, and looking at our pricing
strategy. Clearly, it's too early for us to define our pricing strategy. We're going to watch closely as the market evolves
over the next 12 months to determine what will really maximize the value of that asset but also maximize the position
in treatment for ozanimod.
<Q - Geoff Meacham>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Salim Syed>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. And this is another question
on ozanimod, following on Geoff. Previously, you guys have guided to $4 billion to $6 billion for MS and UC, with the
vast majority in UC. So if I'm interpreting that correctly, assuming the midpoint, you'd give UC about $3 billion and
MS $2 billion. TECFIDERA does $4 billion. I'm just wondering. Are you guys being conservative in your guidance
here, or do you plan on updating this at some point, just your thoughts on that, please? Thank you.
<A - Terrie Curran>: So we see $2 billion to $3 billion in each of the indications. I think if you look at the emerging
data in both MS and UC, we really do have not only a novel compound but a differentiated compound, both being oral
as well as having a unique balance of safety, efficacy, and tolerability. So at this point in time, obviously we're
continuing to assess the competitive landscape, but at this point we're continuing to guide to $2 billion to $3 billion for
each of those indications.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Thanks you, Terrie. This is Scott. Again, the original guidance, to reinforce what Terrie
was saying, was we were thinking $4 billion to $6 billion in total, relatively equally divided between the two
indications ahead of Phase III data. We believe as we move also positive data and move into Crohn's, that could be
upside from the $4 billion to $6 billion that we talked about earlier. That $4 billion to $6 billion was simply UC and
MS. And as we hopefully move forward into Crohn's as well, that would provide upside to the model.
<Q - Salim Syed>: Great, thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on ozanimod. So based on
your read of the Phase III data, do you believe you will have a differentiated label from GILENYA?
And then also, around that topic, it sounds like you won't have a renewed focus on neurology. So what's your focus for
future BD strategy around building a neurology business? Thank you.
<A - Terrie Curran>: Okay, so maybe I'll answer the first part, Ying Huang, regarding differentiation. Then I'll ask
Scott to focus on BD, or Rupert.
So I think if we look at the Phase II data, and you'll see in more depth the Phase III data later this year, I think we see a
profile that really is differentiated, being a specific S1P1. We're really seeing that come to light in terms of the both the
tolerability as well as the safety profile across a number of different parameters. So yes, I think we'll clearly be very
well differentiated versus GILENYA.
<A - Rupert Vessey>: Hi, this is Rupert Vessey. I'll talk to you a little bit about earlier neuroscience efforts. So where
we are with this right now, our initial steps have been to build a small and highly competent neuroscience team. We
believe that the platforms that we have inside the company, which are clearly very focused around immunology –
you've heard a lot, [ph] mostly you were there, at least many of you were at our (49:34) deep dive on protein
homeostasis. These are core elements of neurogenerative diseases. And what we're doing is setting up the appropriate
collaborations through business development activities to look for opportunities that we may already have that can be
taken into these areas of great unmet need.
We're also, of course, pursuing strategies that are more conventional in terms of business development to look to build
out nearer-term opportunities, and that's an ongoing and active process, and I'm sure you'll hear more from us over
time.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: And this is Scott. Just to add on to the comments, we feel very, very good about the data
that's emerging for ozanimod and looking forward to getting it out. We believe that it provides an anchor for our neuro
franchise in the future, a good anchor product, multiple potential indications. But the first indication in MS we think
we're going to have when the data comes out, we think we're going to have the right kind of value proposition to really
have an anchor in that business and then look for other opportunities to continue to build, as we always would.

<A - Michael Pehl>: Hi, this is Michael. Thanks for the very good question. The starting point of the positioning of
course is the clinical data, and you also have the very positive results that we've been showing at ASCO. You can't get
any better than a 100% response rate in a partially penta-refractory population. And many of these patients have CR, so
even a MIB-negative disease.
So the starting point for the development of CAR-T is definitely taking the late-line population that has no additional
treatment option. We are at this moment of time going into an expansion phase with bb2121 with the dose that we've
been choosing, and we feel we can go right into a pivotal program.
There is more opportunity, of course, for this asset when we're thinking about patient segments in multiple myeloma
that are currently underserved, for example, patients who are relapsing very fast after standard therapy, for example,
patients who have a genetic profile, risk patients. And those patients usually have a life expectancy of three to four
years. Those are patients to think about.
At the end of the day when you think about curing a patient population, you need to go into the first-line population.
We're thinking about that as well. We will be very selective. There is a huge effort ongoing to really making sure that
we can define high-risk patients in a way that regulatory authorities are going to appreciate the effort, but we feel that
there is a role of this technology in the first-line setting as well.
Our bi-specific antibody is really complementary to this effort for a couple of occasions. You need bridging therapy for
CAR-T patients. You need to bring the initial cell count down before you can go CAR-T. You may not achieve a CR
but only a PR, and then you can use bi-specific antibodies. So these different assets are very complementary, and they
don't exclude themselves. There's certainly a population of elderly, frail patients where CAR-T may not be an option,
and a bi-specific antibody may be optimal. So we're really thinking very, very comprehensively.
I would just add when we're looking at BCMA as a target, which is a great target, it's not always thinking about options
by excluding themselves. I think what the whole field is showing, the combinatorial approach is often the approach that
makes the most sense, and that's what we have in mind.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: The other comment that Michael and I would make – it's Mark – is when we think about the
antibody, the flexibility of the antibody beyond just myeloma, because we know that this antigen presents itself in
several blood cancers for the antibody, would provide us a therapeutic option for CAR-T would likely be limited to
myeloma. But the antibody could have a lot more application across multiple blood cancers.
<A - Patrick E. Flanigan III>: Great. So, Crystal, we're bumping up against the hour here. I know there are multiple
other conference calls that are going to start. So we have time for maybe two more callers, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and fitting me in. I wanted to
follow up on the recent BeiGene collaboration. You mentioned a couple of times on the call that you believe this asset
could potentially be differentiated based on pre-clinical findings. So I was wondering if you could talk about the
characteristics or the data you've seen that give you the confidence to make that statement.
And then just along those lines, do you see any enhanced opportunity here with this morning's news on the MYSTIC
trial? I assume it's too soon to say too much on that front, but I figured I'd still ask anyway. Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: Great questions. Starting on the molecule, and I think we've been really choosing our words very
carefully, as we said, potentially differentiated, and this potential differentiation is really based on pre-clinical
observations. This asset has a silent Fc receptor that may actually lead to less interaction with inhibitory immune cells
or other immune cells that you don't want. In pre-clinical models, there is an advantage, but this needs to show in the
clinical models.

What's really exciting for us and why we feel that our whole program can be differentiated is two things, and that also
refers to MYSTIC. A), the breadth of our pipeline, which is not just including T-cell activating agents, but we have
many, many other opportunities including cellular therapy to go after the patient populations that we want to go after.
And B), and I think that's a bit of learning of MYSTIC, we really need to make an effort to fully understand which
combination should go into which patient population and how we can better predict as to which other patients are really
profiting from the therapy. PD-L1 may not be the sole answer here. I think this later point is nicely shown by the
FUSION program that we are running where we really have a deep translational effort, and that's exactly what we're
going to do with BGB-A317 as well.
So I personally believe that while it is great to have a pre-clinical hint to differentiation, the true differentiation comes
through the translational program and the combinatory approaches that we're going to use.

wanted you to talk a little about the luspatercept opportunity coming up with MDS and beta-thalassemia, and then
maybe the potential opportunity to leverage your sales force, rest of world as well. I feel like we're heading into the
next six or nine months where we'll get data there. Thanks.
<A - Michael Pehl>: As you know, I'm a huge fan of luspatercept. I'm always saying this. But I think we have created
a wonderful starting point with two fully recruited Phase III studies in a later-line MDS, low-risk MDS population
where we have a nice marker to identify those patients who have the highest likelihood to respond and in beta
thalassemia starting with patients who are transfusion-dependent. And we're going to get these top line results by the
middle of the year.
And we really see this as a starting point for this asset, because what we are trying to do in the second half of this year
is a couple of things. A), we've been showing to you data in an early-line low-risk MDS population which look really
intriguing and, by the way, also intriguing in RS-negative patients. So what we're just doing at this moment of time is
we're recruiting some of these patients so that we can make a pivotal decision for an early-line low-risk MDS study,
which we call COMMANDS, by the end of the year. That offers a huge opportunity for us.
Second big opportunity that follows in beta thalassemia is of course the non-transfusion-dependent patients, and we
will look forward to that.
Third big opportunity is myelofibrosis, where we saw really intriguing results with a system molecule. We want to
repeat this and have a really good translational program and also combinatorial approach so that we can make a pivotal
decision on myelofibrosis by the end of the year. If only some of these opportunities are hitting, luspatercept is going to
be a huge drug.

So this is Peter. Thank you, Michael, and thanks, everybody on the call, for the great questions, a fantastic quarter. We
delivered outstanding results in the second quarter and have great momentum to finish up the year in great shape. But
even more important for all of us in the room here, while we continue to drive great top line growth, great bottom line
growth, and P&L leverage, we are also significantly advancing our pipeline and executing on key strategic initiatives
that really set up the platform for long-term growth through 2020 and into the whole next decade. And I think you can
see a lot of questions we had today, quite frankly, are about the assets that are going to drive us past 2020 and really
create a tremendous growth story for us, and that's what we're all working hard on.
