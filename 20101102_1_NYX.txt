With that, let me turn the call over to Duncan in Paris.
Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Stephen, and good morning, everybody. From a rainy Paris, thanks for joining today's call. We appreciate it.
I'm going to start on Slide 3 entitled Third Quarter 2010 Update, and I would start by saying that we're very pleased
with the progress we made in the third quarter executing against our long term strategy. In this quarter, we made
tangible progress on our goals of operating the most meaningful capital markets, creating broader and deeper networks
and delivering innovative products to our expanding client base. Our business model continues to diversify, and we are
focusing on new initiatives and growth areas to deliver value for our shareholders through all sorts of business cycles.
For the quarter, we recorded EPS of $0.46 per share on net revenue of 599 million, down from $0.53 on 620 million in
net revenue in the prior-year period. The strengthening of the dollar year-over-year reduced our net revenue by 25
million and EPS by $0.03. Hoping to dampen the negative impact of currencies, this 31 million in incremental revenue
from new businesses, highlighting the continuing diversification of our model, which I will touch on in more detail
later.
Our Technology business continued to show great growth, and benefited from the addition of NYFIX and expanding
customer base and improved software sales, driving increased revenue and operating margins. And the business hit
several milestones with Qatar and the Tokyo Stock Exchanges, as well as a large East European stock exchange signing
up to do business with us.
The next stage in the growth trajectory for this business will be a combination of co-location revenues, and follow-on
technology sales from these co-locating clients.
On the Cash and Listing side, we are continuing to see strong demand for our listing venues in terms of transfers, new
listings and secondaries. Year-to-date through September, 13 companies have transferred to the NYSE from other
exchanges with a total market capitalization of over $40 billion. A total of 78 issuers have listed on NYSE Euronext
markets, raising total proceeds of just over 17 billion, including nine Chinese companies that raised just under 1 billion.
Important to note that this success has continued in October and even in early November, where we've already had two
listings from Asia two days into the month. NYSE Euronext is also the leader year-to-date for proceeds raised through
global secondaries with a total of 370 issuers raising total proceeds of just under $150 billion, which also included the
largest secondary ever done, Petrobras, which raised 25 of the 70 billion that they raised in the U.S. markets.
On the Cash equities trading side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability. In the U.S., our market share
in the third quarter is up across all three tapes year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. In the Europe, our share has
remained relatively stable at 73%. SmartPool continues to show some strong growth, and we continue to believe that

over the long-term we will see growth in the overall European market.
Lastly, the results in our Derivatives segment were mixed, with continued growth in our U.S. options businesses
helping to partially offset negative currency and lackluster volume trends in our European Derivative business
year-over-year. The combination of lower volatility and the heightened prospect for a second round of quantitative
easing has clouded the outlook for interest rates and inflation, which has reduced the need for hedging over our NYSE
life platform, and resulted in trading volume declines compared to the elevated second quarter levels.
To close on Slide 3, let me just touch briefly on a few selected business highlights for the quarter. I am most pleased to
report that our NYPC DCO filing with the CFTC is now complete, and we entered the 90-day comment period
yesterday. Additionally, we have been discussing with the SEC the necessary rule filings that will govern the
cross-margining agreement between NYPC and DTCC's FICC division, and we expect to formally submit that filing
later this week and get the clock ticking on that comment period as well.
Pending these regulatory approvals, we anticipate the launch of NYPC, and the simultaneous launch of U.S. Treasury
in Euro/Dollar futures on our NYSE Liffe U.S. futures platform in the first quarter of 2011. The CFTC, SEC and
Federal Reserve have demonstrated a high degree of coordination throughout this comprehensive review process, and
we are grateful to all the agencies involved for their substantial efforts, especially in light of the challenges they all face
with the Dodd-Frank rule-making processes. We will continue to work closely with these regulators through the
remaining phase of the regulatory approval process, which we expect to end sometime in February of 2011.
I'm also pleased to report that we have successfully completed on time our multi-year plan to build two state-of-the-art
liquidity hubs in the U.S. and U.K., which I will let Dominique speak to later. Within our Technology business, we are
seeing building momentum as we move forward with our goal of 1 billion in revenue by 2015. We delivered the UTP
platform to Qatar in the third quarter, and we are beginning work on the derivatives exchange there as well.
More recently, as I mentioned earlier, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and a large Eastern European stock exchange have
chosen NYSE Technologies to build trading platforms for their respective exchanges. Our operating margin for this
business crossed the 20% threshold for the first time, showing strong progress toward our goal of 25% to 30% margins.
Lastly, in the third quarter we bolstered our Listings franchise with the acquisition of Corporate Board Member, a
premier provider of director education programs, and as I alluded to earlier, we have a great pipeline of IPO prospects
and transfer prospects from other exchanges to NYSE Euronext.
Please swing to Slide 4. Slide 4 is the slide that you've seen before where we outline and highlight our 2010 priorities
for our various business segments. Our objective is to leverage our global infrastructure and scale, support our
businesses and our customers' businesses and create a community premium for our shareholders over time.
At the center of the company in support of our three segments is UTP, our globally integrated and scalable trading
platform, an unrivaled global connectivity network and customer gateways; a focus on clearing, which will take on an
even greater importance in the coming quarters; and two brand new world-class data centers. We put this slide up every
quarter to remind you of what we're working toward, and now that we are coming to the end of year, it is really
designed to show you what we have accomplished this year. I think you can put check marks next to most, if not all of
the items on this slide.
Slide 5, focusing on execution. On Slide 5, we provide you with a summary of the major initiatives that we have
underway for each of our segments. In addition to these points, we also have many more new initiatives on the drawing
board to ensure that we have a pipeline of new initiatives ready to come online in the quarters ahead to bolster our
business model, and to grow our franchise. I think most of the stuff on Slide 5 is familiar to all of you, and we'll touch
on a lot of what we haven't already in our remarks later in the presentation.
On Slide 6, we try to show the revenue contribution of our new businesses, which reflect the increasing diversification
of our model. The $31 million in incremental net revenue generated by our new businesses help dampen the impact in
externalities, including foreign exchange and lower capture of volumes in selected markets. This incremental revenue
came from a variety of sources, including NYFIX, which is annuity-like due to the nature of the revenue model for that

business and the stickiness of the channels; the re-insourcing of clearing and verticalization of our NYSE life business
in Europe, which occurred in late July last year; Technology Services revenue from Qatar; and lastly, a small amount of
incremental revenue from Corporate Board Member in the quarter.
In the current quarter where we faced significant headwinds, including foreign exchange, neutral to declining volumes
and capture across selected markets, we were still able to record a solid $0.46 in earnings on 599 million of revenue.
This compares to, just for note, $0.43 in the EPS that we earned about six quarters ago in the first quarter of 2009 on
basically the same amount of revenue, slightly higher, 605 million.
Now why do we mention that because it's sort of a random comparison? The reason I thought that was interesting is
here we are six quarters later with the currency against us on a comparative basis, U.S. volumes down 50%, our capture
in our European business down 40% because of price cuts we've made in response to competition the last few years, yet
our earnings are higher on a similar revenue base. Hopefully, that begins to tell that we're well on the way on this
journey to transform the company and be a much more diversified company, who is much less reliant on volumes in its
core businesses.
Turning to Slide 7. We have a significant number of regulatory and legislative initiatives, both in the U.S. and Europe.
I'll take care of the U.S. side, and then turn it over to Dominique for the European side.
In the U.S., we have intensified our regulatory advocacy in numerous ways, speaking not only on our own behalf, but
for investors, issuers and the markets more broadly. For instance, we've been an active participant in CFTC and SEC
rule makings to implement the Dodd-Frank Act. We've participated in agency round tables on derivatives regulation,
met weekly with agency staff and commissioners on both derivatives and Cash market issues and built coalitions with
industry participants wherever possible.
We've also spent countless hours with the SEC and CFT staff as they produced a very thoughtful and thorough analysis
of the May 6th market turmoil. And in speeches, meetings and commentary, we continue to be a strong advocate for
needed market structure reforms, including increased transparency, enhanced market surveillance and the banning of
flash orders. We've also increased our advocacy on macroeconomic issues, like job creation and economic growth, by
providing our experience and that of our thousands of listed companies to officials at the White House, in the Treasury
Department and on Capitol Hill.
Finally before I turn it over to Dominique, we wanted to make sure we address the ArcaBook issue, which came up
again last week. If people want to get into this more in Q&A, we can. Larry and I are prepared to answer any questions
about that, but let me just give you a quick summary.
This is referencing a rule filing that was approved by the SEC in 2008. We began charging these fees for market data in
early 2009. Remember that in the Dodd-Frank Act, these market data filings are all effective upon filing, and then they
can be suspended by the SEC within 60 days.
In this case, and the case of many other filings recently by our competitors, so far none of these have been suspended.
This one has been appealed. The court who approved the appeal did say we have to improve the competitiveness and
some of the economic support for the market data filing, and we're working on that actively. And again, we can get into
that in Q&A if anybody would like to, but remember that under the new regime that you will see more market data
filings like this. They are effective on filing, and so far none of them have been suspended.
So at this point, sticking on Slide 7, I will turn the call over to Dominique, and he will handle the European piece of the
regulatory landscape, and then update you on a number of other issues ranging from our data center launches to some
additional insights on our Technology services business. Thanks. Dominique?
Dominique Cerutti, President and Deputy Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Duncan, and good morning, everyone. So Slide 7 continuing, and turning to Europe. Regulator had been
also very busy dealing with issues related to markets virtual and financial regulations.

European policy makers are working on this comprehensive review initiative with the European Commission due to
issue of broad public consultation in November, and this will culminate in [inaudible] proposal in the second quarter of
2011. And as a part of this review, the E.U. will be working closely with U.S. counterparts to develop a common
approach to the regulation of high frequency trading.
Derivatives regulation is also a key issue in Europe, as it is in the U.S. The European Commission issued a proposed
draft of EMIR, which stands for European Market Infrastructure Regulation, and also on talks on legislation on
September 15th, and this legislation is currently going through the European parliaments, and the necessary process is
expected to last through most of 2011.
The European Commission has introduced the concept of financial activities tax and a financial transaction tax, FTT in
Europe. This was done in parallel with the working document on financial sector taxation. As we have stated
previously, we are not in favor of any form of possession tax and we will advocate this due on behalf of our
shareholders and various clients.
Lastly on Europe, we expect to see some proposed legislation on several other items in fourth quarter of 2010 and first
quarter of 2011, like corporate governance, market abuse, transparency requirements for small capitals.
Turning to Slide 8. I'm pleased to report to you that we have now officially launch our two new liquidity hubs, and on
this slide we have provided an updated timeline on where we go from here. We have successfully completed on time
the build-out of the two new data centers, and having spend many years, as you know, in the technology sector, I can
confirm that this is a tremendous acquisition.
As I look back at the history of the technology space, there are very few examples of such large-scale migration
[inaudible] in size trading market and they cut across all asset classes. And we are able to get that done because of the
decision and hard work of our global technology staff, and I thank them for their support. It's another clear
demonstration, I think, that we can execute against our strategy while controlling our costs.
So let me summarize where we are on Slide 8. In the U.S., our NYSE market completed its migration to Mahwah on
August 25th. In Europe, our Cash market completed their migration successfully to Basildon on September 27th, and
the NYSE Liffe derivatives market migrated yesterday on November 1st, so that's all done.
On the co-location business, in the U.S., about 97% of the pod is sold out, and in Europe the rollout of the new cabinets
are progressing on schedule. And the ramp, co-location revenues should build as we enter 2011 and we should hit full
stride with third quarter 2011 billings.
The next set in the migration process, as you can see, is for NYSE Arca Markets to migrate to Mahwah in the U.S. and
that's scheduled for the end of first quarter 2011, and as we complete the migration process, as we begin retiring
obsolete data centers with MetroTech and 55 Water Street and then our New Jersey data center. In Europe as well,
where we have also multiple data centers, we will begin the rationalization process and ensure that we have adequate
capabilities in both U.S. and in Europe.
Let me move to Slide 9 with key deals. An example that NYSE Technologies have closed or are closing, so thanks to
strong investment and strategic acquisition, we now own an unrivaled range of technology assets, including the main
one, our state-of-the-art Mahwah and Basildon data center, our best of class Universal Trading Platform, also called
UTP, a world class safety network and leading buy to sell side communication and protection with NYSE and intensive
green market data product.
And then as I said, we are building our capabilities to provide our clients with a consolidated process and services
offering. Our strategic vision is to focus and concern by both market trends and the recent various deals we are
receiving from clients and prospects [inaudible] to absorb their infrastructure. And Slide 9 provides examples of them.
We fully integrate the value of existing assets, transactions infrastructure, data services and products when building
service platforms either through partnerships with other venues or as a solution provider supplier.
On the top left side of the chart, for example, to this global tier one bank, we would provide a full solution from
generating to delivering and management so that NYSE Technologies is now established as a tier one service provider.

Just below on the left side, is U.S. buy side. We've provided a fully consolidated managed trading platform, and that's a
good example of data services that would make sense.
We already talked in the middle of the chart about our partnership with Qatar Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange and
the large Eastern European stock exchanges that we just closed. We can see Warsaw Stock Exchange, and they showed
effectively a platform in terms of asset classes, geographic and regulatory environment.
We are developing real strategic partnerships that are helping assess a full range of solution. Bottom of the chart and
more commentary on market data solutions. An example of the market data administrating service we provide with this
most major global bank illustrates that we have the ability thanks to a very wide range of market data products with a
strong specific requirements that matter from historical or real-time data platform on-demand to fully managed services
across asset class generation. And the development of this strategic deal will guide, as we said recently, our growth to
ensure that we achieve our ruling objective with the same time reaching our margin target, which should be between
25% and 30%.
With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Mike for a review of the financial results.
Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Vice
President
Thanks, Dominique, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter.
Total revenues for the quarter were 1.1 billion, which was down 9% percent year-over-year and 16% versus the second
quarter. Net income and diluted EPS are up year-over-year, down compared to the second quarter of 2010, reflecting
the slower trading volume environment we experienced in the third quarter. This quarter we reported a 25 million
charge for merger expenses and exit costs, with more than half related to exit costs for our data centers.
Last year's merger expenses and exit costs of 8 million were principally for severance. As we have stated previously,
the data center related exit costs for legacy systems and platforms is expected to reduce dramatically after this year.
This quarter we also recorded a deferred tax benefit of $21 million related to the reduction of U.K. tax rates from 28 to
27%. The drop from 28 to 27% is the first step by U.K. tax authorities to lower the U.K. tax rate to 24% in the coming
years. In the prior-year quarter, we reported a $4 million net pre-tax gains from asset disposals primarily related to the
sale of our stake in BM&F Bovespa.
Our review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs,
the deferred tax benefit just referenced, as well gains from disposal activities. Slide 11 provides a detailed look at our
financial results for the third quarter. Excluding merger expenses, exit costs, deferred tax benefits and asset sales,
diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.46, down 13% versus the prior-year $0.53. Year-to-date EPS of $1.64 is up 12%.
These results include a positive $0.02 EPS impact, while a reduction in our effective tax rate from 27.5 to 26.5% as a
result of the adoption of favorable tax laws in the Netherlands. We expect to have an effective tax rate of 26.5% for the
remainder of 2010.
Our focus for 2010 is revenue growth and margin expansion, and while the third quarter was challenging, we are
pleased with the progress on both fronts thus far. On a constant dollar basis, year-to-date revenues are up 5% and
margins have improved from 32% to 34%. These three results were negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar.
Operating income was 180 million, down 8% compared to the third quarter of 2009.
At the time of the launch, we stopped capitalizing interest expense related to the build-out of our data center in the
U.S., which increased our net interest expense for the quarter by 1 million to 26 million. In the fourth quarter, we will
no longer capitalize interest expense for our U.K. data center, which will increase our net interest expense by an
incremental 3 million.

The average weighted diluted share account increased slightly in the current quarter, driven by the vesting of LTIP
grants. We expect the share count to remain at 262 million shares for the remainder of the year.
With a largely fixed expense base, we have significant operating leverage on incremental revenue and volume growth.
Leverage, however, cuts both ways and that's what we experienced in the third quarter.
Slide 12 provides our segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar weakened this quarter versus prior
year for both the euro and the British pound. For the third quarter, 48% of our net revenue was denominated in either
euros or pounds. Currency impact was unfavorable 25 million versus prior year, and a favorable 7 million versus the
prior-quarter. On a currency neutral basis, third quarter net revenues were flat, and operating income declined 2%
versus the third quarter of 2009.
Operationally, revenues for our Derivatives segment were flat, and the Technology segment grew 26% versus Q3 prior
year. Trading and Listings revenue declined by 6%, attributed to the lower U.S. volume and lower revenue capture in
Europe.
On Slide 13, we show our 2010 year-to-date net revenue split by business activity and segments in comparison to the
prior-year period. The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base, which has helped dampen the
impact of FX and volumes in the current quarter. 49% of our net revenues were generated by transactions and clearing
fees through the first nine months of 2010. This is in line with prior year, although this year's results include the benefit
of Liffe Clearing, which was acquired in July of last year.
You saw the contribution in Technology Services show the most meaningful increase, with specific gains stemming
from NYFIX both in our SFTI Europe network and recent software and infrastructure sales.
Turning to our segments. Cash Trading and Listings comprised 49% of our net revenues. Year-to-date, the Derivatives
segments remains our fastest growing segment, contributing 34% of our net revenues, up from 29% in 2009, followed
by the Technology segment, which grew from 14% to 17% of revenues. Again, this is consistent with our revenue
guidance and where we have invested in new initiatives. Though not shown on the chart, 52% of our Q3 net revenues
originated in the U.S., and 48% Europe.
Slides 14 and 15 detail the financial performance of our Derivatives segment. I'm not going to go through these slides
in great detail, but simply touch upon a few points. Net revenues were 188 million in the third quarter, a decrease of 10
million or 5% versus Q3 prior year, and down 38 million or 17% from the very strong second quarter of 2010.
Adjusting for foreign currency impact, net revenue decreased 2% versus prior year third quarter. The decrease versus
the second quarter of 2010 was driven by volume declines in the overall market, NYSE Liffe and U.S. options from
elevated second quarter levels.
The average net rate for contract for NYSE Liffe derivatives, excluding Bclear, was $0.67 per contract in the third
quarter compared to $0.75 in the third quarter of 2009 and $0.64 in the second quarter of 2010. The decline versus the
third quarter of last year was due to a stronger dollar, as well as business mix in the third quarter of 2009, which
resulted in lower liquidity payments during that period.
The increase versus second quarter was principally due to the weakening of the dollar. Rate per contract in the U.S.
options was $0.17 per contract in the third quarter. This is down versus the prior year, but up slightly
quarter-over-quarter. The reason for the decrease year-over-year is largely attributed to an increase in penny-pilot
issues created on NYSE Arca, and minor pricing changes which were offset by market share gains. Our global
Derivatives segment margins declined to 49% in Q3 from 53% in the prior-year quarter. Derivatives accounted for 43%
of our operating income.
Similarly, Slides 16 and 17 show you the financial performance of our Cash Trading and Listing segment. Cash
Trading and Listings net revenues was 298 million in the third quarter of 2010, down versus the both the prior-year
period and sequentially.

Net transaction revenues, adjusting for foreign currency, were down 6% versus Q3 2009. This was attributed to pricing
reduction in European Cash in 2009, and lower overall market volumes in U.S. Cash, partially offset by a 9% increase
in average U.S. net capture and higher market share across all venues for U.S. Cash Trading.
Market share in our four European markets was down slightly to 73% in the third quarter from the second quarter
levels. Revenue capture for U.S. Cash trended up to $0.0313 per 100 shares, in line with expectation and recent trends.
Revenue capture for European Cash was $0.66 per transaction versus $0.90 in the prior-year. The decline in the
European pricing was attributed to the stronger dollar, prior year price reductions and a less favorable mix.
As previously announced, we have redesigned and simplified the pricing for our European Cash trading offering
effective November 1st. We will eliminate the distinction between agency and principal trading, and we will implement
other changes that more align us with our European regulators – with other European regulated exchanges.
Operating margin for Cash Trading and Listings segment was 34% in the third quarter, consistent with the third quarter
of 2009. Slide 18 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment.
Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was 113 million in the third quarter, an increase of 19
million or 20% from Q3 prior year. On a currency neutral basis, revenues were higher by 26%. The increase was
primarily driven by NYFIX acquisition, growth in SFTI clients, delivery of UTP to Qatar and some large software
infrastructure sales.
Revenues were 6 million or 6% higher than Q2. Operating income was 24 million, a 100% increase to prior year, and a
20% increase from the second quarter of 2010. Operating margin was 21% compared to 13% in the third quarter of
2009. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%.
With our data centers now live, we will be focusing on migrating clients and markets into our new liquidity hub.
Co-location revenues will begin to accelerate, and reach their annualized level in Q2 2011.
Slide 19 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. We're continuing to make excellent progress in
lowering our cost base in real terms, while funding incremental investments to grow the business. As expected, Q3
expenses were above second quarter levels as we began to appreciate the new data centers.
As we're adjusting for negative impact of a weaker dollar, and for incremental data center integration spending, fixed
costs were just 4 million above Q2 on an apple-to-apples basis. Third quarter operating expenses were down 7 million
versus last year on a reported basis. However, after adjusting for FX and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures,
such as [inaudible] and new initiatives, fixed operating costs were down 26 million or 6% in the third quarter of 2009.
On a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, year-to-date fixed expenses were down 97 million or 8% compared to the
prior-year period. We continue to make good progress and are focused on efficiency and productivity improvements
that will further reduce operating expenses for NYSE Euronext in the coming years.
Slide 20 provides you with some FX sensitivity for our annual expense guidance. In March, when we provided fixed
cost guidance for 2010, of 1.723 billion to 1.768 billion, we indicated that this guidance was predicated on the average
FX rates for 2009 of $1.39 for the euro and 1.57 for the pound. Based on recent currency moves, we now estimate full
year 2010 currency rates of around 1.34 for the euro and 1.55 for the pound, from which you derive a currency adjusted
full year 2010 fixed expense guidance range of 1.707 billion to 1.749 billion.
Based on fixed cost developments through the three quarters of the year, and a year-to-date spend of 1,253 million, we
now expect our full year 2010 fixed expenses to come in below the low end of the currency adjusted range.
We remain committed to our 2011 objective of reducing constant dollar, constant portfolio of fixed expenses below
1,650 million. 2010 acquisitions, such as Corporate Board Member and NYSE Blue and our May announcement to
build two new clearing houses in Europe are incremental to this guidance.
In the third quarter, 61% of our operating expenses were nominated in dollars, 19% in euros and 20% pounds. Our
staffing level as of September 30th was 3,030 full time positions, which is 337 positions or 10% below year end levels

and include 34 staff from our recent acquisition of Corporate Board Member.
Duly indicated, we do expect costs to rise in the fourth quarter largely due to the migration into our new data center,
investments in our new European clearing houses and launching of interest rate futures in the U.S. The weaker dollar
also increased costs, which is more than offset by the beneficial impact on European revenue.
In addition to the integration and transition costs, we began depreciating the due data centers, which added incremental
depreciation of approximately 4 million in the third quarter of 2010 and an incremental 10 million will flow through in
the fourth quarter. Over time, this will be mitigated as we exit our legacy data center.
Slide 21 details our cash and deposition at the September 30th, 2010. Total debt was 2.5 billion, cash-marked securities
totaled 0.4 billion and net debt was 2.1 billion. 2.5 billion of debt included 2.1 billion of long-term debt, the weighted
average cost of 5.3% and the remaining 400 million short-term debt consisted of commercial paper at an average cost
of approximately 0.5%.
Through nine months, we have spent 244 million on capital expenditures, including 106 million related to our data
centers. We expect our capital expenditures to decline significantly over the next few quarters to more maintenance
levels. We will provide more guidance for the outlook for CapEx at our Investor Day in March 2011.
We also paid a net 126 million in Section 31 fees to the SEC this quarter, reflecting the usual payment of the eight
months of these pass-through charges. At the end of September, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.25 times, up
from 1.9 times at the end of June 2010, but still down from the 2.6 times at the end of 2009. The increase in leverage
ratio in Q3 was due to the seasonal effect of the payment of Section 31 fees I referenced earlier and other cash
outflows, including the second quarter Qatar payment and the weakening of the dollar at the end of the third quarter,
which increased debt in dollar terms by 150 million. We expect our debt-to-EBITDA to move lower in fourth quarter as
cash flows improves.
NYSE Euronext is currently rated A+ by S&P and A3 by Moody and we are now on stable outlook with S&P.
Continue to operate within our long-term target leverage levels and we are committed to continue to invest in our
growth and return excess cash flows to our shareholders. Last week, the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend
for the fourth quarter of 2010, which is payable on December 31st.
With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks and then we'll take your question.
Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thanks, Mike. Just to wrap it up before we open it up to questions, I have a quick overview. Obviously a quarter with
very challenging market conditions, but I come away from the quarter pretty optimistic and very pleased with the
progress we're making on our multi-year strategy as we endeavor to create a global capital markets community. I think
the decisions we've made in the past few years to acquire other businesses are now generating incremental revenue and
that's more than helping us offset the negative impact of things that we don't control, like the currency and the volume.
I also think that this was a quarter where we're beginning to see the results of our diversification efforts, as it's clear that
our business mode is much better position than it was in a few quarters ago, this revised period, like the one we're in
right now.
And I think as we look forward to 2011, with all the things that Dominique and Mike had just touched on in terms of
initiatives coming on the back of the data centers. You combine that with the anticipated launch of interest rate futures
and the launch of New York Portfolio Clearing in 2011, I think we're very optimistic that we've got some built-in
growth drivage for next year, even if the volume environment remains where it is. I think if you asked us as a
management team, we're cautiously optimistic that 2011 will look a lot brighter. It's hard for us to imagine that people
will just continue to stay out of the listed equity and derivative markets to the degree they have in the last few months.
The other thing I liked about our data centers, as I think it is, they're very representative of how we've been able to
change the culture of the company. This is a much more innovative company that it was a few years ago; it's a truly

globally integrated enterprise now. And I think these data centers, which really more act as liquidity hubs for our
community strategy going forward, I think will prove to be the cornerstone of that technology services growth story
that we've talked so much about in the last few quarters.
So all in all, thank you for listening. We think it's a very good showing given the conditions and we are increasingly
confident going into next year and about our abilities to effectively meet the ever changing needs of our ever-expanding
customer base.
With that, that concludes our formal remarks and we will open the line for Q&A. You've got Mike and Larry in New
York and you've got Dominique and you've got me here in Paris. Noellia?

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Harris from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Daniel Harris>: Hi, good morning, guys. How are you doing?
<A>: Good
<Q - Daniel Harris>: I wanted to go back to the NYPC commentary that you made; you guys are in the comment
period now and obviously looking forward to a 1Q launch. Can you tell us operationally sort of what are you doing
behind the scenes with the people that have expressed interest in becoming members or participating on this exchange
to get them ready for the launch? And what are you seeing in terms of 1Q in terms of what their concerns are, how
they're planning on using the system?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Great question, Dan. It's Duncan; I will take that one. So first
and foremost, we've been operating under the assumption for the better part of this year that we would eventually get
out for comment. So a lot of the spade work has already been done on building out the infrastructure and working with
clients to make sure we've got all the connectivity wrinkles ironed out. Now having said that, given that the
preapproval, the pre-comment period was somewhat elongated, you would understand that a lot of the clients have said,
we get it, we understand what you're trying to do, we're supportive. Given all their other technology priorities,
remember we just asked them all to migrate to new data centers in Mahwah and Basildon in the last couple of months,
they've said to us, okay, we've got it, we know what's going to have to be done, let's really get focused on it once you're
out for comment because now we know the clock is ticking.
So a lot of the membership application work is done, the technology work with our sales in DTC has been working
anticipating an earlier launch than this, so that's not going to be a problem. And now I think what we will start to do as
we start to go through the comment period is actually do the work to test the connections, make sure everything's clear.
Remember that most of these clients are already connected to NYSE Liffe U.S., that's not going to be the issue; this is
just a new product over that connection. It's just getting the linkages from those companies, middle offices, back into
NYPC. So everyone knows what has to be done; my guess would be that work will start in earnest now that we're out
for comment.
<Q - Daniel Harris>: Thanks, Duncan.

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Rutschow.
<Q - Rob Rutschow>: I wanted to ask about – we've talked quite a bit about the U.S. data center and the build-out
there; I wanted to ask about the European data center. First, I was hoping you might be able to give us a little bit of an
education on what the competitive landscape looks like for high-frequency trading and for proximity hosting prior to

your build-out of this data center and what your capabilities looked like before you built this and what they look like
now. And then what the pipeline for high-frequency trading looks like in Europe and whether or not there's going to be
any regulatory or tax changes for the Cash businesses as you consolidate everything in Basildon? Thanks a lot.
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Yes, thanks for the question. This is Larry. I think it's safe to say that both high-frequency
trading and co-location are not as well developed in Europe as they are in U.S.; the market isn't as mature and there
aren't as many trading venues and a lot of what drives high-frequency trading and co-lo are having many venues to rub
between. That said, we had some presence both on the Liffe side and a little bit on the Cash side of co-lo, not nearly as
much on the Cash side. Now remember, we've got a data center where we've got Liffe and the Cash business located
together, as well as the equity options that goes along with the Liffe business. So we believe that that will create a
healthy environment for co-location and for the high-frequency trading, but it is a market that is behind the U.S. – and I
think I'm going to turn this over to Dominique in a second – that the regulators are really taking a hard look at this.
Dominique, do you want to comment on that?
<A - Dominique Cerutti, President and Deputy Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, we think, now expanding what
Larry said, high-frequency trading would be above 50% in the U.S.; it's roughly around 30% in Europe, but trending in
the same direction. Sooner or later, that's going to equalize; that's one thing. So it's less sensitive. Number two on
search for latency, of course, pure high-frequency traders are looking for that, but we see more and more player are
trying to cut latency and that's the need across the industry. We're not the same demand, but it's a need across the
industry and not on pure high-frequency trader. And we see that in the new co-lo member that we having in Basildon,
to answer your question.
And last on the regulatory scrutiny, you, of course, know that they really try to understand. We're confident that once
we go underneath and in the details, the regulators will understand better the model, we think we may be more
transparent to what has to be fixed. But there is no real impact on the High-Frequency Trading business, again, once
their work is done.
<Q - Rob Rutschow>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Vinciquerra from BMO Capital Market.
<Q - Michael Vinciquerra>: Thank you. Good morning. I just want to ask Mike on the compensation; nice dip on a
sequential basis here. Can you give us any more detail on the breakdown between incentive comp and then kind of your
base and benefits? And is this level for compensation something that you think is a run rate or was there something
special in the third quarter that helped bring it down further?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Vice President>: Yes, I mean one of the
things that helped in the third quarter is the outsourcing of a number of the regulatory activities of FINRA. So we
previously were actually moving, in a way, cost from what was previously in the compensation line when these
individuals were employees and now in the professional services fee. So there was some reduction in the compensation
line in real terms based on our continued reduction of cost, but a nice portion of that improvement, which is sustainable
going forward, but did come from a little bit of movement between the lines.
In terms of our incentive comp, and we haven't really discussed that too much, I mean I'm pretty comfortable saying in
aggregate, our kind of annual bonus pool in the Cash side, it's about $100 million, to give you a perspective, out of our
compensation.
<Q - Michael Vinciquerra>: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Mike.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.
<Q - Richard Repetto>: Good afternoon, Duncan.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, guys. How are you?
<Q - Richard Repetto>: Good morning to the rest of us here. Anyway, my question is sort of a follow-on on the
co-location. And I know you talked about the 97% capacity, but I was just trying to see get more details, just like what
is the revenue contribution from co-location? And then how would that, just as you broadly look at it and I know you're
going to shut down the other data centers next year, but just how you look at – I know there's other contributions
besides co-lo, but the return on investment, et cetera, on the data centers?
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Sure. Rich, I'm not sure if you were sleeping there, you were not the first question in
today; I'm not exactly sure what happened there. In terms of co-lo, first, we are 97% sold out. We have various options
for expanding the space from here. As you know, we have two halls where we have to just build out the infrastructure
to expand into; those will require capital investment. But the second option is to actually just densify the power supply
in the existing halls, which is a much smaller capital expenditure that actually just gives us more capacity within that.
And we are looking at that option as, a), it costs less and also it's far less lead time to do that.
The way we look at co-lo is it's an incremental revenue; it has costs against it, obviously, that we – and we think that
the ROI on that is good. But it's also important to our general strategy of building the liquidity hub and selling other
value-added technology services, whether those are ticker plants, managed services or other services that go along with
it. So it's all part of the broader technology strategy that Dominique and his team have embarked on. So we sort of see
it as a whole, we're really pleased with the way this is going out and we expect it to continue. So I don't know if that
answers it. We're not completely transparent in terms of granularity of co-lo revenues, but you know what our
competitors disclose and you should assume that we're not very far off from that.
<Q - Richard Repetto>: Okay, okay. That's helpful. I've been up since 3:30, Larry.
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Merci, Rich.
Operator
Your next question comes from line of Roger Freeman from Barclays Capital.
<Q - Roger Freeman>: Hi, good morning. Duncan and/or Larry, I guess question on trading opportunities in sort of
inside the OTC realm. I'm wondering kind of how you're thinking about the opportunity set to maybe partner with
dealers or other CEFs that are going to be created maybe as a technology services provider to get in on perhaps some
eventual exchange trading of product, maybe like CDX, where you don't come in as much of a threat to the dealers as
existing incumbents.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: It's something we spend to lot of time on, Roger, so I'll break
it down into two pieces. One, on the Clearing side, I think it's pretty obvious that the near-term opportunity is going to
be more on the – to be a provider of post-trade services. And as everyone on the call is well aware, that was not our
strong suit; we did not have – I've got the right post-trade asset. So between the NYPC venture in the U.S. and what
we're working on in Europe having largely verticalized our U.K. business and now working on finishing the last step of
that with the Clearing House and the guarantee fund in the U.K. and then building one in the Euro zone, I think we're in
much better position in the next 12 to 18 months to participate on the post-trade side.
I think it's a little early to tell exactly how much of these products find their way to trading venues or swap execution
facilities, etcetera. But I would tell you that our view on any of these front-ends is that given that these products have
heretofore been in the OTC space, any of these products that find their way either voluntarily or by regulatory fiat to be
traded more transparently, our view is not the if-you-build-it, they-will-come theory. We would anticipate that we
would construct these in partnership with the key liquidity providers, we would take the semi-mutualized approach
we've taken in some of our other projects, like our AMEX Options business and our NYSE Liffe U.S. Derivative

<Q - Roger Freeman>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to come back to the European Cash business and the market share
stabilization that you've seen there and I hope that you can maybe talk a little bit more about the high-frequency trading
that you're seeing over there. I think historically, when we think about high-frequency and cash equities, we think that
the market makers that are using technology and are very rebate-sensitive, but when we talk to people in Europe today,
they're saying a lot of the growth is actually coming from the signal proprietary high-frequency traders. And when I
think about those guys, I think about looking for liquidity, speeds, depth of book and things like that, so it should
actually really play into your existing market. So are you seeing the same thing, am I thinking about this right and
maybe what else is helping the stabilization right now? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Yes, thanks. Good question. I think the stabilization is party just coming from the
structure itself, which is for these other MTFs to proliferate, they've got to have good cross-exchange routing, they've
got to have enough liquidity to sort of draw the flow. And clearly there's some fungibility or interoperability of
Clearing issues. I think that the market's just not as well developed. We certainly do have high-frequency traders that
are acting more like market-makers than just liquidity takers on the regulated platforms and I would assume that the
same is true on our competitors MTF platforms, as well as the regulated markets.
So I don't know whether the mix is a little bit different in Europe versus the U.S.; I just think the market is less
well-developed because there are fewer routing options and routing itself is not as well-developed nor is Clearing
interoperability. It's just a very different landscape. I think it will look more U.S.-like over time, but it is taking time. I
don't know if Duncan or Dominique, you want to add anything to that. No? Okay.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's pretty clear. Thanks, Larry.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Thanks.

And your next question is our final question from the line of Niamh Alexander from KBW.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And thanks for also for updating the slide on Page 8;
this is really helpful, especially with the decommissioning of the data centers. If I could just go back, I guess, to the
revenue side of the Technologies business. And the NYFIX acquisition helped a lot last year, you're getting towards the
end of the big CapEx spend with the data centers, so should we think about maybe you starting to reallocate moneys
back towards acquiring to grow that revenue line? Help me understand the priorities for the use of some of this cash as
well, please?
<A - Dominique Cerutti, President and Deputy Chief Executive Officer>: I'm not sure I get the goal of your
question.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: I'm sorry. I'm just trying to understand if you're getting ready to get back into acquisition
mode in the Technologies business, now that the big spend is behind you with respect to the data center expansion...
<A - Dominique Cerutti, President and Deputy Chief Executive Officer>: All right, we've got you.

<A - Dominique Cerutti, President and Deputy Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, Yes. Again, I will let Mike
elaborate on that. So you see what we're doing this year executing on the current portfolio and they're extending. And
you may remember that we said that we move from a 362 million business last year and we are on our way, I mean,
with delivering the 20% growth in third quarter. Again, leveraging nicely but without any other acquisition. You should
project the business as it is today and as we already mentioned, you can do that; there is no secret into that.
And back to the 1 billion goal doubling the operating margin that we said, we should reach out something like 700
million, 750 million normally by just executing; that's one thing. Number two, we are preparing other initiatives, which
I'm not going to detail today, maybe next call, it will be too long, but extending our global network; extending our Data
Service business; building the service platform, and I gave a few examples on deal; and one day or another, attracting
other market venues and this is not a long-term dream because we working on that as we speak. So back to the 700
million projected to your question, we think that just with current portfolio and new initiatives without acquisition, we
have a distant hold on what we committed. Besides that, yes, we working on acquisition, but nothing in the short-term
radar, just to tell you that we can balance current portfolio; new initiatives; leveraging our asset that we have already
and we know how to do that; and potential acquisition and we can see them versus the goal that we mentioned both in
revenue and margin.
Mike, if you want to extend and be a little bit more granular?
<A - Lawrence Leibowitz>: Yes, let me just jump in for a second; this is a Larry. In terms of the acquisitions, I think
the team has shown that we are very capable of integrating acquisitions and evaluating them in a very thoughtful way.
So we're not to going to run around making acquisitions, either that don't make sense or are difficult to integrate. I think
we did that with NYFIX, we did it with AMEX, there's any number of acquisitions. I think we are looking at this very
opportunistically. We'd have to see things that fit in with our technology portfolio, take advantage of our networking
and distribution and allow us to take costs out or get other benefits leverage on the platform.
In terms sort of the bigger picture, Mike, why don't you talk about that?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Vice President>: Yes, I mean I – we
should probably close the call out. As we mentioned on the second quarter with the dramatic reduction in our leverage,
we kind of signaled that we're no longer focusing on delivering and that what we now are looking at in terms of capital
allocation, probably just and foremost, we want to maintain the flexibility and strong balance sheet, but we are looking
to invest in growth where we see the opportunity to do so, both acquisition and organic opportunities. And of course we
would evaluate whether we had excess cash flows as well and would consider share buybacks, et cetera.
As we look forward to 2011, not only are we strengthening our EBITDA, but we're looking at an environment where
we have considerably less capital expenditure, investments. And in fact, we'll be reporting, as we said, higher cash
earnings rather than book earnings, so our D&A will be considerably above our CapEx going forward. So being at a
good cash position, M&A will definitely part of what we'll be looking to evaluate, but as Larry said, it's going to be a
disciplined process.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for answering my questions.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler, Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Vice President>: Okay. Thank you
everyone.
Duncan L. Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer and Director
Hi, guys, we thank you all for dialing in. This was the first time we tried this on the split screen from New York and
Paris, so thank you for being patient with us. Hopefully everything was easy to hear, but any feedback would be
appreciated. And Mike and Stephen and the team will make themselves available for one-on-one throughout the day as
needed with the analysts. Thanks a lot.
