Gregory D. Wasson
Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today I'll begin with a review of
our financial performance. Next I'll discuss our performance against our three strategic growth drivers, and finally, I'll
look ahead to how we're preparing our company as we head towards fiscal 2015. Then I'll turn the call over to Wade for
a more detailed financial review of the quarter and the fiscal year.
This quarter was marked by solid top line growth in performance. We achieved record quarterly sales and record
second quarter prescriptions filled in spite of continued headwinds from slower generic drug introductions and severe
weather. For the quarter, sales were $19.6 billion, up 5.1% from $18.6 billion a year ago, driven in part by 4.3%
increase in comp store sales.
GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, up 4.9% from $1.2 billion last year. Adjusted operating
income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, down 4.3% from $1.4 billion in the second quarter 2013. GAAP earnings per
diluted share were $0.78 in the second quarter compared to $0.79 last year, down 1.3%. Second quarter adjusted
earnings per diluted share were $0.91, down 5.2% from $0.96 in the same quarter last year. And finally, we generated
operating cash flow of $1.1 billion in the second quarter and free cash flow of $877 million.
Turning to trends in gross profit dollars and SG&A dollars. In the second quarter on a GAAP basis, our gross profit
dollars increased 0.8% or $43 million from a year ago. SG&A dollars increased 1.6% or $72 million compared to a
year ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars increased 0.4% or $22 million compared to a 4% increase in the same quarter
last year. This difference resulted from several key factors. The shift in the generic wave from a peak in introductions
in the first quarter last year to a trough this year continue to have a negative impact. The impact, which moderated
somewhat from the first quarter, is expected to continue to moderate in the third quarter and turn positive in the fourth
quarter.
A weak flu season compared to last year resulted in fewer cough, cold and flu related prescriptions and lower sales of
over-the-counter products compared to the same period last year, and we also maintained meaningful promotional
investments in our Daily Living business in the quarter. While we did see some pressure on the gross profit dollar
growth, we were able to balance that with ongoing cost discipline. In a quarter with record sales and an increase in
comp store sales, our adjusted SG&A dollars increased by only 1.7% or $76 million compared to the same quarter last
year.
I want to give credit to our leadership team and the stores who are using their resources efficiently to serve our
customers. In our estimation, adjusted gross profit dollar growth would have been about the same as our adjusted
SG&A dollar growth if we not had the impact from severe winter weather. In the quarter we also made progress on our
three strategic growth drivers creating a Well Experience, advancing the role of community pharmacy, and establishing
an efficient global platform. Today I'll provide more details on that progress.
In our Well Experience growth driver we saw the ongoing impact of a value conscious consumer while unseasonably
cold temperatures, which I mentioned earlier, further affected our sales. In response, we continue to invest in
promotions increasing front-end comp sales by 2%. We also continue to rollout our Well Experience stores reaching a
total of 628 across the country. We realized market share gains across a majority of Nielsen-tracked categories in our
Daily Living business and in addition, average basket size increased 3.4% in the quarter as customers continued to
consolidate trips.

This quarter, we successfully reached a milestone for enrollment in our Balance Rewards program, topping 100 million
enrollees. With almost 80 million active members, we now have the largest retail-loaded program in the industry. We
also are leveraging our customer insights from Balance Rewards to evolve our value proposition and simplify
promotions to help both our stores and our customers.
On our Well Experience rollout, we're pleased with our progress to date. We continue to refine our store formats to
integrate healthcare, to provide an elevated beauty experience and also deliver exceptional seasonal and consumable
convenience to meet customers' needs.
Also this quarter, we expanded and enhanced our beauty offering introducing Boots No7 in New York City. We
completed the rollout to 10 stores in February and plan to reach 150 stores in the city. Our New York City expansion
follows our successful launch of Boots No7 and other Boots brands in our Arizona market and our flagship stores
across the country.
Finally, we continue to bring together our world-class digital capabilities to complement our convenient store locations
and leverage our omni-channel contacts to delight customers. Today, 9 million customers touch the Walgreens brand
everyday at our stores, over the Web or through mobile channels, making Walgreens a true omni-channel provider.
In our pharmacy, health and wellness business, our script comp was up 2.2% in the quarter. Our retail pharmacy market
share increased to 19% for the quarter, up 20 basis points year over year. And we filled a record 214 million
prescriptions, up 2.8% from the same period last year. We also continued to grow our 90-Day at Retail program.
According to IMS, in the second quarter the 90-Day at Retail market grew 15% year over year while the mail market
declined 10%. Also, our 90-Day at Retail volumes in the second quarter increased by 17% over the prior year. Some
perspective, our 90-Day at Retail business alone is as large as one-third of the total mail market industry. We believe
this validates that consumers value the ability to receive a 90-day supply at retail from their trusted community
pharmacist and that payers are increasingly seeing the value in adding a retail benefit to their mail offering.
In addition, we had a strong season for immunizations, with a total of 8.6 million vaccines administered through the
first half of the fiscal year. That's an increase of 11% over the same period last year. While that increase was mainly on
the strength of a strong flu shot season, we also continued to build our non-flu immunization business. For example,
today we are the number one retail provider of Zostavax, a vaccine for shingles. And finally, we continued to see some
impact to margin from the ongoing negative effect related to generics and the volume drop-off of controlled pain
medications which we referenced last quarter.
Looking ahead, our Medicare Part D program is accelerating our momentum in pharmacy. In the quarter, our Med D
volume was up year over year with significant growth in new customers on top of strong performance in fiscal 2013.
Our Part D market share for the quarter increased 80 basis points compared to the same period last year.
As we move forward, we are well positioned to win with senior customers as a preferred provider in four of the top
national plans, giving older Americans more plan choices, which offer them lower co-pays for their prescriptions.
Also as you know, we are tightly integrating our Healthcare Clinics with our pharmacies in hundreds of locations.
We're experiencing growing interest from customers who value convenient, affordable, high quality healthcare
services, and from payers who view Walgreens as an emerging health alternative care model and an important part of
the patient's care delivery team. To help meet this growing demand, we have a goal to add nearly 100 new Healthcare
Clinic locations in calendar 2014 on top of our 400 current retail clinics, and we will continue to expand our network to
develop a comprehensive national footprint.
Our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots contributed $0.08 per diluted share to Walgreens second quarter 2014
adjusted results. Combined synergies for the first half of fiscal 2014 were approximately $236 million. We now expect
to exceed our second year combined synergy target, and we're now estimating $375 million to $425 million in the
second quarter combined synergies. We estimate that the accretion from Alliance Boots in the third quarter of fiscal
2014 will be an adjusted $0.13 to $0.14 per diluted share. We purchased approximately 10.5 million shares of
AmerisourceBergen stock as of February 28, and we own approximately 4.5% of the company.

We continue to make good progress on our global initiatives. We are pleased with the performance of our global
procurement organization. With the introduction of AmerisourceBergen, we believe we will be the largest purchaser of
pharmaceuticals worldwide. More importantly, we are working with manufacturers transparently and collaboratively to
help drive sustainable growth in the U.S. and Europe. Manufacturers have told us they appreciate our approach. We
think this sets us apart from others in the market, benefits our organizations over the long haul, and positions us and our
pharmaceutical manufacturer partners extremely well for both short-term and long-term sustainable value creation.
In addition, after successfully transitioning our branded drugs to AmerisourceBergen last fall, we began our generic
transition this January and are making excellent progress. We're on track to complete the work by September 1.
As part of the company's efforts to optimize our cost structure and assets, we're also taking a closer look at our store
network. As we mentioned in our press release this morning, between now and August we intend to close 76 stores,
spread across the country. Importantly, overall this year, including store closings, we expect to expand our store base
by approximately 55 to 75 locations in fiscal 2014.
We looked at several factors in deciding which stores to close. We addressed the impact of increased density from our
own stores, the impact of real estate positioning within the market, and material changes to a store's trade area. In total,
this represents a very small portion, less than 1% of our 8,200-plus store base. As we position for future growth, and
markets and communities continue to change, we want to optimize our store footprint and make sure our stores remain
on the best corners in America. I also want to note that because most of these stores are located near another
Walgreens, we will be reassigning a majority of our team members.
The store optimization is expected to result in more than $40 million to $50 million in additional annual EBIT
beginning in fiscal 2015, representing an estimated $0.02 to $0.03 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, as well as
estimated charges of $240 million to $280 million, substantially all of which is expected to be recognized in the third
and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014. Keep in mind that we plan to exclude these charges from our adjusted EPS
calculation.
As we head into the second half of the fiscal year, we are well positioned to create value and accelerate long-term
growth. We expect to continue to make meaningful investments in our front end to drive the right balance in sales and
margins. We're also focused on our important programs in pharmacy, health and wellness such as Medicare Part D,
immunizations and Healthcare Clinics that will continue to improve volume and expand access to convenient,
high-quality, affordable healthcare services.
With these areas of focus, we will capitalize on the convergence of our two dynamic industries, retail and healthcare,
and continue to meet the changing demands of our customers, partners and payers. That coupled with the commitment
to excellence and execution that has always defined Walgreens, I'm excited about the future of our company.
And finally, I'd like to thank our team members who did such a great job serving our customers through a very difficult
winter. Across the country, they ensured our customers had convenient access to the essential products, emergency
supplies and the necessary prescriptions they needed through this harsh winter.
And now I'll turn the call over to Wade.
Wade D. Miquelon
Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. This morning I will take you
through our quarterly results as well as update you on our Alliance Boots strategic partnership and our
AmerisourceBergen relationship. As Greg noted earlier, for the quarter we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.78 per diluted
share based on nearly 964 million shares.
GAAP EPS walks to an adjusted EPS of $0.91 for the quarter as illustrated by this chart: a LIFO provision of $0.04,
acquisition related items were $0.12 per share consisting of $0.06 of acquisition related amortization costs, $0.01 of
acquisition related costs and $0.05 from Alliance Boots related tax. Finally the special items were a net $0.03 per share

through the combined impact of the warrants issued by AmerisourceBergen to Walgreens and Alliance Boots with the
Alliance Boots impact reported on a three-month lag basis.
Let me now review our comparable store sales for the quarter. Comp prescription sales increased 5.8%, comp front-end
sales increased 2% and total comp store sales increased 4.3%. Comp prescription sales increased 2.2% versus a script
comp of 4.3% in the year-ago period. In second quarter the front-end comp increased 2%. Components of this comp
were traffic, which decreased by 1.4% and basket size which increased by 3.4%.
As Greg touched upon earlier, our front-end was impacted by the tough cough, cold, flu compare and the severe
weather versus the prior-year. Looking forward, please keep in mind that the March front-end comp sales will begin to
be negatively impacted by the Easter shift this year versus last year. And recall Easter fell on March 31 last year and
falls on April 20 this year. As always, we'll provide the combined March, April comp on May 5 to give you a better
understanding of our underlying sales for these two months.
Looking at comparable store script numbers, our retail scripts were up 2.2%. In spite of a tough cough, cold, flu
compare this performance reflects the fundamentals of our underlying business, the return of Express Scripts customers
and our ongoing progress at winning new Medicare Part D customers. It is also worth noting that the two-year stack on
script comps has risen back to levels last reached prior to Express Scripts dispute.
With respect to margin, our adjusted gross margin reflects our FIFO inventory was 29.1% in the current quarter
compared to 30.5% last year a 140 basis point decline. While we all experienced some level reimbursement pressure,
the most significant factor affecting the pharmacy margin was dramatically slower rate of new generic introductions
year over year. The front-end margin was negatively impacted by increased promotional investment designed to drive
traffic and sales. Partially offsetting these margin headwinds is the fact that purchasing synergies positively impacted
both the front-end and the pharmacy margins.
Taking look at our adjusted gross margin trends, this quarter's 140 basis point decrease was versus a 120 basis point
increase a year ago. In essence, the benefit of the generic wave last year reversed itself this year. We expect this impact
to continue to moderate in the third and fourth quarter and become a tailwind to some degree in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2014. And keep in mind the timing of the introduction of some generic drugs remains a question mark. For
instance, as most of you know, the launch of generic versions of Diovan and Nexium may be delayed which would
result in their benefit being pushed out from our second half of fiscal 2014 into fiscal year 2015.
Moving forward, the front-end margin will continue to be impacted by our promotional investments until we cycle
these changes beginning this summer. As we demonstrated and discussed the last two quarters, this graph illustrates the
impact that new generic drug introductions have had on our monthly prescription sales comps. The highlighted quarters
illustrate that the number of new generic drug introductions have slowed dramatically versus a year ago and you can
see that the generic impact on comp prescription sales was about a negative 6% in the second quarter of fiscal year
2013 versus the generic impact of negative 1.3% in the most recent quarter.
In our experience, the margin change resulting from generics is inversely correlated and slightly lagged to the impact of
generic sales changes. That is the strongest positive effect on margin typically occurs shortly after the generic impact
on prescription sales is the most deflationary. That period occurred in the year-ago quarter. As you can see the tough
year-over-year generic impact margin comparisons dissipate in the latter half of fiscal 2014 into the generic impact on
pharmacy sales comps is expected to increase in that period.
Transitioning now to gross profit, this slide illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past 10
quarters on a GAAP basis and the next slide shows the trends on an adjusted basis. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth
slowed to 0.4% from 4% in the year-ago period as result of the headwinds we described for you in the first quarter
including generic wave shift, the front-end investment and the impact of weaker cough, cold, flu.
For the quarter, GAAP SG&A dollar growth was 1.6% to which we add back 0.1 percentage point for the
acquisition-related costs resulting in adjusted SG&A dollar growth of 1.7%. Shown here are the SG&A dollar growth
trends for the past 10 quarters on a GAAP basis and the following slide shows a similar trend on adjusted basis. The
adjusted SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was 1.7% year-over-year increase versus the 4.2% increase in the second

quarter of fiscal 2013. Included in this SG&A dollar growth rate was approximately 50 basis points or $23 million of
incremental weather-related expenses, mostly snow removal.
This next chart illustrates our two-year stacked SG&A dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last nine quarters.
Now let's review the two-year stack trends on adjusted basis. Two-year stacked adjusted SG&A trends improved versus
a year ago by 200 basis points with the two-year stack of 5.9% growth in the second quarter of 2014 down from 7.9%
last year at about half the rate of growth of 11.6% two years ago.
During the quarter, the rate of growth in adjusted gross profit dollars trailed adjusted SG&A dollar growth by 130 basis
points. As you can see, gross profit dollar growth decelerated year over year, which reflects the incremental headwinds
we encountered.
Turning to the few other components of our income statement, this quarter included LIFO provision of $51 million
versus the provision or a charge of $72 million a year ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the quarter was 2.5%, down
slightly from 2.75% a year ago. Net interest expense for the quarter was $37 million versus $23 million from year ago.
Now, recall the quarter a year ago benefited from the receipt of $19 million of interest income generated by late
pharmacy reimbursement payments. We expect interest expense of approximately $40 million in the third quarter.
Average diluted shares outstanding were 964 million versus 953 million shares last year change. And the change is
primarily due to the impact of a higher stock price on the number of in-the-money options, which are counted as diluted
shares. In the third quarter, we expect a diluted share count of approximately 965 million shares subject to changes in
the current share price.
Our blended effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.9% versus 36.6% last year. The difference is primarily attributed
to foreign-sourced income taxed at a lower rate, partially offset by increases to estimated permit differences between
book and tax income. On a go-forward basis Walgreens tax rate is expected to be about 37.5% and Alliance Boots tax
rate is expected to be approximately 20%.
Accounts receivable increased by 11.8% primarily due to increased business including the return of Express Scripts
network prescriptions and while accounts payable increased 2.3%. LIFO inventories were down 0.6% and FIFO
inventories were up 2% year-over-year versus sales growth of approximately 5.1%. We expect inventory levels to come
down in the back half of the year as we realize greater efficiencies due to daily deliveries and complete the full generic
distribution transition to AmerisourceBergen.
Overall, net working capital increased by 2.9% versus a year ago. During the second quarter we generated
approximately $1.1 billion in cash from operations versus $1.2 billion in the year-ago period. The free cash flow in the
quarter was $877 million versus $953 million a year ago.
The next slide shows our quarterly accretion from Alliance Boots, which was as Greg said $0.08 per share for the
quarter versus our forecast of $0.07 to $0.08 per share. And you can find a more detailed walk included in the appendix
to this presentation on our investor relations website.
Combined net synergies for the quarter totaled $129 million and for the first half of the year totaled $236 million. As
Greg noted because we're running ahead of our original estimate of $350 million to $400 million of combined
synergies for the year, we are now raising the range of our estimate to $375 million to $425 million.
Looking forward, we estimate the adjusted EPS accretion from Alliance Boots for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014
to be $0.13 to $0.14 per share based on our current estimates of IFRS to GAAP conversion and foreign exchange rates
and moving forward we plan to continue to provide our accretion estimates one quarter in advance.
Similar to last quarter, we have reviewed our fiscal year 2016 goals internally and performance-to-date with respect to
four of our five goals remains on track with or slightly ahead of our expectations. And these four goals are: sales of
$130 billion including Alliance Boots share of associates and joint venture sales, synergies of $1 billion, operating cash
flow of $8 billion dollars and net debt of $11 billion dollars.

As stated on our last call, our adjusted operating income goal of $9 billion to $9.5 billion is currently tracking below
the CAGR required to meet this goal and below our initial expectations. We continue to recognize that there are risks to
achieving this goal.
However, we remain focused on delivering it and as I also stated we have identified a range of further opportunities
including benefits from our AmerisourceBergen relationship, incremental Alliance Boots synergies, business expansion
and new initiatives and cost savings, which can all help mitigate these risks.
The asset optimization program that Greg described highlights our focus on efficiencies while the increase in our fiscal
year 2014 synergy estimate demonstrates that we're driving additional synergies with Alliance Boots and
AmerisourceBergen.
In closing, we believe our strategies for the long-term are sound and should further differentiate us versus competition
and create value for our stakeholders. When recapping the current state of our business there are many indicators that
give us confidence in our future. As Greg said we've been growing share of the competitive U.S. Daily Living and
retail pharmacy businesses and we continue on our Well Experience journey and we are focused on continuing this
front-end momentum and also focused on positively impacting margin over time via mix and promotional and supply
chain efficiencies.
Our pharmacy business is well-positioned in patient segments, such as acute needs, Part D customers and key chronic
conditions and we continue to drive real efficiencies in both our Pharmacy operations and in procurement. We also
have a significant opportunity to participate in and influence the healthcare market more broadly via our asset and
healthcare professional breadth. Through our various healthcare partnerships and initiatives we're on a path to do
exactly that.
Now lastly, we continue to be very pleased with our Alliance Boots partnership and AmerisourceBergen relationship.
On the Alliance Boots side, their business remains resilient in a European environment that remains challenging. The
continued strong cash flow and deleveraging focus has also been very positive. Our combined synergies that continue
to track at the high end of our estimates and we're learning from each other every day, and our step two joint
operational and financial planning is going well.
Our AmerisourceBergen relationship thus far has also met our expectations, with the distribution and our joint synergy
efforts progressing right on plan. We also continue to identify additional ways that all three partners can work together
to create value and change the paradigm in various areas of our business.
In short, we believe we're just scratching the surface in what we can ultimately create as a global pharmacy-led health
and well-being enterprise. But in my humble opinion, we are off to a terrific start.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.
Rick J. Hans
Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Thanks so much and good morning and thanks for all the detail. I guess just a couple of quick
follow-up questions. The first would just be around the global procurement impact and timing. Greg, you talked about
the number being better as far synergies going up to $375 million to $425 million, but you didn't necessarily up the $1
billion overall. Should we be thinking about that $1 billion number as being more of a contributor to the overall 2016

number?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Good morning, Lisa. We feel comfortable upping the number for this year to $375 million
to $425 million based on what we're seeing. We still feel confident in the $1 billion and aren't ready to make any
comments on it. Longer term, we still feel confident that there are opportunities that we are identifying. But at this
point, in time we feel confident that we'll get that $1 billion in 2016.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay. And then you didn't really make any comments today about the Affordable Care Act.
Yesterday there were some comments that perhaps now Florida looking at extending Medicaid. Can you just update us
on anything you've seen thus far around ACA volume and then maybe any expectations for an increase in the back half
of the year?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I saw that announcement. And we think obviously, as we've said, as enrollment grows, it's
going to be positive for the business, as you would expect with prescription business and people getting coverage that
have not had coverage. Some of those may be cash customers that we're getting prescriptions that may not be a
complete new prescription customer, but we think there will be an additive benefit to more and more people getting
coverage.
It's still early to tell as far as the number of people that are coming on board. I think there are some positive signs over
the last month or so that more and more people are getting coverage. Let me turn it over to Kermit. Kermit, if you've
got any additional color that you're seeing?
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: Lisa, I think the other thing to add is that we continue to work with many of the new
customers, new patients during the transition period. We've announced that we will continue to do that through April.
We're also working with many of our health plan partners on educating many of the new potential enrollees. So we
think the bulk of the volume will continue to be in the open networks. And as we see more and more of the open
network business, we think that will be good for us.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: And so is it fair to say that you would expect maybe to see that in the back half, the next couple
quarters in your fiscal year, or do you think that's going to be more of a fiscal 2015 event?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I think we've seen a slow enrollment period, but I think we'll see that gradually increase
over the next couple of quarters and into next year.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Lisa.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Great, thanks for the questions. Let me start on the gross margin trend. I know you guys
mentioned that you expect the negative generic comp experience in the front half to ease as we move into the back half,
and I understand you guys don't give specific guidance. But can you maybe just help us think about the components of
the gross margin trend in the back half, maybe for instance relative to the year-over-year declines that we've seen in 1Q
and 2Q? Any sense you can give us on what we should be looking for on the year-over-year trend into the back half?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I would just say just there are a couple factors. The big one obviously is the timing of new
generic introductions and so we start to move into a phase where those come now. Again, the exact date of these can
never be perfectly predicted, so you have in general the information that we have, but that makes a very substantive
difference. Again, we're starting to cycle the front investments that we made that were quite substantial to get back to
more of a normalized rebalancing mix. And so in the next quarter or two we'll move into that cycling. And then even
things like flu and C2s can have some mix effects, and so we'll start to both cycle that and get into more of a
normalized period. So these things will all come when they come. But directionally, especially when you also look at

the stacks for compare, they tend to even out over time, but I think we're moving into that phase.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: All right, great. Then just going back to the synergies, I know originally you guys were calling
for this to be a little bit less than what we saw last quarter. Clearly not the case, you realized more synergies in Q2 than
1Q. And then looking at the full year, even though you did increase it, it does look like the back half would actually be
on track to produce less than what we saw on the front half. Do you just have any more specifics or commentary you
can give us around the drivers of synergies and maybe what's causing some of the cadence in this fiscal year at least?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I think we feel very good where we are. But I would also say that for the people that are in
the trenches working, these people like Jeff and John, some of the deals that we work, you never can predict exactly
when they're going to hit and for what period they'll accrue to. Separately, I would say that every day we have multiple
streams working very hard to identify new synergies, to work new synergies, to negotiate new synergies. And so again,
while we feel very good on the glide path and even the long term as Greg suggested, these things are going to require
hard work each and every quarter, every quarter going forward, and we just want to get ahead of ourselves there.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: So then it's not something that's necessarily linear, clearly based on the guidance that you guys
put out for the back half?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I don't know if it's linear or not, but I'd say that it can be choppy along the way because
sometimes you get a step-up for something that we do, but other times we identify a new source of synergy and start
working that. It's just there are lots of moving parts underneath the hood, but directionally we feel we have the right
momentum towards our goal.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Got it, thanks so much.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Thanks, Bob.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Good morning, Ricky.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: A couple of questions. First on the SG&A spend, this is the second quarter where you've
grown SG&A at well below your 3.5% to 4.5% organic targets. So, if you can, talk a little bit more in detail about the
cost control. Is this like a new level going forward? And also how much of it is being driven by distribution efficiencies
from the ABC relationships? And when does that normalize, if it does?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Ricky, maybe I'll take it at eye level and then let Wade get in a little more detail. As I said,
I think we feel good with what the stores are doing and the efficiency that Mark and team have really driven to the
stores. I think we'll continue to see the stores do a nice job of balancing payroll according to the volume. I think a lot of
the corporate initiatives that we've had in place regarding really looking at core initiatives and core programs and
projects that we feel good that we're making progress there, and that should continue.
I don't think frankly that you should be factoring a lot of efficiencies yet from the AmerisourceBergen transition,
although we do expect to see that going forward but we're still in the process of transitioning the generic distribution
from our distribution centers to theirs. That's early on so there's not a lot of that built-in. We certainly do expect there to
be opportunities going forward with it. Wade anything to add?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I think we're just aggressively attacking all costs, so we have had a couple of very strong
quarters versus to what we had prior in our sustainable growth model. We'll continue to attack all costs and make sure
that we focus all resources on the core strategies that will drive value. So I hesitate to lean into any kind of guidance on
that. But as Greg said also the big distribution benefit for us really comes at the end of this fiscal and into next fiscal

when we have all of our generic volume which is the smaller dollar piece, but 80% of the unit volume fully
consolidated in their systems. And I think that's also when they see the benefit too is once we get the full integration of
branded generics. So that will be a next year event by and large.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: And what, if you can share with us, what percentage of your generic volumes is now
distributed via ABC?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: We haven't giving that number Ricky. We're making good progress and we intend it to be
completed by the end of the fiscal year and we're on track to meet that date for sure.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then secondly on the tax rate, I know the tax rate in the quarter was below
historical levels and Wade you touched upon that. But just to clarify, should we expect in the next quarter then a higher
tax to go up and is there any change in how you account for the AB equity earnings, how you are accounting of taxes
for that?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I think you can expect probably going forward a rate similar to what you saw in this
quarter. It's again, I think it's fairly complex to kind of track the rate through this based upon our joint venture, their
business and our business but I think that you will see something markedly different from what you saw in this period.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you very
much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Hi, good morning. I wanted to get some insights on the Alliance Boots number. The
reported income from Alliance Boots of $194 million was much higher than a lot of us were expecting. What was in
that number? Was there anything unusual in that? And what do you think the core operating earnings growth for
Alliance Boots is running at right now?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: The big thing in the number four IFRS purposes is the warrant income from ABC and they
have a lag so it was actually a gain in this period for them and without the lag for us because the stock pulled back a
little bit, it was a slight loss. But that was the big thing in the IFRS number and again for our purposes for GAAP we
reversed that out. There's always some nuances back and forth. With respect to the overall business, I'm not going to
provide any kind of guidance on that going forward, but they are going to be reporting their numbers for the full-year in
May and so closing at the end of March here in the next week or two. So I think you'll be able to get a lot more color on
their business probably and that should probably be very helpful.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Okay. And the difference between that $194 million that was in the reported numbers and
the $100 million that you had in the slides that were kind of tax affected, is that just taking out that gain that you were
talking about?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: It was primarily the warrants. I don't have the full rec but that would be the main of that.
But we can get you the specific details on that.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Okay. And then on the weather impact, I guess there was some commentary on the
SG&A impact from removing snow and so forth but what do you think the total weather impact was in the quarter?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: As Greg has said, our gross profit SG&A spread would've been basically equal from
having not had it so you can deduct about $20, couple million, $22 million for snow removal, $25 million. And then the
balance up to $60 million, so $35 million or so for gross profit impact; that was both through store closures where we
had substantial store closure days and a little bit of traffic too.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Okay, so $22 million plus the $35 million?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland. Your line is now open.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning, two things. First of all in terms of merchandising changes with Alex involved
and with beauty, I'm curious if you can give us an update of where that is going terms of an opportunity to further
expand beauty, what you're doing in terms of adding product, adding space, adding labor and then also the opportunity
to expand brands to further drive share opportunities from that area.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Good morning, Eric. I've got Alex here so I'll lead off and maybe I'll let Eric or Alex
weigh in a little bit. But as I said, we do think we have an opportunity to go bigger in beauty. We feel good with our
pilot rollout of the Boots brand in Arizona as I said. I think we've been in that since last fall. We're seeing some pretty
good results not only with the brand specifically but in the total category itself, which is encouraging. We intend as I
said to roll out in New York City next. We think that's a good metropolitan market to introduce the brand in a very
special way and we're going to do it right. So we're feeling pretty good there. I guess maybe I'll – Alex, I'll let you kind
of weigh in there with your thoughts.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi, Eric. Thanks, Greg. Yeah, as Greg has said, we're pleased with progress so far. We've seen a
really positive response from some of the customers who are already shopping for beauty in Walgreens. They're doing
more shopping for beauty in Walgreens particularly developing some categories. You're absolutely right. It's around the
whole experience. It's not just about the product. It's about the customer care that surrounds the product, and we're
seeing that consistently both in Phoenix and in the 10 stores that we have upgraded in New York.
So my advice would be if you're interested go and have a look at the Union Square for example in New York City,
Empire State Building, New York City. They are both on the ground and we'll have 150 on the ground by the end of
this fiscal year and we're feeling good. They're certainly encouraging Walgreen shoppers to shop a bit more in beauty
already and it's not just No7. It's the Boots brands and beyond that.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Just a follow on as you think about the future opportunity to gain share, that's never getting to
where Boots is in the UK but moving in that direction. How important is the ability to gain access to brands that you
don't have today, national brands or prestige brands? How critical is that or how far can you get without those?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: We believe we can go quite a long way without them. Again, the history in Boots, the premium
brands have only been in Boots for about 15 years, 20 years and Boots have a very strong beauty business is mass, and
we call it masstige which is mid-market brands before them. So we are feeling pretty good about being able to expand
with both premium brands and obviously as we go forward into the future, we attract customers to think more about the
experience of beauty instead of Walgreens, we believe that some of the premium brands may be interested in joining us
in Walgreens. But that's somewhere down the road and we think we can get a long way down that road without the
support of the premium brands.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Great. Thanks. And just one other if I could, the store closings is a little bit different than what
we've seen in the past. Curious about the timing on that and thinking on that. And also if there is a larger opportunity to
manage down the SG&A or corporate opportunity within the business as you look at combining the organizations?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Eric, maybe I'll lead off and get Wade and even Mark Wagner if he wants to weigh in
here. Keep in mind that when we talked earlier in the year about our enterprise optimization program to really set
ourselves up for the global, the international entity we're about to become, we really want to make sure we're positioned
and ready to roll for that, and we've been doing some good stuff corporately as we talked about to position ourselves.

And then next thing we wanted to look at some of the assets, we took a really hard look trade area by trade area at our
store locations, something to your point, we really we've done in the past but not with a real focus to effort. The good
news is, frankly we've got a lot of great locations out there and we've only really stumbled on about the 75 or so that
we're talking about. A lot of that's just due to – some of that's due to us we put in maybe an extra store in a trade area
than probably what we should have and we've densed up and so forth. But with that, maybe I'll turn it over to Mark a
little bit as far as he lead that exercise to look at our store base and I think maybe he'll add a little color.
<A - Mark A. Wagner>: Hello, Eric. We looked at it really with two lenses, one with a strategic lens, one with a
financial lens and kind of loosened the Pareto philosophy, 80% of the closings are really in some of our denser market
some of our big growth states that we were the biggest competitor in these trade areas. Some of the other challenges we
had in the trade areas were a change over time due to road pattern changes, overpasses, underpasses, you name it that
really made our store real estate sites not as competitive or out-positioned in most cases.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Great, thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Eric.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin of Wolfe research. Your line is now open.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one I wanted to talk about is free cash flow.
Looks like it is running about half of last year's levels and want to get your thoughts as we go forward and we get to
next year when we're going to close the acquisition and what impact if this trend continues that will have.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I would just say that this year both operating and free cash flow look a little bit lumpy just
because we've got this major transition with AmerisourceBergen, the timing of the brand move, the timing of the
generic move, the reselling of the contracts for how we think about inventory versus payables. But this is really going
to work its way through the system because at the end of the year we anticipate that we'll have what will be in the
targeted levels for this type of transition. So I guess what I would just say is I don't think there's anything that is
unusual this year in operating or free cash versus prior year, net slight changes in working capital, slight changes in
whatever.
So as we look forward, I guess, to 2016, we still remain very confident in our combined cash goal of $8 billion in
operating and very strong free cash flow. And again I think what you saw last quarter was very low but it's really just
because of this transitional effect and this quarter was more normalized but the next couple of quarters we should kind
of even it out for the entire year as we complete the full transition.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: So we should think of free cash flow kind of similar to the levels we saw last year, is that
how you would – it's lumpy but it's going to be about the same?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Just for us operating less for capital but it's not substantially different. You've got our
guidance for what we plan on capital spending and you could do the math yourself there too.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Then my second question goes, I think you guys said you had 628 Well stores. I'm
wondering if you can give us any, and maybe you have done this before, any kind of – as you convert stores to the Well
Experience what the sales list looks like? What's the profit list? And then how many more are you expecting this year?
So if you could give us a little insight on that that would be great.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Scott, we haven't given out color on actual performance. We will again say that as we've
been working on this for the last three years, it's a crawl, walk, run and we want to make sure that investment we're
putting in we're getting the right return. We feel pretty good. There are still some areas that we are tweaking to make
sure that we can continue to put the pedal to the metal. One of the things we've done is the good thing is we now have a
pretty good idea of the various components within the Well Experience format and what's working, what still needs
some work. And the good thing is you'll begin to see the various components within the Well Experience format show

up throughout the chain in a much quicker way than what we would have been if we just continued to roll out the entire
format or try to get the entire format right. So bottom line, we feel good about it. There are still areas where we want to
tweak and get the returns on that added content and product and so forth. But there are a lot of the areas that are
modular that we can begin to roll out throughout the chain. Alex, do you want to add any color there?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Thanks, Greg. The other thing I would say is that the success of the Balance Rewards cards in
terms of having 80 million active customers and 100 million people signed up is giving us real-time data about how
people are using our stores. And really that data is helping us to design, as Greg said, even better assortments going
forward.
So I think the design has been really appreciated by customers. Their feedback in terms of the brand perception is good,
in terms of moving on the brand perception to a more differentiated experience than the normal drugstore channel,
which is exactly what the team started to do a few years ago, and the data from the Balance Rewards card is now
allowing us to build better, add better assortments for our customers. So I think we'll accelerate from this point based
on that data and based on what the customers are telling us right now in terms of their perception of the Walgreens
brand within it.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Perfect, thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Scott.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if I could just follow up on that question, Alex. In terms
of the data for Balance Rewards, how much has that data been really analyzed and how much has it already been acted
upon, or is this something you're still collating the data and really crunching it until you really understand the behavior
of your shoppers?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: I think it's a bit of all three. I think some of it is really well understood and we're using already to
simplify some of the things we're doing, particularly in the promotional strategy. And some of it we're understanding in
terms of building assortments, I said already. And from the experience of being with Boots, there's a lot more we can
do with the data over time. But the team, a strong team, they are a really good team, and they're working closely with
their association partners across in Alliance Boots. And I think this will give it a lot of momentum going forward. So I
think all three to be honest, for very good reasons.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Charles, I would...
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: So...
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I would weigh in on that as well. I'd say we're really in the infancy of the insights that
we're beginning to gather from having launched nearly 100 million and 80 million active members a year ago. So
there's a lot of excitement from the merchants, let me tell you, about the data and the insights they're beginning to have.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Okay, that's helpful, and then maybe a question for Wade. If I look at the cash flow statement,
am I correct in thinking you really didn't repurchase any shares in the quarter? How should we think about that maybe
for the balance of the year? Thanks.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Have we repurchased any shares? I think as we've said before, that allocation policy was to
get us through step two, very strong balance sheet position prior to reconsidering any buybacks. We have been buying,
as you can also see, some AmerisourceBergen stock. And I think the number at the end of the quarter was 4.5% –
4.6%.

<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Okay, great, and then maybe if I can just sneak one last question in. You touched on these
stores that you are closing, so our net stores are 55 – 75 for the year opening. How should we think about store
expansions as we go forward? You might have touched on that, I'm sorry if I missed it.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: We don't think that our rate of annualized growth that we've talked is going to be different.
Again, in the grand scheme of things, these 76 stores are less than 1% of our total and many of them have –
circumstances have changed over many years. But on a go-forward basis we would see the same kind of cadence we've
had in the past two years.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I'd say one of the things when, that we have we do feel good about with the opening of at
a slower rate, although still plenty of new store growth year over year, we're really finding some great locations. And
that's what we want to do is we want to find A-plus locations now and open at that same rate going forward. We still
have several geographies out there that we can expand in and find great locations.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Great, thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. I'm showing we have time for two more analyst questions. Our next question comes from the line of John
Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Hey, Greg, so two things. How do you think about tobacco? How much of an opportunity
is that near term right as CVS exits? Is it a liability long term? And then do your partners, HMOs, PBMs, customers, do
they care whether you sell it or not?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Good morning, John. Let me start with where we're focused. And what we're focused on is
to help encourage our customers to make healthy choices and not only just with cigarettes but with daily habits, and
that's our walk with Well and some of the things we're doing are designed to do. That includes helping people quit. And
I think that the CDC has said that the two most important factors to help someone quit smoking is a healthcare
professional as well as nicotine replacement therapy. And some stats that maybe you may have or may not have; but
back in 1960s – 1970s, better than half this population smoked. Today it's down to about 18%, it's been 18% for a
period of time. Those folks, 60%-some of them want to quit, 45% last year tried to quit. We think we are well
positioned to help folks change their behavior who want to quit. So our pharmacists are geared up and we really want to
begin to help change behavior. So that's our area of focus.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So it sounds like you're going to stick with it unless it's mandated like in San Fran that you
can't sell it.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: As I said, we're going to help people change behavior, we're going to help them quit and I
don't think there is anyone better than a retail pharmacy with the pharmacist and smoking cessation products that can
help people change their behavior and help them quit.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: All right. Then for Alex while we have him, obviously beauty, No7, that's pretty obvious
how that can help Walgreens. What are some of the less obvious things you can bring from Boots? One of the things
that has always intrigued me is migrating Pink Friday to the U.S. What are some of the things you have looked at that
can be impactful to Walgreens U.S. that may have flown below the radar screen?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: John, I think to some it's Pink Friday, which as you know is the Soap & Glory today in the UK,
Walgreens already has a really, really good seasonal business. In particular, it's seen as a last-minute gift destination for
many Americans. And that's exactly what Boots does as well. So we think we can really join together and improve and
push some of the beauty ranges in Walgreens and I'm sure the improved range across both Boots and Walgreens by
getting that even better for customers.

So seasonal is definitely one area. I think also the second area I'd point to would be the fantastic Well at Walgreens
brand and the Walgreens healthcare brand is the number one healthcare brand from a consumer healthcare point of
view and again working closely together to bring new innovative products both in the U.S. and to the UK market where
Boots is primarily based is another big opportunity in this relationship on the consumer and the front-end.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: John, maybe I'll add because Alex is probably humble and won't say this but I think one of
the things that we're bringing as well and he's helping us with is the understanding of how their Boots loyalty program
was successful and helped drive a lot of the success that they had moving into beauty and other areas within the UK.
And I think the knowledge that we're bringing with our 80 million active members now to continue to improve our
loyalty program is going to be a big opportunity for us.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yup.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Hi. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. I was hoping we could maybe wrap
up with two topics that have become more top of mind with investors recently. And the first is certainly around the
longer-term view of leverage at the company. You obviously historically haven't operated with a lot of leverage at all.
Alliance Boots has. I think the question is, as you go forward as a combined company generating a ton of free cash
flow, would it make sense to operate possibly with a lot more leverage than where you are today to unlock cash for
either share repo or additional deals? So your thought on that first would be helpful.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: One thing is obviously I think when you look at our business you need to look through to
the leases and the lease effect on the overall balance sheet which is significant. We like where we are investment-grade
it's been important for us to stay investment-grade. We're in that investment grade zone. We should be over time I think
it will be decided over time as we go. But I guess what I would say is yes, we are, we do believe we'll generate a lot of
free cash. We'll have a lot of options. But at this point we're really focused on getting through to step two with the
structure, with the ratings, with the overall metrics that we've had.
At that point I'm sure that we'll look broadly and reassess all of our options as a company to say what's the best capital
allocation process going forward and what are the best value crating ideas? Is it returning cash to shareholders or is it
investing back on the business, or what. So I would it's a little premature to have a discussion fully now.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. The second question, which the answer may be similar, but it's on the notion of tax
inversion because there's been a lot of speculation at least amongst investors about the opportunity here. Could you
maybe just talk about what the issues may be for a company like Walgreens in potentially doing something like this and
whether it's something that you would be open to considering?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Maybe I'd start with just reiterating what I said I think not on the last earnings call but the
one before, that we have no plans to do so, to do an inversion re-domicile the company. I think what we are focused on,
frankly, is spending the time with our board and on diligence and so forth to make sure that we put our board and our
shareholders in the position to make the right decision on step two. And that's what we're focused on. But just to
reiterate as I said the last call, we have no plans to do an inversion.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: All right. Thanks, Ed.
