Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Beth, and welcome everyone. 2016 was a transformational year for Weyerhaeuser. Through our merger
with Plum Creek, and $2.5 billion divesture or our Cellulose Fibers business, we became a focused timber, land and
forest products company, and nearly doubled the size of our Timberland holdings.
In the midst of executing these portfolio changes, we maintained our relentless focus own on performance. In 2016, we
increased full-year EBITDA by almost 55% to nearly $1.6 billion.
We delivered the highest annual Wood Products earnings in over a decade. We captured merger cost synergies faster
than expected and raised our 12-month run rate target by 25%, and we achieved over $100 million in operational
excellence improvement.
Finally, we returned $2 billion of cash to shareholders through the repurchase of common shares. For the full-year
2016, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of just over $1 billion or a $1.39 per diluted share on net sales of $6.4
billion. These results include a solid fourth quarter performance, I will highlight this morning.
Our fourth quarter net earnings were $551 million or $0.73 per diluted share on net sales of $1.6 billion. This includes
after-tax earnings of $489 million from discontinued operations, primarily the gain on divesture of our pulp mills and
after-tax special charges of $44 million for a tax adjustment associated with repatriation of Canadian earnings
following our Cellulose Fibers divesture merger-related expenses and some non-cash Real Estate impairments.
Excluding these items, we earned $106 million or $0.14 per diluted share.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $400 million. This is an improvement of over 60% compared with a
year ago and represents substantial increases in each of our operating businesses.
Before discussing our business results in more detail, I will make a few comments on the housing market.
Single-family housing activity continued a steady improvement in the fourth quarter. Single-family starts rose 10%
compared with the third quarter and ended up the year up 9% compared with 2015. Total U.S. housing starts finished
the year at nearly $1.17 million, a 5% improvement from 2015. As expected, the single-family share of activity
increased during the year and multi-family activity remained volatile.
For 2017, we expect single-family housing starts to increase by over 10%, and we anticipate total housing starts of
approximately $1.25 million to $1.3 million.
Economic fundamental support a trajectory of continued steady housing growth. Employment and wages are rising.
Consumer confidence is strong, mortgage rates remain historically favorable, and public surveys indicate that builder
confidence remains near-historic highs.
Although builders are managing through some constraints such as availability of skilled labor, stringent permitting
requirements, and land and construction cost inflation, our customers echo the optimism seen in builder surveys and
feel confident that housing market will maintain solid upward momentum.
Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts 4 to 6. Timberlands
contributed $123 million to fourth quarter earnings, $1 million more than the third quarter, and $223 million to adjusted
EBITDA. Western Timberlands contributed $101 million to fourth quarter EBITDA compared with $109 million in the
third quarter.
Export log volumes declined due to seasonally slower construction activity and timing of shipments. Average
realizations, however, improved moderately across all export markets as market dynamics remain favorable.
In Japan, housing activity remains solid with wooden housing starts up 8% for the full year. Japanese lumber
inventories which were elevated for much of 2016 after delay in the consumption tax increase continued to decline
through the seasonally slower construction period and are now at more normal levels. This created favorable
supply-demand dynamics and supported improved pricing in the quarter.

Pricing for our Chinese export logs improved also. Fourth quarter log inventories at Chinese ports were largely flat
with third quarter levels and we experienced continued strong takeaway throughout the quarter.
In the Western domestic market, sales volumes were lower as mills took holiday downtime, but average realizations
improved slightly. Low mill inventories drove demand, particularly in Southern Oregon markets.
Our Western crews did a good job adjusting harvest plans to adapt to record October rainfall. Our fourth quarter harvest
volumes were unaffected by weather and we had no infrastructure damage. However, per unit logging cost and road
spending increased compared with the third quarter due to the wetter weather.
Moving to the south, Southern Timberlands contributed $112 million to fourth quarter EBITDA, up $4 million
compared with the third quarter. Southern markets remained flat as mills held adequate inventory and average log
realizations were largely comparable to the third quarter.
Fee harvest volumes increased modestly, as fourth quarter typically includes a higher volume of stumpage sales. As in
the West, our crew successfully flexed harvest settings to adjust to November's severe weather and we had no material
damage to our timberland.
Silviculture expenses declined as fourth quarter typically includes fewer site preparation and hardwood management
activities.
EBITDA for Northern Timberlands totaled $7 million. This was unchanged from the third quarter on comparable prices
and volumes.
The strategic review of our Uruguay operations is proceeding well. We continue to see strong interest and look forward
to providing further information when the review is complete.
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, charts 7 and 8. Real Estate & ENR contributed $13 million to fourth
quarter earnings. Excluding special items, this segment earned $27 million, $12 million more than the third quarter.
EBITDA increased nearly 2.5 times to $90 million.
Our average price per acre declined due to mix, as fourth quarter included a large transaction in Montana, where
timberland prices are regionally lower. For the full year 2016, we sold approximately 83,000 acres or roughly 0.6% of
our land base.
Fourth quarter special items included $14 million of non-cash impairment; these resulted from a change in strategy for
several small legacy Real Estate projects that were formerly targeted for development.
The asset value optimization work continues to proceed well. As we indicated during our December Investor Day,
we've finished applying the AVO process across our Southern ownership and are in the process of listing some of the
500,000 newly identified acres. Our focus is now turned to the West, where we are evaluating our Washington and
Oregon acres. This work is going very well and remains on track for completion by mid-year 2017.
Wood Products, charts 9 and 10. Wood Products contributed $99 million to fourth quarter earnings. The business
delivered full-year 2016 earnings of $512 million, the strongest annual earnings since 2005.
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $132 million, $71 million lower than the third quarter, primarily due to
seasonally lower sales volumes and operating rates. Lumber contributed $57 million to EBITDA, $28 million lower
than the third quarter. Sales volumes declined 12%, average lumber realizations decreased 2%, and Western log costs
increased.
Operating rates were lower and unit manufacturing costs increased due to planned downtime for installation of capital
projects at several of our Southern mills. Heavy rains and regional flooding resulted in modest weather-related
downtime in some of our Western and Southern locations, and higher manufacturing costs for our Canadian mills.
EBITDA for OSB totaled $46 million, $17 million lower than the third quarter. Sales volumes declined 18%, and
average sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Operating rates declined due to downtime for planned

maintenance, as well as repairs to our Sutton, West Virginia mill.
As we previously disclosed, the Sutton mill experienced a fire on November 1. This was an insured event. Repair
activities progressed rapidly and successfully, and the mill resumed full production around year-end. The net fourth
quarter financial impact of this fire on the OSB business was approximately $5 million, the amount of our deductible as
we brought the mill up and received insurance reimbursement faster than expected. We anticipate no net financial
impact from this event in the first quarter, as modest repair expenses should be offset by reimbursements received
within the quarter.
Engineered Wood Products contributed $26 million to EBITDA, $17 million lower than the third quarter. Sales
volumes for Solid Section and I-joists declined approximately 10%, and operating rates were lower due to planned
maintenance and holiday downtime. Average realizations increased modestly.
EBITDA for Distribution totaled $5 million, slightly lower than the third quarter. By focusing on improving product
margins and tightly managing costs, the business performed well in what is typically a seasonally challenging quarter.
I will now turn to discontinued operations, chart 12. We closed the sale of our pulp mills and printing papers business
on December 1 and November 1 respectively. This completed the divestiture of our Cellulose Fibers segment. Net
after-tax earnings from discontinued operations of $489 million are primarily comprised of the gain on these two
divestitures.
Chart 13, operational excellence. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I'm proud that each of our businesses
maintained its relentless focus on improving relative performance, and delivered strong 2016 operating results
throughout the merger integration process.
Each of our businesses met or exceeded its 2016 operational excellence target. Timberlands delivered $42 million of
operational excellence improvements, primarily from merger-related operational synergies. In Wood Products, OpEx
improvements included $16 million in Lumber, $21 million in OSB, $12 million in Engineered Wood Products and $15
million of EBITDA improvement for Distribution. The benefits of these improvements are clearly visible on our
bottom line. In total, Wood Products EBITDA improved by almost $270 million in 2016 compared with 2015.
A $41 per 1,000 square feet year-over-year improvement in our OSB realizations created a tailwind of $120 million.
And in $11 per 1,000 board feet improvement in our lumber realizations provided a tailwind of approximately $50
million. The remaining $100 million dollar improvement was largely attributable to nearly $65 million of Wood
Products OpEx and the addition of the Plum Creek Wood Products mills.
For 2017, we are targeting additional operational excellence improvements of $95 million to $125 million across our
businesses. This includes $40 million to $50 million in Timberlands, $20 million to $25 million in Lumber, $20 million
to $25 million in OSB, $10 million to $15 million in Engineered Wood Products, and $5 million to $10 million in
Distribution.
I will now touch briefly on our merger cost synergies. We've been achieving our targeted cost synergies faster than
anticipated. And as we mentioned in December, the scope of opportunity has exceeded our initial expectations. We
raised our cost synergy target by 25% to $125 million and remain highly confident we will achieve this full amount on
a run rate basis by the end of first quarter 2017.
We also remain on track to eliminate the $35 million of cost formerly allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business no later
than 2017 year-end.
I will close this morning with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. Although discussions between
U.S. and Canadian negotiators continued through the end of 2016, we've been unsuccessful in reaching an agreement.
With the change in administration, negotiations are currently on hold while U.S. Trade Representative and Department
of Commerce appointees are confirmed and take office.
In the meantime, the U.S. International Trade Commission and Department of Commerce have continued to evaluate
the petition for countervailing and anti-dumping duties followed by the U.S. coalition at the end of November.

On January 6, the ITC unanimously determined that there is a reasonable indication that the U.S. has been materially
injured by imports of softwood lumber products from Canada. The U.S. Department of Commerce is currently
conducting an investigation that will result in a determination regarding preliminary duties.
We expect the announcement regarding preliminary countervailing duties in late April, with an anti-dumping
determination following in late June. Our preference remains for a negotiated agreement. The U.S. coalition continues
to work closely with the office of the U.S. Trade Representative and we look forward to resuming negotiations.
I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook.
Russell S. Hagen
Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the first quarter is presented in chart 16 of the earnings slides.
In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the fourth
quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we expect increased log sales volumes and slightly higher average
sales realizations in the first quarter, primarily driven by higher export mix.
Export volumes to Japan and China are expected to increase as a result of the timing of shipments and continued
favorable demand. Domestic log sales volumes and average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the
fourth quarter, as a result of continued stable demand.
Western road costs will decrease due to lower road spending, which is typical in the winter months. Southern harvest
volumes are expected to be seasonally lower than fourth quarter level, as a result of harvest timing in some of our
Southern markets. We expect average sales realizations for the first quarter will be similar to fourth quarter levels.
Silviculture spending in the South will be higher than in the fourth quarter as we perform more forestry activities such
as competition control and fertilization during the first quarter of the year.
In the North, we anticipate first quarter sales volumes will be slightly lower than the fourth quarter, we expect average
sales realizations will be comparable to fourth quarter levels.
Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter are expected to be slight
– significantly lower than the fourth quarter as a result of the timing of our Real Estate sales, with first quarter EBITDA
comparable to the first quarter of 2016. We typically closed fewer transactions in the first quarters and second quarters
of the year, as recreational buyer traffic slows during the winter months. The spring and summer months are the most
active selling seasons, with the largest portion of the sales closing in the second half of the year.
We continue to expect over $250 million of EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources business
in 2017.
As we discussed at our December Investor Meeting, we expect land bases as a percentage of Real Estate sales to be
between 45% and 65% for the full-year 2017.
Wood Products, we anticipate higher sales volume across all product lines in the first quarter as we enter the spring
building season. We expect manufacturing costs will improve, as our operating rates return to normalized levels,
following fourth quarter's decreased levels resulting from maintenance and capital project installations.
Realizations remained relatively strong going into the fourth quarter, as we did not experienced seasonal declines in
Wood Products pricing that typically occur during the holiday season.
We anticipate Lumber and OSB sales realizations in the first quarter will be comparable to fourth quarter levels.
Overall, for Wood Products, we expect adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the first quarter will be higher than the
fourth quarter, and will be roughly $50 million higher than the first quarter of 2016.

Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. For the fourth quarter, the $31 million earnings
variance in unallocated items is driven $20 million increase in non-cash charges related to LIFO inventory adjustments,
profit elimination and foreign exchange.
Moving on to our retirement and pension plans, the year-end 2016 funded status of our defined benefit pension plans
and post-employment retirement plans decreased by $383 million compared to 2015, as a result of a decrease in the
prescribed discount rate.
Discount rates decreased by approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points for both the U.S. and Canadian plans. We
did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2016, and we don't anticipate any cash
contributions in 2017.
Cash paid for all other pension and other post-employment retirement plans in 2016 was nearly a $100 million, which
included one-time payments related to the Plump Creek merger. We expect cash payments in 2017 will be
approximately $70 million. We expect to report approximately $100 million of non-cash unallocated pension and
post-retirement expense in 2017.
Chart 14 summarizes our key financial items. As Doyle mentioned, we closed the sale of the Cellulose Fibers pulp
mills on December 1, pursuant to U.S. GAAP we received and use of cash proceeds from the sale are recorded in
different categories within our cash flow statement.
The $2.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale is shown in cash from the investing activities. Immediately following
the close of the sale on December 1, we used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the $1.7 billion term loan, which you
can see in cash flows from financing activities.
Finally, we paid $494 million of taxes related to the sale of our Cellulose Fibers mills in the fourth quarter, which is
recorded in cash from operations and results in the negative $151 million of net cash from operations.
Excluding the cash taxes paid on the Cellulose Fibers sale, during the fourth quarter of 2016, cash from operations
would have been $343 million.
Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion of long-term debt. We have one scheduled maturity in
August of 2017 for $281 million, which we intend to repay with available cash.
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $207 million, including $22 million related to discontinued
operations. Net of discontinued operations, capital expenditures for the full-year 2016 were $425 million. Looking
ahead to 2017, we expect total CapEx will be approximately $435 million, $300 million for Wood products and $135
million for Timberlands.
Interest expense was $108 million in the fourth quarter. We expect interest expense will be approximately $400 million
in 2017. Our 2016 effective tax rate for continuing operations was approximately 18%, slightly above our earlier
forecast due to a tax adjustment reported as a special item in the fourth quarter in connection with the sale of our
Cellulose Fibers business. For 2017, we expect that tax rate will be between 15% and 17%, based on the forecasted mix
of our earnings for our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.
I'll wrap up with chart 15, which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchase activities. During
2016, we repurchased 68 million shares at an average price of $29.49 per share. There were no share repurchase
activity in the fourth quarter, and we ended the quarter with about 749 million shares outstanding.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and look forward to your questions.
Doyle R. Simons

Entering 2017, I am very optimistic about the opportunities in front of us. We remain strongly committed to driving
industry-leading performance, capturing merger synergies, fully capitalizing on improving markets, and demonstrating
disciplined capital allocation to drive superior value for our shareholders.
And now, I'd like to open the floor for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Anthony.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: With regards to the CapEx guidance, and I think you said $300 million for Wood Products.
Is it possible to say if you're adding or debottlenecking capacity in Lumber and OSB for the year, and roughly what
percent capacity growth you might anticipate? And then specifically with regard to the anti-dumping duties, which we
might get in spring, summer, are you taking steps to rebalance capacity between the U.S. and Canada in your system?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Okay. So, let me start with your second question regarding the anti-dumping duties, and we're
not taking any steps to rebalance, Anthony, as we've talked about previously, if you look at our Canadian operations,
about a third of our Canadian operation – of our production is sold in Canada, a third is sold in export markets outside
the United States, and a third comes into the U.S. Overall, our Canadian Lumber operations is roughly 20% of our
overall Lumber operations, so you take that 20% times a third, it's not a big part of the driver for our Lumber operation.
In terms of CapEx, Anthony, the $300 million is in line with what we've done over the last couple of years, and our
primary focus in our CapEx in our Wood Products operation is low risk, high return projects that drive down our
overall cost structure, and that's been a key part of accomplishing our OpEx.
With that said, some of those projects do, in fact, result in debottlenecking and additional capacity. And as we've also
stated, we are in the process of rebuilding two of our mills, Dierks and Millport, which have been really good mills for
us historically. But in order to significantly drive down the cost structure of those mills, we essentially needed to
rebuild them in place, and that will result in some additional capacity as well. But again, the primary focus is on the
cost side, but we will be increasing capacity as a result of some of the projects that we put in place.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just regarding the Real Estate guidance for 2017. Should we
expect land sales to be weighted towards the South, and maybe the North as you are still working through AVO in the
West? And if you could just talk generally about the demand you are seeing for timberlands and rural lands, and if you
could highlight any difference in demand between the West and the South?
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: Sure, Anthony, this is Russell. So as you know the Real Estate business is a little lumpy, but
getting through our AVO process in the South, and as Doyle indicated, we're starting to work through to bring some of
that AVO work to market. So we identified the 500,000 acres, and now we're starting to bring a portion of that into the
marketplace.
I would expect the activity to be weighted a bit to the South. We still have opportunities in the North, obviously, and
we'll be looking at that. As we get through the AVO process in the West, we'll start looking at what opportunities there
are to bring that to market.
And as far as demand for the rural real estate, the South definitely has continued demand, there's really strong
recreational buyer activity in the South. We do have demand in the North obviously, but it's a little different buyer, and
it's more of a small plot – small timberland plot type ownership, but we see good strong demand in the South for
recreational properties.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - George Leon Staphos>: Thanks. Hi, everyone, good morning, and thanks for all the details.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George Leon Staphos>: Congratulations on the progress. First question, I just want to double check something, I
thought I heard you say, Russell, that the pension liability ultimately went up, I want to say something like $300
million, but you didn't anticipate funding being required this year. If I heard that correctly, could you discuss why? And
I think you also threw out a pension expense figure for this year, but I did not catch that. If you could repeat that that'd
be great?
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: Sure. So, the pension liability or the funded liability was down 383 million, and as far as the
pension expense, it did increase, and that's really a function of a couple of things. The first is the return on the pension
assets. So, we did decrease our rate down from 9% to 8%, and then we have additional amortization of pension loss.
So, that's really driving the increase. And that total on an unallocated basis is $100 million.
And as far as the funding, the funding requirements are really prescribed by GAAP funding, and then IRS funding, so
we don't have any funding requirements in 2017.
<Q - George Leon Staphos>: Okay. Thank you for the clarification there. Could you talk about what operating rates –
recognizing it's early in the year and a lot could change, what kind of operating rates do you think you'll be running at
across the major Wood Products businesses? And then, as it relates to Distribution and Engineered Wood Products, are
you finding any opportunity to further marry those businesses, and have them coordinate to a greater degree and take
share within the large builder pack market?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah, George, in terms of operating rates, we are optimistic about demand as we move into
2017 for all of our products. So, I would tell you there'll be some seasonality as there always is, but I would anticipate
Lumber operating in the low-to-mid 90%s, OSB operating in the low-to-mid 90%s, ELP normally operates about 10%
lower than that so I would anticipate that being in the mid-80%s type range. But as I said, we're encouraged by what
we're seeing in terms of demand. And as we talk to our customers, they are bullish on housing and increasing demand
for all of our products in 2017.
In terms of the coordination between Engineered Wood and Distribution, that's something that here at Weyerhaeuser
we've done a lot of work on, and I would tell you those two operations are working more closely together than they
ever have historically. And that's been very beneficial in driving improvements in both our EWP and our Distribution
business, and I think there will continue to be further opportunities for that coordination as we move forward.
<Q - George Leon Staphos>: Doyle, is there a way to size, if at all what kind of benefit you might get from that in
2017? And then my last question, not that you haven't had great performance on this over the last couple years, but I
noticed a little bit of a pickup in G&A. Is that just still the residual effect of just putting Plum Creek into the business or
are there other expense categories that are growing that you'll need to manage for in 2017? Thank you and good luck in
the quarter.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you, George. In terms of G&A, I would tell you this, the slight increase in fourth
quarter versus third quarter is just timing. We are – if you look at where these companies were before we combined
them in 2015 versus where we're going to end up in 2017, we are highly confident that we're going to meet or exceed
our $125 million target by the end of the first quarter 2017.
And as I said earlier, we are at a basically $100 million run rate through the fourth quarter of 2016. So in really good
shape on our G&A, and as I mentioned earlier the $125 million is 25% higher than what we originally factored in,

In terms of the Engineered Wood Products and Distribution coordination and quantifying that George, as you would
expect that is difficult to quantify, but that is part of the OpEx improvements that we've highlighted in 2017, and there
maybe some upside as these two operations continue to work closer together and figure out a way to drive value for

Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Collin.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: First question from me just – hey. First question from me, just relates to the Lumber dispute.
As we enter the potential look back window, have you started to see any change in Canadian shipments to the U.S. just
more broadly in the marketplace?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Collin, it's hard to tell, yet. I mean we're only into the – through the month of January. And as
you know the look back will be roughly 90 days. So hard to determine, yet if there has been any significant change in
the Canadian activity. As you know, the Canadian activity was up significantly in 2016, and we'll be watching how that
plays in 2017, a lot of rumors floating around, it's still what may or may not happen, but too early to tell, what changes
if any the Canadians maybe taking as we move into 2017 and the potential look back period.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. Thanks for that Doyle. And then switching gears, just I maybe splitting hairs here, but
just your guidance on Real Estate seems to maybe be a little bit more optimistic than the December Investor Meeting.
Just given kind of a language around looking for it to exceed the $250 million in adjusted EBITDA. Am I reading too
much into the language choice there or is there something kind of driving maybe a little bit more optimism on the Real
Estate front?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Well, Collin, what I would tell you is, as we continue to learn more about our Real Estate
operation and what the opportunities there, we continue to be encouraged by the AVO process and what that is
unveiling. So, we are confident that that number will be over $250 million for 2017.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. And then curious, just given the potential for a tax reform, can you touch on how
important 1031 exchanges are to the Real Estate business, I know that's something that Weyerhaeuser legacy had
engaged in to some degree, but how do you think about it now just kind of given your current tax status on a combined
basis?
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: So, Collin, this is Russell. As far as the 1031 program, you're correct, Weyerhaeuser had used
that in the past, and that was primarily because they were in the built-in gains period. So, now they are out of the
built-in gains period, so on a combined basis rather built-in gains period it's really not a tool that we would use going
forward in a meaningful way.
<Q - Collin P. Mings>: Okay. Great. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you, Collin.

Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Can you give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the export market. So lot of
other commodities are seeing a big uplift in volumes to China, are you sensing any of that at all in either logs or lumber
either from North America or from other parts of the world?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So, Gail, we continue to be encouraged about what we see in the export markets. Let's start
with Japan, as you know, that's our biggest market. As we said earlier, prices were up in fact in the fourth quarter,
which was encouraging, volumes were down, but that was due to seasonality and frankly some of the timing of our
shipments, and how the ships played out that were going to Japan, in the first quarter, in line with your point, we do
anticipate volumes will be up, and our best guess right now is flat pricing. But we continue to be encouraged by what
we see out of Japan, housing markets activity was up 8% roughly through the month of November, which is the last
data point that we have.
As we look to China, encouraging there as well. As you know, log inventories continued to be at normal levels, pricing
was in fact up in the fourth quarter, volume again was down seasonally. And then, as we move into the first quarter,
continue to anticipate good demand out of China, and we anticipate volumes up in the first quarter versus the fourth
quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Can you give a little bit more color on the charges on some development projects,
are there any projects that we might have heard of or are they just really small?
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: Yeah, this is Russell, so as we've gone through our AVO process, part of that is also to
identify any kind of small development projects. And Weyerhaeuser had done some small development activities,
really around entitlement and maybe some minimal infrastructure type investment.
As we went through the portfolio, given the change in our strategy, as it relates to development, we chose to move
those into an HBU category and sell through those a little quicker, and because of that, we took the impairment against
those assets, but it's very small properties, select properties, and we don't expect to have any material impairments
going forward in the future.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Doyle, can you give any sense of where your customer log inventories are positioned
moving into the year?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. I would say, customer log inventories in the West are kind of towards the low-end of
normal as we move into the year. And I would say in the South, they are kind of at normalized levels in terms of where
you would have seen log inventories historically.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And one just last one. Obviously, you're looking for fairly stable Southern pricing in
the first quarter. Can you give any perspective on what your outlook is for the year? Are you seeing any traction
building?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Gail, our take is the first and second quarter, we would anticipate pricing to be essentially flat.
We do think there is the possibility of slight improvements in pricing as we move to the second half of the year. And
then as we look further out in that, we continue to be quite optimistic about improvement in Southern log prices, as
housing continues to improve that will drive demand.
As you also know, there are significant projects that are being built and will be coming online in 2017-2018 timeframe,
and we think that is going to drive $12 million, $13 million green turns of additional demand.
And then, of course a big component of this will be what happens with Canada. And we think either as a result of
hopefully a negotiated agreement, which will result in a quota or the duties that that will have an impact on the amount
of lumber that's coming in from Canada, which will result in more demand on Southern saw logs.

So, all those factors, we are encouraged by what we see there, and like I said, we're hopeful that we'll see some slight
improvement in the second half of this year, but more importantly as we move into 2018 and beyond, we think we're
going to see some pricing power in Southern saw logs.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Thank you. A couple of follow-ups. First, you gave us the sense of inventories, the
customers on the logs, do you have a view where they are on Lumber and OSB?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah, Mark, I would tell you that our sense is inventories for Lumber and OSB are pretty
thin. I would say kind of below normal levels and that seems to be how our customers are running their business, but I
would say inventories are lean.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay, and a bit of a hypothetical, but have you been able do any work, have any thoughts, if
a border tax adjustment were to be part of new tax bills, et cetera, what would that mean for Lumber and for that matter
OSB coming in for Canada? I don't know if you've gotten any – if it would be treated any differently or any thoughts on
implications there?
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: Yeah Mark, this is Russell. As far as the border tax adjustment, we've kind of looked at the
implications of that. But as Doyle mentioned, given we have relatively low volumes coming in from the Canadian
operations into the U.S., more primarily a domestic producer and sell into the domestic markets, we don't think it will
have a material impact on our operations or it will effect on us.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Well, I guess, coming from the kind of the other angle. Would it have material implications
on wood coming in from Canada, not produced by you, essentially a homebuilders not going to be as inclined to buy
the wood from the Canadian and essentially access a further umbrella for U.S. pricing?
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: I mean, yeah, I mean there could be a factor in the amount of volume that comes down from
Canada. I would say that's a possibility.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: With a lot of these changes – markets, we're doing a lot of work on it, but it's still too early to
know exactly how these will play out under this administration. But a lot of moving parts that could have, you know,
and frankly potential benefits for our company going forward.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Understood. I appreciate it. And I guess just – whether there was anything that would be
different about materials coming in from Canada – Wood Products coming in from Canada, but there's nothing that's
been talked about that would differentiate from anything else coming in from anywhere, is that fair?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: That – at this point that is generally fair, more work to be done, and more specifics to be
learned. But, I think to your point, if anything, it should be a net positive for our company and the U.S. industry.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. Thanks a bunch.

Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: Yes. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Chip.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: First question is, Doyle, I remember, well, it was about three years ago, when you got into your
current role, it seemed like you had like a couple of years where you were going to improve the – pretty much the
whole Wood Products business, and I think it's fair to say you've exceeded expectations. But I was under the
impression that after those two years, CapEx might come down and you would have sort of be in a position where
maybe you would've accelerated a lot of opportunities.
What I seemed to see today is CapEx is staying elevated, but to be fair you're also having continued high targets, in
fact, and it looks like Lumber and OSB, they're higher for savings in 2017 and 2016. So, the question is, what changed,
has it been that since you've been in there, you have found new things you can do to plants you've already worked on or
are you just expanding the number of plants that you're putting capital in, in order to get these savings?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: And so, it's a good question, Chip. So, when we started this process as you will recall and as
you highlighted two years or three years ago, a lot of the improvements were non-capital improvements, because our
take was show – these mills needed to show that they could make operational excellence improvements without capital,
and then if they could do that then they earn the right to capital to further drive down the cost structure.
So we initially said, okay, let's do this without capital. Once you show that, then you earn the right to capital which will
further drive down the overall structure of our mill set.
So as you said, we've made good progress, there is still more work to be done, but we now have confidence Chip, as we
put in this capital that we will in fact continue to deliver on these OpEx improvements and more importantly than that
continue to drive down the overall cost structure of our mill system, where we will in – the current upturn that we're in,
outperform the competition, and when things do eventually rollover, which we think was many years from now, we
will be black at the bottom.
Now, with that said, Chip, I don't want to give you the sense that this $300 million of capital is going to be the level
forever. We think there is a couple more years of spending at this level to get our mills fully positioned to where they
need to be from a cost perspective, and then you would see capital fall off to a more normalized level in the $200
million to $250 million range.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: Okay. So $200 million to $250 million. And then the second question is, it seems like as we've
looked at the situation here we are in 2017, that there would be a lot of TIMO type partnerships that were established
10 years to 15 years ago that are coming up for – I guess they're maturing or the partnerships are at a point where they
might dissolve, and yet it seems like the timberland market has stayed pretty solid, I don't know if it's great, but it's
been pretty solid. And I didn't know if you had any thoughts as to, are you seeing a lot of these partnerships sort of
extend themselves or are you instead seeing them dissolve, but there is just a solid demand to sort of have new
replacements in terms of investors to take over these ownerships?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. Chip, what I would tell you is, I think timberland markets do continue to be strong and
we see that over and over especially for high-quality timberland, there is a lot of interest in this investment class and for
high-quality timberlands there is a lot of interested buyers, both domestic buyers and frankly international buyers
starting to show up.
So, as these TIMOs do mature, and that is happening, some of them you see being extended due to performance, some
of them you see trading back and forth, but a lot of interest continued in this asset class. And like I said, any process
that's being run and there are some being run, and we participate in just about all of those, there are a number of
interested parties who are part of that.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: Okay. And then last question quickly, any update on sort of your thinking about either the
dividend, dividend policy at this point?

<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah, Chip. So, as we mentioned at our Investor Day, kind of – currently with 90% of our
business assets in timberlands and as you just highlighted, a significantly improved cost structure for Wood Products,
our go-forward cash flow will be much more stable, and that's intentional. We are in the process of discussing the
payout ratio with our board and we will update you when those conservations are complete, but we think there is the
opportunity to increase the payout ratio as we look forward.
In terms of a dividend increase, as we have consistently said for the past few years, we're committed to a sustainable
and growing dividend. As we look into 2017, we're clearly going to benefit from cost and operational synergies,
continued OpEx improvements, and as we've talked about this morning stronger housing markets, so all those things
will be factored in as we work with our board on decisions regarding our dividend.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: Great. Thanks for the update.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Maguire>: Hey, good morning and congratulations on the strong 2016 results.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Brian. Thank you.
<Q - Brian Maguire>: We're seeing some inflation out in the economy these days, definitely a lot of commodity prices
moving higher. Just wondering if you're starting to see that in your business, seeing some cost pressure? And related to
that, maybe just wondering if some of the higher oil and gas prices might have any benefit on the energy part of the
Real Estate segment, just in terms of royalties, and if that's kind of factored into your outlook or not?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. So, on the second part of your question, clearly higher natural gas and oil prices will
benefit our Energy and Natural Resources segment. We have a lot more leverage to natural gas and for every – rough
numbers, just to give you a sense, every $1 improvement in natural gas, $5 million to our bottom line, all else being
equal, but as you would also anticipate, when pricing increases that also gives you the opportunity to go lease more.
We don't have quite that type of leverage to oil, but as oil prices continue to improve, there will be more opportunity
from a leasing perspective.
In terms of commodity price push, we are starting to see a little bit of that, not big numbers at this point, but frankly
that's why OpEx is so important, as we are at some point going to see some cost push. And a big part of our operational
excellence efforts are to make sure we're doing things that offset that or frankly more than offset that, so that the
benefits we see from our increased pricing and volume fall directly to the bottom line.
<Q - Brian Maguire>: Okay. Great. And then, the other area where there's been a lot of volatility lately has been just
in currencies, and I know you've got some sensitivity to the yen. Just wondering what kind of an impact the
post-election move in the dollar is having on realized pricing or competitive trade flows, particularly into Japan, where
I know you've got some competition from some European producers?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. As you said, the strong U.S. dollar continues to be a headwind for us. All of the
currencies that are important to us weakened versus the U.S. dollar after the election, some of them have strengthened
slightly since December. But they overall net-net remain weaker than where they were at the end of the third quarter.
In Japan, as you said, the risk there is the strong U.S. dollar pressures prices, our customers' products compete with
lower cost lumber imports from Europe. But as I said earlier, despite all that, we continue to have good demand for our
logs into Japan. And we actually saw some fall-off in the imports that were coming in from Europe during that time
period. So net-net, while it's not a positive, we've worked through that and continue to have good demand from our
Japanese customers, and part of that's built on the long-term relationship and unique relationship we have with our

customer base in Japan.
<Q - Brian Maguire>: Okay. Just one last one, if I could. Just on the corporate expense in the quarter and the outlook
there going forward, I think there was maybe a LIFO or inventory hit there in the quarter; I assume that was maybe just
a year-end true-up, but just thinking about what kind of a run rate level we're at going into 1Q there. And as you
remove some of the stranded costs from Cellulose Fibers, where you think we'll be kind of ending the year there?
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: So this is Russell. As far as the $14 million LIFO adjustment, that was a combination of
LIFO and profit elimination, and that was really a function of increasing inventories at year-end. Then also bringing on
some of the Montana inventories that were legacy to Plum Creek, and so we increased log inventories, particularly in
those regions for – anticipating winter break-up. So it's really just an increase in inventory was the driver for the LIFO
and profit elimination.
As Doyle mentioned, we are on track to capture our synergy targets, $125 million by the end of first quarter, and then
we are on track to capture the additional $35 million of CF stranded costs by the end of 2017, and we're making good
progress on both those accounts.
<Q - Brian Maguire>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark Connelly>: Thanks, Doyle. Just expanding on Chip's question, are the nature of the operational excellence
improvements in Timberlands any different now. I'm just curious whether things are evolving there, and maybe
maturity schedules and things are getting involved?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah so, I would say the biggest difference in Timberlands versus where we were the first
two years or three years are the additional opportunities that have been presented as a result of combining
Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek. So a portion of the $42 million that we got in 2016 was due to those operational
synergies, the ability to rebalance wood flows to minimize cost and increased realization, optimize the silviculture cost
based on our larger scale.
And then frankly just best practices in harvesting and transportation, both again as a result of scale. But maybe even
more importantly learning from each other. There were some things that Weyerhaeuser, when we've got in there and
looked at it did better and lower cost than Plum Creek, and there were some things that Plum Creek did.
So, you know as we move forward, while we're confident in having what I would say are fairly significant targets $40
million to $50 million in 2017, and I would anticipate a similar number in 2018 are because of the opportunities that
have been created by combining these two companies, taking best practices, taking advantage of the larger scale, both
from a ability to service customers, rebalance wood flows and drive down the overall cost structure of our Timberlands
operations. So really excited about that. And I can tell you our folks are really excited about it, as they almost on a daily
basis find additional opportunities for OpEx as a result of the combination.
<Q - Mark Connelly>: That sounds great. Just one point of clarification, in Real Estate you mentioned a shift to the
South. But is there anything lumpy or should we start to think of this as a relatively normal quarter in terms of
realizations?
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: So as I mentioned earlier in my comments, you know the first and second quarter are pretty
kind of low volume of sales. And so, you know we're guiding for lower amount than fourth quarter. Real Estate sales
can be a little lumpy, it depends on the character of the transactions. And so it's a little difficult to predict. And then, in
the second half, we'll see it will pick up. So, that's pretty much the pattern we would expect pretty low in the first
quarter and second quarter, and then picking up in the third quarter, and then a lot of closings really occurring in the

fourth quarter.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: And Mark, in terms of the value from the different components, so it really is depending on as
you very well know there is different value components in the North, tend to be lower per acre South, higher than that,
and then, of course, the West even higher than that on a per acre basis. So, it's really just going to depend on what the
mix is. And as Russell said, yeah, at least initially it will be more weighted to the South and the West. And then, as we
move to the West, as we complete our AVO process, that will factor in on a per acre value.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Mark.
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: Good morning.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Doyle, I wonder if you and Russell could just give us some sense of kind of how your
appetite is right now for kind of Timberland acquisitions, and where your biases would be just regionally?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: You know Mark, I'll tell you that right now our focus, what I'd like to say number one,
number two and number three is continuing to make sure we fully capitalize on the value that we can create by
combining Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek and driving the synergies and other benefits to the bottom line. So, that's
what we're primarily focused on.
As we continue to work through that, and as I'd like to say earn the right to continue to grow, we will be looking at
Timberland acquisitions to potentially grow our company. With that said, with the scale we have and the diversity of
geography we have we don't have to grow, so we can be very disciplined as we move forward.
In terms of South versus the West, we're basically like both of those markets, and would look – so it's not a waiting
more to one than the other, we both – we like both the South and the West. And we'd look to potentially growing both
of those as we move forward.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay. And then on the other side of the equation, Doyle, just I know you're still in the
midst of the valuation down in Uruguay, but can you just give us some sense of sort of any tax consequences on that
sale?
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: Hey Mark, this is Russell. Pardon me. Right. Yeah. Thanks for the qualification. If that were
the case, we would have minimal tax impacts on that transaction.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay. Right. Doyle, one of the last question I had is just over in Engineered Wood, I
know that there have been some conservations about sort of more fire code restrictions around particularly I-joists, can
you just kind of update us on what that situation is and how Weyerhaeuser kind of deals with those changes in
regulation?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good question, Mark. And there are a lot of various regulations, potential regulations
regarding that. I can tell you we're doing an immense amount of work on that front. We've got a really good technology
group that is looking for different applications that you can put on Engineered Wood Products, that will in fact extend –
it's called the burnthrough test, extend that, and as a result of that meet any additional requirements that maybe put
forth from that. So, again a lot of work being done on that, very encouraged about what we've seen so far in the tests
that we're running, and think we will be well-positioned as we go forward in EWP.

<Q - Mark William Wilde>: And how widespread is this Doyle, is this kind of a state-by-state or is this more of a
national basis?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: No, it's clearly state-by-state, that's the way these things work, and again a lot of uncertainty
regarding exactly what that may look like and what the timing maybe, but we've been on top of it and feel good about
the opportunities to do deal with this on a go-forward basis.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay. Just a last question also on I-joists. I just – I noticed in your graph that prices of
I-joists have been kind of trending down over the last I don't know four quarters or six quarters, yet at the same time
kind of the inputs for like OSB for wet stock are actually going up. So, would you expect to see kind of those higher
input costs starting to roll through to I-joists prices here over the next few quarters?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah, Mark, I do think there is the opportunity for price improvement in EWP as we move
through 2017.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay. Very good. Good luck this year guys.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Russell S. Hagen>: Thank you.
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Quinn>: Yeah. Thanks very much and good morning gentlemen.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good Morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Quinn>: Hey, just a question on Softwood negotiations. You mentioned that government employments
haven't been made yet, so there is no government-to-government negotiations, but maybe you could just give us some
color on whether the industry is talking and whether you are making any progress and when you expect
government-to-government negotiations to start?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah. I think it's going to take a little bit of time, Paul, to get the appointments in place and
approved and get up to speed. So I can't tell you exactly when negotiations will start again, but it's going to take a little
bit of time.
In terms of the U.S. coalition, a lot of work continues to be done, just to so we don't lose any momentum during this
period of time. I think the U.S. coalition are all on the same page, and like I said, are hopeful of a negotiated settlement
as we move forward.
<Q - Paul Quinn>: Good. That's all I had. Best of luck guys.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: All right. Thank you. Take care.
Doyle R. Simons
So as I understand it, that was our final question. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And as
always, really appreciate your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Take care.
