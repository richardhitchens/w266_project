These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please
note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake
no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of

we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in
our earnings press release.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon, everyone. It's Patrick and you may remember we mentioned last quarter that Larry
will no longer be joining us on a regular basis on this call, as he focuses his energy on running the company, but
consistent with our prior calls Nikesh and I will be here. We'll cover the performance as well as answer any questions
you have about the business, including significant ad product launches or other developments. And in the case you have
a very, very detailed product-related question in some cases we may simply take it offline with you. But with that, why
don't we just dive into the details of our financial performance for Q4?
Our gross total consolidated revenue for the quarter was $16.9 billion and the overall business was up 17%
year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google segment gross revenue grew a healthy 22% year-over-year
to $15.7 billion, and it was up 14% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations the Google segment revenue
growth would have been 23% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google sites revenue was up 22%
year-over-year to $10.6 billion and was up 12% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the strength of our core search
advertising business.
Network revenue was up 3% year-over-year at $3.5 billion and was up 12% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven in
part by easier year-over-year comparisons as we anniversaried some of our ad policy changes implemented at the end
of 2012, but we also saw improved year-over-year growth from our Ad Exchange. Finally, Google's other revenue
grew 99%, almost double year-over-year to $1.6 billion and was up 34% quarter-over-quarter. The digital sales of apps
and content in our Play store drove the year-over-year growth in this line, as did hardware sales and the Play hardware
sales drove a big chunk of quarter-over-quarter growth.
Turning to Motorola segment, gross revenue was $1.2 billion. As we announced yesterday, Lenovo plans to acquire our
Motorola business for approximately $2.9 billion. This is great news for Motorola and the Android ecosystem. And as
Larry noted in our press release, Lenovo has the expertise and the track record to scale Motorola Mobility into a major
player within the Android ecosystem.
Coming back to our Google segment, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 31%
year-over-year and up 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 11% year-over-year, and
down 2% quarter-over-quarter. And please note that currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q4 on the
cost-per-click. Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors discussed on previous calls
including FX, geographic mix, platform mix, property mix as well as product and policy changes.
Turning to geographic performance of our Google segment, we saw improved performance in the U.S. and the U.K.
and strong performance in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides you can find on our Investor Relations website
you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the
benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.

U.S. revenue was up 16% year-over-year to $6.9 billion. The U.K. was up 15% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, which
includes a small $2 million benefit from our hedging program. So currency fluctuation had minimal impact on U.K.
revenues in Q4. Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 30% year-over-year to $7.3 billion and this
accounted for 46% of our total revenue, which included, again, a very small benefit from our hedging program. In fixed
FX terms, the rest of the world grew a strong 33% year-over-year.
So let's come back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was
$4 billion in Q4, excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses
totaled $4.8 billion, again excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. And our non-GAAP operating profit was $4.8
billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 29%.
For our Google segment specifically, our traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion, or 24% of total advertising revenue.
The other cost of revenue was $2.8 billion, excluding $127 million of stock-based compensation. And our Google
segment operating expenses were $4.3 billion, again excluding SBC of $746 million. Depreciation and amortization
expenses on property, plant and equipment for the Google segment was $660 million this quarter. And Google segment
profitability was $5.3 billion in Q4, resulting in a Google segment operating margin of 34%.
At Motorola, total segment operating expenses, including cost of revenue, were $1.6 billion, excluding $29 million of
SBC and $15 million of restructuring charges for Motorola. And keep in mind that intangible amortization expenses
attributed to Google segment and Motorola segments are included in these segment measures.
Of the $279 million in consolidated intangible amortization expense this quarter, $153 million was a result of the
acquisition of Motorola, of which $116 million was allocated to Google and $37 million was allocated to the Motorola
segment. As a result, the operating loss for the Motorola segment was $384 million in Q4, and the operating margin for
that segment was negative 31%.
Our head count for the consolidated business was up roughly 1,300 people in Q4. Google segment added 1,700 people
during the quarter. And in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter with approximately 48,000 full-time
employees. Our effective tax rate was 16% in Q4. This tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continuing mix shift of
earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
Let me now turn to cash management. Our OI&E was $125 million for the quarter. Interest income and realized gains
on investments offset the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense from our hedging program. For more detail on
OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.2 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.3 billion. In
this quarter, the majority of our CapEx spend was related to production equipment, data center construction and real
estate purchases.
As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest for the long-term, and our infrastructure
continues to be a key strategic area for us to invest. Our free cash flow in consequence of all this, was $3 billion.
So there you have it. Strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth
opportunities including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Enterprise, just to name a few.
Before I wrap up, I want to cover two quick things. First want to remind everybody, as I do every time at this time of
year, that as we start a new year things, such as employer taxes, 401(k)s, and all these other related accruals tend to be
frontloaded in the year. So please consider this as you model your forecasts.
And second, before I hand it off to Nikesh, I want to give an update on our issuance of Class C shares. Our board of
directors has formally approved a Class C dividend, and has set March 27 as the record date and April 2 of this year is
the issuance date. So we expect the Class C shares to begin trading on April 3.
And we're excited to announce that the Class C shares will actually trade under our original ticker, that is, GOOG,
while the Class A shares will trade under a new ticker, GOOGL. We're setting up a link on our Investor Relations site
so it can give you more information on the Class C dividends.

And with that, I'll let Nikesh cover the details of our business performance in the quarter, and after his remarks we'll
open up the phone lines for questions. So here you go, Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick.
As Patrick mentioned, our business had a strong quarter at $15.7 billion in Google segment gross revenue. Overall,
performance was strong in Retail and Automotive and CPG sectors. We had particularly good growth in Asia-Pacific,
including its various emerging countries, as well as in Southern Europe.
I want to talk about three areas that are fueling growth for Google and our clients. First, our continued efforts to help
performance marketeers reach customers and drive action across screens. Second, our continued progress in banner
advertising, and third, our ad technology platforms used by thousands of agencies and publishers. Then I'll say a few
words about new areas like Digital Content, Hardware and Enterprise.
On performance. Performance advertising continues to be a mainstay of our core business. We're seeing good growth.
It's driven primarily by increased search activity across all screens. It is driven by new measurement features and more
sophisticated marketeers that are aligning their Search and Display Advertising strategies. Last year we made the move
to Enhanced Campaigns in AdWords. Twelve months in, marketeers tell us it helps them get results and reach people
across screens in a big way. Our internal slogan for this is, "Advertisers' ROIs don't lie."
We also rolled out Estimated Total Conversions. Marketeers can now measure results like calls and conversions that
take place in different devices. For example, 1-800-Flowers discovered a 7% increase in overall conversions when they
figured out that conversions that start in one device, and end on the other. This is a great example of our vision as it
relates to seamless multi-screen marketing and something that was the impetus for us to launch Enhanced Campaigns.
In the holiday season, one thing has become very clear. The web has truly become the new holiday store window. It's
the first place people go, and it's where everyone gets excited about holiday shopping. In the U.S., Walmart continues
to use Google Search more and more. They're investing with us more than ever before to drive sales during the holiday
season.
There's also great momentum in product listing ads, and we continue to improve the experience for shoppers and
retailers. Last quarter Google Shopping came to eight more countries. We even help deliver products to your doorstep
in just a few hours. Google Shopping Express, our same-day delivery service has been opened to shoppers in the Bay
Area since last year. And we're very pleased with the feedback we've gotten from our partners and users.
Now moving on to brand marketing. Working closer and closer with brand advertisers has been a big priority for us,
and we're making great strides. You might have seen all the teaser ads running on YouTube ahead of the big game
Sunday. Given my personal passion for cricket, and lack of pretty much any knowledge of American football, I decided
to turn to Google Trends and see who's leading. I see the Seahawks have more searches than the Broncos, so that's my
bet for the Super Bowl. But folks in Denver better get searching if they want the Broncos to win. I don't know what that
means for the big game on Sunday, but I do know that we are becoming a central to the biggest brand-building
campaigns in the world.
There are three big areas of focus that brands and our agency partners really like: first, building out great content on
YouTube. YouTube gives brands amazing reach, and a passionate unique audience you can't get elsewhere. YouTube
has over a billion viewers per month, and saw a 50% increase in daily watch time last year.
Second, the best digital marketing captivates people when it's by the web for the web. It's so much more than simply
taking television ads and transplanting them on YouTube. So we're investing in creative ad formats that pivot around
user engagement like TrueView, or engagement ads across the web. Last year for the first time, three videos by brand
marketeers were in YouTube's list of top 10 videos for 2013.

Third and importantly, better measurement that enables brands and agencies to measure and optimize campaigns based
on metrics like reach, recall, or awareness. Last quarter we enabled advertisers in our Google Display Network to start
buying ads based on viewable impressions, a fancy way of saying ads that people actually saw. In November, we began
testing Nielsen OCR, measurement on YouTube and our network. There's a lot more to come here, but it's an important
step to helping brands invest online.
We think our efforts are really resonating with major clients and agencies from around the world. Our sales team
continues to fire on all cylinders, and I'm really pleased we hired Kirk Perry as our President of Brand Solutions from
Proctor & Gamble. His role is to help the largest brands and agencies in the world embrace digital marketing more and
more. He speaks their language, so we hope that he'll be able to convince them that the future for brands is truly digital.
We worked with Kraft to build a series of engagement ads, showcasing brand videos, recipes, and coupons for its new
Fresh Take brand. That campaign was very successful and left an impressive 2.9% engagement rate and an average
engagement time of 48 seconds.
Moving on to our ad technology platforms, our DoubleClick buying tools continue to be the choice of agencies around
the world, and we're really benefiting from the growth in programmatic spend. One trend we're seeing is the move
towards private ad exchanges in which a premium publisher uses our technology to make ad space available to a small
number of hand-picked high-quality and highly qualified advertisers. This can provide a very safe, real-time
environment for both brand and publishers. The volume of impressions running through our private exchanges has, on
average, doubled every quarter over the past year. Overall, our monetization solutions like our Ad Exchange, AdSense
and AdMob are helping major publishers maximize their revenues from digital advertising.
So that's our core ads business. Let's talk about our trifecta of emerging new businesses: Google Play, Hardware and
Enterprise. Google Play continues to win the hearts and minds of people, the latest books, newspapers and magazines,
20 million songs, thousands of movies, textbooks all access music. You can live your life in Google Play. People love it
so far.
This quarter we introduced the Google Play newsstand that brings together more than 2,000 free and paid news sources,
including newspapers like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and we also introduced Google
Play for education, designed for schools with educator-approved apps, as well as tools to easily set up a classroom of
tablets in minutes.
We had a strong holiday season for our growing suite of hardware products. One of the things that has done really well
for us is Chromecast. It continues be a living room favorite, remaining a best-selling product throughout the entire
quarter. We've also been adding to the growing list of content available through Chromecast with new supported apps
like Hulu Plus, HBO GO, and Pandora, with more to come.
Chromebooks are seeing great momentum with eight of the top manufacturers of computers now making
Chromebooks, including new devices from both Dell and Toshiba. One in four devices sold into K-12 education in the
U.S. is a Chromebook according to Future Source.
We're also seeing strong momentum in Nexus hardware with great reception for Nexus 5. And as cars become more
connected, we recently teamed up with the automotive and technology leaders Audi, GM, Honda, Hyundai and NVidia
to form the Open Automotive Alliance.
Our enterprise business continues to grow steadily as more businesses than ever want their employees to work the way
they live. We're seeing great momentum in the retail space, the British supermarket, Waitrose; the clothing retailer,
Chico's; and the fashion accessory brand, Fossil have all gone Google this quarter.
On the cloud platform side, we announced the Google computer engine is now generally available supporting
additional operating systems at new lower prices.
But before I close, also want to give a shout out to our marketing team, in particular they have really helped drive the
success of Google Play and our hardware products over the holidays. They've been able to do that through great
effective advertising and creating awesome retail environments. And of course thanks to all the Googlers and our

partners for helping us have a terrific quarter. You're not just embracing the future; you're helping to shape it.
With that, I'll hand it over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. So, Jamie, we'll look for your instructions to open the lines and get on to the Q&A please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Thank you. Two quick questions. Patrick, if you took your five or six major geographies for
Search and for each of them you plotted separately the evolution of CPCs for mobile and for PCs and tablets, and you
look at these curves from 5000 feet, would they be mostly going up, down, flat or all over the place?
And secondly, could you let us know if Google Compute Engine and Google App Engine are significant drivers of
CapEx, 5% or more of your CapEx? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: All right. So let me jump by the second one first. Look, Compute Engine, most of our CapEx
right now is really driven by data center construction, and machines that are actually driving both the core businesses of
Google, and of course App Engine. But App Engine I wouldn't describe as any of the core areas where we're seeing a
ton of growth. Not that App Engine is not successful, it's just when you compare to Search or other elements that kind
of use a lot more capacity.
In the case of your first question, it's very clear that we don't usually break down each of these geographies. But the
fundamental trends are happening across the web, right? And in the same way. So all this issue of some markets are
growing much faster, which is the emerging markets. So you can see that, you can infer that from our results obviously.
Clearly there's a shift between all those platforms, whether they be mobile, tablet and desktop again across the world.
So you can infer that, as well. Our sites versus Network, the U.S. is a strong Network area. Everybody knows that, and
so you can basically kind of, from your own inference, pick and part these kind of elements. But they together move to
actually really make the ecosystem vibrant and growing.
And at the end of the day, what you have, it's just a – how did you say it? "ROIs don't lie," Nikesh? So at the end of the
day, that's what you're pleased about. You're pleased about great results for our users that give them exactly the right
answer they're looking for, and great answers for advertisers. So that's how actually you should think about it, Carlos.
Thank you for your question. Let's go to our next question, Jamie.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Mark May with Citi. Mr. May, if you would check your mute button. At this
time we cannot hear you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Why don't we go to the next question, and then Mark can show back up.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.

<Q - Jordan C. Monahan>: Oh, great. Thank you. It's actually Jordan for Scott. I guess two quick questions. The first
is, you didn't talk much about Nest, and so we were curious whether you were primarily interested in their design team,
or product, or something else?
Then on the other revenue line, what was the contribution to the other revenue line from the Chromebook or Chrome
otherwise in the Enterprise?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: All right. Thank you for your question, Scott. In the case of Nest, Nest and Google share a real
common vision. Nest – both of us believe that technology should be doing the hard work so that people can get on with
their lives, and do great things. So our goal is really in the case of Nest, is to help them scale, and bringing the
resources of Google to increase their investments, reach broader audiences, and then scale internationally. So for us it's
a terrific opportunity, and then bring people – being able to attract people like Tony and Matt to the team is actually
wonderful. So that's really the context of Nest.
Your second question – let me just go back to your second question. The other revenue line. Well, actually as I
mentioned in my comments, the other revenue, it really grew well, just under 100% year-over-year. If you look
year-over-year, the biggest contribution was actually on the Play apps and content. But quarter-over-quarter, because of
seasonality, obviously it's hardware but it's both a combination of Nexus 5, which was very strong for us, and the
Chromecast. You've got to remember that most of the Chromebooks are actually sold through other parties. So we're
really a facilitator rather than – so we don't book revenue on the Chromebooks. So that's really the puzzle, Scott.
Thank you for your question. Why don't we go to the next question please?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Nikesh, I just wanted to ask you about YouTube in
particular. If you could help us understand the growth that you're seeing in terms of YouTube advertising revenue?
And then secondly, just on Nielsen OCR tagging, if you could give us some early marketer feedback in terms of what
you're seeing there and then a little bit more color on your decision to go with outside measurement, rather than how
you've been doing it internally? Thanks.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, sure. Look I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, YouTube is part of our core
advertising business and both Search and YouTube are doing well for us around the world. It is part of a broader shift
where we're seeing brand marketeers and, as I said, our strength this quarter was not just from retail or automotive, also
from CPG. And part of our ability to get CPG customers to come and advertise with us is our ability to convince them
that brands can be built on the Internet, and YouTube clearly is a key player in our brand story vis-à-vis advertisers
because they still think visually, they still think video when they think brand advertising, not just text ads.
So I think YouTube is definitely a key part of our brand story and it continues to do well. I think our teams around the
world have sort of figured out how to pitch YouTube to large customers and customers are paying attention. So I think
YouTube continues to do well in addition to our core Search business and people are seeing the value of YouTube
vis-à-vis brands.
In terms of the OCR tagging and our decision to do it internally versus externally, I think in the long term what
advertisers want is a third party to endorse various media. It's very hard for us to being a media owner to be the person
providing measurement against our own media. At the same, time we believe there is tremendous amounts of
development that can be done in the space of measurement where traditional measurement has been both set up after
the fact and also has been on a very limited set of parameters. And we believe we as a team can not only increase the
parameters that you can measure, given the digital world, we also believe that you can look at different metrics
simultaneously in a dynamic way and also create new metrics for the future.

So our metrics efforts internally have been focused towards hitting future metrics as well as more dynamic metrics, as
opposed to passive or legacy metrics, but that's work that we continue to do. We continue to work with third-party,
parties outside, including Nielsen and other players in the industry because we believe that's where the measurement
industry needs to go and eventually we have to work with them to get them to evolve with us in that direction.
In terms of the early feedback from Nielsen OCR tagging, I think it's sort of like – it's table stakes. You have to have
Nielsen OCR or some metric that is common across various media in the market for you to be – for advertisers to be
able to measure your effectiveness or your relevance vis-à-vis somebody else. And so I think what we've done – this is
just early table stakes which is just sort of the comfort factor for advertisers that they see that, take a look at Nielsen
OCR metrics vis-à-vis us and other people and get a sense that they're not spending their money in an unwise fashion,
but I think there's tremendous amounts of evolution and development that's going to happen in this space.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thanks, Nikesh.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Nikesh. Jamie, why don't we go to the next question?
Operator
And we will take question from Mark May with Citi.
<Q - Mark A. May>: I apologize about earlier. A question around Google Play. I believe today – and just the app
business, mobile app business in general for Google – I believe today you don't do a lot in the way of app marketing,
for instance app install type advertising. First, is that true? And if so, is that an opportunity for Google?
And then secondly, it seems like that there's a lot of discussion in the market and dollars being put against
identity-based ad targeting in addition to, or in lieu of, cookie-based advertising. What are your thoughts on that? And
how is Google, if you think that's a trend, a positive trend, how is Google taking advantage of those new forms of ad
targeting?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thanks, Mark. This is Nikesh. In terms of your first question in the area of app install, yes
clearly it has become a larger market recently with this whole mobility factor, where everybody's trying to get more
and more mobile. We have solutions, we have always had solutions as part of our AdMob product as well as our
AdSense products where advertisers can use those forms of advertising towards creating app installs. And we continue
to work hard to see where else in our various portfolio of services we can introduce the idea of app install, so you'll
hear more from us in that area in the future. But I think you're right, this is an opportunity and we continue to work
hard towards making this opportunity real, not just with our existing products but also looking at other ways that we
can keep driving this.
In terms of your question around cookies and alternatives for cookies, I think it's fair to say that there's a lot of
conversation around cookies. There's a lot of stuff going on in terms of how we do we continue to evolve this area of
technology and make sure that we give the users more control and also make sure that users have security in terms of
what data gets transferred [indiscernible] (28:44) and increase the transparency. So our teams are working on this.
There's some early concepts in our teams where they're trying to see how they can evolve this notion in all three
perimeters that I mentioned, but I think it's too early to talk about what those precise solutions are likely to be. Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks for your question. Jamie, let's go to the next question, please.

And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.

cards that you actually already have in that system, can you give us any help understanding the quantity there? Are you
measuring in the hundreds of millions, tens of millions?
And then separately, Nikesh, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on initiatives to improve ad attribution
and measurement, and specifically, measuring online to offline attribution? Thanks.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: [indiscernible] (29:42), thank you very much for those questions. I think, let me start with
Google Wallet. I think the best way to think about what Google Wallet is trying to achieve is, we're constantly trying to
reduce the friction from somebody doing a Search to trying to actually acquire something, whether that is going from
online to online, from online to Mobile, from Mobile to Mobile, or even online to off-line, like you referred to in your
question at the end. So the hope of our team is to make sure we reduce the friction and of course create higher degree of
security and comfort vis-à-vis the end-user, so they get a better experience. Now Google Wallet is actually a team that
is run by our Commerce team, which works with Sridhar, who works with Larry.
And I think the best way to think about it is, as people go more and more mobile, we're noticing a lot more people are
spending time buying apps and digital content on the mobile devices, and they end up signing up for Google Wallet as
part of their Google Play experience. So we are seeing lots more – lots of users use those services. I'll leave it to you to
infer how many Android users there are and how many Google Play users there are, and what proportion of them are
buying goods and services from us. So that gives you a sense of Google Wallet. It's definitely a number that we're very
happy with and it continues to grow.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks for your question again. And Ben, this is a complex question. You can always refer
back to the IR team for more details on this stuff. Jamie, why don't we go to our next question please?
Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. A couple things. We are seeing rest-of-world revenues accelerate. Does that have any benefit
from Product Listing Ads [PLA], or some of the mobile changes you made to the platform and maybe you could talk
about how those are going?
And then sales and marketing went up quite a bit in Q4. I was just wondering if that was related to Motorola? Thank
you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So why don't I take the second one, and then I'll let Nikesh talk about the PLA. Sales and
marketing in Q4 was actually just really tied to the holiday season. We had great momentum on the Nexus 5, and the
Chromecast. So at that time of year we decided when we have such winner products, we would actually support them
in addition to a number of other areas where we actually invest. So very, very pleased with the performance of both of
those, as well as Chromebooks, which have been, if you look in the press the feedback you get is, number one, number
two in so many markets. So very, very pleased of actually kind of making that investment in these core products.
For the PLA I'll turn it over to Nikesh.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Hi, Justin. Yeah, to break your question down in terms of, there are two or three parts to your
question. I think in terms of the growth in the rest of the world, effectively the growth we're seeing in the rest of the
world is actually in our core Search Advertising business, and it's across the board. It's across our various products. As I
mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done a lot of work on Enhanced Campaigns and trying to drive solutions
from a multi-screen perspective. What you're really seeing is not a particular screen or a particular format, it's actually
something which is allowing advertisers to come in and say, hey, I'd like to acquire more customers,
I'd like more people on my website, I'd like more people in my store. And effectively then spending money and us
helping them optimize across multiple screens how that money should be effectively spent, and then measuring their
ROIs and saying, this is good, I need to spend more money in this direction. So it's not a particular change in our
mobile platform, or any other platform. It is actually, really our move towards Enhanced Campaigns, which is helping

us to strengthen our core business.
Vis-à-vis product listing ads, we've talked about this a few quarters ago, that how we are moving from ten blue links in
certain categories to more entry-level results, and product listing ads is a prime example of how it's happening
effectively. We are seeing adoption, as I mentioned, we've added eight more countries this quarter. So this part of a
continued evolution and it's adding value to both our end-users, shoppers, as well as our retailers. So it's clearly giving
us benefit, our users benefit, and obviously more relevant results allowing merchants to reach specific audiences.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks for your question, Justin. Jamie, we'll go to our next question, please.
Operator
And our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Stephen D. Ju>: Hey, guys. So I've always thought of Motorola as an asset for Google to push the agenda for
both hardware and software innovation to the OEMs. So how does the sale to Lenovo affect your ability to do that?
Also, was your ownership of Motorola ever an impediment to having a closer working relationship with any of the
other OEMs before? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Well, the short answer is, we believe that this is a great transaction where everybody wins. I
think that Motorola will find in the mature handsets, a terrific partner and will provide scale and continued, really,
momentum on what is now done very well which is develop world-class product.
In addition to that, Motorola let's never forget, right, has really strengthened our Android ecosystem and done a terrific
job on that. So I think that both from a perspective of the hardware itself in the handset area as well as for the core
Android ecosystem, I think it's a real win-win for everybody.
In addition to that, right, as you know, from the Nest acquisition and Glass and wearables, we continue to innovate. We
continue to be committed to hardware in areas that are kind of enterprising, promising new frontiers and that's where
actually we're focusing on. So I think all in all, quite a great story.
Thank you so much, Stephen, for your question. Let's go to our next question, Jamie.
Operator
And we'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the question. I guess broader question for the long term around your
e-commerce initiatives, just understanding how you envision continuing to partner more deeply with offline retailers,
how PLAs play into that, and maybe an update on what you've seen early days from the Google Shopping initiative in
San Francisco and now it seems to have expanded into a second market? Thank you.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: I think the best way to think about it is that what is was happening is over time people are
looking – when they look on the web they look for more and more precise answers and which was the genesis of why
we believe that entry-level search begins to make more and more sense. Whether it's in travel, whether it's in hotels,
whether it's in product listings, people are looking for more specific answers, and as you get mobile you want even
more bite-sized answers so that people can get the information as quickly as they want. So that sort of is the genesis of
product listing ads.
If you take that to its logical conclusion, that is people declaring intent that they would like something and that gives
you a sense and a signal that okay clearly if they're looking for something they more than likely wanting to buy it at
some point in time. So we see our role as trying to enable the entire ecosystem across the board of retailers both online
and offline to be able to provide those goods and services directly to the end user as quickly as possible with the least

amount of friction. And friction comes in their ability to find it, friction comes in their ability once they've found it to
buy. That's why things like Instant Buy exist in Google Wallet where you can have instant purchasing capability. And
then of course there's the notion of gratification once you bought it, I want it as quickly as I can get it.
So you can see that our product initiatives are sort of triangulated across all of these things, whether it's PLA in terms
of the ability to find it, whether it's payment capabilities to try and close the loop, or whether it's delivery experiments
where we see how can we get it to you as soon as possible? So it's more of an open system approach to be fair, where
we can help the entire ecosystem of our various partners, and you can see that our teams are working really hard
towards this enabling vision. But it takes time and great execution.

And we'll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Good afternoon. You've talked in the past about Enhanced Campaigns as being the most
significant change to AdWords since its inception, and can you give us a little bit of context to it's been rolled out for
six months now. Is it fully up and running? Are advertisers fully embraced? Or at what period do think that we're going
to kind of hit its stride with enhanced campaigns? Thanks.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Hey, Gene. Yes of course. Actually it's been a year since we started talking about Enhanced
Campaigns, and we're very happy with the progress. It's fully embraced, it's fully up and running around the world, our
thousands and thousands of salespeople around the world are trained, our customers and advertising partners have
understood that, that's the way for them to go target audiences and users and really focus on ROI metrics. As we talked
about we even launched the notion of Estimated Total Conversions so we can look at – let people think about it in a
multi-screen way because more and more we're seeing that people do not distinguish the activity they conduct on one
screen.
So earlier we said that people usually search on their desktop and on their mobile devices when they're mobile, they do
different things, but we're noticing across any screen you get the sense of pretty much the same activity that happens,
which means that advertisers should be somewhat agnostic on where they're able to reach the user. They should want to
reach the user wherever they are.
So our thesis has been proven right. Advertisers are embracing it, users are exhibiting those behavioral patterns, so it's
provided honestly tremendous amount of efficiency in our ability because we don't need specialists in various screens,
various technologies to try to work with advertisers. We can have one team work with this product which our product
teams have created which makes it very, very simple and people can look to the ROI they get from spending money
with us or in the digital economy as opposed to having to break it down in silos. That doesn't need to happen.
So it's been very successful. We're very happy with it. I think it's in its full stride and the effects that you don't see, the
effects we see internally in the amounts of efficiency and clarity. And then our ability to work with advertisers and
them being able to measure their ROI effectively.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Do you think it could have kind of an increasing positive impact going forward? Or are we
kind of seeing its full impact in the December quarter?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: I think the way to think about it is that if you hadn't done something like this, our lives would
have been extremely complex and you might have seen us decelerate because we would have gotten sort of tripped up
in our own clothing. And we wouldn't want to do that, because we'd have to explain why one screen works better than
the other screen, how does the ROI from one compared to the other. And you create an artificial differentiation or
distinction that doesn't need to exist because in the end it's about users, advertisers and publishers.

<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you so much, Gene, for your question. Jamie, let's go to our next question please.
Operator
We'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks, guys. Just a question on, I guess, product or strategy for mobile. You guys are
working on assisting users in mobile, not just answering Search queries with hyperlinks as you did during the PC
browser era. Yet most of the data suggests that mobile users are spending pretty much all their time thumbing around in
apps all day. So how do you envision Google improving the mobile experience? And how do you envision Google
potentially controlling the purchase funnel, if we stay in apps all day, like you controlled it in the PC era? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Let me jump in just on that very high level. Ross, I think that the fundamental tenet is, rather
than to speak about mobile and only mobile, it's really living with the user. And once you think through living with the
user, supporting our users across all their day, whether it be on a TV, whether it be on a mobile phone, whether it be on
a desktop, whether it be with Google Glass, wearables, that's really the aim that we're actually shooting for. And if it
happens that on mobile they spend some of their time on apps, that's just one portion of the puzzle. But when you're
looking for the question, the answer and actually getting you to the real assist across your day, then it's just what the
device you're on, what's your question or where should we assist you I think is the real question to answer.
And I think that's a much broader and a much richer set of opportunities for us rather than just to be cornered into one.
So I kind of defend the premise of your argument, because I think our agenda is so much richer and so much more
exciting for us when you think about it in the way we just did. So that's the way to think about it.
Thanks for your question nonetheless. Let's go to our next question please, Jamie.
Operator
And we'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thank you. I have two. First on local advertising, I'm curious about Google Maps,
Google Ways, modernization of Local. Are geo-targeting-based products helping local advertisers to drive ROI? And
what do you guys need to do to drive that business in terms of advertising real-time locally?
And then the second question maybe for Nikesh. You mentioned the NFL jokingly. I wonder with the growth of
YouTube as a platform, when you look at the birth and the growth of Chromecast, why is it that you wouldn't find
professional content or sports contents strategic or useful in terms of driving the next leg or era of growth and
monetization for YouTube? Thanks very much.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thanks for your question. Let me answer two different parts of it. First is in terms of your
question around Local monetization, so I think we are clearly experimenting with new ad formats in Google Maps. But
I think there's a broader way of thinking about Local. It's not just about app, it's about location. And as the world begins
to interact across multiple screens, you begin to look at location in a whole different way because you have a better
understanding of where users are and how you can use that as a filter to provide them more precise information and
hopefully much more relevant advertising, which requires both ends of the spectrum. It requires us to understand the
user's location but also requires the advertisers to make sure they give us the location of where their services are best
utilized.
So we need location extensions from advertisers, we need locations from users, and then we have to be able to marry
them across not just Google Maps, but across pretty much every experience that we have, whether it's Search, whether
it's anything, whether it's YouTube. Whatever service that the end user is using, we have to be able localize it, because
location is a great filter. It allows us to make things more relevant both from advertising and from an organic

perspective.
In terms of YouTube, I think we're very happy with the growth that YouTube is having and has had, both from a user
perspective as well as content provider perspective and also from a monetization perspective. In terms of content
providers, we talk to content providers large and small across the entire spectrum because we want you to use the
platform where creators of any size can build an audience. They can build an audience of scale, fans can find the
content that they want. It's hard to comment on a particular piece of content because it starts whole seas of
conversations. But look, we are – we would welcome any content on YouTube as long as people felt that it would add
value to the end users and as long as there is a right economic model associated with it.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you for your question, it was a great question again. Jamie, let's go to our next
question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q>: Hi. This is [ph] Kevin (45:06) on for Mark. I was just wondering, are you guys seeing Nielsen OCR measurement
pushing more brand advertisers towards YouTube? Thanks.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thanks, Mark – I'm sorry, no, this is [ph] Kevin? Sorry. Thanks, [ph] Kevin. Kevin, as I
mentioned earlier, we had a long spirited answer around measurement. We are seeing measurement as sort of table
stakes for brand advertisers because they want to understand what is the return of their brand spend? Now, it's easier in
performance advertising because you can see the number of clicks you get on your website or you can measure the
number of people who walk into your store. On brand, it's a different metric so you want to actually try and understand
how many people were you able to reach of a certain age, certain gender. And that's what Nielsen OCR allows you to
do, it allows you to compare across the various brand media.
So some of that's just table stakes and as I said earlier, it is the early set of metrics that are sort of basic entry metrics
into the space, but we hope that this market is going to evolve from a measurement perspective over the coming
quarters, coming years, where we can have more sophisticated metrics and metrics that actually allow you to see the
impact of this advertising on your brand.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks. Let's go to the next question please, Jamie.

And we'll go next to Richard Kramer with Arete Research.
<Q - Richard A. Kramer>: Thanks very much. Patrick, you've talked before about projects like Google Fiber needing
to make returns, and you see acquisitions like Nest getting replaced by disposals like Motorola, and you've now passed
the $50 billion mark in terms of net cash. So do you have any plans this year to address this sort of mounting cash pile,
and as a part of the Google business that needs to generate returns like the other businesses?
And then for Nikesh, you've surely seen the various social network and messaging peers absorb some substantial
volumes of advertising spend. How does that make you think about the evolution of Google+ and YouTube and some
of the other Social platforms you have as a complement to the Search-based business? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So I'll jump on the first one. As I've reiterated many times before, and we were with our board
yesterday at the audit committee reviewing this issue, and so clearly our – the cash position of Google is seen as a
strategic asset. It is an important asset to us, both in terms of offensive and defensive, given the world in which we live
in. And in that context, it's being reviewed regularly and we make sure that actually we get the best return for our

investors on that asset as well, so we have a real strategy for that as well. So for now we have nothing else to announce
on it, but just to give comfort to our investors that we do take this issue seriously and it is reviewed on a regular basis
by both ourselves at management but also raised to the board for the right answer.
So thanks for the question, thanks for asking it, it's always there. I'll turn it over to Nikesh for the second for the second
part of the question.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Richard. Let's see. Yeah, I guess to your point, yes, there are other
people who are beginning to absorb some amounts of digital ad spend. I think the $15.7 billion for this quarter with the
majority of this being advertising, I still think we have substantial advertising spend coming in to us. But again, from a
longer-term perspective, I think every piece of advertising becomes digital, so we're still at single yet low double-digit
numbers in terms of how much ad spend is digital versus non-digital, so we need more people in the digital space
getting more and more advertising to shift from what we call traditional old media.
I think over time television becomes digital, I think everything – every piece of advertising becomes digital, because
this provides so much efficiency from a measurement perspective and a targeting perspective, to take out a lot of the
waste out of the system. So with that in mind, I think we're still in the very early days of how much advertising is going
to move over to digital media, and I think you're right to identify that places like Google+, places like YouTube, are
still very, very sort of in their infancy in the amount of advertising they can support vis-à-vis the amount of usage we're
getting.
So we continue to work hard. We have to strike the right balance between user services, end-user service and the
amount of advertising we represent to them, because this continues to be sort of evolving space and what you don't
want to do is, you don't want to overwhelm users with tremendous amounts of advertising because that may be good in
the short-term but creates a bad experience for the user in the long-term.
So you will notice that many of our products still do not have tremendous amounts of advertising because we still
believe those products are evolving and the right form of advertising just hasn't been invented for those particular areas.
So we remain hopeful in the long-term for finding more and more ways of enabling advertising for users, and for sure,
perhaps, some of the products may not lend themselves to advertising and users will prefer to pay for an ad-less product
as it relates to certain areas like applications or digital content, et cetera. So those models also exist out there. So I think
there's tremendous amount of scope in the future and I think you rightly identified some of the areas where we should
be concentrating.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks for your question. Let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could share with us your strategy to try and
reduce fragmentation of Android, and is the sale of Motorola a potential catalyst for this to start to happen? And
ultimately, do you think this even matters over the long-term? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Well, I mean, again, Heather, certainly the transaction with Motorola continues to support the
ecosystem, so in that sense, right, I think that we have clear objectives of support. We've always had clear objectives to
support all of our partners and after this transaction, it's very clear that we'll continue to be kind of this impartial
supporter of the entire ecosystem.
As it relates to the detail of fragmentation, we've taken a number of steps. We've talked a lot about this already in the
past but there's a number of steps taken to make sure that in fact, there isn't fragmentation and I'd just encourage you to
kind of circle back to both what's written as well as circle back to the IR team for more of the details. But we've done a
lot of progress already on this over the last kind of 18 months and a lot more to come.

So thanks for your question. We have time for one more so why don't we jump, Jamie, to the last question of the
afternoon?
Operator
And we'll take our last question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Great. Thanks. Just a question on Enterprise. Obviously from a SaaS perspective you
already have a very good business but in terms of the infrastructure and platform services, can you talk about how
you're approaching the go-to-market whether it's based on pricing since there are low-margin competitors already in the
market or is this more of a broader platform approach to link the services together? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Nikesh?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thank you, Colin, for your question. I'm trying to interpret here.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Hold on. You're still on mute. Sorry.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Sorry. I was on mute. Thank you, Colin, for your question. I'm still trying to parse your question.
I think we've done really well from an Enterprise perspective. We have steadily growing revenues on our traditional
Google Apps business.
Outside of that, on the platform service, the Google Compute Engine, Google App Engine stuff, we continue to make
progress. I think we have more room to work harder over there. We understand there are other players out there, but
again, that is such an early stage in that market. We think over the long-term almost every business out there, existing
and new, has to be on a cloud platform, has to be on a large-scale industrial strength infrastructure platform, and there
are still few players out there and there's lots and lots of room.
So I'm not sure if price is the current factor on which people need to make a decision. People make a decision based on
robustness, based on security, based on availability, based on the breadth of services we can offer on that platform. I
just think it's early days. So we should be working on all those things and you should be hearing more from us in the
future.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Thank you.
Patrick Pichette
Thanks for that. So in closing, a couple of points one is welcome to 2014, everyone. Having closed now 2013 we're
totally excited by this coming year and just as Nikesh has said at the very beginning, thank you for the people in the
financial community for your support as well as to our Googlers, partners, I mean, the amazing people that make our
job, Nikesh and my job, so easy to be on this call because of their superstar performances across all of our products and
our markets. So again congrats to the Googlers for a great 2013.
And with that, Jamie, I'll let you close the call.
Operator
Thank you, sir. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank everyone for your participation. Have a great day.
