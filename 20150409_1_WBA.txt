Stefano Pessina
Thank you, Gerald. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first ever earnings conference call for Walgreens
Boots Alliance. Let me begin by underscoring how pleased we were to finally bring the two companies together on
December 31, 2014. This was a historic and pivotal milestone for two iconic companies, Walgreens and Alliance
Boots, as we completed our merger to establish Walgreens Boots Alliance forging a new company, the world's first
global pharmacy-led health and well-being enterprise.
We established a senior management team to bring together our businesses and lead them forward to the next phase of
their evolution, while making steady progress with the integration and the establishment of a single unified corporate
data entity and culture. Our team worked very hard to accelerate closing the deal, two months ahead of the beginning of
the completion window. We raised the funds to complete the transaction and re-financed essentially all the AB debt in
an efficient manner, while going through a complicated process of preparing our first full consolidated earning under
U.S. GAAP, including eliminating the three months reporting lag.
The complexity and effort these tasks have taken cannot be underestimated. I would ask you to remember that till
completion, our businesses had to operate at the arm's length as separate entities. We are today only 14 weeks, in fact
99 days into the creation of this new global entity. It is still very early but we have moved mountains, in what we have
done and are still in the first steps of our journey.
We have achieved much in a short time and are moving quickly. We have expanded our restructuring program to create
a more competitive cost structure, begun to access synergies created through the combination and sharpened our focus
on our strategic priorities including the sales of the majority interest of our infusion business subsequent to the quarter
close.
And today, I am pleased to announce a strong quarter, achieved along with all the other tasks that we have undertaken.
We are looking forward to the future with enthusiasm.
Our transaction has created a group, which I believe has an enormous potential to grow in ways that give us a great
excitement and optimism for the future.
Let's start by looking at our business as we stand today. Based on an in-depth review of our Retail Pharmacy USA
segment, I can say that Walgreens is on a sound structural footing. As you might expect, some parts are better than
expected, while others offer room for improvement.
Our first priority is to understand the business fully, its interdependency and its differentiators. This exercise is
underway and will ensure we stay focused on what is truly important, delivering against the needs of our customers in a
dependable, yet innovative manner that provides us with sustainable and growing income across all parts of our
businesses. This will be achieved through a combination of efficient practice, research, and insight, investment in our
core business, and innovation in our business model.
From what we have seen already, we believe there to be significant scope to enhance the performance of our
pharmacies through refreshing and differentiating our store, improving customer experience, delivering proven services
to customers and patients and introducing new offering through innovative partnerships.

We believe that through good business practice and the application of these and the other initiatives, we can over time
expand the retail margin, grow market share and prepare ourselves to better address the competitive and market driven
headwinds we face in certain areas of our business.
Let me be perfectly clear. Our aim is to help Walgreens further develop strategies that will continue to deliver growth
for many years to come. It is vital that we make best use of the assets we have, core to which is our unrivaled portfolio
of location across the U.S. We must work tirelessly to drive the best possible return from these assets, and to that end,
we have today announced an enlarged but necessary restructuring program to focus the Walgreens business back on its
core assets. We believe we will come out of this stronger and better positioned to deliver enhanced performance that
our premium location should command.
In Retail Pharmacy International, in Boots, we are working hard to refine the new cycle of our business that will deliver
growth in the coming year. We are continuing to develop our online offering and building on recent success. We are
working to further integrate these with our physical stores and logistical network to enhance the customer's choice,
while making better use of our resources.
The constant work to keep our offering fresh through innovation, within store and within our own brand and exclusive
product portfolio is continuing to differentiate us in the extremely competitive U.K. retail market. I am confident that
the work which Simon and his team are doing will set us on a path for further growth in the years ahead.
As well, our Retail businesses are also continuing to perform well, and it has been a particular pleasure to welcome our
new colleagues in Mexico and Chile to our company, making the expansion of our international retail presence in Latin
America through the addition of two outstanding businesses, with excellent prospects for growth.
Our Pharmaceutical sales division is continuing to develop the integrated business model that we introduced many
years ago, operating an ever-growing suite of services to the manufacturers that tie us more close than ever to them as
partner.
On the other side of the supply chain, we are expanding our offer into our pharmacist customers; to both align them
more closely with us, the wholesalers, and let them improve the quality and economics of their own businesses.
While such initiative enhance the vertical integration of our Wholesale businesses, and creates strength and value, the
ever-changing market that we operate in, and the continuous economic pressure that healthcare system are under,
present us with regular opportunities to expand our network.
These present themselves in many ways, in one extreme through a consolidation within market and at the other extreme
through innovative partnership and alliances, as you have seen us to do with AmerisourceBergen. As Wholesale is a
business that is enhanced by volume and market presence, we will continue to explore opportunities to expand our
network as they arise.
Underpinning all of these, Walgreens Boots Alliance has embarked on the beginning of a new year, a new year that will
bring a new attitude, a new culture, aligned toward driving performance, serving our customers and creating long-term
sustainable shareholder value.
Now, I will ask George to take us through the quarterly results. George?
George Rollo Fairweather
Thank you, Stefano. Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Today, I would like to
cover the following three topics; first, to provide detail on our fiscal 2015 second quarter performance; second, to
provide you with an overview of our restructuring program; and finally, to articulate our views on FY 2015 and FY
2016 results.

To summarize, the second quarter was a solid start for our new company. Key highlights include net sales of $26.6
billion, GAAP earnings per share of $1.93, while adjusted EPS was $1.18, cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion
and free cash flow of $1 billion.
The quarter's financial results are complicated, as we began reporting as a consolidated entity partway through the
quarter and the comparability to last year is a challenge and of limited use.
Before we get into the details of our second quarter financial performance, I'd like to explain some elements of our new
reporting structure.
Historically, Walgreens has reported as one segment, which consisted of the results of Walgreens in the USA, its
corporate costs, synergies from the Walgreens Boots Alliance Development joint venture also known as WBAD, and
equity earnings from Alliance Boots on a three-month lag. Our focus was to merge the businesses as soon as possible
and eliminate the three-month reporting lag. This aligns the reported results of the global enterprise and will make our
performance easier to understand going forward.
As Walgreens Boots Alliance, we now report results in three segments; Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy
International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. Segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including
WBAD and combined corporate costs.
Within our Retail Pharmacy USA segment since the deal closed on December 31, we have reported one month of
Alliance Boots' equity income this quarter versus three months in the comparable quarter a year-ago, recognizing the
45% stake that Walgreens had in Alliance Boots until end December. The months of January and February are fully
consolidated. Year-over-year comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly
comparable.
So now, let me take you through our financials in greater detail, beginning with the consolidated results. For the
quarter, GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were just over $2 billion or $1.93 per diluted
share, while adjusted net earnings were $1.2 billion or $1.18 per diluted share. This compares to $0.74 of GAAP net
earnings per share and $0.97 of adjusted earnings per share in the prior year quarter.
Net sales in the second quarter were $26.6 billion, an increase of 35.5% versus the prior year. Operating income on a
GAAP basis was $1.4 billion, and on an adjusted basis was $1.8 billion. The increase in adjusted operating income was
driven by growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA segment as well as the consolidation of Alliance Boots' results for
January and February.
We reported $144 million of net interest expense this quarter, which included interest expense associated with
prefunding the transaction for the month of December. Consistent with last quarter, our adjusted EPS excludes this
interest expense, which we'll not need to do going forward.
The adjusted tax rate for this quarter was 27.7%. Now this has been impacted by a number of factors, including a
change in the geographic mix of forecast profits, now that Alliance Boots has been fully consolidated, includes net
discrete tax benefits specific to the quarter and the presentation of Alliance Boots taxes in the income statement.
Prior to the full merger, Walgreens 45% share of Alliance Boots adjusted results net of Alliance Boots tax were
presented in a single line within operating income. Now following the transaction Alliance Boots taxes reported within
the income tax provision line in our income statement impacting the calculation of the adjusted tax rate.
Diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were 1.1 billion and average diluted shares outstanding for the
quarter were 1.05 billion, resulting from the issuance of 144 million shares on December 31, as part of the
consideration for Alliance Boots.
So now, let me walk you through the component pieces to explain the change from GAAP to adjusted EPS. The GAAP
earnings per share for the quarter of $1.93 reconciles to an adjusted earnings per share of $1.18. The net adjustment of
$0.75 per share, this reflects the removal of net gains on transaction-related item of $0.67 and gains on the warrants we
hold over AmerisourceBergen shares of $0.35, which was partially offset by LIFO provision costs of $0.04,

acquisition-related amortization expenses of $0.15 which includes $0.08 relating to an inventory step up which will not
reoccur in future quarters, and special items of $0.08 related to optimization costs and asset impairments.
The components of a net gain on transaction-related items were a gain on Walgreens previously held equity interest in
Alliance Boots of $0.77, a foreign currency hedge loss of $0.07 related to the delivery of the British Pound element of
the Step 2 consideration and a net $0.03 cost of transaction fees, tax adjustments and interest costs from pre-funding the
cash consideration.
So next I'd like to provide insights into financial results at the segmental level, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA.
Reported net sales were $21 billion, up 6.9% on a comparable store basis. In the pharmacy, comparable store scripts
which includes immunizations, these increased 5% on a 30-day adjusted basis. The increase was driven by the positive
impact of a strong cough, cold and flu season, by continued growth in Medicare Part D scripts and positive underlying
share trends.
For the quarter ending February 28, the division's 30-day adjusted retail prescription market share in the U.S. reached
19.3%, as reported by IMS Health. This represents an increase of 20 basis points versus the same time last year. In
retail products, comparable store sales increased by 2.5%. This was partially driven by strong December holiday sales,
including seasonal sales of cough, cold and flu products.
GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, while adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 13.4%
over the year-ago quarter. Strong expense control and efficiencies offset the expected pharmacy gross margin pressure
from declines in reimbursement, generic drug inflation, as well as the Med Part D rates step down that begun on
January 1 this year.
Retail product margins increased this quarter, helped by seasonal and cough, cold, flu mix, as well as our focus on
reducing less profitable promotions. We remained very pleased with the progress on controlling and reducing SG&A
expenses this quarter. Our GAAP SG&A expense declined 0.3% compared to the prior year quarter.
So next, let's review the Retail Pharmacy International division, which is pharmacy-led health and beauty retail
businesses in eight countries. The biggest contributor is Boots in the U.K. Total sales for the two months ended
February were just over $2 billion. As the businesses included in our Retail Pharmacy International division were
acquired as part of a merger with Alliance Boots, no comparable information is included in the WBA consolidated
results.
On a pro forma constant currency basis, comparable sales for January and February grew by 2.9%. Comparable sales at
Boots U.K. were up 2.3% of sales in our businesses in Chile and Mexico, which were acquired by Alliance Boots back
in August 2014, these were up 2.9%. The acquisition brings us over 1,000 stores in Mexico and over 400 stores in
Chile and provides strong growth opportunities in the Latin American market. Inclusion of these businesses in the
division combined with contract manufacturing are reflected in the margins.
Now, turning to Pharmaceutical Wholesale, which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand in 12 countries.
Results in any given quarter influenced by performance in larger geographies, including the U.K., Germany, France
and Turkey and the division's contribution from WBAD. Total sales for the two months ending February were $3.9
billion.
Similar to Retail Pharmacy International, our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division was acquired through the merger with
Alliance Boots. And so no amounts are reported in the comparable period. However, in the pro forma constant currency
basis, sales were relatively flat compared with the same period the prior year.
Now, let me spend a minute on our expectations for synergies and how they will be reported going forward. Prior to the
merger, the majority of our synergies were flowing through WBAD, the former joint venture between Walgreens and
Alliance Boots, which Walgreens fully consolidated and then removed the Alliance Boots portion via the
non-controlling interest line item.
Following the combination, we're allocating all synergies, including those generated by WBAD to the segments and
we're doing this according to the relative proportion of purchases driving the synergy benefits.

With regard to performance in the quarter, combined net synergies were a $170 million, bringing the fiscal year to date
total to $310 million, driven primarily by our drug procurement efforts. We remain comfortable with our ability to
achieve at least $650 million in combined synergies this fiscal year.
For FY 2016, we continue to expect at least $1 billion in combined quantifiable net synergies. Consistent with prior
reporting, these synergies do not include any benefit from our AmerisourceBergen relationship.
Now that we're a combined company, as expected, we are focusing on driving incremental synergies from sharing our
best practices and working more closely together. However, not all of these can be easily quantified, but some of them
tend to blend into our normal business.
So moving on to the cash flows. We generated approximately $1.3 billion in cash from operations during the quarter,
and our free cash flow was $1.0 billion. We're pleased with the cash generation during the second quarter, due in part to
an improvement in our primary working capital within our Retail Pharmacy USA division, driven by reduction in
inventory levels. We will continue to focus on working capital, and remain confident in future opportunities to increase
efficiencies.
Net debt as of the quarter-end was $14.1 billion. With regard to uses of free cash flow beyond reinvestment back into
the company, we completed $94 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization. We
purchased additional shares post the end of the quarter under pre-established trading plans, bringing the total purchases
to $330 million.
I'd now like to make a few comments on our capital allocation policy. As we've consistently communicated, we remain
committed to a solid investment grade rating, while looking for ways to enhance our cash generation. This includes
driving working capital efficiencies, taking capital expenditures, controlling costs and of course improving operations.
Beyond maintaining a long-term 30% to 35% dividend payout target, our top priorities for free cash, include M&A
consistent with our strategy and share buybacks. All of these are with a view to optimizing long-term shareholder
value.
Following on this theme, and as Stefano mentioned, we are focused on becoming a more agile and more productive
company. As you know, in August 2014, we announced a three-year $1 billion cost reduction initiative. After a
rigorous analysis, we've identified additional opportunities for cost savings, primarily in our Retail Pharmacy USA
division. These additional cost opportunities will increase the total expected cost savings program by $500 million to a
projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017.
Significant areas of focus include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the USA, to re-organize corporate and
field operations, drive operating efficiencies and streamline information technology and other functions. These actions
are designed to restructure and invest in our company's future in a way that it's better for customers, simpler for our
employees resulting in a faster and more agile organization.
We estimate that total pre-tax charges associated with this program to our GAAP financial results will be in the range
of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, of which the cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. The restructuring
charges will be recognized over time as the program is implemented in accordance with GAAP. Looking ahead, we
will continue to focus on other areas of cost reduction.
So now, let's talk about the rest of fiscal 2015. We understand and appreciate that there are a lot of factors that will
impact our results. So in order to help you, we're providing an adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.45 to $3.65 for fiscal
year 2015.
Now this range assumes quarterly interest expense of $140 million to $150 million, it assumes a full-year adjusted tax
rate of approximately 29% and a fiscal year diluted share count generally consistent with the current quarter. And it
assumes management's estimates for foreign exchange rates but reflect current market rates over the balance of the
fiscal year. Now this guidance also includes recast fiscal Q1 results, due to the elimination of the three-month lag.

Finally, you will see an increase in the share count in Q3 and Q4, due to the full inclusion of the 144 million shares
issued with Step 2 of the AB transaction. This will result in approximately 1.1 billion diluted shares per quarter. Any
additional share repurchases will impact of course the fiscal year diluted share count.
So moving on to FY 2016, our previously published goals were based on a variety of assumptions to arrive at estimate
ranges for both sales and adjusted EPS. These included operating assumptions for our businesses and certain below the
line items including interest, tax, and share count.
When we set the goals in August, we made foreign currency assumptions based on exchange rates that were close to
market rates at that time. Since then, we've seen significant global currency movements, especially the strengthening of
the U.S. dollar. Because we report in U.S. dollars, we do have currency translational exposures, primarily based on
movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar.
Simply put, a stronger dollar hurts our sales and earnings in dollars, while a weaker dollar helps them. We estimate that
1% move in the pound sterling versus the dollar from current levels would impact our adjusted EPS by approximately
$0.01 per share. Despite the FX headwind, I'm confident that we have initiatives and resources in place to address the
controllable elements that drive our adjusted EPS goal for FY 2016.
Our revenues have greater potential variability due to the varied mix of businesses, particularly in our Wholesale
division, which accounts for a significant proportion of our overall revenue.
In addition, the geographical spread of the Wholesale business increases its exposure to currency variations. This being
the case, we view overall revenue as a less relevant measure of our business. So taking these two factors into account,
we decided to no longer provide our published revenue goal. And please note that our forward-looking statements
assume no significant changes to the current exchange rates.
So I'd like to wrap up today by saying that our reporting structure has changed and comparability is limited, which I
know makes it really difficult for you. Therefore, in an effort to be as informative as possible, we've provided adjusted
EPS guidance for fiscal year 2015. And next week, we will have a financial session to provide further insights. In
addition, we plan to provide operational insights in each of our three segments as well as views on our key financial
drivers and future strategy. We really look forward to seeing you then.
So with that, I'll turn the call back to Stefano.
Stefano Pessina
Thank you, George. Let me finish today by reminding you of our key priorities as we look forward. We are working to
deliver the benefits of our transaction within our core businesses. This will involve executing our synergies and
efficiency programs across the group including the progressive development of our procurement initiatives.
We must also properly manage the assets of the business to ensure we are suitably structured and prepared to address
the pressures we face as the pharmacy market evolves. These pressures may variously be from reimbursement cuts,
competitive action or simply changes in consumer behavior. Whatever form they take, if we are properly structured and
prepared, operating an efficient high-quality patient oriented pharmacy service, we will earn the rights not just to
participate, but to be an architect of the changes in our market.
We are already seeing the benefits that can be achieved in retail with the initiatives underway at Walgreens and
ongoing at Boots. We must ensure that we get the best return for our investment and create the best environment for our
employees and customers alike. This will require us to operate enhanced systems and control, so that we can monitor
and manage our business operations.
Now, many of you have asked where we are on the CEO search. As you know, we formed a search committee of the
board and they have been working with one of the top executive recruiting firms to help us find a new CEO. Currently,
we are in the process of reviewing the candidates they have proposed. Finding candidates with the combination of
attributes that we deem important for the role is naturally challenging, as we expected it to be, but we remain confident

that in due course we will find the right person for the job.
Lastly, as the new culture takes hold and finds roots in a company, you can see echos of it in all part of the business. I
hope that in one particular area, you are seeing the new culture of merger very clearly, and that is in our approach to
our owners and the financial community in general. I have always viewed investors as my business partner, as I hope
that they will view me in the same way. As an organization, we strongly believe it is our duty to care for our
shareholder and ensure that we are as accessible, responsive and transparent as we can be.
We also believe in being proactive in reaching out to our investor to properly understand their requirement and ensure
that in our investor relations effort, we are as mindful of our shareholders as we are of the patients in our pharmacies or
our customers in wholesale.
I think that Gerald and his team have done well to demonstrate this [indiscernible] (36:24) and it is a great pleasure to
see, although there is still more to do. We are on the first step of a long and exciting path and I look forward to
traveling it with you as fellow owners and partners.
As I said earlier, I am optimistic about the long-term future of our company, and have made a significant personal
commitment to our future, not only as Executive Vice Chairman and Acting CEO, but also as a significant shareholder.
I am convinced that the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance is a unique first, which will almost inevitably lead to
many other new firsts in our industry.
It may not yet be clear which steps these will be, but we are determined to continue to show the way and be at the
forefront of innovating healthcare. Our ambition is to build a generally global company and universal healthcare
champion.
We look forward to providing a more comprehensive outlook on our future strategy and value creation next week at our
first Analyst Day.
With that, we are now ready to take your question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line
is now open.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Good morning and thanks for the questions. I know we'll get a lot more detail next week
at the Analyst Day, but I thought maybe I'd start on the incremental cost cutting you introduced today. I believe the
previous expectation was for the bulk of the cost cutting to come in fiscal 2016. Just curious if you can give an update
on how we should think about the cost cutting over the next three years. And then related to that, given that there is an
additional $500 million in cost cutting, obviously reiterating the fiscal 2016 guidance, wondering if there was any
negative offsets that you've realized since giving that 2016 guidance. Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: George and after Alex can give you, I believe a satisfactory answer.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Yeah. Our first priority – I think, remember, we're merged as a relatively short
time, a key priority to see what additional savings were achievable. The second, the increase of $0.5 billion will take
time to come through, so quite a lot of this will be into the year – into 2017. So it's really over the next two and a bit
years is how I would look at that in terms of driving performance.
I think when we're – the piece I would really reiterate on the guidance that we've given is, is please do remember the
change in currency. I mean, remember the sterling is about $1.48 today, and it was about $1.68 back in August just as a
reminder. So in setting the guidance and reaffirming the guidance, you've got to take into account that we've had an
unfavorable wins on the currency versus some of what we are doing in other areas.

<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: That's fair. And then I guess just maybe more near-term, looking at the U.S. SG&A,
quite a bit lower than what we were looking for and obviously quite a bit lower than it was a year-ago this time. I'm just
wondering if you could give a little bit more clarity on what went on within the U.S. SG&A line. Is that reduction that
we saw there in any part a result of these cost initiatives? Or is there other things at play within the U.S. cost structure?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Alex?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi Bob, it's Alex here. Yeah, it's a combination of both. First of all, the additional $500 million is
going to be – almost all be in 2017, so this is a result of what we've been doing over really the last nine months as we've
really deeply understood the current operating model and really tried to lay out the ground for the new operating model
that we're going to put through the business.
We've been really successful. The team has done a great job in Walgreens in terms of being able to find a cost savings
that do not affect the customer. The most pleasing thing about this beyond this cost savings is the fact that we're still
growing volume ahead of the market both in pharmacy and in retail products. And also we're seeing internally our
measure in customer delay improving.
So the whole idea of better for customers, simpler for our teams, and more faster agile organization is what's driving all
of this, and we'll keep on going. We'll keep on working the old model and creating the processes, the IT structures for
the new model. So yeah, we're delighted with the SG&A savings in this quarter and they are materially better than the
same period last year. And as part of the restructuring we started already is in there, but a lot of this also is just good
ongoing cost control and cost management.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Great. Thanks for the comments. I look forward to seeing you guys next week.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah. Hi, good morning and congratulations on closing the transaction and a good quarter.
When we think about this space, the consolidation obviously continues. We just heard the news last week on kind of
like, how United is thinking about the supply chain and the payer world. Do you think that you now have all the
relevant pieces that you need in the U.S. market, or are there still areas that you think that you might be missing or
below scale at?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Well, what we think is not real important. The reality is that as I have said many times and I
have realized immediately after being for two weeks in the job, is that this market, the American market is ready for
another round of consolidations, because the margin are squeezed everywhere, the government is more and more
in-charge for the cost of their healthcare business and so for sure, as they will exercise their power to squeeze the cost
as much as possible, as we have seen in Europe for decades. And so the complex structure of delivering the medicines
to the patients will have to be rationalized. And as a consequence, it's easy to believe that we will have additional
synergies coming from M&A activities.
This could be of course at the level of, for example, a consolidation, but in many layers of the chain, the consolidation
is still up and is still quite advanced. So it's very likely that we will see also a vertical consolidation, and the
opportunities are there for everybody and we will see what happens about that. As I have said before, we wanted to be
and we have been in the past, at the forefront of changes. And so if this needs for a consolidation will be confirmed, we
will try to be part of it.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then just as we think about the trends on the front end, can you talk a little bit
about promotional activities in the quarter and just how you think about promotional activities for the rest of the year,
and also about private-label penetration?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Alex.

<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi, Ricky, it's Alex here. The team have built a new tool in and there's some good data. And so
this has been driven really from the implementation of Balance Rewards, the insights we're getting, and they're driving
that through better tools for merchants. So the management team has done a really great job in terms of understanding
more precisely where customers truly value promotions and where actually they don't. And you can see the growth in
the front end margin, you can also see the growth in product sales at the same time. So we've really been able to pull
these two things off together. And we feel confident with the new tools we've got and the cables we're developing, that
will continue forward. Also a great hire. Linda Filler has come into us, and again, Linda we believe will accelerate that
journey given her tremendous experience in Walmart and Sam's Club in particular. So that feels pretty good.
In terms of own brand penetration, we've created a new division within organization, within Walgreens Boots Alliance,
led by Ken Murphy and again we're able to think about how do we understand [ph] localization in (46:05) America and
also global in sales and Ken will speak more about this next week. And how therefore do we get the right products and
the right brands into the making American consumers' hands in the drugstore channel.
Having said that, we've done a couple of things. Recently, we've introduced two new masstige cosmetic brands, CIRCA
and Colour Prevails, that's happened in the last two weeks or three weeks. So we're not waiting for that to happen. We
continue to walk on a basis of growing own brand penetration. So I think in both fronts, we made good solid progress
and there is more to come.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Great. Thank you very much and see you next week.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Great. Thanks very much. George, as I look at the first half versus the second half, it looks
like there is a deceleration in earnings. Can you talk about what the primary contributors are there? And I'm just curious
if the Medicare Part D – while you talked about the trends being positive from a script perspective, we know that there
has been pressure there on the reimbursement front.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Yeah. I mean there is a number of factors and I know it makes it really, really
complicated sort of looking half year and half year, because of course it includes the deal and remove from three
months lag et cetera. I mean in terms of Med D steps, Med D step down, obviously, firstly, we've got two months
results in Q2 given this kicks in at the beginning of the year, but will impact us for the full quarters in each of Q3 and
Q4.
Second half of the fiscal year is seasonally weaker than our first half normally and of course, I know we haven't got all
the comparables to sort of give you the overall seasonality, which makes it tough to model. And then of course we've
got the exchange rate issue as well coming in because of what – where the exchange rate has moved over the last
number of – last six months and of course we were all still bringing in the 45% of AB at that point in time.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Alex you if you can add something.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah, absolutely. We have also got some cost savings timing. So for example, we've got much
closer to the plan of how we're going to actually drive the cost savings and therefore, we've been able to take a few
more of the cost savings in the first half relative to the first half of last year and then the remainder of the year we have
still cost savings coming through, so we actually had quite a lot of cost savings in Q4 of last year to go against.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: And then my second question would just be around generics. If we think back to last
summer, a lot of talk about drug price inflation on generics being a headwind. As I think about the generic pipeline for
the back half of your year, it looks to be improving. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing, one, on drug price
inflation and the impact that it's having, are you able to offset that with your procurement entity? And then secondly
kind of your outlook for incremental generics that are going to come as we go through the next couple of quarters.

Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Jeff can you answer this question?
<A - Jeffrey Berkowitz>: Sure. Thanks, Lisa. The generic manufacturers are continuing to react to the suppliers use
and approval delays in the ways that we've come to expect, which is what has been driving the inflationary
environment, but we do continue to see a similar range of inflation as we've seen in the past 12 months or so. The teams
of WBAD, Walgreens, ABC, and Alliance Healthcare, all are continuing to work extremely effectively together to
assure, that is the biggest buyer of generics in the world, that we are appropriately managing the industry dynamic.
The teams in particular have gotten very sharp and have a number of effective mechanisms in place and are working
very collaboratively with the generic drug manufacturers to really manage through this dynamic they've gotten, very
flexible and nimble and understanding the marketplace where there might be issues and really managing them
proactively.
In terms of the generic pipeline, we've recently seen in February, the entry of Nexium, but we haven't seen it go
multisource and we're looking forward to that and we are seeing the list of generics that are coming out, we're looking
forward to maximizing those opportunities as they come.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Great. I look forward to seeing you next week.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Good morning, guys, and I'll echo the congratulations on getting the transaction closed. You
highlighted in the press release a target of closing about 200 stores. I guess the first thing I'm wondering is, is that a
kind of a complete evaluation, and could there be upside to this figure? And how should we think about the earnings
profile of these stores? We would assume that they're less profitable than the composite of the business. But is there
any chance that they're losing money and there is going to be a positive margin lift from this?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Alex?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi, George. This is Alex here. Yeah, we have done a thorough review and again we've been
doing this for a while. We've also reviewed the performance of the closure of the stores we made in the last year as
well. And the good news there was that we saw more retention of customers and we saw the ability also to retain a lot
of our people as well, which is really important to us, as a team, and as a business. So we feel confident about the
number we've given out approximately 200, and of course we will tell our people first where we're going to go and
actually make these closures. Another key point is that we'll be opening up about 200 stores in the same period. So this
really is just getting the right stores in the right place.
And also, I think it's about the right cash and the right returns per store basis. This is a very individual store-based
decision. And of course, in the stores which are potentially going to be closed, we have looked carefully at the markets
today and the number of customers in them and how they're shopping that market and also how the population has
flowed over the course of these stores being open, and we've seen stores which really the population is moving away
from and is less future opportunity than today.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe if I can go with a quick follow-up, you guys also highlighted
that your synergy targets explicitly exclude the ABC relationship. And I guess, where should we think about where we
are in the lifecycle of that relationship? I guess, how much cost can continue to be taken out? And maybe from an
inventory perspective, what can still be taken out? And I guess, like, is there a lot of store inventory left that can be
taken out and kind of better served through the DSD delivery of ABC? Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Alex?

<A - Alex Gourlay>: Hi. Yes, it's Alex again. Yeah, we've made really good progress in terms of inventory reduction
and myself and Jeff are working really close in this together, it's really end-to-end view from the pharma manufacturers
all the way through ABC into the work which Ashworth is doing in the stores.
We're also seeing importantly our service levels improve as well. So again, we've seen this nice thing when you get less
[indiscernible] (52:57) out of the system, you improve costs and you improve working capital and importantly you
improve service levels. So again, we'll continue to work at this. There are more opportunities and we'll do it in a really
balanced way to make sure that we care for customers first, get our items going forward, and the Tier-1 capital out.
I'm confident that the working relationship with ABC will continue to improve. And of course working in Europe as I
did before with Ornella and the team at Alliance Healthcare, we really worked this well for a numbers of years and saw
more and more opportunities, which comes through very clearly in the U.K. business performance of both the
Wholesale and the Boots division.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: All right, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on the results. So I guess for me,
just a clarification question on the gross margin for the quarter. I think the LIFO adjustment is pretty straightforward,
but I think I heard you mention there may have been an inventory step-up charge as well. So I apologize if I missed
this, but I guess did you provide the fully adjusted gross margin for the quarter, just to make it a little bit easier for us?
And also part two within that, just curious, all the talk about the U.S. Medicare Part D rate reductions that went into
effect on 1/1/15, is there any way just to get a rough sense for how much that impacted the gross margin in the quarter?
Was it perhaps 100 basis points year-over-year or maybe something greater than that? Just trying to get a sense for that.
Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: So, George, you can answer to the first answer.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Okay. I'll try not to [indiscernible] (54:24) the inventory step-up one. I mean, it was
$0.08, because under – that is in the legacy AB businesses, so it's in the Retail Pharmacy International and
Pharmaceutical Wholesale and that's – and that we've – it's one of the key differences between adjusted and you have
the U.S. GAAP results.
And that's simply because, under – when you're doing the purchase accounting and we've done the provisional purchase
accounting allocation where we've got a year to finalize that. What you have to do is revalue the inventory at the selling
price less the small margin, so we're not valuing the industry -the inventory at costs. So that gets – what it does is it
essentially artificially takes down the U.S. GAAP profit in those two divisions as a result. So that's why we've stripped
it out to show the operating results with that out. It has no impact at all on the comparables, because it doesn't impact
the Retail Pharmacy USA segment.
I'm sorry, there's so many of these adjustments. We'll try, next week I'll try and take you perhaps through them in a
little more detail, it really doesn't make it very difficult to articulate this story as clearly as we would – I'm sure you
would like and we would like.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Jeff, can you answer to the second question?
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Yeah, that was just the impact on the Medicare Part D, within the quarter, just roughly
how much that might have impacted the overall gross margin. That was the second question. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey Berkowitz>: Yeah. So Medicare Part D, it's an important component of the business. We are not
commenting specifically on the gross margin impact. You know that we've said it's about a third of our business

moving forward. Right now we're in the midst of negotiations for the 2016 year, they're very productive right now, but
we're very – it's very early days in terms of the impact moving forward.
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah. From a volume point of view, we're pleased with volume and really the margin has come
through as we expected. And so again, this is really a – it really has been a solid selling season and we feel good about
the pull-through.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. All right, great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And we have time for two more questions. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller of
William Blair. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi, good morning, everyone. So thinking about the opportunities with both horizontal and
vertical consolidation, that obviously goes in many different dimensions. But when you think about the opportunities, is
it more about getting leverage with suppliers, or more about getting leverage with payers in pharmacy? And then I
guess sub-point to that is getting more scale within the retail operations. Or is it more about strategic moves that allow
you to drive more share across your own network and I'm specifically thinking about better managing the payer
relationships and potentially having some type of a pharmacy benefit management relationship.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Well – it's Stefano. In – of course, we are looking at the market. I believe that we are starting
to understand quite well the market, and there are many opportunities. When we talk about opportunities, of course we
don't exclude a typical M&A opportunity, but there are many, many opportunities, which are not related to an
acquisition or to a merger, related to a potential joint venture – commercial joint venture. And we did initially with
WBAD when we approached Walgreens. When we started our discussion, the first thing we decided was to create these
joint ventures to buy together, and these joint venture would have been there even without the merger.
So there are many ways to deliver synergies and of course, we are open to any kind of organization, which can improve
the value of our company, and we are analyzing many, many different alternatives, and of course, it depends also on the
maturity of the potential partners, on the willingness that they have to do something with us. What I was saying is that
the market goes clearly in one direction and sooner or later these kind of things will happen.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: And then I assume if we are speaking about this real-time that you believe the organization is
ready to move when the opportunities develop, I mean, given everything that's going on with the consolidation of
Walgreens and Alliance Boots?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We have always been able to face the opportunities because, of course, it will take time to
create the platform here in Walgreen Boots Alliance, a solid platform, because of course we have to integrate the two
companies. The integration is doing very well, I have to say, ahead of my expectation, but still there is a lot to do. But
the fact that that we have not yet finished this job doesn't mean that we cannot do something else in the meantime.
So of course if we had an opportunity we will take this opportunity. And any big important opportunity, be it an M&A
activity, be it a joint venture, a commercial joint venture, takes months to be perfectionated, to come to life. So we will
have time to continue our integration while discussing with other possibilities. So of course, if we will see
opportunities, we will be ready.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: That's helpful. Thanks. And then just quickly, George. Does the EPS guidance – can you
clarify whether that includes additional share repurchase?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: We haven't – we've obviously got our $3 billion program authorized. So I think that
should give you an indication of our thinking in that respect. We've obviously not been specific on this, but we
wouldn't have put a program in place if we hadn't felt that we had the ability to generate the necessary cash to complete
that program whilst maintaining solid investment grade.

<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Yeah. Hi, good morning, guys. I have a question on your guidance, particularly as it relates to
getting to 2016. Could you just give us a little bit of color on what your expectations are for the underlying growth of
the business? Maybe growth – profit dollar growth by division that you've sort of contemplated here.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: I mean, in terms of the overall guidance, really today just reaffirming what the
guidance that was put out in the summer last year, recognizing that the currency has gone against us. We've not been
through obviously our detailed – our intensive detailed budgeting exercises as a combine group, and we're getting
everything on a comparable basis under U.S. GAAP.
So we're going through quite a bit of change to try and then be to go through this process. What we'll try and next week
when we meet, just try and give you a little bit more insight into the drivers as we go through each division section.
And then we've got the half day on the financial modeling on the first day. So hopefully, we'll be able to give you a
little bit more insight in that. It is quite complicated because of the lack of comparability, because we have obviously
put the segments in place, that particularly reflects where the – in terms of where the synergies are. We're putting the
synergies in where the real economic activity is happening.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: And so you don't have to be too impatient. At the end of the day you have to leave us with
something to tell you next week.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: All right, that makes sense. And then just one quick follow-up for you on real estate.
Obviously getting smaller is not necessarily something that you want to do in U.S. pharmacy. But do you still have
other stores that you would consider underperforming or lower margin stores? And I guess the question would be
what's the real answer to improving those stores if it's not necessarily closing them?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Yeah. I mean obviously, we have a range of stores. As I said before, as I really get
a look at this and that is about 2% of our estate we've talked about this morning, so therefore 98% of estate is in either
good or satisfactory order. And I think also, we're doing a lot of work in the front-end. We are becoming more
confident about our ability to not just improve the front-end through margin expansion, but to develop potentially new
formats, integrate particular assets to become a new channel. Some of the work really that Simon and the team have
done in Boots has been great in that respect in the last couple of years.
So there will be different strategies that we will apply over the months and years ahead to make the very most of what
is a great set of assets. Stefano said this in introduction, we have got the best corners in America and we will tie them
and we still think we are a really important assets to the future of the Walgreens company.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: But also – it's Stefano here. Also we are talking of a few hundred stores, the stores that we
have already closed, if you understood it means a few percent, a few unit percent of the number of stores that we have.
In reality, old retailers should let's say have a problem on maintenance for their stores and when you have such a vast
territory, such a high number of stores, ineluctably you will have some stores that which have been maybe profitable in
the past and are not particularly exciting today, and you will need to open stores in areas which didn't even exist in the
past.
So the reality you see a certain concentration, which is still small because a few hundred out of 8,300 stores is not a big
number, but you'll see it a certain concentration because this program has not been done in the past in an orderly
fashion. In the future, once we have – let's say, recreated this new base, I believe we should every year look after
review all the stores and this we have every year if we have to close 10 stores, five stores, 15 stores, we have to – we
will have to do it in order not to have these concentration of stores just in one year. So – because it's better to do this
gently over time. Practically this will be business as usual and nobody will see the reality, inside the company.

Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to hand the call back over to Gerald Gradwell
for any closing comments.

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I know there would have been plenty of other questions we haven't had time for
today. We are looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible next week at our Analyst event on April 15 and
April 16 in New York. That will also be webcast live and will be archived on our Investor Relations site. So I hope that
many of you as possible can participate in that. We'll address as many of your additional questions as we can then, and
thank you very much indeed everyone for participating today.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may
all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.
