Good morning and thank you for your time and participation in our conference call. Although we saw continued
improvements in our core business performance this quarter, we have announced a third quarter loss of $0.17 per share,
due to still elevated credit expense with an economy that is demonstrating a slow pace recovery and actions that we've
taken to accelerate the disposal of problem assets and reduce our balance sheet risk going forward.
In addition to absorbing higher costs related to problem asset sales and loans transferred to held for sale, we also
reported a loan loss provision essentially equal to the elevated level of loan charge-offs. Loan loss provision, OREO
and held for sale costs in total were an estimated $0.41 per share after tax this quarter. We executed this position of $1
billion in problem loans including 709 in distress asset sales. We remain confident in our business plans and our
determination to execute these plans and returning Regions to sustainable profitability as promptly and prudently as
possible.
Our actions are moving Regions closer to the improvement needed to achieve a break-even point. We are encouraged
by this quarter's business progress that resulted in steps towards achieving that goal. While our credit teams are
diligently working to resolve credit-related issues, the majority of our associates have demonstrated a focus on
profitably growing revenue and constraining operating expenses in our core businesses.
In the third quarter, net interest income rose 1% from second quarter, driven as expected by continued reduction in
overall cost of deposits and a favorable shift in mix. And while fee-based revenues declined 1% versus last quarter, the
drop was primarily driven by the impact from Regulation E on service charges. Notably, while the implication of Reg E
did negatively impact the quarter, that impact was less than we forecasted, and we continue to be encouraged by the
efforts of our associates in our branches and our call centers to further mitigate the impact of this regulatory
requirement as we assist customers in making the best decisions to accommodate their needs.
At the same time, operating expenses, while being closely managed, did unfortunately increase due to the impact of
higher credit-related expenses. We remain confident in the progress we're making in spite of the slow pace of economic
recovery. Our strategies are working. We're disciplined in our focus on customers and we have developed strong
accountability for execution and results.
The operating environment does continue to be a challenge. The economy is gradually recovering but growth is
forecasted to be unfavorably slow for the next few quarters with stubbornly high unemployment, a weak housing
market and unusually low interest rates. To date, economic recovery within our markets has been uneven. Residential
home values have not stabilized in many of our markets, especially the markets within the state of Florida where we
could potentially experience another 10% or so decline relative to mid 2010 prices, depending on the ability of the
banks and the courts to process foreclosures effectively and the amount of shadow inventory remaining in the system.
With that in mind, we are careful when we're making general statements. It may prove to be inaccurate due to the
inconsistent valuations from market to market. But we are starting to see what appears to be stabilization in some of our
market. Fortunately, the Gulf oil spill's impact on individuals and business customers has been far less economically
negative than initially forecasted. It's still a difficult situation for these markets but far less impactful than earlier
feared. Regions maximum loss potential is projected now to be $20 million or less, sharply less than our initial $100
million estimate.
That being said, the long term economic environmental impacts remain a concern as the markets and businesses along
the Gulf Coast recover very slowly. Across all of our markets, I am convinced the economic conditions are improving
but the slow pace of recovery is weighing on borrowers' capacity and borrowers' willingness to continue to fulfill credit
obligations, and thus has increased the implied potential benefit of guarantor support on many of our credits. As such,
we have become incrementally more cautious on our economic outlook, which was a driving factor in the increased
gross migration of loans moving to a non-performing status.
I think it's important, however, to consider the composition of that migration. Of the $1.4 billion third quarter gross
non-performing additions, approximately 390 million were disposed of during the quarter. Of the Commercial loans
remaining, 933 million, 62% or 575 million, were current home payments. Overall, the percentage of non-performing
Commercial loans that are current on payments has risen from 24% at the end of second quarter to 36% at the end of

third quarter, giving us more confidence in the ability to manage the potential loss content and the potential to
restructure in some cases.
It's also important to point out that our internally risk-rated problem loans declined on a linked quarter basis. Our early
stage and late stage delinquencies have stabilized and are moderating. The lingering effects of the slow pace of
economic recovery has not helped many of our borrowers and we have acted cautiously and prudently reassessing and
modifying risk ratings as appropriate. We are focused on being very careful and accurate in assessing the financial
condition of our borrowers and taking prompt action as required and as appropriate. Protracted economic challenges
have also reaffirmed our stance with regard to disposing of problem assets, as well as our strategies to reduce exposure
to higher risk loan portfolios, especially Investor Real Estate. Investor Real Estate declined $1.5 billion point to point;
ending balance in this quarter achieving $17.5 billion in Investor Commercial Real Estate.
In terms of strategic growth, our customer focus remains a top priority as we strive to deepen existing relationships and
acquire new customers. Our efforts continued to pay off in the third quarter as evidenced by further strengthening in
new checking account sales. We remain on track open more than 1 million new business and consumer checking
accounts this year, exceeding 2009's record level. The addition of new relationships is fueling revenue across multiple
lines of business for Regions. For example, in the third quarter we processed 182 million debit card transactions,
representing a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year. With respect to deposit balances, in line with our overall
balance sheet strategy, overall deposit levels have declined. As many of you are aware, we had a sizable amount of
higher interest rate CDs mature in the third quarter, and forecasted some run-off as rates were reduced to market levels.
Given the reduction of higher cost deposits, Regions funding mix and costs continue to improve, declining another 9
basis points, driving third quarter's net interest income and net interest margin higher. We remain on track to reach our
target 3% year-end margin. Our liquidity remains solid with a loan deposit ratio of 89%. While maintaining a clear
focus in reducing the overall cost deposits, we are successful improving our market position. According to the
recently-released data by the FDIC, Summary of Deposit analysis, Regions deposit growth ranked first in our peer
group and seventh among the 25th largest U.S. banks. Furthermore, we grew market share in 6 of 16 states in which we
operate and in 15 of our top 25 MSAs.
Unfortunately, total average loans did decline in third quarter, but importantly at a slower pace than previous quarters,
and despite the continuing de-risking efforts in the Investor Real Estate portfolio, generating good quality, profitable
loans remains a challenge, but we're starting to see some encouraging signs, including a 2% linked quarter end period
Commercial and Industrial outstandings.
Within C&I, the growth story really is about our middle market segment, which represents about half the outstandings.
These balances grew 5% in the quarter, despite low but stable line utilization. Most of this production was related to
capital expenditures and refinancing of existing debt. Small business lending is starting to get traction as well, but this
is yet to materialize into growth and net outstandings, given generally light demand. Nevertheless, small business
lending is a significant opportunity for Regions, as we are the number three small business loaner in the country as
ranked by the Small Business Administration. On whole, we remain cautious but optimistic. Net production volumes
will further strengthen in the fourth quarter due to increasingly solid new business pipelines.
On the consumer side, we continue to emphasize residential first mortgage lending. Production was $2.3 billion for the
quarter, a 31% increase over last quarter. We continue to incrementally adjust our business model to mitigate the
unfavorable revenue impact of new regulation. In fact, we've already begun mitigation efforts, having eliminated free
accounts for all customers except students and seniors and have raised balance and transaction hurdles to earn a waiver
of monthly service charges. We are closely monitoring performance on the new structure, and we will make further
adjustments as necessary, taking into account both customer value provided and related costs of delivery.
In all instances, we continue to focus on superior customer service, which we believe sets us apart and which customers
highly value. We continue to provide many free account services for customers but will incrementally adjust our
pricing models over time to better rationalize the value proposition. Please keep in mind that the actual impact of
Regulation E changes are proving less negative than anticipated. Originally, we expected implementation to reduce
service charge revenue $72 million during the second half of this year. Based on third quarter results, the second half

impact is now expected to be in the range of $50 to $60 million. This performance and the continued adoption of
overdraft services indicate customers find value in these services.
In terms of interchange revenue, like the rest of the industry, we are waiting for both rules from our regulators. So it's
difficult to project final financial impact. We do have annual interchange fees of approximately $330 million. So any
change in fee structure could be significant, but we are seeing a 14% increase in transactions activity year-over-year.
On Basel III, while still being finalized, we are not estimating it to have a significant impact on Regions. Our Tier 1
Common ratio is currently at a solid 7.6%, and based on our understanding of those rules, it's above Basel III's
minimum 7% guideline. Regions is also expected to meet Basel III's liquidity requirements in its current form. In any
case, we will ensure that Regions' capital levels remain strong and fully compliant, as the formal implementation of
Basel III requirements are better known.
In summary, we are successfully executing our plan to return Regions to sustainable profitability. We are aggressively
reducing credit risk, rolling our customer base, implementing productivity and efficiency initiatives, and taking
appropriate steps to ensure that we are positioned to fully capitalize on profitable revenue growth opportunities. At the
same time, we recognize that environmental, economic and regulatory challenges persist, creating headwinds and
caution on our part. But I am convinced that Regions has the right strategy and the right people in place to deliver on
our commitment.
David will now discuss third quarter financial results. David?
David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice
President
Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1.
As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pre-tax pre-provision net revenue, or
PPNR, amounted to $454 million, down about 7% linked quarter, due primarily to the impact of higher credit-related
cost and Regulation E. Compared to the same period a year ago, adjusted PPNR was up 11%. Within PPNR, net
interest income continued to grow, increasing $12 million, which drove a 9 basis point improvement in the net interest
margin. Non-interest revenues dipped 1% linked quarter, primarily driven by the impact of service charges from
Regulation E, which I'll cover in just a minute.
Absent this impact, non-interest revenues were higher, primarily due to strong mortgage and fixed income brokerage
revenues. Non-interest expenses increased $37 million, or 3%, second to third quarter excluding second quarter's $200
million regulatory charge. Total non-interest expenses were negatively impacted by the rise in credit-related costs,
primarily due to higher OREO and held for sale expenses related to the bulk sale of distressed assets.
Regarding credit quality, the level of non-performing assets, excluding loans held for sale, was down $186 million this
quarter, to $3.8 billion. The provision for loan losses rose to $760 million, from $651 million in the previous quarter,
and essentially equaled net charge-offs. The increase in charge-offs reflects about $233 million of charges associated
with distressed asset sales and the transfer of loans to held for sale.
Let's now take a deeper look into the quarterly results beginning with credit. Shown in Slide 2, non-performing assets,
excluding loans held for sale, were down 5% this quarter, but remain elevated. Now to reiterate what was said earlier,
an increasing and substantial portion of the migration into non-performing loans was attributable to loans that are
paying as agreed. The sluggish and persistent nature of the economy necessitates that we remain cautious when
internally risk-rating our portfolio. Despite that cautious stance, internally risk-rated problem loans did decline this
quarter. However, factors like Florida unemployment, which has been greater than 10% since May 2009 and is now
over 12%, and pressured housing prices in parts of the state require that we not get ahead of ourselves, and that we
maintain a clear and objective view of the economic environment. To that end, we remain focused on de-risking our
portfolio.

Our proactive disposition efforts remain a key element of our risk management strategy. This quarter, we sold or
transferred to held for sale a total of $1 billion of troubled assets. This total reflects a broadened effort, as it included
approximately $350 million of distressed asset sales on a bulk basis. These assets, which were predominantly land,
included both non-performing loans and OREO, and resulted in $108 million of associated charge-offs and $30 million
in losses that are recorded in non-interest expense. While the markdowns were greater than we have previously
experienced, we believe that long term economics justified getting these assets off our books and behind us. Land is
one of the most difficult assets to sell, and we were pleased to be able to dispose of these assets as opportunities arose
during the quarter.
We don't want to be in the property management business, and we'll make every reasonable effort to remove properties
and risk from our books when it makes long-term economic sense. As you can see on Slide 4, net charge-offs increased
to $759 million, or an annualized 3.52% of average loans, and reflect our efforts this quarter to de-risk our balance
sheet and dispose of problem assets, which contributed $233 million in charge-offs. Drilling down, the main source of
charge-offs continues to be our Investor Real Estate portfolio. Our loan loss provision essentially matched net
charge-offs this quarter, and was up $109 million linked quarter. Our loan loss allowance to loans ratio increased six
basis point linked quarter to 3.77%. As we said at our Investor Day, we remain cautious about the economy when
evaluating the loan portfolio and our allowance methodology reflects this stance.
Turning to the balance sheet, Slide 5 breaks down this quarter's change in loans. Although Investor Real Estate still
accounts for a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio, we have reduced this exposure substantially through the
credit crisis. In fact, total Investor Real Estate loans have declined by $6.5 billion over the last two years. And we
continue to make solid progress in reducing this segment of our portfolio as shown by the current quarter reduction of
$1.5 billion. At the same time, targeted efforts to grow segments of our portfolio are getting traction. Most notably,
Commercial and Industrial loan balances grew 2% in the quarter, primarily through our Energy and Healthcare lending
groups. Energy lending in Texas has been particularly strong.
New client acquisition is driving this growth as line utilization has remained about 40% over the last several months.
Furthermore, we continued to invest in specialized lending groups including, Business Capital, Healthcare,
Transportation and Franchise Restaurant. Lastly, we are excited about the opportunity to leverage our Small Business
expertise through our extensive branch network. Our plan to grow consumer loans is multi-faceted and includes
increased emphasis on direct lending through leveraging the strength of our branch network. Also on the consumer
side, we are evaluating products targeted at the Underserved Customer segment, a large group with short-term funding
needs.
This next slide shows changes in our deposit base this quarter. Ending time deposits declined $2.1 billion, reflecting
expected run-off of balances as we reduced maturing high cost CD rates to market levels. Low cost deposit growth was
somewhat offsetting, with ending balances increasing $854 million, or 1%, in the quarter. Total deposit levels were also
affected by our more disciplined approach to deposit pricing with some customers choosing to pay down debt rather
than hold deposits at current rates. Although customers are deleveraging and paying down their loans, our new
checking account growth has helped offset this downward pressure on deposit balances.
Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis rose $13 million linked quarter, while the margin strengthened 9
basis points increasing to 2.96%. Improvements stemmed primarily from continued optimization of deposit costs and
mix. For the quarter, deposit costs declined another 9 basis points to 0.7% in the third quarter and loan yields remained
stable at 4.29%. We expect to see continued improvement in deposit costs, and expect to reach a 3% margin in the
fourth quarter, as originally projected. In fact, we expected to reach our target of 3% this quarter, but the recent decline
in long-term interest rates accelerated mortgage refinance activity and premium amortization within the investment
portfolio, which had an adverse impact on net interest margin of around 4 basis points.
Driving further margin improvement we have approximately $11.4 billion of CDs maturing over the next 9 months,
which will be re-priced to market rates as they mature. These CDs currently carry an average 2.1% interest rate and
should enable us to reduce our overall deposit costs. In addition, the drag to net interest margin associated with interest
reversals in carrying excess cash at the Fed will fade with time. These items were margin headwinds of 16 and 8 basis

points, respectively, on an annualized basis in the third quarter.
As an update, we have recently adjusted the hedges in place to support the margin in a prolonged low rate environment.
These now reduce our interest rate sensitivity through December, 2012. Our emphasis on improving deposit mix and
cost, combined with the projected impact of these hedges, is expected to result in modest margin improvement going
forward in our most likely rate forecast scenario.
Let's now shift gears and look at non-interest revenue and expenses this quarter. Non-interest revenues were down by
about 1% linked quarter, driven by an approximate $16 million impact of Regulation E. Absent this impact,
non-interest revenues were higher, reflecting strong mortgage revenue driven by heavy refinancing activity. In fact, we
originated $2.4 billion of loans this quarter versus $1.8 billion last quarter. And refinance activity was much higher,
representing 67% of current quarter originations, up from second quarter's 41%. Also contributing to non-interest
revenues, Morgan Keegan's brokerage revenues were up 6% versus the prior quarter, reflecting continued private client
and fixed income strength. Fixed income revenue was especially strong, increasing 13% linked quarter, driven by
higher – by customer purchasing short term securities.
In terms of non-interest expense, while credit-related costs continued to remain high, we continue to focus on
containing other overall costs. Excluding prior quarter's regulatory charge, total non-interest expense was up $37
million, or 3%, linked quarter, due to a $31 million linked quarter rise in OREO and held for sale costs. As I mentioned
earlier, the rise in these costs reflects approximately $30 million resulting from a bulk sale of OREO during the quarter.
In all, PPNR continues to be impacted by credit-related costs, which on a normalized basis are impacting us by $75 to
$100 million per quarter. We recognize in this economy to be successful, we have to be diligent in our efforts to
manage expenses.
It's going be a low growth, low rate environment for an extended period of time, and we have to continue to target all
areas of staffing, occupancy, discretionary spending and credit-related expenses. Rest assured that any changes we
implement will at the same time maintain focus on service quality and making sure that we are serving the needs of our
customers.
Let me now discuss our capital and liquidity. We continued to execute our disciplined capital planning process that we
developed over the past year or so, which encompasses various scenario analysis, including stress testing under a range
of adverse conditions. It begins with a development of macroeconomic forecast scenarios, which serve as a basis for
our credit modeling. Our capital ratios remain strong, with a Tier 1 Capital ratio that now stands at 12.1%, and a Tier 1
Common ratio at a very solid 7.6%. As we stated last quarter, the Collins Amendment will have little impact to our
risk-based ratios, since trust preferred securities at about $846 million are a fairly small part of our overall capital base.
Let me briefly touch on Basel III, which will be phased in over the next several years beginning in 2013. We continue
to assess the impact, and are awaiting the details, but we feel very good about our capital base as our Tier 1 Common
and Tier 1 risk-based Capital ratios are above the respective 7% and 8.5% minimums required under Basel III. The
proposed adjustments are expected to have a minimal impact on us. Similarly, Regions is well positioned with respect
to the liquidity coverage ratio described under Basel III. In fact, we have been internally managing to a similar measure
for some time.
Moving to the broader impact of recent regulatory reform, there is no doubt that recent sweeping legislative actions will
ripple through banks' operations and financial statements from this point forward, but we are well positioned to
effectively manage any potential impact.
In terms of Regulation E, with the August 12th full implementation date behind us, we now have good visibility into
foreseeable financial ramifications. As Grayson noted earlier, the negative impact is proving less than our original
forecast. To date, roughly half of all of our customers who have overdrawn their account in the past year have chosen
to opt in or link their account for overdraft protection. And 97% of customers who have made an election after
experiencing a declined transaction are choosing to opt in or participate in overdraft protection. Clearly, customers are
seeing value in services that ensure their ability to make purchases.

The Durbin Amendment, which affects debit card interchange fees, will likely result in a revenue reduction as well. But
keep in mind that final rules have not been established. They will be determined by the Federal Reserve as we head into
next year, and we will make adjustments to our products and services, as appropriate.
Lastly, unlike many of the larger money center banks or brokerage houses, regulatory reform will only minimally
impact our brokerage revenues, since Morgan Keegan does not engage in proprietary trading, has little to no private
equity exposure, and faces very minor impact to its derivatives business. Bottom line, while regulatory changes are
certainly challenging from a revenue perspective, I'm confident that we will be able to make adjustments to minimize
any long-term financial effect on Regions.
In summary, although we are not pleased with the loss this quarter, our associates remain focused on executing both
our short-term and long-term goals. We continue to remain focused on returning the company to sustainable
profitability as promptly as possible. And with this quarter's further de-risking efforts, we are building a stronger
company with an emphasis on improving our risk profile, which will ultimately benefit our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for closing comments.
O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, David, and before we move to questions, I'd like to give you Regions' position on a topic that's received a
tremendous amount of publicity of late, residential foreclosures. Regions has a solid and tested foreclosure process in
place to ensure the fairness for customers and compliance with state and Federal regulations. In cases where all options
to avoid foreclosure have been exhausted, a committee of key managers approves the decision to proceed with
foreclosure after a thorough review of loan documentation. Once the decision has been made to proceed, the process is
the same, whether the loan is owned by Regions or by an investor that we service the mortgage for.
In each case, department managers review and verify the accuracy of the loan documents. In states where a mortgage
foreclosure affidavit or similar legal documentation is required, the document is completed and signed by a department
manager, in the presence of a notary employed by Regions.
Due to our foreclosure prevention efforts and the relatively small size of Regions servicing portfolio, our foreclosure
volumes have remained relatively low. Regions forecloses on approximately 100 loans that we own each month, and
160 investor-owned loans each month. Staffing levels are sufficient to internally verify loan information and
appropriately execute required documentation. Regions has a residential mortgage servicing portfolio of $41.2 billion.
Of that, $16.3 billion are loans that we own, while $24.9 billion are loans owned by government agencies or investors,
such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Our foreclosure rate for the entire portfolio, both owned and investor, is less than half the national average. Our ability
to maintain low foreclosure rates is the result of proactive efforts to provide solutions to distressed customers. In late
2007, Regions began reaching out to customers at risk of falling behind on payments through our Customer Assistance
Program. The program is available to customers whose loans we own and service. To date, we have helped more than
30,000 customers stay in their home. We pursue all available options to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, including
loan modifications, rate reductions, short sales and deed in lieu of foreclosure.
Foreclosure is the option of last resort. When foreclosure does take place, evictions are rare as many homes are second
homes, investment properties or are no longer occupied. Our focus on the customer has resulted in Regions second
consecutive year of ranking in the top five of J.D. Power and Associates Customer Satisfaction Survey for primary
mortgage servicers. That being said, we have directed our leadership in the business, in internal audit and in risk
management to review and validate each process step to ensure full compliance with all laws and regulations and
customer needs.
Operator, that concludes our remarks and now we'll open it up for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim
Securities.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Good morning. I had a question on inflows. We had the schedule in there in the past that were
showing us what that migration was. My estimate is it's still above $1 billion per quarter. So I wanted to get a feel for
maybe what that number might have been this quarter. And then also, you were talking about the inflows being more
related to paying as agreed. So what triggered moving more of those into non-performing this quarter?
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Marty, good morning. Just a couple of comments, then I'll ask Bill Wells, Chief Risk
Officer, to make some additional comments. Number one is that we do see some of our credit trends clearly
moderating. Our early stage and late stage delinquencies appear to have stabilized and declining slightly. We do see
internal risk-rated loans improving, as you saw in our numbers. However, the migration to non-performing status
clearly stands out this quarter. It was significantly up from last quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, we were very
cautious. One quarter does not make a trend and as we look at the loan portfolio, the pause in economic recovery, it
really focused around commercial real estate and in particular the guarantor.
If you look at as the economy continues to have a slow recovery, the capacity and willingness of these guarantors
comes into question. And as we look at what's migrated into a non-performing status this quarter, as you saw of the
amount, we disposed of a significant amount of that migration but we also retained quite a bit. And of what we
retained, 64% is still paying as agreed. But there are questions even though they're paying, there were questions raised
regarding the capacity or the willingness of those guarantors to continue. With that, I'll ask Bill to make a few
comments.
<A - William Wells, II>: Yes, Marty. The first thing, we talked about last quarter about being very cautious about
where we were with the economy, the slow growth economy. And what we saw in our migration really is a reflection
of what we've seen in the economy. Also, as we've looked at our valuations, that has caused us to be very conservative
in how we've looked at our non-accrual calls, and that's what was the uptick in looking at our gross inflows. As
Grayson mentioned, the one thing to talk about, while we're disappointed in the inflow – increase in inflow and
migration, what we did notice is that a high percentage of ours, over 60% of the non-performing loans that we had
remaining at the end of the quarter, were currently paying.
Well what the difference is, as Grayson mentioned, there was some question about the guarantor's willingness or
capacity to pay. So we thought it was very prudent to put it on non-accrual. Having said that, we do think the loss
severity is less than what we have seen before in earlier migrations. And also gives us the ability to do more
restructures, which in the past we have not done a lot of restructuring.
The other thing that Grayson mentioned is that as we see the gross migration coming in, we are continuing our efforts
to aggressively de-risk the balance sheet. We've seen that not only in the reduction in Investor Real Estate of 1.5 billion
over the quarter, but also our ability to dispose of problem assets in our sales program, which continues to work very
well for us.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And I guess a follow-up to that would be if you're looking at the pricing, and you said it
deteriorated this quarter, was that related to what you were selling? In a sense, was it more distressed or more
land-oriented, or was that really just a contraction you think in the market, in a sense of the willingness of investors?
<A - William Wells, II>: One thing, Marty, what we did is, a couple quarters ago we were approached by two or three
companies to look at some efforts of disposing of our problem assets and we did a bulk land sale this time. It was well
up to almost 4,000 properties. These were small loans, located, primarily land, located throughout our footprint. And so
in our pricing that we saw, we saw a little bit more discount than what we had been seeing in the past. That bulk sale

discount was about 40% of the book balance that we had.
The other thing that I would say is that on our additional sales, we were probably averaging in the low 20s. So an
average for us, when you take the bulk sale and what we did on the note sales, was a discount rate on our dispositions
of about 31%, as opposed to what we did last quarter of 24%.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: And, Marty, we remain cautious in regards to bulk sale. It's really the first material bulk
sale we've participated in. It clearly – we moved, as Bill said, close to 4,000 properties out of our portfolio. The
economics of bulk sales are very challenging, and we were pleased to be able to execute this transaction internally. We
still are not particularly encouraged by the economics of bulk sales, but we still believe the best way to do these are
strategic sales. But as we looked at these particular properties and how long we estimated that we'd have to carry them
to sell them to strategic buyers, we believe this was the right decision to accelerate the de-risking of our portfolio.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Well, I guess what we were talking about is the composition of the bulk sale throws some of the
pricing being lower, and then also did you have any other process where you looked at the guarantors, or was there
something in the sense of review process that triggered you to say, I need to go look at those and then expedite moving
some of those more into non-performers? And I'll let the questions move on. Thank you so much.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Marty, as we were entering into the third quarter, clearly there was a pause in the
economic recovery of the country, and we have taken a much more disciplined, much more conservative approach to
looking at guarantor support. And we've challenged ourselves on guarantor support to determine, as Bill said, the
capacity of our guarantors, has it held up through this economic cycle? Where did they stand purely from a capacity
perspective? But also as you continue to see valuations of these properties decline, how much decline in willingness of
these guarantors did we see? And so we've taken a very rigorous and disciplined approach to looking at guarantor
support, and that's why you're seeing many of these that are paying as agreed moving to a non-performing status.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Relative to the $1 billion of loans sold or transferred to held for sale this quarter, how is
disposition activity trending in October? And do you think – how should this trend in November, December here?
<A - David Turner, Jr.>: Well, right now we have about $40 to $50 million under contract. It's trending again very,
very good. The marks are holding back to what we saw pretty much in the second quarter when you take out the bulk
sales. So again, there's a lot of interest in properties. We continue to move it. We try to strike our best deal possible
and, as Grayson said, we have seen our best results is when we find a strategic buyer for these properties.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Right, got it.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Was your question specific to loan sales?
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: It was actually on both. There was transferred to held for sale plus the loan disposition, the
aggregate activity level we saw in the third quarter. Should we expect that level to remain flat, move high or move
down in the fourth quarter?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Craig, I think that as we
have stayed the course with our strategy of acceleration of disposition of stressed assets, and we would anticipate
continuing that strategy until we see a clear turn in the credit metrics.

<A - William Wells, II>: And, also, too, Craig, what I'd say is you would see us continue to use the held for sale. And
then as you look at our marks, that once it moves into held for sale have been pretty true, been pretty consistent over
time, and hold to when we actually move it into held for sale. Our marks have held true.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: And then just a follow-up on the net interest margin. What is the dollar value of CDs
maturing in the fourth quarter? And do you know roughly what the average cost is?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: We have about $4
billion that are – of CDs that are maturing in the fourth quarter. The cost of that, if you'll give me just a minute. It's just
over 2%.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: About 2.1?
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Yeah, the more meaningful – the more meaningful maturities come in the first quarter
of next year, where we do have some CDs maturing in the first quarter that are over in excess of 4% cost of funds.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: And is that a big number? It's a couple billion dollars?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Yep.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: It's roughly $4 billion.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Got it. All right. Great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Good morning.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hi. I had a follow-up on the NPA question, and then a separate line of questions on just loan
growth. When we look at the additions of 1.4 in the quarter, should I read that as a little bit of a one timer for this
reassessment of how you're treating guarantor CRE loans?
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Betsy, I think the way to look at it, last quarter, when we saw the migration in the last
quarter, we expressed that we saw moderation in our credit trends but we were cautious.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Sure.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Because we just didn't – we're seeing a little bit of volatility, if you will, in migration
quarter-to-quarter. And as we progressed into the third quarter, we're disappointed with the amount of migration that
occurred but nevertheless, that's where the economics of our customer base took us in that review.
We are, as I said earlier, we see encouragement in some of the trends in terms of early stage and late stage
delinquencies. We didn't see any surprises on the consumer side. Consumer side, while still elevated, continues to
modestly improve a little, but really tracks very closely to our forecast. The disappointment this quarter was all around
Investor Commercial Real Estate. That continues to be the problem segment in our portfolio. We do believe that the
aggressive stance that we took on guarantor support is reflected in these numbers, but in terms of trying to give
guidance on where this goes in the fourth quarter, I'm reluctant to do that.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: And also...
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: I can understand. I guess I'm just wondering, of the 1.4 that was additions in 3Q, can you give
us a dollar amount that was associated with the guarantor CRE portfolio?

<A - William Wells, II>: I would say that probably the majority when we say that 60% of what was non-performing
loans that were current, I think you would say that there's a good percentage of that, of what we saw is dealing with that
guarantor support. The other thing I'd also mention, too, Grayson mentioned early stage delinquencies, we're at about
2.09%. That's relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. If you look at our 90 plus days, they're actually down in Business
Services, and the one thing that David had also mentioned earlier, while we don't disclose the actual number, we have
seen a second quarter decline of our internally risk-rated credits, which shows another positive trend when we talk
about what we think will happen for the future.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay. And then you mentioned that you re-jiggered the hedges a little bit. We're still expecting
to get to NIM of 3% at year-end. And then, is it modest improvement from there? Could you maybe describe what you
did to re-jigger the hedges and what you mean by modest improvement?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Yeah. We do feel good,
Betsy, about getting to our net interest margin goal of 3%. Like I said earlier, we were hopeful to get to it in this past
quarter. Didn't get there through the prepayments I had mentioned on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio. The
ultimate net interest margin is going to be driven by the rate environment, which is driven by the economy.
We have positioned the balance sheet and the hedging strategy to protect us on the low side from a protracted low rate
environment for 2012. If, on the other hand, rates continue to go up and the economy rebounds, then we'll have – we'll
still participate in that rebound, just not as much as we otherwise without the hedges. And we think that that means
everything's getting that much better. So we're willing to take that risk to protect ourselves on the low side. And I
would expect that you would see, like I said, modest improvement in the net interest margin. But it's all driven by what
rates do.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: And the modest improvement is not from 3Q, but it's from your 3% expected?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: That's correct.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay. And then on loan growth, you outlined a couple of areas of loan growth. Could you just
give us some color as to on the C&I side, why you believe you're getting that growth? You mentioned new customers.
Is it – how are you extracting them from competitors? And then maybe if you could just talk a little bit about the resi
mortgage, I noticed that was up 1%. Is that a change in demand or is that a change in migration, you shifting
investments from securities into loans?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: I'll take those. In terms
of loan demand, we have been encouraged by areas within our C&I portfolio, our middle market. We are able to really
leverage our strength there. Specific industries, I mentioned Energy. Energy in Texas has really been a spot for us to
generate loan growth. We think that that will continue. We have continued to invest in specialty teams in Energy,
specifically out of Houston, and that is – we expect that to continue for us for some time. We do have other specialized
industries that we'll be investing in, Regions Business Capital. We also have investments in Healthcare, we think is
particularly strong for us. So areas of those industries where we see capital expenditures and continued expansion in
those businesses are really what's driving our loan growth and our investment in the areas of the country that are
driving that.
As it relates to the resi mortgage growth, obviously a lot of refinance activity going on across the country with the rate
environment that we have. We have continued to – we've put certain products on our books. We continually evaluate
what we want to put on our books from a rate standpoint, duration standpoint. So I think we have opportunities to grow
that, but what we will be evaluating and have evaluated is whether or not we want to put a given rate for duration on –
that's available to us.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: And, Betsy, if I could add to that. When you look at the growth in our Commercial and
Industrial segment, it really is a middle market segment. And those customers are really won and lost one at a time.
And our efforts around making sure our bankers are calling frequently and calling prospects. Because if you look at our
commercial line utilization, it's approximately 40% this time, roughly 39% last quarter. It hasn't moved much, and it
bounced around that 39 to 40 for several quarters in a row.

If you look at our pipelines, as we mentioned in last quarter's conference call, we started to see some strength in July.
That strength, we were a little cautious that it might not hold up in terms of new business. It's continued to hold up
through the quarter, and the sales pipelines that we're looking at today are strong. But it really – there's nothing really
special that we're doing from a growth standpoint. It's just executing our plans of calling on customers. It's a very
competitive market. Obviously, the industry is struggling with loan growth. And so it's very competitive. And we're
trying to win these customers one at a time each and every day.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Betsy, let me update or
give you a little more color on – you asked a margin question. So did Craig earlier. As we continue to reflect on where
we think we can go from 3%, it's more specifics on our maturing CDs. In the fourth quarter, we do have the $4 billion
maturing. The average rate there is 1.37%. And then in the first quarter, it's $4.6 billion of CDs maturing with a rate of
2.36%. So you could think about that in terms of where we might go with our continued improvement in net interest
income and margin expansion.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Well, I mean because I do think that we'll continue to see some improvement in our
deposit cost. We believe that's going to occur, but the pace of improvement coming from deposit costs will obviously
slow. And the material improvement in our margin going forward has to be in loan pricing discipline.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay. And the pace of improvement in CDs slows post 1Q?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: It carries a little bit into
the second quarter, but the strongest is in the first quarter where we have some CDs at 4.5%, 5%.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Sure. But the average is 2.36?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: That's right.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Okay. Super. Thanks so much for the detail.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Hey, guys.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Maybe I'm just missing something here, but I'm trying to understand the Reg E impact that
you had this quarter, which I think was a $16 million drag and how you get from that to the 50 to 60 for the back half of
the year? I guess I thought I would just take double that 16 million. I guess that's...
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Yeah, I think, Matt.
Matt, this is David. I think if you just did straight line you'd have 16 for the quarter we just had, which was essentially a
month and a half. So if you double that, then you're at 32.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Right, and [inaudible].
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: [inaudible]. So 32 and
the 16, is the 48, that's your 50 million and there's a little cushion.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Caution.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Caution.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: There's caution.

<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Caution in there with
respect to what might happen. That's where the number comes from.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. And then just separately on your deferred tax assets, it
looks like the amount that was excluded from Reg capital came down a little bit this quarter. And I was just wondering
if you could give us one, the overall deferred tax asset amount, and then just how we should think about how much is
included versus excluded going forward in regulatory capital.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Today our deferred tax
asset is a little over a $1 billion gross. We exclude just over $400 million from our capital calculation, and that's based
on regulatory rules. We look at and forecast our income as defined by the regulators. That 400 didn't change
dramatically from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to look at it every quarter, and it's dependent on our return to
sustainable profitability. So I guess the way I would look at it is, as we see the economy turn, credit turn and our return
to sustainable profitability will be the triggering point where we can count that little over $400 million, which is 40
some odd basis point in Tier 1 Common. And so we continue to look at that every quarter.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay. And then just lastly, if we look at the securities portfolio, I think you have one of
the higher quality books out there, and that might be driving some of the increase in prepayments, which is obviously
happening industry-wide. But if you – can you give us a sense of what the prepayment speeds have been doing there?
And I guess what the strategy is on the securities book going forward? Do you plan to reinvest or let some of it run off
like you did this quarter and use the swaps instead?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Yeah. We had
mentioned at a conference about prepayments really coming through the government short refi program versus this,
which is market driven with the low rate environment. Given we do have substantial gains in our investment portfolio,
a little over $600 million at the end of the quarter, that's up even today. We measured today, which poses risks to us, to
the extent prepayments occur.
We are going to evaluate what that risk is. And whether it makes sense to continue along with our strategy, which has
been a fairly clean investment portfolio. Virtually all of it's been agency guaranteed. And we did that as we de-risked
our balance sheet. At CMBS, taking credit risk in our investment portfolio. We had it on the loan side, and we didn't
think that was prudent for us to do. We are looking at ways to reinvest proceeds coming off the investment portfolio, as
well as whether it makes sense to take any gains and reposition into other asset classes, whether it be back into some of
the newer tranche CMBS or corporates, or whatever the case may be. And we will evaluate that during the quarter.
What we have been seeing from a cash flow perspective off the investment portfolio has been about $500 million per
month to reinvest. As a result of prepayments, that number's been up about $300 million on top of that. So we have
about $800 million right now to deal with from a reinvestment standpoint. And we'll consider that in our overall
balance sheet strategy going forward through this fourth quarter.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of K.C. Ambrecht with Millennium.
<Q - Kenneth Ambrecht>: Hi. Thanks very much for taking the questions. One thing we're looking at, we're trying to
figure out if Regions has enough capital. Right now if you – your tangible common equity of 6.13%, or 7.8 billion,
seems light considering you have criticized assets around 6.2 billion. Can you comment on that?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Your percentages that
you came up with Tier 1 Common we have about...

have about 6.2 billion of criticized assets.

<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Yeah, we continue to
obviously look at our capital levels. We feel like we're in good position from that standpoint. We do have, as I
mentioned earlier, over $600 million worth of gains sitting in our portfolio. We have – in order to really get our capital
generation going, we realize we have to return to sustainable profitability there, which is dependent on our turn -- in our
credit metrics.
<Q - Kenneth Ambrecht>: But it sounds like from the call, though, that the provision should be elevated for a lot
more quarters to come.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Well, we will – we
continue to evaluate the level of our reserves that we need to have. Our charge-offs will remain elevated, as we
discussed. Our provisioning will be dependent on what we see credit metrics doing from a migration to non-performing
status. And as we see that, while our charge-offs may remain high, the question is when do you – when are you able,
when is it prudent to provide less than your charge-offs? And that's what we have to watch each and every day for that
turn.
<Q - Kenneth Ambrecht>: Maybe I can ask you one other way then. What happens if housing were to rollover 10%
from here or 15%? How much cushion do you have to protect yourselves if the housing double dips?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Yeah. We have a – we
have a robust capital planning process that we go through, including multiple scenarios, adverse scenarios. We have
about actually 5 scenarios that we run from an adverse standpoint, which includes GDP and housing prices and
unemployment. And we've gone through those scenarios and believe we'd be adequately capitalized through those
scenarios. We continue to update that each and every month as the group meets. And we think from that perspective
that we have enough capital. If you go through another double dip, obviously it puts strains on capital. No question
about that. But we think, based on our forecasting, that we should be in okay shape from that standpoint.
<Q - Kenneth Ambrecht>: Okay. And then one last question, if you had to look forward a year, I know a lot things
are dependent on housing and the markets, but if you had to look forward a year, and considering you have $6.2 billion
of criticized assets, a lot of which are resi-related, how much do you think your book value is going be down in a year?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Well...
<Q - Kenneth Ambrecht>: Because last year at this time, it was $7.40, now it's $6.22. So you're down 16% on the
year. What do you think it will be in a year from now?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: We haven't given
guidance with respect to what we think our book value will be or our earnings for next year. I think there's no question
that the determinant on where we will be with regards to our book value is going be based on the economy and the turn
in our credit metrics. And that is the key driver. And if you can tell me when the economy is going to settle down and
improve, I can give you better perspective on that, but that's really what it's going be driven off of.
<Q - Kenneth Ambrecht>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Heather Wolf with UBS.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Heather.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: Hi. Good morning. Couple quick questions, on the $1 billion of troubled assets sold or
transferred and the 1.4 billion of inflows, can you give us a sense for how much of that is related to resi real estate and
how much of it is related to commercial real estate?

<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Yeah. Heather, I would
say that the majority of what you saw in our dispositions was really dealt with on the commercial side. We did do that
bulk transaction that has to do on our sales of – I believe it was $350 million that part of that coming out of the loan
sale and OREO. But the majority of what you saw coming through was from the commercial side.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: You know what? I think I had this problem last quarter. Let me clarify again. I understand it's all
coming from the commercial side of it, but is it land and property for use in resi or for use on commercial real estate
such as retail, lodging, hotel, et cetera?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: It's predominantly
coming through on the land side. If you look...
<A - William Wells, II>: Resi.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Resi land.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Resi land.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: Resi land. Okay.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: If you look at Page 24 of
our earnings supplement, that gives a little bit of a breakdown. And I would say when you look at that land, condo and
single family, the majority of the green part is coming out of the resi side.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: Okay. And can you give us a sense for all of the -- of all of your NPA, OREO and NPL, where
do you have that resi land marked currently?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: I'm trying to go through
and think of our numbers of how – we'll have to get list and get back to you on that to make sure we have the right
number, because we've gone through and marked down over a period of time. And then did a recent markdown, we
moved to held for sale. If it's okay I'll let...
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: And then we market it every time we re-evaluate valuations. And so, we'll have to
calculate that. It's a good question.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Let me give you some
broad strokes. And this, Heather, may not be what you're looking for. But obviously if we have that in OREO or held
for sale, that's been mark-to-market. So we have that covered at whatever the current market price is. Now if you're
asking what's the percentage of book, we'll have to get back to you on that. Obviously, we do have those mortgages as
our – in non-performing loans, too. And I don't have the reserve coverage on those. Is that what you want to know
about?
<Q - Heather Wolf>: Yeah. I'm trying to figure out how much more in the way of marks we can expect on the existing
NPL book.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Okay. It's a good question. We can certainly spend some time.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Doing that and we'll get
back to List and let him contact you.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: Okay. That sounds great. And then one last question on your consumer loans restructured but not
included in NPAs, can you give us a sense for the types of re-defaults you're seeing currently versus what they may
have looked like previously?
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Heather, I've got Barb Godin with us here. And I'll ask Barb to answer that question
briefly.

<A - Barb Godin>: Good morning, Heather. Yes, we are continuing to see a recidivism rate give or take around 20%
on that book. And that's held pretty constant for us over the last 6 or 7 quarters.
<Q - Heather Wolf>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.

Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jefferson Harralson with KBW.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Hi, Jefferson.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Maybe you guys could you help with put back risk and the amount of loans that you have
originated and I was thinking specifically about EquiFirst. I know it's been a long time ago you sold it. But do you hold
revenue warranty risk on EquiFirst?
<A - Barb Godin>: No, we don't have any.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: We do not.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Okay. And can you talk about the put backs that you've received so far and what you
expect over the next few quarters?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Sure, this is David.
Jefferson, in terms of our put back, they've been fairly consistent and not all that large. We're probably in the $3 to $5
million range per quarter. We think we have our reserve coverage about almost two years worth of our exposure based
on our experience with our reserve of around $30 million, a little over $30 million. So our put backs repurchased
reserve issue that you've seen in other places just has not been an issue for us.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: And, Jefferson, the – we have predominantly sold to the agencies and so almost all of
our put backs come in from the agencies. They come in two forms. They come in a make hold transaction, which is
where the agency has disposed of that property at a loss and they're expecting us to make them whole on that loss. They
also come back in mortgages that we're – they're asking us to put back on our balance sheet. As David said, we're
incurring a loss on the combined of those two in the $3 to $5 million a quarter. That's a little bit up from last year, but
not materially. And when you look at a $40 billion loan portfolio that we're servicing, it's just not material to our
numbers, and we don't anticipate it becoming material. I would tell you on the loans that they're putting back to us, we
are challenging or appealing some number of those.
We're probably, of the ones we appeal, we probably win half of those. But I would tell you successfully they're putting
back about 80% of what they desire to put back. And so – but overall, I mean, if you look at our numbers and the size
of our portfolio, just not a material issue for Regions.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Right. And lastly, on the GAAP DTA. What type of a scenario would it take for that
GAAP DTA to have to be written down? Do you need to be profitable you think by second or third quarter of next
year? Or do you – I guess if you're not profitable by I don't know third quarter next year, would you expect GAAP
DTA write-downs?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: The threshold is more
likely than not if you would realize the benefits of that deferred tax asset. And so we – we evaluate that. The vast
majority of our DTA is due to the – our allowance for loan losses and timing differences related to that for book and
tax. We don't have a lot of net operating loss carry forwards that are about to expire, which would put more risk that
you would have to have a valuation allowance for GAAP purposes.
So we think – we've obviously trended out cash flows and profitability over an extended period of time in support of
the DTA. And from a GAAP standpoint, we don't foresee, at least at this juncture, any valuation allowance, anything in

addition to what we already have. I think we have some valuation allowance for some state net operating loss carry
forwards that are fairly minor. But we do not anticipate having that valuation allowance for GAAP purposes.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Thank you, Jefferson.
Operator
Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott Valentin>: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. You mentioned Florida as still being an area of
concern. Just wondering with the foreclosure issues starting to creep up, what that will do to foreclosure timelines and
potentially OREO expense going forward?
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Well, Scott, we continue to see from market to market, there are markets in Florida
stabilizing, but there are many who still are showing declines. And we're predicting further declines into next year.
Right now, on average in Florida, our foreclosure process is taking about 23 months. We're trying to work hard with
those customers, but obviously our foreclosure REIT in the state of Florida is high. It's about at the national average for
all of the U.S., but Florida as you know, is probably three or four times the national average in Florida. And so we're
disappointed that we've got foreclosures period, but encouraged that our foreclosure rate compares so favorably.
But we would anticipate that there's going to be a lot of attention on this issue. It's too early to call. There's a certain
amount of media attention, and there will be a certain amount of regulatory intensity around this foreclosure issue. I
think in today's call, it's way too early for us to predict what some of the implications to foreclosures will be going
forward.
I can tell you we feel good about our process, but we're going back and re-validating and re-testing to make sure that
everything is working as it should be, but I think it's going to take a few weeks for this issue to fold out across the
industry and as it does, we'll react appropriately but I think we're in a good position today.
<Q - Scott Valentin>: Okay. And just in terms of that extended duration of the foreclosure process, do tests from
impairments initially book the asset I guess into a fair market -- a mark-to-market on the asset and then do you test
later, maybe 12 months or some period later for impairment?
<A - Barb Godin>: Yes, we do.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Yes. Barb, if you could speak to that for just a second.
<A - Barb Godin>: Yes. We absolutely do. And, again, just going back to what Grayson said a second ago, Scott, just
to give you some metrics on our Florida foreclosure rate, we're at 4.34 compared to an industry of 14%. And even
during this entire timeframe with the foreclosure issues front and center in the media, we have not stopped our
foreclosure process. Again, we work very diligently with our customers up to the point of foreclosure and even up to
the point of being sold on the courthouse steps, if need be, so that we give every opportunity to avoid foreclosure where
possible. But again, to the second part of your question, yes, we do test for impairments.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: Let me add to that. This
is David. We go through a process and get updated appraisals periodically, but we have a – it's incumbent upon us to
make sure we're taking markdowns on our OREO at least quarterly, per the accounting rule. So even if we don't have
an appraisal, it doesn't mean we don't at least consider what we're seeing with sales activities or what's going on in the
marketplace. We leverage that information to take whatever marks we think we need to on a quarterly basis.
<Q - Scott Valentin>: Okay. And on a different note, the guarantor issue, it sounds like you reviewed loans for
guarantor financial ability to carry the loan. Is that – was that an entire loan portfolio or just a certain segment of the

portfolio and is there much more to review there?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr., Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President>: What we do, Scott, is we
go through our risk rating scale. We go through and look at guarantor support on an ongoing basis. These are some of
our credits that we had identified. And we went through those specifically to identify where the guarantor issues were.
Usually these are in some of your troubled assets. When the question came up about valuation, and that in part came
about the question about looking at guarantors. But we look at our whole portfolio on an ongoing basis to look about
where we are as far as the guarantor's willingness and capacity to repay.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: But, Scott, let me be clear. The valuation is a big part of this issue. It's not just
re-evaluating guarantor support. It's re-evaluating guarantor support in light of valuation change.
<Q - Scott Valentin>: Okay. And as you mentioned before, it's ongoing, I guess, it's throughout -- all the time.
<A - O.B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: That's correct.
<Q - Scott Valentin>: Okay. That's very much.
