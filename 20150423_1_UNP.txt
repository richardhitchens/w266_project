President of Operations; and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.
This morning Union Pacific is reporting net income of $1.2 billion or $1.30 per share for the first quarter of 2015. This
is a 9% increase in earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2014. Solid core pricing gains in the quarter were
partially offset by a sharp drop in volume. While we took actions during the quarter to adjust for the volume decline,
we did not run an efficient operation. Total first quarter volumes were down 2%, with particular softness in coal,
industrial products, and intermodal.
Throughout last year, we worked to add the people, locomotives, and capacity needed to meet a dramatic increase in
demand. By the end of 2014, we had seen full-year volume growth of 7%, and we were fully resourced to meet this
demand. Over the last few months, however, volume has shifted negative. As a result, our operation is in catch-up
mode and not as efficient as it should be.
Managing a network is a constant balancing act to ensure you have the right resources in the right place at the right
time. This balancing act becomes more difficult during significant volume swings. We are taking the steps to align our
resources with current demand while remaining agile in an ever-changing environment. We remain committed to safely
providing excellent service for our customers while improving that service and our financial performance.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Eric.
Eric L. Butler
Thanks, Lance, and good morning.
In the first quarter, our volume was down 2%, driven by challenges in some key markets. Automotive and Ag products
volume grew, with declines in coal, industrial products, intermodal, and chemicals. Milder winter weather and natural
gas prices drove softer coal demand. Lower crude oil prices reduced demand for shale-related shipments, and we also
experienced the effects from the drawn-out West Coast labor port dispute. I'll talk about more specifics as we walk
through each group.
The fuel surcharge revenue reduction negatively impacted average revenue per car and was a 4% headwind on freight
revenue. However, solid pricing gains across our business led to a core price improvement of 4%, which combined
with 1% mix and drove average revenue per car up 1%. Overall freight revenue was down 1%, as our strong pricing
gains and mix were offset by lower volume and fuel surcharge revenue. Let's take a closer look at each of the six
business groups.
Ag products revenue increased by 3% on a 3% volume increase and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car.
Grain volume was down 2% this quarter. We continued to see strong demand for overseas export feed grain shipments,
particularly through the Gulf and Mississippi River. Those gains are offset primarily by declines in wheat exports and
to a lesser degree softer demand for domestic feed grain.
Grain products volume was up 4% for the quarter. Ethanol volume grew 7%, driven by increased gasoline consumption
and export demand. We also saw increased export demand for soybean meal, and a strong canola crop drove increases
in canola meal shipments. Food and refrigerated shipments were up 3%, driven primarily by continued strength in
import beer, partially offset by slightly lower refrigerated food shipments.
Automotive revenue was up 6% in the first quarter on a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by a 1% reduction in
average revenue per car. Finished vehicle shipments were up 11% this quarter, driven by continued strength in
consumer demand and a reduced impact from winter weather. The seasonally adjusted annual rate for North American
automotive sales was 16.6 million vehicles in the first quarter, up 6.4% from the same quarter in 2014. Auto parts
volume grew 3% this quarter, driven primarily by increased vehicle production.
Chemicals revenue was flat for the quarter, with a 2% improvement in average revenue per car offsetting a 1% volume
decline. Plastics shipments were up 8% in the first quarter, as stability in resin prices resulted in improved buyer
confidence in the market. Strength in fertilizer demand this quarter drove volume up 10%. The slight delay in last fall's

harvest pushed some application into the first quarter of this year. We also saw strength in export markets, particularly
to China.
Finally, lower crude oil prices and unfavorable price spreads continued to impact our crude oil shipments, which were
down 38% in the first quarter.
Coal revenue declined 5% in the first quarter. Volumes were down 7%, partially offset by a 3% improvement in
average revenue per car. Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 1% for the quarter. We experienced a very
mild winter this year, which combined with low natural gas prices to reduce demand for coal. Colorado-Utah tonnage
was down 32% for the quarter, as the mild winter and low natural gas prices drove receiving utilities to switch to other
fuel sources. Colorado-Utah tonnage was also impacted by soft demand for coal exports.
Industrial products revenue was up 1%, as a 3% decline in volume was offset by a 3% improvement in average revenue
per car. We continued to see strength in construction products, where volume was up 4% for the first quarter. Demand
for rock was strong in the quarter, particularly in the southern part of our franchise. Metals volume was down 17%, as
lower crude oil prices significantly reduced new drilling activity. In addition, the strong U.S. dollar drove increased
imports, which reduced demand from domestic steel producers. Our government and waste shipments declined 8% in
the quarter, primarily driven by a temporary reduction in short-haul waste shipments.
As a side note, our minerals business was not a key driver in industrial products this quarter, but I wanted to mention
the fact that our frac sand volume was up 3%. Demand remained strong in January but tailed off significantly in March.
I'll talk more about our outlook in a moment.
Turning to intermodal, revenue was down 5%, driven by a 3% decrease in both volume and average revenue per unit.
Due to the structure of intermodal fuel surcharge programs, there was a greater average revenue per unit impact to
intermodal this quarter than seen in other commodities. Domestic shipments grew 9% in the first quarter, setting an
all-time first quarter record for volume. We continued to see strong demand from highway conversions and for our new
premium services. International intermodal volume was down 12%, driven by the West Coast port labor dispute, which
stretched late into the quarter. We are encouraged that the parties have come to a tentative agreement, so we're working
with our customers to reduce the backlog and return to normal.
Let's take a look at our outlook for the rest of the year. In Ag products, we expect grain volume to return to normal
seasonal patterns through the third quarter, and we anticipate exports will favor shorter haul shipments to the Gulf and
river in the near term. As always, we're keeping a close eye on planning reports and the weather to determine what the
next crop will look like. In grain products, we think the ethanol market will remain strong, and BDGs will remain
steady throughout the year. Finally, we anticipate continued strength in our import beer business, and we see potential
upside in refrigerated shipments.
In automotive, finished vehicles and auto shipments should continue to benefit from strengthened sales, driven by a
healthy U.S. economy, replacement demand, and lower gasoline prices.
Coal volume will largely be dependent on the weather this summer and natural gas prices. If natural gas prices remain
in the current range, it will be a headwind throughout the year. Also, the latest inventory figures show that stockpiles
are significantly up from last year and are now above the five-year historical average, which will likely lead to
continued softness.
We think most of our chemicals markets will remain solid this year, though we expect that crude oil prices will remain
a significant headwind for crude-by-rail shipments for the rest of the year.
Lower crude oil prices will also impact some of our industrial products markets. We expect metals to continue to
experience headwinds as capital investments for new drilling activities are reduced. As I mentioned earlier, frac sand
shipments were up modestly in the first quarter, but we expect to be meaningfully lower year over year starting in the
second quarter, as demand softens and we come up against tougher comps. On the positive side, we think continued
strength in the construction and housing markets should drive growth in aggregates and lumber.

Finally, we anticipate strong demand for domestic intermodal to continue throughout the year, primarily from highway
conversions. For international intermodal, we expect the backlog recovery to continue for the next few weeks, then we
return to normal seasonal patterns for the remainder of the year. Both domestic and international intermodal should
benefit from strengthened consumer demand in the U.S.
To wrap up, we are experiencing some volume headwinds created by uncertainty in the coal market and crude oil
prices, but we see opportunities in other markets. While top line revenue will be impacted by lower fuel surcharge
revenue, we expect solid core pricing gains for the year. As always, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise
will support new business development efforts throughout the year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Cameron.
Cameron A. Scott
Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance, which is the foundation of our operations.
The first quarter 2015 reportable personal injury rate improved 23% versus 2014 to a record low of 0.85. These results
are a validation that our comprehensive safety strategy is working and that we are focused on the right things. I'm very
proud of the team's commitment to find and address risk in the workplace.
In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate increased 6% to 3.16. To make improvement going
forward, we continue to focus on enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment to help reduce the
absolute number of incidents, including those that do not meet regulatory reportable thresholds.
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 27% versus 2014 to a first quarter record mark of 1.88. Our
strategy of reinforcing public awareness through community partnerships and public safety campaigns is generating
results, and we will continue our focus in these areas to drive further improvement. In summary, the team has made a
nice step function improvement in several areas that is generating results on our way towards an incident-free
environment.
Moving to network performance, as we discussed, we worked hard in 2014 to match network resources with the robust
volume levels in 2014. During the latter part of the fourth quarter, our available resources were largely aligned with
demand, helping generate the sequential velocity improvement in the network. While we have largely held those
velocity levels made in December, we still have more work to do as we exit the first quarter that provided more
favorable weather conditions, but one that also saw more extensive track renewal programs on key corridors.
And while our velocity in the first quarter was almost one mile an hour faster than the first quarter of 2014, our service
performance still fell short. As reported to the AAR [Association of American Railroads], first quarter velocity and
freight car dwell were about flat when compared to the first quarter of 2014. However, the team continues a relentless
push to improve service and reduce cost.
While productivity was not where we wanted it to be, we did generate some efficiencies, even with the decline in
volumes during the first quarter. We achieved record train lengths in nearly all major categories, including in
automotive, where we leveraged an 11% increase in finished vehicle shipments with a 5% increase in average auto
train length.
Our terminal productivity initiatives also continued to generate positive results, as cars switched per employee day
increased 3%. But our suboptimal service performance and timing issues with readjusting resources led to
inefficiencies during the quarter. One example of this is locomotive productivity, as measured by gross ton miles per
horsepower day, which was down 6% versus 2014.
As for our efforts to readjust resources, while we chased volume on the way up last year, it's been a different story in
the first part of 2015 with some softer volumes we've seen thus far. To balance our resources to current demand, we
have placed around 500 TE&Y employees into furlough or alternative work status. We have also reduced our original
TE&Y hiring plan downward by 400, and are now planning to hire around 2,400 TE&Y employees for the year. Of

course, we will continue to monitor and adjust our workforce levels and hiring plans throughout the year as volume
dictates.
The same process is underway with our locomotives. By the end of the quarter, we had already moved 475 units back
into storage and continue to look at every opportunity to further reduce our active fleet.
Also, our planned acquisition of 218 units this year will further improve our overall reliability and efficiency. We have
experienced a timing lag in getting our resources aligned with demand, but we're intently focused on balancing our
resources and reducing our cost as the year progresses.
We are also adjusting our 2015 capital program down $100 million to approximately $4.2 billion. We will continue to
invest to improve the safety and resiliency of the network, including more than $1.8 billion in infrastructure
replacement programs. Our capital program also includes continued investment for service, growth, and productivity,
which are primarily concentrated on the southern region of our network, but which also include corridor strategies that
reduce bottlenecks across the system. This reduction does not impact our core investment strategy, which is to maintain
a safe, strong, resilient network and to invest in service growth and productivity projects where returns can justify the
investment.
I'd also like to give a quick update on Positive Train Control. As most of you know, the rail industry has been required
to install PTC by the end of 2015. The required development and testing of this new technology has been challenging.
Nonetheless, we have been moving forward, investing approximately $1.7 billion thus far to complete the mandate.
Now that the scope of the project has been better defined, we've updated our total project investment in PTC to
approximately $2.5 billion. Although UP will not meet the current 2015 deadline, we have been making good faith
effort to do so, including field testing since October 2013. The industry has been working to extend the deadline, and I
think there is general understanding on Capitol Hill that this has to happen. While we remain hopeful that an extension
will be passed, our overall investment in the program will not be contingent on the deadline.
To wrap up, as we continue on in 2015, we expect to continue generating record safety results on our way to an
incident-free environment. We expect to leverage the strengths of our franchise to improve network performance. We
will invest in the resources and network capacity needed to overcome congestion and generate productivity gains. And
we will remain agile, balancing and adjusting resources depending upon demand to drive improved cost performance.
Ultimately, running a safe, reliable, and efficient railroad creates value for our customers and increased returns for our
shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight
Thanks and good morning.
Let's start with a recap of first quarter results. Operating revenue was flat with last year at just over $5.6 billion. Strong
core pricing was offset by declines in fuel surcharge revenue and total volumes. Operating expenses totaled just over
$3.6 billion, decreasing 4% when compared to last year. The net result was operating income growing 7% to about $2
billion.
Below the line, other income totaled $26 million, down from $38 million in 2014. Interest expense of $148 million was
up 11% compared to the previous year, driven by increased debt issuance during 2014 and at the beginning of 2015.
Income tax expense increased to $704 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings.
Net income grew 6% versus last year while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued
share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share, up 9% versus last
year.
Now turning to our top line, freight revenue of about $5.3 billion was down 1% versus last year. In addition to a 2%
volume decline, fuel surcharge revenue was down about $200 million when compared to 2014. The decline in fuel

price was partially offset by the positive lag in the fuel surcharge programs. All in, we estimate the net impact of
reduced fuel prices added about $0.08 to earnings in the first quarter versus last year. This includes both the fuel
surcharge lag and lower diesel costs. In the second quarter, we expect the net earnings impact of reduced fuel prices to
be closer to neutral.
Business mix was slightly positive for the quarter, driven by a decline in lower average revenue per car international
intermodal shipments. Looking ahead, given the volume shifts between our commodity groups, business mix is likely
to have a negative impact on freight revenues beginning in the second quarter.
Slide 23 provides more detail on our core pricing trends. First quarter core pricing came in at 4%, reflecting a more
favorable pricing environment in 2015. This represents a full point of sequential improvement from the fourth quarter
of last year. Of this, about 0.5% reflects the benefit of legacy business that we renewed earlier this year, and this
includes both the 2015 and 2016 legacy contract renewals.
Moving on to the expense side, slide 24 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which
increased 9% versus 2014. Lower volumes were more than offset by labor inflation, increased training expense, and
lower productivity. Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 6% when compared to 2014.
About a quarter of this increase was in our capital-related workforce. And as Cam just discussed, we are adjusting our
total hiring downward to better balance our resources. The largest hiring area will continue to be in the TE&Y ranks. In
total, when you factor in attrition, training, furloughs, and volume levels, we expect our net overall workforce levels to
be around 48,000 by year-end, about flat with year-end 2014.
Labor inflation was about 6% for the first quarter, driven primarily by agreement wage inflation, and will likely
continue to be in the 6% range for the second quarter as well. Keep in mind that the first and second quarters include
the 3% agreement wage increase effective the first of this year on top of the 3.5% wage increase from last July. For the
full year, we still expect labor inflation to be about 5%, including pension.
Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $564 million, down 39% when compared to 2014. Lower diesel fuel
prices along with a 1% decline in gross ton miles drove the decrease in fuel expense for the quarter. Compared to the
first quarter of last year, our fuel consumption rate improved 1%, while our average fuel price declined 38% to $1.95
per gallon.
Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense increased 6% to $643 million.
Increased locomotive and freight car material costs were the primary drivers. Depreciation expense was $490 million,
up 6% compared to 2014. We expect depreciation expense to increase about 6% for the full year.
Slide 27 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $311 million,
which is flat when compared to 2014. Other expenses came in at $259 million, up $33 million versus last year. Higher
state and local taxes and casualty costs contributed to the year-over-year increase. For 2015, we still expect the other
expense line to increase between 5% and 10% on a full-year basis excluding any unusual items.
Turning to our operating ratio performance, we achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 64.8%, improving 2.3 points
when compared to 2014. Our operating ratio benefited about three points from lower fuel prices, including the fuel
surcharge lag. Keep in mind, however; we also lost the revenue benefit from our energy-related volumes as energy
prices declined.
Turning now to our cash flow, in the first quarter cash from operations increased to just under $2.1 billion. This is up
17% compared to 2014, primarily driven by higher earnings and the timing of cash tax payments. We also invested
about $1.1 billion this quarter in cash capital investments. And as Cameron just noted, we now intend to spend about
$4.2 billion in capital for the full year, down about $100 million from our previous estimate. Given the sharp decline in
fuel surcharge revenue, capital spending will likely be greater than the 17% of revenue this year. Longer term,
however, we still expect capital spending to be about 16% to 17% of revenue, assuming of course that fuel returns to
somewhat higher levels.

And one housekeeping item to note on the cash flow statement; as you know, in the first quarter, we changed the timing
of our quarterly dividend payments so that the cash outlay occurs in the quarter for which the dividend is declared. As a
result, we had two dividend payments during the quarter, one for the fourth quarter of 2014 and one for the first quarter
of this year. This is the only time we'll see this, this year. And together, these payments totaled about $922 million. We
also increased our first quarter dividend by 10%. This is in line with our commitment to grow the dividend payout
target to 35%.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, our adjusted debt balance grew to $15.6 billion at quarter end, up from $14.9 billion
at year end. This takes our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio to 42.6%, up from 41.3% at year-end 2014. We remain
committed to an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio in the low to mid-40% range and an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio
of 1.5 times plus. We feel our current cash outlook positions us well to execute on our cash allocation strategy.
Our profitability and strong cash generation enable us to continue to fund our strong capital program and to grow
shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we bought back about 6.9 million shares, totaling $807 million. Between the
first quarter dividend and our share repurchases, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders in the quarter. This
represents roughly a 23% increase over 2014, demonstrating our commitment to increasing shareholder value.
So that's a recap of the first quarter results. As we look towards the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there
are a number of factors that we'll be watching very closely. On the revenue side, we expect the favorable pricing
environment to continue, supported by improving service and our strong value proposition. And we remain committed
to solid core pricing above inflation.
As for volume, the outlook is a little more uncertain. The recent challenges that we've seen in coal and in the
shale-related markets are likely to continue. At this point, we think coal volumes in the second quarter could be down
in the mid-single-digit range versus 2014, with ongoing softness throughout most of the year, as Eric discussed earlier.
For the year, strength in other areas could offset these headwinds, depending on what happens to the drivers, ranging
from consumer spending to the size of the 2015 grain harvest. Of course, as I've previously noted, the volume mix
shifts could also have a negative revenue impact. We'll just have to see how it all plays out this year.
From the cost perspective, the second quarter will likely still reflect some impacts of operating inefficiencies, although
as Cameron noted, we will see gradual improvement in productivity over time. And as I mentioned earlier, if fuel prices
stay close to where they are today, the net impact on earnings should be neutral for the remaining quarters of the year.
Taken together, we have our work cut out for us again in 2015, but we will continue our unrelenting focus on safety,
service, and shareholder returns.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thanks, Rob.
As you've heard from the team, we've had some challenges to start off the year but we are taking the steps needed to
work through those challenges and realize the opportunities we see ahead. As Eric mentioned, weakness in our coal and
shale-related markets could persist for some time, but we continue to see gradual improvement in the underlying
economy, which should be a positive for other parts of our business.
When you consider other wildcards from the next grain harvest to the strength of the U.S. dollar, it all adds up to a
dynamic environment, and that's the nature of our business. Our goal is to provide our customers with excellent service
wherever the need arises. We expect to see solid improvement in network performance and cost efficiency over the
coming months. As we leverage the strengths of our diverse franchise, we continue to be intently focused on safety,
service, and shareholder returns.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Good morning. So first I wanted to ask you on coal, it seems like the macro backdrop is
pretty challenging. You acknowledged that, particularly with low natural gas prices, but I'm wondering. Your
mid-single-digit decline seemed somewhat optimistic versus the trend we've seen recently that's been more like – I
don't know, down 10% – 15%. So what is it that leads you to say mid-single digits instead of worse, and how much
visibility do you have to that?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric, do you want to take care of that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes, as you know, Tom, a lot of factors go into play. There was a relatively mild winter. In our
serving territory of our utilities, the heating days were down 5% to 10% versus last year. We are assuming more normal
weather patterns for the balance of the year. So that clearly is a factor.
The other factor, as you know, is this is typically the shelf months. We see this every year where you don't really have
heating or cooling during the spring. And again, we're assuming that we're going to get back to normal seasonal
weather patterns. As we mentioned, natural gas prices, what happens with that will have an impact, but a lot of factors
but that's our best assessment at this time.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay, thanks. And the second or follow-up question I guess on the resource levels, you
indicated a number of times that inefficiency or let's say a time lag in resource reduction versus volume. How do we
think about how that will play through in second quarter? Do you catch up pretty quickly and see reduction in
resources? Do you expect train speed to improve? And how do you think that plays out in terms of the margin
performance? Does that really kick in and support margin improvement, or is that something where the revenue
headwind is the more dominant factor in terms of again looking at how that affects the OR or the margin performance?
Thank you.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure, Tom. Thinking about the time lag, so we talked to you all last year about trying to catch
up with the volume, and then in the fourth quarter we indicated we had finally caught up and were fully resourced. And
then coming into the first quarter of this year, volume shifted what I would consider fairly dramatically to being
negative, ending up 2% down. And so it's really all about being caught in the riptide, being behind the curve in terms of
getting our resources right-sized.
When we look forward into the second quarter, we've indicated that we're anticipating better service and better
efficiency. We haven't put a stake in the ground and said exactly how that happens. But we anticipate, and I see it
happening right now on the network, we anticipate continuous improvement as Cameron and his team get the business
right-sized. Rob or Cam, any additional comments?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I would add to that, Tom, to your margin question. Of course we're always focused on
improving the margins. And as Lance pointed out, we're focused on continuous improvement on the cost and balancing
the network. We will have the challenges, as I pointed out, of the mix shift we anticipate taking hold in the second
quarter and beyond. But even with all that activity, we're always going to be focused on improving our margins from
where we are today.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.

Our next question is coming from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your
questions.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Great, thanks for taking the question, just first question on the top line. If you think
about the range of potential downside on the frac sand business, have you guys tried to bookend that at all as far as how
much you think demand may be down as we head into the second quarter?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So a lot of things could change that or drive that, as you know, particularly coal prices. As we
look at the outlook right now, we see a mid-teens range. We see our business look more like 2013 volumes than 2014
volumes.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, the core pricing gains of 4%, I think,
Rob, you mentioned that inflation was going to be on the labor side unusually high this year because of the new labor
agreement. How do we think about that in terms of your expectation of pricing above inflation? Are you guys expecting
a lot more productivity for the back half of this year? Or how do we think about that pricing inflation relationship, or do
we think that pricing maybe gets better in the second and third quarters than the 4% you reported?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: David, just to capstone that question, we've been consistent and clear that when we're pricing in
the marketplace, we're pricing for our value proposition. And so whatever, either Eric or Rob, if you want to comment
on, it's in that context. Our pricing in the marketplace is our value.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I would just say, David, that our long-term view is pricing above inflation. It's not
necessarily a quarterly pricing activity directly tied to inflation. And as I called out, we expect the first half of this year
to have a little higher labor inflation. But overall for the year, we expect our overall company inflation to be in that 3%
to 4% range. So that gives you a guiding light in spite of the challenges that we know we're going to face in the first
half on the labor line. Overall companywide, we think in that 3% to 4% inflation rate for the full year.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay, that 4% includes the legacy reprice, right, for first quarter, or is that...
<A - Robert M. Knight>: The 4% we reported for the first quarter does include legacy repricing, yes.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Good morning, guys, thanks for taking my question. As a clarification to David's last
question and your prepared remarks, Rob, you had indicated that the core pricing accelerated to 4% in the first quarter.
And I think you had mentioned that roughly half of that was attributable to legacy. Was that half of the step up from
3% to 4% or just half of the 4% in aggregate?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Let me clarify that. Of the 4% core pricing we reported in the first quarter, 0.5 point of that,
so 3.5% to 4%, the 0.5 point was attributable to the legacy renewals.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Thanks, I appreciate the clarification. And taking a step back, going back to your Investor
Day toward the end of 2014, you had indicated that your longer-term four-year volume outlook is positive. I guess
given the drop-off that we've seen in terms of the shale-related business, some of the coal challenges that you indicated,
as well as uncertainty in terms of the Ag crop, do you still have confidence that the volume growth in aggregate will be
positive, or do you see that a little bit more challenging as we look out from here?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob, this is Lance. I'll let Rob answer that a little bit more in detail. But the thing that we think
about is the beauty of our franchise, the strength of our franchise, and all of the opportunity that it represents. We've got
a diverse book of business. And over time, we have seen that there are always areas where we can develop more

business and grow. And so we feel still quite bullish about in the long term being able to grow based on this great
franchise.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Lance, I would just add to your comment that we know we have some challenges right now.
But if you look at the UP franchise, it is a fabulous franchise that has great optimism long term. Coal is not going to –
the inventories are high right now. Gas prices are low. The energy prices are low, which is impacting our frac business.
All of those are going to balance out over the long term.
And then you add on top of that what's happening in the chemical franchise, the opportunities still in front of us longer
term with the investments that are being made in the Gulf. If you look at the Mexico franchise, the fact we're the only
railroad that interchanges at the six border crossings and you look at all the opportunities that are still taking place
there, if you look at our strong auto franchise. So if you add it all up, the diversity of our business mix and the strength
of our franchise long term still provides us stronger optimism, which is why we think longer term that the expectation
still is that volume will be on the positive side of the ledger.

Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - William Jeffrey Greene>: Hi, good morning. Rob, can I ask you to put maybe if you can a little bit finer point on
some of the challenges on the cost side in the first quarter? I think last year you estimated we had about a $35 million
headwind from weather. Can you estimate what the headwind is from some of the inefficiencies that occurred in the
network this quarter?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Bill, you're right. Last year we called out about $35 million of inefficiency tied to the
significant weather events, primarily in the Chicago area. This year, clearly our cost performance in the first quarter is
not what we'd like it to be. And I'd say if you take fuel off the table, our costs were about $200 million up year over
year. And it's a combination of things that we all have talked about this morning. We had some timing issues. We've
resourced for, unexpected coming into the quarter, higher level of volume. We had some mechanical activities that we
took on that I would categorize as timing. And then, as we pointed out, we had some inefficiencies in the network.
So without splitting hairs in terms of where those dollars are, we think they're all opportunities for us to right-size the
network. If you look at what would you have expected if you were running optimally and you had things timed up a
little bit better, it probably had a negative impact in the quarter of about one to two points on our operating ratio, and
that's the way I would look at it.
<Q - William Jeffrey Greene>: Okay, and then your point about second quarter is it will still take some time for the
network to get to the operating efficiencies that you want. So maybe it will be less than the first quarter impact, but still
meaningful. Is that what you were trying to communicate?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Cameron, why don't you walk us through a little bit about the activities that are underway to get
these things right-sized and get your service back there?
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: We still have work to do, but we think we can eventually right-size the network in the
second quarter. And as Rob mentioned, we do think there will be some inefficiencies throughout the quarter. But the
right-sizing of our locomotive fleet, weekly we review opportunities to store additional locomotives. And several times
a month, we're also right-sizing our hiring plans as we look out for the remainder of the year.
<Q - William Jeffrey Greene>: Okay. Rob, let me ask you one last question too then here. Just on share buybacks,
how opportunistic can you be, or is the first quarter run rate what we should expect? If the shares are down a fair
amount, can you ramp this up, or do you feel like no, we'd rather have it be a consistent buyback each quarter?

Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Good morning, everyone. Lance, in context, your first quarter actually wasn't that
bad. Earnings were up 9%, even with all the challenges that you had. And yet it sounds like the tone from everyone on
the call here is that we're not too happy with it. Obviously, we could have done better. And it did miss Wall Street
expectations here. And I think over the long run, you guys have been better at staying at expectations relative to some
of the other stocks in the space, but I think investors have definitely rewarded your company for that.
But as I hear it from some of the questions here and the answers, it sounds like we still have some cost challenges.
We're catching up for the new volume reality. We don't know where energy and coal markets are ultimately going to
shape out or shake out. So as your comps get more difficult on earnings growth this year, consensus definitely ramps up
a lot in 2015. Is it getting more challenging to see double-digit growth this year? I know you don't want to explicitly
guide, but can you help folks on this call understand where this year could shake out?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure, Brandon. And you're exactly right, we're not going to speak specifically about what to
expect out of the year from a percentage perspective. So I think you've got the tone pretty well right. When I look at the
first quarter, I'm proud of the hard work that the team did in terms of trying to get the costs adjusted to the volume
reality. I'm disappointed that we couldn't have done better because we here at the table see the opportunity of what the
franchise really has the ability to deliver. Having said that, I am confident as I look forward that our operating team and
all the teams are focused on doing the right thing. As we look forward, we're adjusting to current volumes at the same
time as we're trying to determine what does peak season look like and what does the growth rate look like from here.
I would tell you, there's no change in my confidence both this year and over the long run of being able to generate out
of this wonderful business, this beautiful franchise, the kind of financial performance and return generation that you've
seen historically. We've said before it gets more difficult. From a 65% or 64% or 63% operating ratio, margin
improvement gets more difficult. But we remain absolutely confident that it's there. We'll realize it and continue to
realize it.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Could you maybe talk a little bit more explicitly about some of the drivers of
margin improvement this year, outside of the benefit from the fuel surcharge? Because it does sound like you have
quite a bit of compensation benefit headwind just given the wage increases. And obviously, if volumes could come in
flat or maybe even negative for the year just given some of the uncertainty, what's the ability to drive leverage in the
business then?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So, Brandon, I think Rob and the team have outlined a fair portion of that already this morning,
which is as we look forward, Eric said he's in an environment where pricing, core pricing gains looks good. Cam and
the team are working on right-sizing the business and generating efficiencies through the UP Way and by taking
variability out of the network. And then we're looking for all other opportunities to generate margin improvement. Rob,
is there anything else you want to add?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Brandon, I would just remind you that it's the same levers that have got us from where we
were many years ago to where we are today. While volume is our friend, we don't use it as an excuse. You saw us
perform well in years when volume did not play in our benefit. We know we've got some challenges this year with

volumes. We've got challenges with mix, as I called out. But we're going to continue to be relentlessly focused on cost
control and cost management, as Lance and Cam have outlined.
And as Eric talked about, pricing is another key driver here. We're going to improve the value proposition in the
marketplace, and pricing will continue to be a strong driver of that. So to get to our longer-term guidance of a 60% plus
or minus operating ratio by full-year 2019 is going to take those same efforts and same focus from the organization that
we're going to continue to focus on.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Great, thanks, good morning. I guess I just want to maybe try to understand a little bit
better about maybe what the outlook was internally as you guys thought about 2015, and in particular the volume
opportunity. I know you were looking for I think positive volumes for the full year, and that looks like that's a little bit
in question. We've had tough comps understood coming up in the next several quarters. So as you're trying to adjust to
the volume environment, I guess I'm just trying to make sure I understand maybe where your heads were at coming into
this year versus where we are now. It seems like maybe a little bit bigger of a change than I was anticipating, so I just
want to make sure I understand that.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: We don't specifically address what our budgets or forecasts were coming into the year. What I
will say is the big change is actual growth and then actual decline, and the biggest change there was coal, which was
somewhat surprising in terms of how weak it turned out quickly. Of course, we had the difficulty with the West Coast
ports and the labor dispute, but we had pretty good visibility to that. Looking forward, Eric, why don't you talk to us
about what your markets look like as you look into the future?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I think what Lance said is accurate. The big swing factor is coal. Certainly the first quarter we
talked about the international intermodal West Coast port labor dispute that we think will normalize throughout the
year, but the big swing factor is coal. As you know, Chris, if you go back really probably four months, oil price outlook
for the year was still up in the $90s. It's now in the $50s. So of course, that had a swing factor that's impacting broad
swaths of the market also.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Okay, that's helpful, and I guess that generally makes sense. Maybe sticking on that coal
question and maybe one for you, Eric, in terms of the mid-single-digit outlook for the second quarter that you were
thinking about, Colorado-Utah obviously underperformed pretty meaningfully relative to PRB [Powder River Basin] in
the first quarter. Is that inherent in the second quarter outlook? Will you expect maybe PRB to soften a bit on the
comps and then you still have weakness in Colorado-Utah? I'm just trying to get a rough sense of maybe how you think
about coal mix in 2Q.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: The mid-single digits assumes a continued profile with Colorado-Utah, particularly because we
are not expecting export markets to pick up significantly this year.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: And so PRB roughly similar performance that we've seen?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Thereabouts, driven again, as we said, by weather and natural gas pricing.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Okay, thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.

The next question is coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks, good morning. So, Rob, I wanted to ask you about some of the yield drivers in
terms of how much of a negative do you think mix could be in the second quarter?
And then on the pricing, the 50 basis points from the legacy pricing maybe is a little lower than I would have expected.
I'm wondering if that's a timing issue and that ramps, or is this the volumes are down, so it just limits the impact of the
legacy repricing and it's going to stay about 50 basis points the rest of the year?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yes, Scott, let me address the mix comment. As you know, we don't give specific guidance
around mix because there's a lot of – again, the beauty of our franchise is we have a lot of diverse business
opportunities. And as a result, it's not uncommon to have a fair amount of mix. But we are highlighting that given the
change anticipated in both the coal and the fracking environment and continued strength in our intermodal that there
likely versus the first quarter will likely be a bit of a mix headwind as the rest of the year plays out. How precise that
will be, we'll have to see. I'm not going to give precise guidance around that.
In terms of your pricing question on the legacy contributor, as I've always said, you can't straight-line. Don't take what
we repriced in past years on legacy and assume that each contract is the same. They're all different. So that's what those
contracts gapped to market and that is what we took them up to. But to your point broadly, not just on legacy but I'd say
broadly, I'd say that the way we look conservatively at calculating our price, as you know, the fact that volume was
down in some key markets did have a negative impact on the way we contribute price, and I view that as actually a
positive. So as the volumes recover, we would expect to enjoy the improved returns on those business volumes that
we've been able to reprice.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. And the contracts that you repriced for 2016, is that showing up in this number already,
or were they just priced but the actual impact doesn't show up until next year?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: It's also in that number.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. And last thing, just going back to the question about the buybacks, so was your point
about the extra dividend payment in the quarter, in your mind, does that have an impact on how much you bought back
in the first quarter, and then as you go to a more normalized dividend just once a quarter, there's more left for the
buyback, or they're independent?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: They're independent. I was just calling it out so that folks understood that there were two
dividend payments in the quarter. But I would not make any correlation to that and the share buyback pace.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: All right. Thank you, guys.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Thanks, Scott.

Next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Great, good morning. Just to follow up on some of the volume commentary, maybe,
Eric, just talk a little bit on chemicals, given that that's usually a bit of a precursor for the economy. We've seen them
trend a little weak lately. And I know longer term, you're looking at a lot of plants opening up in the Gulf region. But
maybe more in near term this year, is that a precursor for the industrial side of the economy? Maybe give a little bit of
your insight there.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Ken, as you know, our chemicals business net of crude-by-rail actually was pretty good in the
first quarter. We were up one, two percentage points (sic) [5%] in the first quarter net of crude-by-rail. So we think that
is a good precursor to the economy. The plastics business really ties pretty closely to construction and automotive and
all of those, and even the consumer side, the retail side of the house, and our plastics business was up in the first quarter

as we mentioned. So we think that all of those trends indicate the strength in the North American economy.
As Rob said earlier, we had some headwinds in coal, some headwinds with shale stuff. But if you net that out, we feel
pretty good about some of the underlying strength of the economy.
<Q - Kenneth Scott Hoexter>: Thanks for that insight. And then just to follow up, Lance, maybe there's been a lot of
discussion out east and in Canada about industry consolidation. Can you address Union Pacific? I know we did this a
couple quarters ago, but perhaps revisit your thoughts on how the markets changed over time and your thoughts given
some of the activity or discussions at least on the eastern and Canadian half of the country, not country but Canada?

Our next question is from John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. You had mentioned that grain
exports in some cases were still pretty strong but that export coal was getting hit, and that was due to the very strong
dollar. Could you give us maybe more a complete picture of the impact of the strong dollar on the exports across more
than just grain and coal?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Sure. The grain exports really were driven by milo and soybeans. We had a great soybean crop,
and China is really pulling those into China. And spreads between Gulf Coast/West Coast have narrowed in terms of
ship spread, so that really is driving milo and beans from the central part of the U.S. into China, which was a positive
for us.
We still are seeing headwinds from the strong dollar in exports across probably a pretty good chunk of the economy. So
when you think about steel, steel is being impacted both with imports, particularly from Asia coming into the country,
and domestic steel producers are struggling. It's also being impacted in terms of machinery exports, construction and
farm machinery exports. Those are headwinds just because of the strong dollar. On the wheat side, we are seeing some
difficulty in the U.S. wheat crop competing in export markets partially due to the strong dollar.
So the strong dollar is, as you would expect, impacting exports on a pretty wide swath of the economy beyond just coal,
and it's helping imports. So you should see our intermodal import business and other import business strengthen as you
go throughout the year. But the strong dollar is having an impact.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thanks for that, and then maybe a question on the ever-changing energy markets. Do you have
a sense for where oil prices would have to go in order to recharge the activity levels in the shales? And then related to
that, how high would natural gas prices have to go in order for the utilities to switch from natural gas back to coal?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: If I could predict energy markets, I would probably be sitting in a different spot than today
because – there's a lot of conventional wisdom out there. I think the conventional wisdom was that you needed to be in
the $70s for the U.S. shale markets to be strong. I think even if you look today with the oil in the $50s, there are some
shales that still going pretty strong. The Permian shale is still doing relatively well. The Eagle Ford shale is not, so I
think there's a spread there. Again, conventional wisdom on natural gas is somewhere in the $3.00, $3.25, $3.50.
There's probably a crossover range. But again, that depends on a lot of different things by utility and by region of the
country.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: John, just a little more detail. Clearly, we would like to see oil prices back up in the $75-plus
range. Clearly that would be better for us.

Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Thanks, good morning. Following up on your earlier comments on the underlying strength
in base chemicals and plastics, can you remind us how much of your business is tied to the housing and residential
construction markets? Yesterday we saw existing home sales numbers that surprised to the upside and new home starts
are expected to be pretty solid for the year. So I just wanted to get a view, an all-inclusive perspective of the
commodities that you move that are tied to these markets and what that represents as a percentage of volume or
revenues.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I think historically we've said between 5% and 10%, and we still think that's a good estimate.
Housing starts were down in February and March. I think the housing start number comes out today or tomorrow. I
think there's some expectation it's going to be up because weather impacted the number being down the last couple of
months. And the existing home sales number was very strong, as you say. So again, we tend to factor that into our
optimism about the underlying strength of the economy.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And as a follow-up question, given that your main competitor
has seen some modest improvement in velocity, albeit off of some easy comps, do you think that the risk of losing
some of the traffic that you gained last year as a result of their issues is now somewhat heightened? It seems like there's
plenty of traffic to go around at the West Coast ports. But BN yesterday actually made some comments that it has
regained some lost Ag business. So I just wanted to get your perspective there.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Allison, this is Lance. The BNSF has been showing some improvement in their service product.
We would anticipate that would happen. They're a very good, vibrant competitor. And Eric had said historically that
some of the business that we had shipped last year, certainly in Ag, maybe to a lesser extent in some other
commodities, was naturally a better fit for their franchise, their network, and would likely go back. And I think you see
that in the Ag line in terms of reported volumes. Eric, do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: No.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay, excellent. Thank you for the time.

Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Hi, thanks. I have a couple of questions, the first one on intermodal. Can you give us a sense of how
much your intermodal volumes might have been impacted by the West Coast port congestion and how long you think it
might take that congestion to unwind and filter into the Q2 numbers?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So our intermodal, international intermodal volume was down low teens in the first quarter. And
again, we expect that as you catch up throughout the year that that will normalize and most of that will catch up. We do
not expect to see any permanent deterioration of our West Coast international intermodal business.

<Q - Tom Kim>: Okay. Would it be possible to give us a sense of how much your fuel surcharge might have impacted
ARPUs for that commodity group? I know, Rob, you had mentioned that it impacted it in the first quarter a little bit
more than the rest of the book of business.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: We don't break out by commodity, Tom, the specific surcharge contributor to each
individual commodity. But there are timing differences by different contracts, and we have some 60-plus different
mechanisms. So there can be and there are timing differences actually on the intermodal line versus some of the other
lines.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Okay. And just, Rob, as a follow-on, you had commented that you anticipate some potential mix
shifts ahead, which could impact your revenues. Can you talk about how the mix shift is going to affect your RTMs
versus carloads? Because I noticed that the RTMs were down about 4% in the first quarter and carloads were down
about 2%. I would think that this is going to impact your overall productivity, costs, and then ultimately margins. So
I'm just wondering if you could help us frame how we should think about the impact of efficiencies that might be
affected by RTMs potentially being weaker than carloads.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I'm not going to break it out as finitely as you're asking, Tom. But I would just say that mix
is something we deal with. And so from a cost standpoint, that just presents challenges and opportunities, depending on
what the volume actually is, for the operating team. And Cam is all over improving the cost structure.
In terms of the top line, the pricing line or the impact on revenue, again, it will depend upon which markets actually are
stronger than others. But we do anticipate, as I called out, that there will be a headwind for the balance of the year. And
the simple explanation for why there is a headwind on the revenue line is we think there's going to be stronger growth.
And a lot of it's the recovery with that intermodal business we just talked about, and softness in coal and the frac
markets or the negative drivers, if you will, on that mix headwind that we anticipate. So we're calling that out
directionally as a challenge. But we're not using that as an excuse not to continue to run as efficient an operation on the
cost side as we possibly can.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Thanks, Rob.

Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thank you and, gentlemen, thank you for the time as always. When you look at your core
pricing of 3.5%, it's in line with what I expected. But is it occurring in certain areas – in terms of are you getting more
pricing now out of that truck competitive business than you were a year ago? Is that what's driving the improvement?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We're getting good market-based pricing across our book of business. As we've said before, a
certain percent of our book of business is in fixed or multiyear longer-term contracts that you can't touch them. We've
talked about that before. But for the things that we are able to reprice, the demand is strong. The impacts in terms of the
challenges that the trucking industry is having are in our favor. And we see strong opportunities to price our value
across our book of business.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Does it get any easier to price the intermodal product once the port clears up, or did that not
really have much of an impact on your pricing?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Pricing is always difficult, no matter when you do it. I would guess most of the international
intermodal business would not be in spot pricing type of agreements.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. And to piggyback on Allison's question as a follow-up, you obviously benefited from BN
last year in several different categories, and you locked up some of that business in some longer-term contracts. When
do those contracts start expiring?

Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W Baird. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Good morning, guys. I know a lot has been asked. Eric, I did want to follow up on domestic
intermodal, pricing in particular. Given the decline in crude. I know there are certain lanes now where you can find
intermodal pricing all-in that is competitive to truck. You guys are more insulated to that with the longer length of haul.
But let's assume that crude does stabilize here around $50 – $55 a barrel. As you look into 2016, do you see a situation
where intermodal rate growth does have to lag truckload rate growth going forward at current levels of crude because
of the lower energy price, and some of that disparity, that historical disparity between truck and intermodal might have
narrowed over the past several years? Can you provide some perspective there?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I guess I'm not quite understanding the foundation of your question. I think actually truck
pricing is increasing. If you look at most of the truck pricing indexes, because of the challenges that the truck industry
is having, they're getting high single-digit type price increases. So I think that suggests that instead of the gap
narrowing, it might even be expanding or at a minimum staying the same.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Okay, yes, truck pricing is increasing. I was asking as we go into 2016, should we expect
domestic intermodal pricing growth to mimic truckload, or does it need to lag what the rate of truckload rate growth is
to make sure that there is enough of an all-in price delta between truck and intermodal?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We think we have a value proposition and we're going to continue to price that strongly.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Thanks, Ben.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much and congratulations in a very tough quarter. I want to go a
different direction. We're hearing a lot about the drought in California, the lower water tables, the reduction in water
use. And also during the quarter we heard – I think we focus with the port issues on the inbound movement of products,
but we also heard there was a fair amount of Ag and produce-related products that could not get off the West Coast.
Could you discuss how that affected you in the quarter and how you're thinking about this drought in California in
terms of the growth of your western business?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So the drought in California, as you know, the authorities right now in California are trying to
insulate the Ag industry and really are putting the onus for water conservation on residential customers. Politically,
how long that could sustain with the Ag industry being insulated is anybody's guess. I do think that if you look at the
Ag industry in California and you profile who uses the most water to the least water, I think our customer base will
probably be in the using the least water category. So we feel pretty good that the drought will not have near-term
material impacts on our food and refrigerated business. We feel pretty good about that, short of some Armageddon-type

scenario.
In terms of your export question, yes, so Ag products, particularly refrigerated products, do go export off West Coast
ports, and they were similarly impacted just like the imports were impacted. So just like things couldn't get on, things
couldn't get off, and they similarly had impacts fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Okay, thank you. And just to follow up, last year we heard about truckers moving water
into California on an as-needed basis. Maybe I'm going off the deep end here, but is that a potential revenue source for
you over the long run?

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Asset Management. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Matt Troy>: I had a question. As you talk to your utility customers, you mentioned natural gas switching
impacting some of the Colorado-Utah basin business. I'm just curious. With the echoes of 2012 still lingering, how
should we think about the potential for additional or incremental vulnerability in your coal business? What's your sense
in speaking with coal customers that as nat gas approaches $2.50 now and potentially lower, how much has switched
and how much remaining could switch? What's the vulnerability there?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I think the things that can switch probably have switched. And as natural gas goes lower, there
might be some incremental impact. You would expect there would be, but I think we've seen most of it.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: If I could comment on that, Matt, you may recall. The last time natural gas prices got to
historically low levels, we really in our territory didn't see material switching until it got sub-$2.00, so that doesn't
necessarily predict the future. But what we are seeing, though, and I think the bigger impact today, rather than our
utility base switching from one source to another, they're able to buy electricity off the grid that is being produced by
somebody else, perhaps from gas. So we're seeing that impact as opposed to a pure switch, turning off the coal plant
and turning on the gas plant in our territory.
<Q - Matt Troy>: All right, thank you. And my follow-up would be, you mentioned PTC. I'm just curious there. I
think when it was initially enacted, no one believed that it would be completed by 2015 of any of the various
stakeholder groups, but here we are knocking on that deadline. I'm curious in terms of your conversations with
Washington. What is it that the industry is proposing as the path forward in terms of either timeframe or our
incremental expansion to the window? And an off-the-wall question here, what if Washington in all its rational thought
and reason decides to hold you to the letter of the law? What would be the implications if the industry does not make
the deadline and they are not flexible? Thanks.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So, Matt, this is Lance. I'll start with the path forward. Cameron had mentioned we believe that
virtually everyone involved understands that there has to be an extension because the industry is not going to make the
date. That extension is going to have to come through Congress. There are a number of different vehicles that could
make that happen, and we're monitoring all of those potentials and giving feedback and input into our thoughts to help
navigate that process.
From the perspective of having an extension occur, I remain confident that will happen. It just reflects the reality of the
situation. From the perspective of what if we don't get an extension, there are penalties outlined in the current
regulation, current law, and we've been discussing what our actions would be should an extension not occur. That
would be a horrible outcome for the industry, and I don't believe that's the way it's going to go. But we will be prepared
for that very, very remote possibility as the year comes to a close.

Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John Barnes>: Thank you, guys. First on the port situation, can you talk a little bit about – you've been through
this a couple of times before. Can you talk a little bit about your view of a return of market share to the West Coast
ports, or do you think some of what's swung to the East Coast and other ports is more permanent in nature?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: I'll start and then I'm going to turn it over to Eric. We've said for quite some time that there
maybe is a low single-digit number of share transfer from West Coast to East Coast when the Panama Canal opens up.
The reality from our perspective is the most efficient vessels and the ones that are being commissioned as we speak:
A), won't go through the modified Panama Canal; and B), there needs to be some significant work to occur on the East
Coast ports in some circumstances to handle those. Having said that, there's also a natural cost/value proposition that
makes those imports want to come into the West Coast. Eric, do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: No, I think that about covers it.
<Q - John Barnes>: So you still view it as a couple of percentage points of market share?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Currently the East Coast has about 31%. Historically we've said that could go to 33% with the
Panama Canal opening. But as Lance said, the largest ships that are being built today really won't even be able to go
through the expanded Panama Canal. So there is a value proposition to the West Coast. If you look at ship spread in
terms of the cost West Coast versus East Coast, and if you look at the costs of overland bridge, rail, transportation,
there's a natural economic driver to the West Coast.
<Q - John Barnes>: Okay. And then my other one is, I know you've got an uncertain volume environment right now. I
get where the pressure points are. But if 2014 taught us anything is you can get caught on the other side in a more
robust growth environment just as easily. How do you go about balancing where to pull in right now, where to pull the
reins in, especially given what you experienced in 2014 where you really ran out of certain resources? How do you
make sure that you don't pull back so much trying to balance in this environment that should growth reaccelerate that
you're not back in a similar situation as you were in 2014?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Cameron, can you handle that?
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: In 2014, our locomotive surge fleet strategy served us very, very well. When business came
on, we were able to match that business. So as we look into this year, redeveloping that surge fleet and being agile, as
we mentioned, is a very critical asset and a very critical initiative for us. We take Eric's forecast on where he predicts
business will be and then we make our moves appropriately.
<Q - John Barnes>: Okay, thanks for your time. I appreciate it.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure thing, John.

Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much and good morning. With respect to the West Coast ports, I was just
wondering if you could comment on the challenges associated with big ships and the new shipping alliances, which
may remain once the backlog is cleared, and what you're doing internally and with your supply chain partners to cope.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I'll start and then Cam can finish. So you're right, there is going to be a challenge. And basically
the challenge is because the new alliances as they bring their business together may bring it all to one terminal that then

overwhelms the capacity of that individual terminal on the port vis-à-vis it being spread out between multiple terminals.
So that is a challenge the alliances are working through. That's a challenge the terminals are working through. That was
a challenge that was starting to be seen before even the port slowdown.
We from outside are working with our customers developing planning practices and protocols and capacity
management protocols that we're sharing with them to basically say, here's the capacity within this window that we can
do. And to the extent that there's a larger than that flood, because of alliance activity through a terminal, what do you
need to do to correct that. So we did see it in the past. We will see it in the future. We're working with them to spread
that out.
<A - Cameron A. Scott>: Our most important asset in the LA Basin to stay up against the intermodal business is
locomotives. And we have spent over the last year developing a model that stays up against Eric's forecast of business
from week to week to week, and it's been very successful. Our originating on-time departures out of the LA Basin are
in the mid-90%, and we feel confident we can keep it there.

Our next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Good morning and thank you. My first question relates to the impact of mix on operating ratio.
Can you please clarify for us whether you expect mix to be a headwind or a tailwind? If it's a headwind, is it mostly
because of declines in coal and frac rather than international intermodal coming back? Thank you.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Cleo, the headwind that we would anticipate from the mix going forward is a result of, we
expect, strong intermodal and softer coal and fracking-related activities, as you're calling out. But as always, we're
going to continue to focus on being as efficient as we can on the cost side. And as Eric has been talking all morning,
we're going to continue to price to the value proposition. So we're not throwing the towel in, in terms of the margins,
but we know we're going to face the headwind of those mix changes.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you. And my second question relates to coal. Can you please discuss to what extent share
shifts may have affected your volumes in a flat western coal market in the first quarter? And your outlook for
Colorado-Utah, any detail you want to share on the market for that coal and whether your long-term export outlook has
changed. Thank you.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: There were no material contractual share shifts that we saw.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: What about Colorado-Utah, Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: There were no material share shifts.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Okay, because we have seen BN being up mid to high single digits and your volumes down. So I
was wondering whether those are related in any way. Are they just totally separate tracks, so to speak?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We can't speak to their business, naturally. We described the dynamics we saw in our business.
It would not surprise me if they had a much greater opportunity for inventory replenishment for their customers in the
first quarter than we had, simply because we had more deliveries last year. So it would not surprise me if they had an
opportunity for greater inventory replenishment.

Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Thank you and good morning. So I had just one quick one on frac sands. You say you're
adjusting to the current outlook down mid-teens in the second quarter. But as opposed to something like coal where you
have natural gas in inventories, as you mentioned, as a little bit of leading indicator, with sand it's tougher as the
amount of sand per well continues to go up and different basins move ahead at different rates. So do you have any
sense of visibility into the second half of the year, either in what you're seeing in actual orders or talking to your
customers directly and what their completion programs might look like at this point? Thanks.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but it would basically be similar to what we said
before.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Brian, are you asking for a crystal ball on frac sand in the second half of the year?
<Q - Brian P. Ossenbeck>: Yes, please. I was just asking if you have, how you think about the second half of the year
with frac sands that comes from your...

Our next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. Noting the strength of autos in the period, would you please comment on how
your expectations for trade with Mexico compare with maybe somewhat tempered overall growth rates, perhaps auto,
grain, and otherwise?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: So, Eric, let me jump in. Just on the very long term, and Rob mentioned this early on in a
comment about our franchise, because we do serve all six rail gateways to Mexico and because of Mexico's opening up
of some of their core industries as well as the significant foreign direct investment, from the very long-term perspective
we feel very, very good about our business and growth with Mexico. Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I'd have nothing to add more with that. Mexico continues being an upside. For us, we've got a
great franchise and we're optimistic about the outlook.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: If Mexico does grow outsized compared to the business in the U.S., would this be OR
accretive?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Keith, not necessarily. That question actually has been in fact what we've experienced
probably about the last decade. Our volumes in and out of Mexico have grown at a slightly faster pace than the overall
enterprise volumes, and I wouldn't try to draw any conclusion in terms of margin differential between those moves.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Is it longer haul though?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: It can be. But again, I would say in the overall scheme of things, it's no different than our
overall enterprise mix.
