Leo P. Denault
Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are reporting final results for 2016, a pivotal year for our
company. The year in which our objectives were ambitious and our execution was on the mark. We delivered on our
commitment to grow our core business, and our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings reflected over 40% growth
year-over-year.
These financial results are the outcome of exceptional performance that have positioned us to achieve our financial
outlooks in the coming years and to deliver steady predictable growth in earnings as well as our dividend.
We raised our dividend for the second consecutive year, a trend we expect to continue, subject is always to board
approval. And finally, with the Indian Point announcement last month, we completed our plan to exit the merchant
power business and transition to a pure-play utility.
Our results today are the outcome of the disciplined execution of our strategy for the past few years, a strategy intended
to fundamentally reposition our company on a steady predictable earnings trajectory. And today, we are initiating
guidance for 2017. We were also affirming our three-year Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings outlook, targeting a
5% to 7% growth rate, acknowledging that some years may be above or below that range.
This morning, I'll provide more detail about our longer-term initiatives and the progress we made toward them in 2016,
as well as our plans for the future.
As I mentioned at the outset, 2016 marked a critical milestone in our exit from EWC and the risk associated with the
merchant power business. We finalized the plants to sell or shutdown all remaining nuclear plants in the EWC portfolio
through a deliberate planned and orderly process to cease all merchant nuclear operations by 2021, effectively exiting
the merchant space.
We began this process with the shutdown of Vermont Yankee at the end of 2014, followed by the sale of EWC's Rhode
Island CCGT in 2015. 2016, we sold EWC's interest in the wind assets in Iowa and Texas. The proposed sale of
FitzPatrick to Exelon is on track to close in 2017.
In 2018, we expect to close Palisades followed by Pilgrim in 2019. And finally in 2020 and 2021, we will close Indian
Point Units 2 and 3. This orderly wind down of EWC will provide a sufficient time to look for ways to integrate
employees into other areas of the business, and right size our corporate organizations.
With a sustained low wholesale energy price environment and increased operating cost, exiting our merchant power
business is a sound strategic decision. Looking back at some of our more significant announcements this year, we
reached an agreement in August with the State of New York and Exelon for the sale of FitzPatrick. In January, the
NRC approved the transfer to Entergy of the decommissioning trusts for both FitzPatrick and Indian Point Unit 3, and
we remain on track to close the transaction in the first half of this year.
For Palisades, we've reached an agreement in December with CMS Energy on early termination of the long-term
purchase power agreement subject to approval from the Michigan PSC. We plan to shutdown that plant in 2018. And as
you are aware, last month, we announced the plan to shutdown of the two operating units in Indian Point in 2020 and
2021. The shutdown as part of a settlement, under which New York will drop legal challenges, and support the renewal
of the NRC operating licenses for Indian Point.
The plant will run for several more years, allowing time for the New York ISO to replace this key generating resource,
which currently provides roughly 25% of the electricity for New York City, and the Hudson Valley. We appreciate the
commitment to safety and operational excellence of the nearly 1,000 employees at Indian Point. They have enabled the
site to run at greater than 90% capacity factors under Entergy's ownership, compared to roughly 60% under its previous
owners.
The NRC has placed both units and its top regulatory column for safety. Our plans to mitigate the risk of our merchant
business extend beyond operational risk. We reached an agreement this past November to transfer Vermont Yankee's
decommissioning liability and trust funds to NorthStar, condition on regulatory approval by the NRC and the Vermont

Public Service Board. This transaction will eliminate the residual risk from decommissioning and is targeted to close in
December of 2018. There are many advantages to this kind of transaction, and we view this as a model to pursue for
future risk reduction, as we move forward with the shutdown of the remaining nuclear plants.
Finally, I would note that the decision to close our merchant nuclear plants was a difficult one. We cannot overlook the
impact these shutdowns will have on the lives of our employees and the communities they serve. And despite these
challenging circumstances, our employees remain dedicated to the safe operation of these plants through shutdown.
And I thank them for their ongoing hard work and professionalism.
Our decisions were driven by adverse economics and are not a reflection in any way of the quality of our workforce.
The company remains committed to supporting them as they manage this difficult transition. With the orderly wind
down of our merchant business underway, I will now talk about our strategies to grow the utility for the benefit of our
customers.
Beginning with our generation fleet, we are delivering on our promise of portfolio transformation as part of our
ongoing Environment 2020 commitment. Recall that in 2011, we made a voluntary pledge that by 2020, we will
maintain our carbon dioxide emissions at 20% below year 2000 levels. We're meeting this goal in part, by replacing
older less-efficient legacy units with a cleaner, more efficient portfolio.
Additionally, we'd begun to add renewables to our portfolio, along with a greater emphasis on energy efficiency
programs, as well as completed upgrades to our nuclear capacity. This transformation began about a decade ago, and
today, we deactivated roughly 5,100 megawatts of older generation since 2005.
Currently, over 8,000 megawatts of our legacy generation is over 40-years-old. We've added nearly 6,000 megawatts of
generation through acquisitions, including our most recent acquisition of Union Power Station, which received final
approval in 2016.
We're now transitioning from acquisitions to building new plants, beginning with Ninemile 6 in late 2014. After
receiving approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission in November, we're moving forward with the
construction of the St. Charles CCGT expected to come online in 2019.
We also have applications pending for the construction of the Lake Charles CCGT in Louisiana, and the Montgomery
County Power Station in Texas, as well as New Orleans Power Station. All combined, this will represent nearly 4,000
megawatts of new generation to replace older, less-efficient plants.
These plants will improve the reliability of our system, increase our environmental efficiency and reduce costs for our
customers by using less fuel, in improving our average fleet efficiency by roughly 800 BTUs per kilowatt hour.
Additionally, new units will have lower maintenance cost and produce upto 40% fewer carbon emissions. These critical
attributes provide significant benefits to our customers and support our Environment 2020 commitments.
Nuclear generation also continues to be a key component of our cleaner generation portfolio. It's an important source of
clean, low-cost, reliable-based load power. These plants provide fuel diversity and reduce fuel price volatility for our
customers. Prudently investing to preserve these valuable resources for our stakeholders is an important part of our
utility strategy.
Our transmission system is critical to deliver to the delivery of this newer cleaner generation. And, in 2016, we
completed projects like upgrading the 230 kV lines from the Ninemile 6 generating facilities for Entergy Louisiana and
Entergy New Orleans. Transmission is also needed to support economic development by serving new customers.
In 2016, we invested in projects like substations to serve new industrial customers, particularly in Arkansas and
Louisiana. And we're on schedule to deliver the Lake Charles Transmission Project, a $160 million investment
supporting industrial growth in the region by June of 2018.
Finally, our transmission grid is critical for system reliability and efficiency. In 2016, Entergy Texas completed three
major projects to comply with NERC Reliability Standards and reduce congestion in its service territory. We added

three new 230 kV lines as well as a new 230 kV substation which will not only enhance reliability and efficiency, but
also reduce cost to customers.
And there are four large transmission projects underway in Entergy Mississippi, which will increase the reliability of
the electric systems in Vicksburg [indiscernible] (10:50) Madison areas and provide opportunities for those regions to
grow and develop.
We continue to work with MISO on future transmission projects. We received final approval in early December from
the MISO board for MTEP 2016. MISO approved all 48 of our projects, which were remaining for final consideration
totaling roughly $480 million of transmission investment to serve our customers over the next few years.
Beyond these traditional generation and transmission investments, we're also looking at the future by modernizing our
grid to incorporate technologies to improve efficiency and reliability. In 2016, we started to lay the foundation for our
integrated energy network. We've begun the process for our advanced meter infrastructure, a gateway technology that
will allow us to be more responsive to emerging issues, reduce outage restoration times and improve system reliability.
This technology will also provide timely information to our customers, so they can better understand and control their
usage. We've now made filings with our regulators in four jurisdictions for approval to implement advanced metering
and we expect to file in Texas, our final jurisdiction in 2017.
We anticipate beginning meter deployment in 2019. Investment in this technology along with other grid technologies
such as meter data management, outage and distribution management, and communication network infrastructure, are a
key focus for us in 2017 and for several years beyond.
To that end, we've created a dedicated team to provide constant focus on evaluating and integrating new technologies
into our operating model. These include distributed generation, utility and community-scale solar, microgrids, and
battery storage. In 2016, we completed and initiated a number of projects to explore the use of some of these evolving
technologies.
Our success with all of the Utility initiatives, I've just mentioned has been facilitated by the work we've done with our
regulators to implement progressive regulatory mechanisms. We've come a long way in the past two years. We now
have three jurisdictions utilizing formula rate plans with Entergy Mississippi utilizing forward-looking features and
Entergy Arkansas having adopted a full forward test year.
In December, the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved our first forward test year FRP filing with new rates
in effect last month. In Texas, we are now utilizing two riders for a more timely recovery of distribution and
transmission investments. We have reached a settlement agreement in our most recent transmission cost recovery factor
filing and are awaiting final approval from the Commission. Where available, aggressive regulatory frameworks will
facilitate investments that enhance the efficiency and reliability of our system to benefit our customers, provide access
to capital at a reasonable cost to our customers and facilitate infrastructure investment that supports economic
development and create jobs in our regions. We will continue to work with our regulators and others to improve
existing constructs to ensure that we have the financial flexibility to execute on capital investments in response to our
customers' needs.
Our objective in concert with our regulators and other key stakeholders is to assure the access, affordability, reliability
and sustainability of the services we provide.
Many of you have heard about last week's tornadoes that struck multiple areas across Louisiana including a confirmed
F3 tornado that touched down in New Orleans East. Supporting our customers and communities in times of need is
central to our mission as a company. Our crews work tirelessly to restore power to thousands of our customers and
many of our employees volunteered their time to support recovery efforts.
The success of our Utility business is dependent on making sure that the communities we serve are thriving. As part of
our five-year initiative supporting job training opportunities, we've begun making grants to promote economic growth
and workforce development across our service territory, through economic development activities such as these,
Entergy has contributed to the creations of tens of thousands of new jobs in our region since 2005.

We're pleased to have been recognized through several awards in 2016 for our efforts in corporate stewardship and
community development. For example, our major upgrade to transmission service in New Orleans was named as a top
10 finalist for construction project of the year by Platts Global Energy Awards, recognizing innovation, leadership and
superior performance.
Site Selection magazine named us one of the top 10 utilities in economic development for our integral role in capital
investment and job creation in our service territory, and for the 15th consecutive year, we were named to the Dow
Jones Sustainability Index for performance in corporate citizenship and philanthropy, environmental performance,
biodiversity and climate strategy.
Before I wrap up my remarks this morning, I'd like to thank Bill Mohl, who is retiring at the end of this month, after
more than 35 years in the industry. Throughout his career at Entergy, Bill has led major initiatives, which have been
key to enabling us to achieve our objectives. His leadership, business perspective and high professional and personal
standards, are characteristics, which have made him an important member of our senior leadership team. More
importantly, we'll miss having his trusted counsel and friendship, as we accomplish the objectives, he has helped us
shape. We wish him all the best as he moves into this next chapter of his life.
As I said at the outset, this year was a pivotal year for our company, a year in which we fundamentally repositioned our
business on a path of steady predictable earnings by growing our core business with our Utility, Parent & Other
adjusted earnings increasing by more than 40% year-over-year, and completing our plan to exit the merchant power
business and transition to a pure-play utility. 2016 was an ambitious year and our results and achievements have made
us a stronger company, and have set us up for success in the years to come.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Drew.
Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. As Leo mentioned, 2016 was a pivotal year for Entergy. We continue to
execute on repositioning our company towards a steady predictable earnings and dividend growth trajectory. Today, I'll
discuss how our core Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS grew by over 40% in 2016, and I'll provide an overview of
our guidance for 2017.
I'll also provide our perspective on EWC going forward and potential tax reform.
Now, let's jump into 2016. I'll start with the key takeaways from fourth quarter consolidated results on slide 5. On the
left, Entergy's as reported loss of $9.88 included special items totaling $10.19 related to the decision to sell or close
each of EWC's nuclear plant. Majority of that was for previously disclosed impairment charges for Indian Point and
Power Sales.
On an operational view, our consolidated earnings were $0.31 per share in 2016, this compares to $1.58 a year ago.
Remember the 2015 results included significant income tax benefits, largely from the business combination of the two
Louisiana operating companies.
Turning to Utility, Parent & Other on slide 6, operational earnings per share decreased $1.07 quarter-over-quarter. 2015
income tax items, net of customer sharing were $1.57. Conversely weather was favorable in 2016. Adjusted EPS
normalized for tax items and weather improved year-over-year. This was partially due to rate actions to recover
investments that benefit customers and improve returns.
Specific drivers include Entergy Arkansas rate case, Union Power Station acquisition, Entergy Mississippi's formula
rate plan, and Entergy Texas transmission cost recovery rider. Results also included lower write-offs and reserves
related to regulatory proceedings. We recorded an $0.08 charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the Waterford 3
steam generator replacement project, which I noted last quarter is something we were monitoring. Billed retail sales on
a weather adjusted view increased 0.8%, driven by residential and commercial segments. Industrial sales were slightly
positive with expected refining outages offsetting continued growth from new and expansion customers. UPO earnings

also reflected higher non-fuel O&M from the aforementioned Union acquisition and nuclear.
Turning to EWC's fourth quarter results summarized on slide 7, operational loss of $0.04 in the most recent quarter was
lower than earnings of $0.16 a year ago. Net revenue from nuclear plants declined on lower price and volume.
FitzPatrick's generation volume was lower because of its ramp down, before its refueling outage. Decommissioning
expense was higher due partly to the establishment of decommissioning liabilities for Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick as
a result of our agreement with NYPA to transfer the decommissioning trust and liabilities to Entergy. On the positive
side, DOE litigation awards reduced EWC expenses approximately $0.10 in the quarter.
Slide 8, shows operating cash flow in the quarter was approximately $750 million. This quarter was lower than last
year due primarily to deferred fuel timing at the utility.
Now, I'll quickly go through the full year results summarized on slide 9. Consolidated operational earnings for 2016
were $7.11 per share, higher than the $6 reported in 2015. It is also above our guidance midpoint and better than our
expectations in November. Drivers to the change versus our expectations, included cost management at the utility,
which we noted as an opportunity last quarter, favorable weather and the DOE awards at EWC.
The year-over-year growth in operational EPS was driven [ph] by the (21:27) growth in core utility earnings. Both
years included income tax items, but the earnings benefit were $0.25 higher in 2016.
As shown on slide 10, Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS was $4.38 in 2016 slightly higher than the $4.35 guidance
midpoint. The approximately 40% increase compared to $3.08 in 2015 was due largely to higher net revenue from the
same rate actions mentioned in the quarterly drivers as well as industrial sales growth and lower non-fuel O&M.
Slide 11 summarizes EWC operational earnings which increased year-over-year to $2.01 per share in 2016 from $1.03
per share. Income tax items and reduced operating expenses from 2015 impairments were the main drivers. Expense
reductions associated with DOE litigation awards also contributed. 2016 results also reflected lower nuclear revenue
from lower average prices and capacity factors.
Full year 2016 operating cash flow, shown on slide 12, was just under $3 billion in 2016 around $300 million lower
than the prior year, again due largely to timing and the recovery of fuel and purchase power costs and lower EWC net
revenue.
Now, we've wrapped up 2016 results, let's look forward. I'll start with the framework for our EWC expectations shown
on slide 13. As Leo discussed, we now have plans on orderly wind down of the nuclear assets within EWC. But we
plan to have nuclear plant operations through 2021. As such, EWC does not meet GAAP criteria to account for the
business as a discontinued operation and we'll continue to report the results of the business consistent with our practice
for the past few years. We will classify severance and retention expenses as well as impairments, including capital, fuel
and refueling outage cost as special items, and we'll exclude them from operational earnings.
Our 2017 guidance and operational adjusted EBITDA outlook is reported using this framework. That said, we
acknowledge the changing risk profile of our business. Therefore, we're providing additional disclosures to help you
better understand the financial expectations as we exit the merchant power business.
First, we're providing a five-year operation EBITDA outlook as well as estimated special items. Taken together, these
disclosures should give you an approximation of the cash position of the business over this time period, excluding any
potential amount for top-off of nuclear decommissioning trust. Our current NDT top-off estimates are preliminary as
well as commercially sensitive, as we pursue additional VY-like transactions. They're included in our long-term
planning. In addition, we're pursuing other opportunities at EWC that could result in an incremental $100 million to
$200 million of cash over the next five years.
Second, we're providing you with a view on what remains after the end of merchant nuclear operations in 2021, namely
decommissioning expense and trust income for our decommissioned nuclear assets, a few small fossil assets and the
Cooper contract.

Turning to slide 14, we're initiating 2017 consolidated operational EPS guidance of $4.75 to $5.35 per share with a
midpoint of $5.05. You will notice that this range is narrower than previous years to reflect the change and risk profile
of EWC. As with last year, the possibility exists for significant tax items at EWC in 2017 as early as the second quarter.
If they do materialize, it could be valued roughly in the range of the EWC tax items recorded last year. Of course, there
is also a possibility for tax reform, which I'll discuss in a minute, which could affect the magnitude of those items. But,
despite the fact that resolution is only a few months away, there is still too much uncertainty to put this potential item
into our guidance at this time.
We're also using our Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.25 to $4.55 per share with a $4.40
midpoint, consistent with our outlook at EEI. Both our operational and adjusted guidance assume normal weather in the
current statutory income tax rate. Our $4.40 midpoint expectation in 2017 is up slightly year-over-year, rate actions and
sales growth are expected to offset higher non-fuel O&M and depreciation expenses.
Growth from rate actions is largely attributable to rates already in effect, while projected retail sales growth in 2017 is
about 1.4%, in line with our expectations at EEI. This increase includes approximately 3% industrial growth and less
than 0.25% increase for residential and commercial sales. Our industrial sales growth in 2017 continues to be driven by
new and expansion projects. Sales through existing petroleum refiners are expected to decline year-over-year due to
anticipated customer outages in the first half of 2017.
We are projecting non-fuel O&M to be about $2.6 billion, which represents a $0.45 per share increase over 2016, due
primarily to higher nuclear spending. Pension and OPEB costs are expected to be slightly higher than 2015, reflecting a
4.39% discount rate.
EWC's guidance midpoint is $0.65 per share. Our guidance assumptions isolate FitzPatrick, which we assume is sold in
the first half of this year. Average energy and capacity revenue is just over $50 per megawatt hour based on year-end
prices. Another driver is decommissioning expense, partially due to a full year of decommissioning expense through
Indian Point 3, as well as the liability adjustments for Indian Point and Palisades in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The projected year-over-year decline due to EWC income tax expense is due to the income tax item recorded in the
second quarter of 2016, and assumes no income tax benefits in 2017, although as I said there could be some.
Slide 15 summarizes our Utility, Parent & Other financial outlook, which is unchanged from EEI. Our outlook reflects
continuation of our strategy to grow the utility through investment that benefits customers and recovery through our
normal ratemaking mechanisms.
Our cash and credit metrics are summarized on slide 16. The year-end results are all within our targeted ranges. In
addition, S&P recently changed Entergy an operating company outlook to positive, while Moody's placed Entergy
under review for upgrade. These actions are the result of our efforts to change our business risk profile to focus on our
core utility business. As Leo said, we got a lot done in 2016, and we'll continue those efforts through 2017.
Now, I'd like to outline our current thinking on potential tax reform. Similar to what our peers have noted, given the
early stage of discussions, it is premature to draw any firm conclusions. However, overall our EWC and the Parent
could see an earnings impact, cash impacts there should be minimal. At the Utility, we believe that impacts on investors
are manageable, while customers could see a benefit. As many have already discussed, there are a variety of potential
outcomes, some positive and some negative depending on the result of reform effort.
We provided a framework on slide 17 for the near-term effect of the major components. To be clear, this high level
view is illustrative for certain potential components it does not take into account all the complexities of how the various
issues would work together. Under both high level proposals, the House blueprint and the administration's plan,
customers would have lower rates driven by the lower corporate tax rate, how much of a benefit depends on the new
tax rate, how excess ADIT is managed and how other items gain or lose status as deductions.
If the tax rate were lower to 20%, that would create about $2.6 billion in excess ADIT and roughly $700 million of that
would be unprotected as defined under the 1986 Tax Act. A 100% expensing of the capital scenario in isolation would
reduce rate base, but with our NOL positions, we would expect our rate base outlook to remain relatively unchanged. If

interest were no longer deductible, revenue requirements would increase for customers, but we would expect no change
in earnings.
We also have deferred tax assets at Utility, as well as at EWC for that matter which are outside of rate making. These
are currently valued using a 35% federal tax rate. If the corporate tax rate declines, the value of these deferred tax
assets would be correspondingly lower. For example, if the tax rate were to move to 20%, this will result in a one-time
reduction to those assets of approximately $580 million, about $180 million of that at the Utility. However, the taxes
due on future earnings would also be lower. So the net cash impact from the revaluation of these tax assets would be
zero.
Our EWC and Parent & Other segments are expected to have as reported losses in the future. And a lower tax rate
would provide a lower tax shield from those losses. Loss of interest deductibility would further impact the parent
holding company. The magnitude would depend on whether this change would affect only interest on new debt,
existing debt, or net interest.
Although, there will be earnings impacts in these segments, we still expect to be in a well position for the foreseeable
future. So, our cash flow expectation should not be materially affected. But obviously, the details matter and potential
financial implications for Entergy and our customers would depend on exactly what is enacted.
Our objective is to continue to work with our peers at EEI and other stakeholders to reach a final construct, which is
equitable. Continue to closely monitor this issue and we'll provide more specifics when we can.
And now, the Entergy team is available to answer questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Wanted to go through the tax reform update that you provided. For the reduction in
income tax rate from 20% – to 20% from 35%, is there a sense of the magnitude of the EPS impact from that? I'm
thinking really more for Parent & Other not as much for EWC. But is there an approximation that we should be
thinking about in terms of the magnitude there?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Sure. Just from the tax rate change in isolation and it's probably $0.10 to $0.15, if you went
from 35% to 20%. But again, as I mentioned, we would still have the NOL in place. So, we wouldn't expect any real
cash impact near-term for that.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Understood. Understood. And then, just as a follow-up in terms of thinking about EWC
and its cash flow over time. Would you mind just giving us your latest thoughts on what is the likely cash flow profile
for that business through this period of time overall?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah. Stephen, our expectation through kind of 2021 is that we would be able to get back to
about flat from a cash flow perspective. And, you can see where the EBITDA is. And, net of all the special items – and
that includes all – the special items include all the impairment expectations and the capital expenses and everything
else. It doesn't include the NDT, which I mentioned is sensitive, which would take us a little further negative. But, we
have opportunities operationally. And, in some of our balance sheet items like working through the – working capital
and other things to bring us back to negative. And, as we are successfully, we could get a little higher than that.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Understood. So, you'd be neutral by 2021. And, any guidance in terms of the cash flow
position prior to 2021?

<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I am sorry, say that again, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: So, it sounds like you're on track to be sort of neutral by 2021. But prior to 2021, is there
any guidance in terms of the cash flow position for EWC's earning sort of 2017 through 2020?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: 2017 through 2020? I think this year we'll probably be a negative cash flow year, because
we have three refueling outages in the business. And, as we move forward, it would be a little bit better than that. And
then, as we get towards – we'll have expenses associated with severance and retention that we incur as each plant shuts
down, I think most of that's detailed in the back, in the appendix.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Great. Thank you very much.

Thank you. And the next question is from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Thanks so much. Hi, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Praful.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning, Praful.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Good morning. So question firstly on the utility growth and with the Trump, growth and
infrastructure plan, there seems to be lots of talk on the spend and one benefit could be your service territory. So
wanted to understand given you haven't really changed your utility growth profile, if you expect to see anything, and if
you do, how will that translate to utility growth?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, I'll start and then I'll let Theo or Rod jump-in. But, our growth profile right now and
particularly over the term that we give the outlook through 2019 is pretty set as it relates to modernization of our
infrastructure across all segments of the business, whether it's generation, transmission or distribution.
And recall that a lot of what we're doing on the generation and transmission side is both catching up to a short position
plus modernizing, aging and less efficient infrastructure on both sides. So changes in growth profile that would be
caused by anything that's coming up with Trump would probably not happen fast enough to have any kind of impact on
our growth strategy as it stands right now.
If we were to start to see things happen, particularly in the energy sector that started to provide a stimulus for growth or
we start to see our existing customers expand or new customers show up, that would really be more of a continuation of
the existing story. We've got the 3% industrial growth that we had in 2016 that we're looking at again in 2017, that just
might continue that path. But that most likely would be in projects that would show outside of the 2019 timeframe.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Got you. Thank you. The next question I had was on just the decommissioning, on slide 49 you
lay out the decommissioning status and this is just, for example, Vermont Yankee trust assets are higher than the
liability. But the sale of the asset was basically at no cost or no price, so I am trying to figure out how do you think
about decommissioning funded status relative to your strategy to sell these assets to somebody else to decommission.
Like, shouldn't there be some value in the decommissioning trust relative to the liability?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, this is Drew and I could just talk to the balance sheet items and what's going on there.
I'll let Bill talk to the commercial element that I think is associated with your question. The trust – the liabilities and the
trust, well, let me say, the liabilities are accreting over time. I am not sure I understand if there is a question in there
about the liabilities, but they are accreting over time and we're seeing some expense associated with that. The trust
assets and our NRC minimums are all met. The trust assets are growing at about – and we're assuming the growth

around 6.25% over time.
And by the way, there is a rule change in 2018, about how much income we may recognize, because we moved
mark-to-market on the equity portion of our trust. But I think that we are anticipating in our current plants, Praful that
we would put some money into the decommissioning trust we talked about that, there is some, and we're expecting to
put in for both Palisades and Indian Point. But, the Pilgrim trust is pretty well funded at this point, as you can see in
that table and it's at $960 million. So I'll turn it over to Bill to allow him to talk a little bit about the commercial
implications of where the trusts are and how we might disposition them.
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yeah. I mean, essentially, I mean, if you take the VY deal, I mean the way it was looked at
is, you've got – they've obviously, we've got our projected liabilities and if you'd compare that to what the NDT is, what
we're looking at is, folks who have the capability to do this on a much more aggressive schedule and a much more
efficient schedule.
So while there could be a small pop off with something like VY, that is all been taken into consideration in the
negotiation of the commercial deal. And if you look at what we're looking at in terms of the transaction with Pilgrim,
Palisades, you're looking at one, which is over funded, one which they would look at as being underfunded. But they
have the ability to kind of look at that on the combination basis. And that's why we package those together to do some
– do preliminary due diligence to look at doing a very similar transaction.
<Q - Praful Mehta>: Got you. I appreciate it, guys. Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thanks, Praful.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Hey, guys. A couple of questions. First of all, Leo, you commented briefly about
opportunities in terms of rightsizing the corporate organization. Can you give a little bit of a detail about that in terms
of how big of an opportunity from a cost saves perspective and kind of a timeline when, and how long do you think it
would take you to achieve and when do you think you'd be at a more normal run rate?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah, well, and I guess we're at a normal run rate right now and if you think about it, Michael,
we're actually in the – and I was talking that section of my script around the nuclear corporate organizations, as well as
the corporate. Corporate organization as it relates to overhead inside EWC. We are at – we are – as we've said here over
the course of the last several months, we are running somewhat of a lean shop strategy, so we got that going for us to
begin with as we start to ramp up to get more towards industry benchmarks at the same point in time, the EWC shutting
down. The whole point there is, we made the decision to shut down Vermont Yankee in 2014.
We started looking at the issue in terms of rightsizing the organization then with an eye towards recognizing that a lot
of this stuff has been in the works for a long time. From 2014 to 2021, we got a seven-year where the plants will
sequentially go away and we've already started working on that organizational size. The question comes up from
time-to-time about the overhead as if it's an issue, it's just not, that was the point I was trying to make.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Okay. Super helpful. One, if you don't mind one quick follow-up. At what point like the deal
with the State of New York regarding the retirement of Indian Point, and the plant retirement is 2020-2021, but there is
the potential the plant could live out to 2024-2025. At what point would you know, like how does the decision making
process happen in terms of the state decides or some combination of other and how early do you need to know, like at
some point refueling decisions or other similar decisions have to get made, if the state decides the play it wants to
operate beyond 2020?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yeah, Michael. This is Bill. So, really the responsibility for the resource need will fall with
New York ISO. So what you need to be watching for is, they will do an updated kind of load and resource study
probably the second half of this year, where they'll start to incorporate the shutdown of Indian Point, as well as any

other additional resources that may be coming online.
And so, that will start to paint the picture of what 2021 looks like. And so, that will look at overall capacity needs as
well as specific reliability needs in terms of system security. And then, that will be updated on an annualized basis.
What we're going to need to be watching for to – and the state will be watching for is that we'll have to likely make a
decision sometime in second half of 2018, if we want to extend the operations of that unit.
And then, we would have to enter into negotiations with New York State, because remember that's a mutual option, we
both have to agree. So obviously, they'd have to recognize the need for reliability, we'll have to ensure that we've fully
recovered all of our costs.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. So, in other words, post 2020, if there is an operation it's likely under some form of
PPA or some other agreement that probably looks, smells and acts a little bit like an RMR, because it's actually needed
for reliability purposes.
<A - William M. Mohl>: Yes, sir. That's correct.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thanks, Michael.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Yeah. Hey, good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Just didn't hear much of an update on the nuclear improvement program, could you just
maybe talk about how that's progressing, any update on the kind of the cost levels that you gave before or should we
just assume they're the same? And just, how do you plan to update us on how that's going kind of going on in the
future?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Steve, I'd say that right now there is no update on the cost. You should assume that they are
what we've outlined originally and continuing the numbers today. As far as updates, right now the nuclear strategic
plan is kind of all wrapped-up in our expenditures, therein all of the guidance that you've got right now. We're
beginning to see improvements in the operations or the facilities. So I think, it will just be no a regular basis and
probably more by exception than anything else as far as what we'd be updating you on.
As far as where it sits in the regulatory process, as Drew mentioned, everything that we've got going on at the moment
is just running through the normal regulatory processes that we've already got in place, particularly given the fact that
we've put some pretty good mechanisms in place over the course of the last several years to adjust things on a regular
basis.
And as you know, we're in the process of reviewing some of those costs that were in the 2017 or the 2016 filed formula
rate plan, there is no procedure. In Arkansas, there is no procedural schedule for that at the moment. We'd anticipate
that that will get done if not before, at least, within the same context as when we make the next filing of the FRP in
Arkansas.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: The last point, is that, you're referring to the kind of small prudence thing that was opened up
on the last, on your settlement on the filing there or is that...?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Right. And really what that is, is the fact of the matter is the process is a brand new process.
The formula rate plan with the forward-looking test year. And so, we're just going through the process and the
Commission just wants to make sure they got it right, that's all.

<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. But operationally do you feel that the nuclear performance improvements are going on
plan, ignoring cost, just operationally? Okay.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Both. Both. Not ignoring cost. Everything's on the plan.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Everything is on plan. Okay. One other question, just to clarify, I know, you gave the
three-year utility guidance, but the 5% to 7% that you mentioned at the beginning of the call and I think, you said
something about that being some years above, some years below. What are you now kind of using as the base for that
5% to 7%?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: We're still – this is Drew – we're still thinking about, sort of, I guess, you could either place,
you could base it off of where we are for 2016 or if you went back to sort of an adjusted view of 2015, it would be a
little bit higher than that. But either way, I mean, I think, our objective is to try and get in that range each year, although
at times, it will be a little lumpier than most. So, that I think, it doesn't really matter, Steve, where you would start from
is our objective. But we should be able to get in there over time.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Right. Because I mean, obviously 2016, 2017 is below, but then I think, 2019 is well above
based on your guidance. So that's what you mean by the back and forth just kind of?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: That's right. That's right. If you recall, last year before we put the nuclear costs and we were
expecting to be more steady in that. And now, we've got the nuclear costs in. But as time moves forward, we'd expect
to get recovery of those costs and we would get back on track to our original plan. And so, that's why 2019 is still
where we'd put it, I guess, a year ago. And the other – in 2017 and 2018 move down slightly, but we expect to get back
on track.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. One last thing, Leo. I think, you are on the EEI Tax Committee, on the Tax Reform
Committee, just maybe, any just more color on how we should think about tax reform, given the discussions that you've
had and just where it might go?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, I mean, I think, as Drew mentioned and I think everybody else in the industry has
probably mentioned, it's pretty early in the process as it relates to what's going on and the dynamics that I think will be
the most determative over time or the interplays of all these different items not only how they impact our industry, but
others as well.
But, I would say that the dialogue that the industry has had with folks at the White House and on the Hill has been
constructive. I think the history the industry has in terms of the way our rate regulated regimes work is understood by a
large number of folks. And so, I think that we're in a position where, we're talking to the right people, we're having a lot
of dialogue, everybody is doing it with a pretty aligned point of view and we hope that things constructive come about,
because of it. And again, the nature of our business being rate regulated certainly does provide some nuances that are
important to us that may not be important to other industries, but that's been provided for in the past when there has
been tax law changes and also the fact that we're rate regulated gives us some ability to make sure that, we have
rational regulation around the way the law turns out just like we do today, in terms of normalization practices and
things like that.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hey, just wanted to follow-up a little bit on some of the last questions here. Can you
talk a little bit about some of the costs associated with EWC and how that might get allocated out in the future vis-à-vis
the regulated business? It might somewhat dovetail with your talk about bringing down cost overall, but just wanted to
understand, how that process plays out? And then, I got a follow-up.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, the way the process follows – falls out is, we have corporate organizations that allocate
cost to EWC. Again, a seven-year period over which plants go away one at a time to be able to manage that process.
We've already begun managing it on Vermont Yankee which is over, kind of, we've already gone through the process
of shutting down Vermont Yankee. We've already managed as it relates to Rhode Island plant, which we've already
sold. We've already managed as it relates to the wind assets which we've already sold. We've managed, as it relates to
FitzPatrick, which will be sold this year, we'll manage it as it relates to Palisades which will shutdown at 2018, and
Pilgrim in 2019, and then in 2020, and 2021. It's a process that has to be managed as it relates to what those costs are,
but to right size the organization over a seven-year period is something that we'll be able to manage. So I guess, Julien,
it's just not an issue of significance that I would see.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I can throw in some modeling elements too – this is Drew – and from a modeling
perspective, when we started we had about $35 million per plant of overheads. And as we've had direct cost for each
plant, I don't have the percentages in front of me right now for each plant going back to Vermont Yankee. But, as each
one of those is going to peel off as those plants are shut down. And I think there may be about 40% or so left at sort of
indirect costs, and those are the ones that we'll have to work down over time that Leo is talking about and we've got a
really good head start.
And so, I think at the end of the day, what we're going to end up with is the costs that are reasonable and necessary to
operate the business going forward. And, I mean, that should make sure that we have reliable and safe operations of our
nuclear plant. So I think from a modeling perspective, those are the things that you would look at as it kind of winds
down over time.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: But, just a follow-up here, just quickly you talked about the non-nuclear assets and
Cooper contract being generally earnings neutral. But, just outside of that on a go-forward basis, 2021 onwards, I mean,
you're talking about ramping down the cost, there should be no other costs outside of decommissioning in NDT that
need – that are ongoing. The remainder is either cut and/or allocated out and largely there is no other cost EPS
attributable to the business.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: That's correct. And in the slide, in the front, we talk about the NDT earnings and the
decommissioning expense that's on slide 13. And you see initially, there is a pretty big gap between the
decommissioning strength and the NDT earnings. I think, one thing that's important to know there is, for the earnings
part of that we're assuming that we're realizing only about 45% of the 6.25% of the earnings in 2017. And so, it's
effectively showing you like about a 3% return on your NDT earnings, the rest of its going straight to the balance sheet.
And then in 2018, we'll have an accounting change, which would cause us to mark-to-market much more of the equity
portion of the trust. And so, our return will go up substantially, not – from 6.25%, it's going to stay there, but we'll just
acknowledge more of that in the income statement which will close that gap. And then, over time if we're successful, of
course in doing more VY like transactions, that should shrink as well.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Sorry, just a quick follow-up on Arkansas Nuclear One, what's the timeline for filing
for and/or process to just get recovery on the regulated expense there? Just a quick one.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: I think, as it relates to – there is no filing around Arkansas Nuclear One. There is a formula rate
plan filing that we had. The one that's already in place, there is the review that's going on where there is no procedural
schedule for yet and then we'll just make another formula rate plan filing, is that what you're asking about the recovery?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Yeah. Exactly, I was presuming it was part of the FRP, but I wasn't a 100% sure.

<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yes. Yes. It was part of the FRP as it relates to the breaks that are in effect today and that's
where we're going through the process where the Commission want to go back and review some more information on
those costs. There is no procedural schedule around that at the moment, but then there will be another FRP filing this
summer. And so, there will be more cost associated with every – [ph] hopeful (57:35) business including ANO at that
point in time. So we would anticipate that the one that's out there today will either get a procedural schedule before that
time or it will get wrapped up at the same point in time, as the next step [ph] for Vermont (57:45).

Thank you. And the last question will come from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Well, good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Hi, Leo. Actually I wanted to clarify just on the question you were just talking about.
Firstly, are those costs likely to get recovered in 2017 under the 2016 FRP if they wrap it up sooner or are they sort of,
because I think they set them aside, so they wanted more information, but would it be retroactive to beginning of the
year, if decided on a more timely basis than, I guess, next year's filing?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: They are in rates now.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. So, still the question is whether they stay in or...
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Correct.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: ...you're collecting it today?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Correct.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah, they are just reviewing them. They didn't set them aside out of the pricing. They are all
being recovered today.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Right. Okay. Thank you for that. And then, secondly, I think you gave a number on
what you thought the potential Utility, or Parent & Other exposure to tax reform at a lower tax rate would be.
If you layered in losing interest deductibility as well, in that kind of scenario, would you guys still see yourselves in the
5% to 7% range? Does it move you in the range? How should we think about that kind of incremental scenario?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yeah.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Jonathan, this is Drew, so clearly, we have a fairly narrow range out there for Utility, Parent
& Other. And if you were to layer on the change in tax rate and the interest expense that and assuming that was the
scenario you ended up with, they would probably move you close to the bottom of that range.
It's too early to tell about what we decide to do with the ranges at this point. But, if you just were to take those two
things in isolation that would probably, bring it to the bottom of the range. But, it's not clear yet that we would move
the range or change our guidance or anything at this point.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Right. Understood. Okay. Thank you very much.
