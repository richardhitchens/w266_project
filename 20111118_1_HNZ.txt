Now with the formalities out of the way, let me turn the call over to Bill Johnson. Bill?
William R. Johnson
Thank you, Meg. Good morning, everyone. Before Art take you through the numbers, I will briefly review our second
quarter performance, which was led once again by our trio of growth engines, emerging markets, our top 15 brands,
and global ketchup. I'll also discuss our expectations for sequentially stronger results in the second half of the year,
especially in developed markets where pricing and commodity costs should finally equilibrate. Overall, we are still on
track to achieve our full year sales and EPS outlook.
Turning to the second quarter, I would characterize our results as strong in emerging markets and mix in developed
markets. Reported sales grew 8.3% and we delivered EPS of $0.81 a share before special items. Notably, we saw a
combination of continued strength in emerging markets mixed with softness in some developed markets, primarily
Australia and our foodservice business in the U.S. where consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in 30 years.
Turning first to emerging markets, they continue to be our most powerful growth engine as they delivered 16% organic
sales growth, which excludes any of our acquisitions. The growth was led by excellent results in ketchup and sauces in
China, Latin America and Indonesia as well as very strong performance in Complan and infant nutrition. We have
significant innovations still to come and I want to be clear that I expect our emerging market growth rates to actually
accelerate in the second half of the year. Importantly our recent acquisitions: Quero in Brazil and Master in China also
performed well and continue to exceed our expectations in these two critically important emerging markets.
Quero sales grew 8.5% in the first half despite capacity constraints and without the benefit of any marketing
investment, which we commenced in early November. Sales of Foodstar's Master soy sauce brand grew around 30%
and I now expect Foodstar to deliver somewhere between $140 million and $150 million in sales this year well above
our plan. In both cases, we're focused on driving top and bottom line growth through innovation, marketing investment,
channel expansion and improved capabilities.
Overall emerging markets generated the vast majority of the company's organic sales growth representing over 20% of
total Heinz sales. The second growth driver was the performance of our top 15 brands, which now include Quero and
Master. Reported sales in our top 15 brands including Quero and Master grew more than 12% and accounted for around
71% of our total sales. Excluding Quero and Master, the remaining top 15 brands delivered 3% organic growth in the
quarter.
The third growth engine was global ketchup lifted by higher pricing, strong sales results in Europe and higher volume
in Latin America. Ketchup delivered excellent organic growth of 6.5% in the quarter and is up 7.4% organically
year-to-date as we continue to successfully focus on innovation, new distribution and penetration opportunities, not bad
for a 135-year-old brand. We are keeping our flagship product healthy and growing with innovations like plant bottle,

balsamic ketchup and Dip & Squeeze, which was recently recognized with two major industry awards for innovation.
Dip & Squeeze continues to build strong momentum in Foodservice. Wendy's is the latest customer to accept Dip &
Squeeze and the product is performing very well at Chick-fil-A, Dairy Queen and other quick serve chains.
Importantly, it will shortly represent 25% of our single serve ketchup business, and we are essentially at full capacity.
Separately, sales of our new retail 10-packs of Dip & Squeeze have just commenced. This is the first time a Heinz
Ketchup innovation developed primarily for restaurants has achieved broad distribution on retail store shelves.
Finally, Heinz Ketchup with balsamic vinegar will reach U.S. store shelves next month after making a splash in the
U.K. earlier this year and after a very successful Facebook campaign commenced in the U.S. this week. This launch
exemplifies the progress we have made in sharing best practices in new product innovation globally to grow our
business. In summary, our trio of growth drives emerging markets, top 15 brands in global ketchup helped Heinz
deliver our 26th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth.
Turning to developed markets, they were a tale of a two cities with many of our mature market business units posting
solid results despite the tough environment led by another outstanding performance in the U.K. On the other hand
Australia and U.S. Foodservice continue to be very challenged as Art described last quarter.
In Australia we are confronting a combination of weak categories, relentless promotional pressure, and growing private
label, as well as executional issues. We have significantly upgraded the management team and are aggressively
working to simplify the business and reduce costs.
Overall, we are taking action on many fronts to improve our margins. We are eliminating hundreds of SKUs, closing
the sauces production facility in Girgarre, downsizing two other factories, reducing overheads, and are working with
suppliers and retailers to improve overall efficiency in terms of logistics and promotions.
Turning to U.S. Foodservice, after two years of favorable profit trends, this year is clearly proving difficult. We are
being challenged by significant increases in commodity costs, promotional price pressure and non-branded back of
house products and a lag in price realization at national accounts as well as a downturn in traffic at key customers.
The industry poses structural challenges to growth and consequently we are carefully reviewing the makeup of the
Foodservice portfolio to determine where we are competitively advantaged. Our branded KC&S business, for example,
is performing much better than our branded and more commodity oriented lines. We will share more on this during
future updates, but for now we are closing several factories and streamlining back office activities to further reduce
costs and eliminate what has become redundant capacity. We expect substantial improvement in Foodservice profit
over the balance of the fiscal year as we lap the onset of higher commodity cost last year and benefit from the rollover
of our pricing initiatives. Together these two actions alone should be worth approximately $20 million to $25 million in
incremental operating profit in the second half of the year versus our first half performance.
We anticipate substantial improvement in both Foodservice and Australia during the second half in response to our
recent actions. Stepping back and viewing North America in aggregate, the combination of steep unemployment and
historically low consumer confidence dampened consumer grocery spending in August and September especially in the
frozen food aisle. Importantly we saw improvement in October which is continuing into November.
North American sales results reflect category weakness across the frozen aisle as well as price related volume softness
in Ore-Ida. Overall our ambient product line performed far better, consequently organic sales in North America
consumer products would have been up almost 2% excluding Ore-Ida. I am encouraged by the continued growth in
Small Ones share behind the launch of bagged meals and several breakfast line extensions although the frozen
nutritional category does remain soft in line with consumer confidence.
We are launching a number of innovative new frozen and ambient products in the third quarter that have been tailored
specifically to meet the needs of U.S. consumers with tight grocery budgets. Our launch includes several items with
compelling price points of $0.99 and a $1.99. These products have been developed to deliver the same great taste that
we always do and value in affordable sizes while maintaining and in some cases building on historical margins.

The initiative will feature a new 10-ounce version of Heinz ketchup and standup pouch packaging with a spout and a
suggested retail price of $0.99. Many other products will also be priced around $1 including new retail sizes of Heinz
mustard, Heinz Worcestershire sauce and Heinz 57 sauce.
Additionally, we have just launched Heinz Home Style Beans priced slightly higher than $1 after encouraging results in
a number of test stores. Over the years countless U.S. consumers have requested that we bring back Heinz Beans. And
we believe this is the right time for the return of this convenient, nutritious and value oriented classic. Consumers have
been turning to comfort foods during the recession and a recent consumer opinion poll ranked baked beans as the
number two comfort food.
In Frozen we are launching a one pound bag of Ore-Ida French fries late in the quarter at the suggested retail price of
$1.99 to address consumer request for increased affordability. Data shows that one-third to one-half of unit purchases
in many U.S. product categories are now of small size SKUs as many consumers are shopping from week-to-week to
stretch their food dollars.
Importantly these new products will enhance our ability to serve the rapidly growing number of U.S. households with
incomes below $50,000. As you can see, this income bracket has grown three times faster than households with income
above that threshold. Overall, U.S. consumers remain loyal to Heinz and are extremely satisfied with the quality and
value of our products. That factor was reinforced this week as we were notified that Heinz ranked first in overall
customer satisfaction among all of the 225 companies across 47 industries in the 2011 American Customer Satisfaction
Index. Heinz led all companies with an overall customer satisfaction score of 89, which measures performance in
quality, value, consumer loyalty, and consumer expectations. The Heinz brand topped all brands ranging from Apple
and Cadillac to Google and Lexus. Heinz also led all food manufacturers for the 12th year in a row with a score eight
points higher than the industry average.
Outside North America, we are responding to consumer's desires to economize on price per ounce basis by introducing
extra free packs of beans and soup in the U.K and a 1.5 liter variety of Heinz ketchup across continental Europe. In
Europe where the economic climate remains volatile, Heinz will also launch a number of products priced around €1,
including entry price varieties of Plasmon, the leading brand of baby food in Italy.
In addition to innovation, marketing is a key to unlocking growth in our core portfolio. Marketing spend is up strongly
year-to-date and I expect it to increase at a high single-digit rate for the year to help drive stronger organic growth
across the second half. In addition to continued marketing investment behind our leading brands, we remain committed
to our sizable investment in Keystone, our global initiative to upgrade and standardized processes and systems. We
continue to take a long-term view of the company and these investments will position us well in the future.
Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we expect our second half results to benefit from improved results in
U.S. Foodservice and Australia, roll over pricing and a relative easing of commodity inflation, stronger volume as well
as even greater growth in emerging markets than we experienced in Q1 and Q2. We are making progress in our value
engineering and productivity initiatives and I'm pleased with our results in this area. And as always, we will not
sacrifice quality and safety in the name of savings.
SG&A comparisons in the second half should be easier as well than they were in the first half. As you will recall in the
back half of last fiscal year, we were affected by some nonrecurring expenses such as the closing cost of the Quero
acquisition, increased investments to drive innovation and plant expansion in emerging markets and we significantly
stepped up our investment in Keystone. Our investment in Keystone is a critically important component of our
productivity initiative, but it does represent a substantial headwind.
Nevertheless, as I stated earlier, we remain on track to achieve our previously announced constant currency EPS
outlook of $3.24 to $3.32 for the full year, excluding special charges for our one-time productivity initiatives. Heinz
continues to expect constant currency sales growth of 7% to 8% and EPS growth of 6% to 8% for the full year
excluding the special charges. We also expect strong operating free cash flow of approximately $1.15 billion for the
year excluding charges and more than $1 billion on a reported basis.

Overall, Heinz continues to drive strong growth in emerging markets, our top 15 brands and global ketchup. We are
taking decisive, but prudent actions to reduce cost in developed markets and we are continuously analyzing additional
programs to drive increased shareholder value. Furthermore, we are evaluating numerous M&A opportunities in the
emerging world to build on our already strong momentum.
With our continuing focus on operating discipline and productivity investments, we believe we are well positioned to
continue to driving solid organic growth led by our trio of growth engines: emerging markets, our top 15 brands and
global ketchup, which by the way continues to support our troops via the Wounded Warrior program, which is working
very well for us.
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Art.
Arthur B. Winkleblack
Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results, a brief update on the first half and
the shape and phasing in the P&L as we look forward through the remainder of the fiscal year. Overall, Q2 results
reflect a strong top line performance, continuing investments to drive future growth and productivity and significant
challenges in Australia and U.S. Foodservice.
In short, we're largely in line with our expectations and driving growth despite a very challenging environment in
developed markets. Let's first ground you on our EPS performance on a reported, constant currency, and ex-items basis.
To summarize for Q2, reported EPS was $0.73 which reflects $0.08 of charges for one time productivity investments
announced back in May.
Stripping out special items and the favorable impact of foreign currency this quarter, EPS was $0.78, flat to prior year.
Note, however, that this includes the higher cost for Project Keystone that we discussed back in May.
And finally EPS excluding special charges was $0.81, up 4%. Now before going through the P&L ex-items, let's
quickly review the special charges for the quarter, they included $14 million of severance and employee benefit costs
for reducing the global workforce, $12 million of asset write-offs associated with the closure of five factories, and $11
million of other implementation expenses primarily related to the supply chain hub in Europe.
Overall we recorded pre-tax charges of $37 million or $0.08 per share, the entire amount was reported in the
non-operating segment of our financial statements.
Now turning to the P&L scorecard ex-items, revenue growth was driven by recent acquisitions, foreign currency and
organic sales growth. Gross margin was down 180 basis points reflecting the results in Australia and U.S. Foodservice,
as well as what we expect is the toughest commodity overlap of the year. We continue to invest in marketing, up about
9.5% and operating income was down, more than all of which was due to Australia and U.S. Foodservice, OI for the
rest of the company was up more than 5%.
In terms of currency movements, we benefited by $0.03 from foreign exchange, driven by the pound and the euro,
which have exhibited surprising strength in the face of sovereign debt concerns on the continent. These currency
movements offset a portion of the very high inflation we experienced in the quarter.
Taking a look at the P&L, let's focus on the few lines I haven't yet reviewed. The increase in SG&A reflects the impact
of acquisitions, increased capabilities in emerging markets, and investments in Project Keystone, partially offset by
aggressive cost management in developed markets.
Below operating income, higher net interest expense was more than offset by currency gains this year. And as we
projected on last quarter's earnings call, our effective tax rate was very favorable for the quarter, benefiting from
effective international tax planning and positive international audit settlements.
Looking at the key components of revenue growth, organic sales grew by 1.5% and constant currency sales grew
almost 6%. Volume was down due to Australia, declines in restaurant traffic and U.S. Foodservice and as a result of

price increases and promotional timing in the U.K. and U.S. Price improvements of about 4.5% were driven by the
U.K., the U.S., Latin America, and China. Our recent acquisitions are performing very well and increased company
sales by 5%. This was partially offset by the exit of the Boston Market license in the U.S. and foreign exchange
contributed almost 2.5 points to sales growth.
As I noted earlier, gross margin declined 180 basis points, half of which related to Australia and U.S. Foodservice.
Overall, margin inflation on commodities was about 10% this quarter. This double-digit inflation represents more than
400 basis points of margin in Q2 and we expect this inflation rate to be the high water mark for the year.
While we delivered solid pricing and productivity gains, they only partially offset this very significant inflation. Market
inflation on commodities was driven primarily by sweeteners, resin for plastic bottles, beans and dairy products. While
we continue to expect moderating cost comparisons in the second half, full year market inflation is now expected to be
about 7.5%, or 50 basis points higher than our projections back in May. This represents an additional hurdle of about
$0.05 of EPS. As high as our inflation rate was in Q2, the CRB Commodity Inflation Index increased at an even higher
rate. It was up 15% in our second quarter, five points higher than the market rates of increase on our commodities.
It is important to note the sharp increase in inflation in the back half of last year. This is what gives us confidence that
our cost comparisons will become progressively easier through the remainder of our fiscal year.
Now, let's take a quick look at the top and bottom line performance in the each of our key segments. First, in North
American consumer products we posted relatively flat results in a very difficult market. Organic sales were up slightly
at 0.3% offset by a 2% impact from the exit of the Boston Market license. Operating income was down about a point.
We generated solid sales growth in frozen entrees, ketchup and other sauces offset by lower sales of Ore-Ida frozen
potatoes and Classico pasta sauce. Our growth in frozen entrees was driven by share gains as the category was down,
reflecting exceptionally low consumer confidence in the U.S. Gross margin was impacted by commodity inflation,
which outpaced pricing and productivity gains. Given the tough economy, we aggressively managed discretionary
spending and are adapting to the changing environment. As Bill discussed, we're addressing the Ore-Ida price value
equation and launching new products with more compelling price points.
U.S. Foodservice business had a difficult quarter in a very tough environment. Overall, sales were down almost 3% and
OI declined 33%. As Bill said, Q2 sales were impacted by declines in customer traffic and promotional timing.
Compounding the weak traffic trends, commodity inflation in U.S. Foodservice impacted gross margin by more than
500 basis points. We expect better performance in Foodservice over the back-half of the year with improved price
realization, moderating commodity inflation, increased productivity and a better overlap in SG&A. Despite the
headlines coming out of Europe these days, Heinz posted very solid results in Europe with constant currency sales up
almost 3% and operating income up about 3.5%.
The U.K., Germany, Nordics, Eastern Europe and Russia set the pace for sales growth in the region. Organic sales
growth and gross margins were up based on pricing and increased marketing. We continue to deliver strong growth on
our flagship ketchup product in Europe. For the quarter, organic sales of ketchup were up 6%. The growth across much
of the region was partially offset by reduced organic sales in Italy where the key baby food categories declined during
the quarter.
Importantly we continue to drive our aggressive change agenda across Europe. As part of this, we moved forward on
Project Keystone with a rollout of new processes and initiation of the project in Germany, brought the Netherlands and
the Nordics into the supply chain hub model and broke down on a new European innovation center which should be a
key catalyst for faster and more effective new product development in Europe. Overall, we delivered very solid results
in a tough European market and continued to invest for the future.
Asia-Pacific region posted mid-single digit constant currency sales growth but incurred a sizeable reduction of
profitability during the quarter. Emerging markets continue to drive strong growth driven by Complan in India, ABC
Sauces in Indonesia and by both baby food and Western Sauces in China. Additionally, we're seeing great growth in
Foodstar. Lower profit reflects the performance in Australia.

As Bill mentioned, we're taking very aggressive action in this market. With a new Managing Director in place, we're
improving commercial capabilities, dramatically simplifying the business, reducing the cost structure, and focusing on
better day-to-day execution. Underscoring that dichotomy in sales growth trends in the segment, constant currency
sales for emerging markets grew 31% in the quarter, while Australia's top line was down in the double-digit rate, and
the other developed markets in the region were basically flat. August and September were particularly difficult in
Australia, following a price increase with better trends in October and early November.
Turning to the Rest of World segment, constant currency sales more than doubled, while operating income grew more
than 150%. This growth was driven by very strong performance in Latin America reflecting price, volume, and share
growth. The strong start with Quero in Brazil, largely related to good growth in the sauces category and importantly we
just recently launched the first TV advertising in the company's history. And finally, we're launching new baby food
pouches in Mexico and Central America.
Moving to cash flow, operating free cash flow was $131 million for the quarter. This is down versus last year, but in
line with our planned expectations. The reduction versus fiscal 2011 largely reflects the impact of higher inventories
and one-time productivity charges. Capital expenditures at 3.6% of sales were higher than last year, but again in line
with our expectations for the year. Finally during the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares with a total cost of $73
million, partially offset by cash from options. This is in line with our stated goal of keeping diluted shares flat for the
year.
Now, let's take a very brief look at results for the first half. Year-to-date P&L shows sales up 11.5% and EPS up almost
4%, these are in line with our expectations, but the shape of the P&L is different than planned. Gross margin is lower,
which is offset by a lower tax rate and strong performance in the U.K and emerging markets.
In terms of the balance sheet, year-to-date cash flow of $228 million is below prior year due to inventory, cash taxes,
capital spending and special items. We expect to accelerate cash flow in the back-half, consistent with our typical
annual phasing. Net debt to EBITDA is up slightly reflecting our emerging market acquisitions late last fiscal year, but
remains low at 2.1 times. ROIC is down also due to the acquisitions, but excluding the Quero deal, ROIC would be up
10 basis points.
Now I'd like to make a couple of comments on the full year outlook. As Bill said earlier, we remain on track for the full
year sales and EPS outlook that we discussed back in May. On a constant currency ex-items basis, we expect sales
growth of 7% to 8% and EPS growth of 6% to 8%. And we continue to expect operating free cash flow of $1.15 billion
before one-time productivity charges.
Clearly, given the economic headwinds we're facing and the difficulties we're encountering in U.S. Foodservice and
Australia, we expect to get to our full year EPS target in a different way. Specifically, versus the original plan we
discussed in May, we expect a lower gross margin driven by higher commodity inflation and challenges in Australia
and U.S. Foodservice offset by stronger results in emerging markets and the U.K., reduced SG&A costs through tight
management of discretionary spending, lower net interest expense from lower market rates and strong treasury
management and lower taxes with a global effective tax rate in the mid-20s related to a very effective foreign tax
planning and favorable international audit settlements. And I want to reiterate what I said last quarter. We expect Q3
EPS to be higher than Q2, and Q4 EPS to be higher than Q3.
Before summarizing, I want to update you on special items for the year. As you'll recall back in May we discussed
productivity initiatives that would have an impact of $160 million of operating income, $0.35 of EPS and $130 million
of cash flow. We believe we are on track for these projects in terms of timing, costs and benefits. And in order to even
more aggressively address the difficult environment in which we're operating, we have continued to look for additional
opportunities to simplify the business and drive shareholder value. As a result of this effort, we've identified additional
projects in FY12 that will cost $55 million of OI, $0.15 of EPS and $20 million of cash flow. These projects are
expected to result in the closure of another three factories worldwide. We'll talk more about these projects in the
coming months.

So in summary, we're posting solid sales and EPS results in a very challenging environment, driving top line growth in
emerging markets, our top 15 products and global ketchup, continuing to invest in the business for sustainable
long-term growth despite the environment and expecting stronger organic growth, easing commodity headwinds and
more favorable cost comparisons in the second half.
With that, we'll turn it back to Meg and take your questions. Meg.

Great, operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS. Please proceed.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Good morning, Meg. Guys, first question on Ore-Ida since that was – that's obviously been a
struggle. That brand has had some volume issues. It's somewhat surprising if you were to take a step back, Ore-Ida is a
power brand in your portfolio. So to see it struggle the way it is, you would have thought that this brand is not just
about the functionality like the microwavable fries and that the private label risk to it would not be as great as it appears
to have been. What's the prognosis for the brand? I mean, and the plan to sort of get the volume turned around with that
brand?
<A - William R. Johnson>: I think, David, the thing to keep in mind on Ore-Ida is that private label has always been a
big piece of this category and it's probably one of the more price sensitive brands we have in the company given the
gap that has increased. We took significant pricing in Ore-Ida, nobody else moved at all on Ore-Ida. That is being
corrected now as we're seeing private label prices move up and our own prices are being addressed through D&A and
through discussions with customers regarding what's better for the category.
The second is I think our plans were a bit feckless and pallid. I don't think they worked very well. I think they were
pretty boring and so we've got a lot of things in place. First, we are adding some additional D&A into the business to
bring price points back down. Second, we're adding some marketing money back into the business to restore some
advertising in the second half of the year, which we know drives this brand pretty well.
Third, we have the small size package coming. We've started producing this month. It will start shipping in January at a
$1.99 price point or probably lower in some accounts depending on what they want to do with it and at one pound, it
offers a family of four a terrific value and we know that that will drive solid business while helping us in maintaining
our margins. Fourth, we have a lot of new product activity coming, much of which we'll talk about in our next call
because a lot of it doesn't occur until Q4.
We've just launched two new though, sweet potato fry items in crinkle cuts and straight cuts. They've just gone into –
are just going into the market now. We've got Ore-Ida casseroles coming, probably in January. So there's a lot of
activity on Ore-Ida. The issue on Ore-Ida for me was that we moved too slowly and I just did not feel that our
marketing teams moved quickly and aggressively enough, but I can tell you in the last two or three weeks since we've
taken a number of these actions, our shares in the accounts where we've done a lot of things have moved upwards of
250 to 350 basis points, 2.5, 3.5 share points. So I'm not concerned about getting it fixed. I'm just a little annoyed that it
took us as long as it did.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: And then just a separate question on the smaller package sizes in general. Why are smaller
sizes the answer? I mean, what is that in your analysis and your consumer work or even what you're seeing in terms of

activity out there that make you think that smaller package sizes are what will help the volume trends?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Because that's where the consumer is going. The consumer data, and I mentioned it in my
comments, says that half the consumers now are buying smaller sizes with lower, more compelling price points in
virtually every category in which we operate. We've seen it in Europe. It's now starting to come to the U.S. Partly that's
a function of a number of consumers shifting to dollar stores, partly it's a function of price point management with
consumers shopping week-to-week, partly it's a function just of general economic malaise that we get back from our
consumers in focus group research.
But, ultimately, we're seeing a lot of the categories downsize. Historically, what you would have seen is price per ounce
management on the part of the consumer where they would have gone to larger value sizes, but we are seeing a
dramatic shift to smaller sizes which is the reason we're launching the 10-ounce pouch ketchup, doy pack ketchup,
which really we've being doing in rest of the world for quite a period of time.
We've brought beans into the country. We are doing a lot of stuff on sauces, bringing in some of the food service items,
rebranding them and putting them in the retail side which allow us lower price points at very good margins. But
compelling price points seem to be key as people are shopping week to week or paycheck to paycheck, and so our
research clearly points out that consumers want smaller entry sizes and they want more compelling price points, and so
we can give them both while protecting our margins and really driving the businesses forward.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks, Bill.

Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Investment Research. Please proceed.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Good morning. Bill, really want to just, a question here about risk, whether this is real or
perceived and hear your answer on my focus really in Europe. So Bill can you discuss how you expect the Heinz
portfolio to respond to a recession in Europe? Volumes were down I think about 2% in the quarter and economic
conditions are likely to deteriorate significantly in the coming quarters.
I get this question more than I get anything about your operations. Folks are just focused on this like a laser. How do
you respond to it in terms of what you think the downside could be, in many cases it's beans and simple items that you
have, but people seem to think you guys have a lot of downside on volumes next year because of economic weakness.
What are your thoughts?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Well, my first thought is I've been hearing that for quite a period of time and I don't mean
to be Solomon-ic and create some level of wisdom beyond that of the market, because clearly we're not smarter than
the market. Having said that, I think our U.K. performance, which has fundamentally defied gravity, is being driven by
a number of things.
One, we probably have the best sales organization in the U.K. We have great insights and great leadership, we have a
lot of innovation coming, we've got the Squeeze & Stir soups which just launched in July and are doing really well.
We've got the Pouch Pasta products at a lower price point which are doing really well in the U.K., the U.K. team was
courageous, took a lot of price. Therefore their marketing spend is also up and oriented against a very powerful brand
in the Heinz brand in the U.K. and so, we're doing very well. We've got a new Aunt Bessie's lineup coming in
November, December that looks very strong in the U.K. and I know you will all be in a hurry to try the new Duck Fat
roasts, they're a delicious product.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: It's gourmet.

<A - William R. Johnson>: Can't get me to try it, but I'd be glad to share it with you the next time we're all together.
In the continent itself, I mean, we grew volume in Germany, France, Spain, the Nordics, Poland, Russia, literally across
the board. And the third thing is that ketchup continues to grow very quickly across most of the European market. I also
indicated we're introducing different pack sizes in the U.K., we're introducing pack sizes with free units, across the rest
of the continent, we're looking at areas priced around €1.
In Italy, we've got a lot of new product activity coming; they've got the new aseptic line just now shipping. It's a big
breakthrough from a product standpoint for the consumer. We are going back to individual packs in Plasmon so that we
can price down against a consumer that's basically telling us they're buying fewer of everything and they want a lower
price point. And so, we can protect both margins and our consumers and allow them to continue to buy. But I just don't
see the downside in Europe for our business.
Now the other thing we've done, remember with Project Score, we're consolidating our supply chain in a central
location in Europe, which will make us far more efficient, and a lot of that efficiency is going to be spent back in
support of these businesses and we have a great deal of new product activity coming.
We are also growing very rapidly in the Eastern markets, Poland has come back quite strongly, our Russian ketchup
shares this quarter hit all-time highs, the Heinz brand itself hit a 39 share in ketchup in Russia, which is an all-time
high. Our total collective Russian business hit a 57 share in ketchup in the key accounts. So we are continuing to drive
volume in areas where we think have competitive advantage.
And if we have a recessionary environment in Europe, for most of the Europeans it's not going to be any worse from a
consumer standpoint than they already perceive things to be because the things we hear back in focus groups in our
research in Europe is that the Europeans don't believe they ever came out of recession and in fact if you look at the
latest Nielsen data, their online surveys where they do a lot of consumption and consumer work, consumer confidence
declined in virtually every market we operate in in the developed world last quarter.
It went up in the developing world where we are really focusing a lot of our efforts, but I feel actually pretty good about
Europe. For the company itself our second half organic sales are going to be considerably stronger than they were in
the first half driven by a lot of innovation, a lot of targeted promotion and we have terrific leadership in Europe and so
if any of our businesses can withstand the recession, I think the European guys are well positioned.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: David, one thing I would add to that remember that we're putting in the Europe R&D
center, which historically would not have that capability, the R&D effort has been very fragmented. So by pulling back
together, we think we will have much better insight, much better capability to react in the market place whatever
comes.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: One quick follow-up; are the new dollar items margin neutral to your business?
<A - William R. Johnson>: For the most part, yes, both in the U.S. and in Europe. Some of them are margin
enhancing and I won't get into the specifics but most of them are margin neutral or better. There are a few exceptions
but not many.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Really appreciate the comments. Thank you.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Thank you.

<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Hello, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: I wanted to ask about the two acquisitions, Foodstar and Quero. It seems as though Foodstar is
getting off to a rocketing good start with the – on the sales growth being at 30%. Quero seems to be solid at the sort of
8% to 9% level, but obviously not quite as fast as Foodstar. I mean, does that represents the upside, is there more
upside from the Foodstar acquisition, or is that that you're waiting to get going on Quero? And what are the biggest sort
of surprises or lessons learned from each acquisition so far?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Well, I think and let's talk about Quero first. Quero grew 8.5% in the first half, it's up over
10% in October, it will be up over 11% in the Q3. You've got to remember, in Quero, we spent the first three and a half
months integrating the business. We have not spent marketing. I believe we spent about $400,000 in total marketing in
the first half of the year on Quero. We were short of capacity, particularly in corn processing. And so, we are now in
the process, we've just turned television on for the first time ever the first, second week in November, we're just taking
the Heinz brand into Quero, we've added capacity.
Our supply chain team, global supply chain team just came back from a visit to the factory outside of São Paulo and are
raving about the opportunities particularly on pouch and on tetra pack where we can run tetra pack faster than we can
run cans in many parts of our business. So, I think in Quero, you will see a substantial increase in second half sales as a
function of the marketing investment and a lot of the new items we're putting in place.
On Foodstar, my concern on Foodstar is not growth. My concern is how we're going to stay up with it. We grew 30%
on the Master brand and Guanghe brand in the first half of the year. October sales were up 69%, November sales are
running at about that level, north of 50%. The Shanghai factory has come online, but it is nowhere near ready yet to
handle the kind of growth we're seeing in Foodstar.
Foodstar is a function of a lot of things, a lot of new product activity, significant levels of advertising again which we
haven't started yet in Quero. We've gone into our third province. So we're in Guangdong, we're in Fujian and we've just
gone in Zhejiang and so I think, Foodstar, I mean we have a tiger by the tail.
The other thing on Foodstar that's really helped us is also the Guanghe brand, which is in the white bean curd market,
the red bean curd market is where the growth is and we are just now launching into the red bean curd market. We have
a lot of new product activity to take us in the other three segments on soy sauce. I mean Foodstar is a business frankly
that every time we have an update with the Chinese team, we take the number up and ask ourselves how we're going to
continue to supply it and that – I mean, I don't mean to be flip on that. That is a concern we have.
We are – this business is just growing so rapidly and we're still only in three provinces. We're hitting less than 200
million people in a country of 1.2 billion, but Quero itself in the second half will grow substantially faster as we infuse
marketing. Foodstar will continue its growth in the second half. And as I said at the outset, our emerging market
businesses in the second quarter were up 16% organically, they're up between 14% to 15% for the first half.
I expect our emerging market businesses organically to be up somewhere between 10% and 20% minimally on that
growth rate in the second half of the year as we lap the purchase of Foodstar, as we continue to drive significant growth
in China, we have a lot of innovation coming in China, a lot of innovation coming in Poland. We have launched cheese
sauce in Russia, which is doing spectacularly well. This is a product that actually is out used by – versus ketchup in
McDonald's in Russia which we supply and so there is just a lot of activity in the emerging markets. And while
obviously we do have some concerns about the economies in those markets, if anything, I think our growth rate in the
second half of the year will be dramatically better on these businesses. There is just a lot of activity.
The other thing in Quero we've done is we've infused new management and added capabilities to the business that we
do not have before and in fact interestingly enough the Brazilian team has been on the phone with the U.S. team giving
them insights on how to drive doy pack ketchup and how to drive other businesses like they do in Brazil. So I think
from those two acquisitions we feel pretty sanguine about where we're going.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Great. Thank you very much for that additional color. I'll pass it on.

Our next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning, Thilo.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good morning, everybody. Bill can you maybe give us a little bit more color on what you are
doing differently in Australia these days, what changed from last year and really where is the confidence coming from
that the business in Australia will improve in the second half?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Well, the good news is it has no place to go but up and it has been so bad although I will
tell you in the second quarter the bigger hit to the company in my view from an unexpected standpoint was in
Foodservice. We actually were anticipating the Australian issues we experienced.
As Art mentioned, we've changed the management team in Australia, we are doing an aggressive job of looking at cost,
we've shutdown the Girgarre factory, which is a tomato processing plant we've had in Australia for a number of years,
we've downsized two other facilities, we're reducing the number of SKUs, we have greatly improved our relationships
with the two retailers there, that's a tribute to Nigel Comer who came over from New Zealand to sort of dress up the
business in terms of trying to get it fixed.
We lap at the end of the third quarter the discontinuance of tuna by one of the two major customers last year, so we
don't have to deal with that after the month of January, so we'll get a big pick up going forward from that.
We've got a lot of innovation coming, and just a lot more clarity in terms of the focus. The reality on Australia, it's
almost come to the point that it's become fairly immaterial to us going forward, because it has taken such a hit.
A lot of activity in Australia, and I feel much better about the prospects for Australia going forward than I have in
several years. But the key thing is the improved relationships with the retailers and our ability to start working with
them on more efficient and effective promotion activity, and the focus on the right brands.
We are really renewing our focus in Australia on infant nutrition where we think there's significant opportunity and the
category is doing well. A lot of activity in new packaging and opportunities to reduce price points in beans and in soup
and then just a lot of activity across the business. And so, I think with the new leadership, we just – we've seen a – I
said to them on a call the other day, I've seen a bounce in their step that I haven't seen in the last couple of years.
So I think from that standpoint, the second half of the fiscal year in Australia will perform on a relative basis versus the
first half dramatically better. And the good news is that our expectations that you've seen, that we've shared with you in
terms of where we think the year will end are not really expecting a lot out of Australia in the second half.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Maybe if I can ask one quick follow-up, I mean, just listening to you talk about all the regions, all
the different categories that you compete in, it sounds like everything is already great or is just about to become really
great. Do you have any concerns about your business right now?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Sure. I have many sleepless nights. The concerns I have relate to the global economic
environment. The concerns I have relate to the productivity initiatives we're under doing, and will they become a
distraction? The concerns I have always relate to the retention of our management team in the businesses where we're
doing well like Europe, emerging markets, and in those kinds of businesses. I worry about complacency and people
taking it for granted.
Yes, there are a lot of areas, but I can tell you, Thilo, in the second half of the year, our organic sales are going to be up
dramatically more than they were in the first half of the year. And the thing that I think people are forgetting, in the
second half of the year, we lap two big labor situations last year, one in Latin America, one in the U.K. We've got a lot
of new product activity coming that we didn't have in the second half of last year.
We lap the SG&A where we really started to commence spending on Keystone aggressively towards the end of Q3 and
all through Q4. We had a lot of additional investments in other areas last year and as Art mentioned we obviously had

the Brazilian close in the month of April. So there is a lot of things going on in the second half of the year, but I don't
want anybody to misunderstand my comments. I am not at all sanguine about the prospects for the industry and about
our business without a lot of work.
We have good leadership in place now. But I can tell you and you should recognize that with the additional
productivity charges which are focused, you should assume, I am not going to detail yet where because employees
haven't been talked to, but you should assume they are focused on our problem businesses. This is going to continue to
be an ongoing struggle in an industry right now that's not being helped by the global economy, that is dealing with
significant commodity inflation which lessens for us on a relative basis in the second half. I mean just to give you some
perspective, the Foodservice inflation in the second quarter was over 11%, in the second half of the year it's about half
that and our pricing, we just took our third increase on Foodservice last week, will roll over into the next six months.
So I don't want anybody to misunderstand my comments. I do feel very good about our emerging market prospects and
I think 16% organic growth in the second quarter should not be taken for granted and I think we'll substantially
improve on those numbers in the second half given hopefully no repeat of our labor situation last year and a lot of new
product activity and the fact we lapped the Foodstar purchase. So there's just a lot of stuff going on, but as the people
that work for me, I am sure will be glad to tell you in a private moment, you should not think we go into these calls
with our business units with a big smile on our face.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: All right. We do appreciate that. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Good morning.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Bill, I wanted to follow up on, you listed a number of markets in Europe where volume
was up. I mean am I misunderstanding that? It looks like volume was reported down 2.9%, where was the significant
volume decline that offsets all those positive performances in those countries?
<A - William R. Johnson>: U.K. and Italy. But U.K. got more price than it did volume. They took significant pricing
at the end of Q1 through Q2 and as a result they continue to turnaround and spend some of that back, but volume was
down significantly in response to that, categories were down. And in Italy, the category, baby food category has
declined pretty significantly over the last three to six months and so we saw some volume decline there. We did take
some pricing, but it was not enough to offset the volume, but U.K. and Italy we're basically the only markets in Europe
to see volume down for the quarter.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Thank you. As far as you mentioned emerging market volume – revenue of 16%. Can I
give – you know you haven't historically want to get into emerging market volume, but can you give us a sense how
that splits between volume and pricing, I know there's been some significant price mix issues, currency issues.
<A - William R. Johnson>: No.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: That was easy. I'll put down my pen, thank you.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: There is both.
<A - William R. Johnson>: I think we're obviously getting a fair amount of price, but we also had very strong volume
in the quarter. And I think in the second, and let me put it to you this way, price was more than volume. In the second
half I think volume will be the same or close to price. So you should just assume more price than volume in the first
half.

The reason I don't like breaking it out is because these markets move all over the place on a quarterly basis depending
on the NPD, but volume was up, price was up. In the second half of the year, volume will be up commensurately more
than price in the emerging markets.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: And I guess just one last follow-up please. The reason I ask this is looking on a stacked
basis the way you guys reported, it looks like volume on a consolidated basis for the company is down something like
7% since 2008, so basically since before the recession and I mean certainly I understand exactly where the company is
going, but I'm wondering three years from now is volume going to continue to decline at that rate, would you expect, as
we sort of migrate from developed markets into emerging markets?
<A - William R. Johnson>: No, it will go the other way. In fact you'll see it go the other way in the second half of this
year as emerging markets become more and more important and as we plateau against some of the other businesses.
The bulk of the volume decline over the last couple of years has been related to Foodservice and Australia. I mean
Foodservice volume is – this is not new news – has been declining for three years.
Our expectations for Foodservice were that we would see a turnaround in the industry this year and that the structural
dynamics that have worked against us so aggressively would reverse, they have not. And so the bulk of that volume
decline in Q2 was Foodservice and to a lesser degree Australia from a volume perspective. But there is no doubt,
Jonathan, that you're going to see a significant shift. I mean one of the things, again I don't – I'm not trying to be
Solomon-ic here and I am not trying to express the wisdom of the ages.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Nor am I trying to be rancorous.
<A - William R. Johnson>: That sounds unusual for you, but one of the things that I think we need to all keep in mind
is the reason we have pushed so aggressively into these emerging markets is because of a recognition on the difficulty
of being able to drive sustained growth in some of these businesses going forward. And again in the second half you
will see – I mean the second half of our year is going to be interesting relative to the first half.
What you're going to see in the second half of the year is dramatically improved organic sales versus the first half and a
higher tax rate than you saw in the first half. So you're going to see almost the opposite situation, but Foodservice and
Australia, but again in my view going forward lesser on Australia, more on Foodservice is really where the focus has
got to be.
And if I break out Foodservice by the branded piece versus the non-branded piece, the branded piece is essentially flat
and where we are seeing the pressure in Foodservice is on proprietary brands that are made specifically for customers
where we've lost price leverage because of the environment and capacity available and in the categories where we don't
bring branded leverage. Similar situation exists in Australia.
And as I said, U.K. volume was down significantly and it goes all over. I think in Q3 you'll be interested to see what
U.K. volume is. I'm not going to tell you, but I think you'll get an interesting perspective as we come back next quarter
and report. But, again, there is no doubt that our shift into emerging markets was not done on an ad hoc opportunistic
basis. It was done strategically and with intent, because I will tell you my own view is that the developed world is
going to get increasingly difficult in which to operate just because of the concentration of retailers in all these markets,
the difficulty in categories, the pressure consumers are feeling, the ethnic and demographic shifts occurring in all these
markets. And so you're going to see us push more aggressively and with greater alacrity into these emerging markets
because we have to and that's why.
So I think nothing we've seen this year other than, I will say, Foodservice, has surprised us. Foodservice has
disappointed me, because I expected the industry to turn, it has not.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Jonathan, the other thing I'd point out is the SKU rationalization we've done over the
last few years on a very conscious basis, particularly in these developed markets, particularly in places like
Foodservice. As we have gotten the focus more and more on our top 15 brands. So we've tried to cull the herd, if you
will, in some of these smaller brands and get refocused on the top 15 brands which have grown nicely.

<A - William R. Johnson>: The only other thing I'll remind you of Jonathan, even with the volume declines, we've
had 26 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth and we've made some conscious tradeoff between price and
volume, but again, I come back to my comments. The developed those who are not pushing aggressively into emerging
markets are going to wake up one day and find out that the world left them behind.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Yes. And Jonathan we can follow up later today, but I'm not showing volume down for the
company that far. The only way I could get there is if you're including divestitures. So volume actually has been, I
think, flat to slightly up if you include, particularly the '08 year so. Anyway, but we'll be happy to follow-up with you.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA. Please proceed.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Good morning.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Good morning.
<A - William R. Johnson>: Good morning.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: I want to ask on the productivity, the new productivity plan. I think the original you announced
in May you had a 2.5 year payback, could you just confirm that you're still on track regarding that and then should we
assume sort of a similar payback on the new plan given that you're not giving a lot of details and I understand why, but
if you can help us with what we should think about there?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Yes. To your point, Diane, we are on track with the plans that we laid out, certainly the
projects we talked to you about back in May, as I mentioned, are on track in terms of cost benefits and timing. The new
programs, which we won't go into much, probably should generate an incremental $15 million or so of pre-tax profit on
an annualized basis over time. So we expect a good solid return out of those programs as well and more to follow on
that later.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay. Can I just for a clarification on the new products that you announced today in terms of
the smaller pack types you said, margin neutral to maybe slightly positive, but is there – how should we think about the
top line impact? Do you report your volume in tonnage or units, and does that have a – will that have an impact on your
volume number on the top line?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Diane, you don't have enough time for me to explain the machinations. It's dollarized
volume basically.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: I have a lot of time.
<A - William R. Johnson>: Then Meg will be glad to take this. It's dollarized volume and the impact on the top line
should be favorable, providing that the sales are incrementally – that they are gap fillers in terms of places and people
we are not reaching and right now our portfolio tends to skew more middle, upper income. We are very
underdeveloped in the dollar stores and so these are opportunities for us to reach a segment of the population that
historically we have underserved, and so I think from that standpoint this should represent some incremental upside for
us going forward.
I think the other thing is I also said and I want to be clear on this, that not all of the items; there are some exceptions to
the margin enhancing and margin neutral. I won't get into specifics, but there are a few exceptions to those, but we
should make up for that in terms of the incrementality. I mean, we haven't sold beans in this country in – I can't even
remember the last time we sold beans here, and I've been here almost 30 years, and I think the last time we sold beans
was maybe the 70s or early 80s in the U.S. and so we tested; it has done very well. We have a whole line of products
like that coming.

And I think as we get into the third quarter call, we'll be able to specify and detail for you the items. But I think you'll
find them very interesting frankly some of them had me scratching my head as we looked at it, but the North American
company and European companies in particular have gotten my messages regarding my concern over the top line in
developed markets and the fact that we need to serve these underserved population segments.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay. Thanks for the additional details.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi, thank you.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Hey Rob.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: How are you doing? My question had to do about the supply chain – if you look historically,
Heinz has not been a very CapEx intensive company, CapEx has been pretty much in line with D&A. We've had
examples of other staples companies that have had supply chain problems recently. Bill, as you go through the supply
chain and are now closing more facilities, is that increasing the amount of capacity or the amount of utilization that the
other plants have to take on in the absence of those and what have you done at those plants to make sure that they are
capable with up-to-date machines to handle the increased load?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Actually, Rob, I'm glad you asked the question. I think all of you know how I feel about
CapEx in this industry. I think it's been abused over the years. I think it's been spent needlessly to add capacity and do
other things that have not given consumers return or shareholders returns and haven't helped consumers. In our case,
one of the rules I outlined at the outset of this initiative was I was not simply picking up equipment and moving it from
one edifice to another.
So in other words, most of this – there are maybe two small exceptions, most of this volume will shift from factories
that were grossly underutilized into factories that were slightly underutilized without the need for a lot of CapEx in
terms of new equipment.
Now there are a few exceptions. Closing Girgarre required us to do some things in New Zealand and moving some
things out of the couple of the factories in Australia allowed us – forced us to put some capital in New Zealand which I
did not like doing, but I can tell you and I am sure Art and Meg will tell you in a private moment that this didn't come
without a great deal of angst. I hate these kinds of initiatives. I don't like doing them. I think they are abused.
I think we are a company that was criticized for that for a number of years. So one of the rules I outlined for everybody
was I was not simply picking up or buying new equipment to put in another factory. If we could not take the volume
and move to a facility that was underutilized or had excess capacity, it was going to be very difficult to convince me to
close some of these facilities. That is in essence what we have done.
In a couple occasions we've had very low utilized factories where we have decided that our customer relationships
coming out of those factories or the cost to serve a customer were not conducive to the kinds of margin and returns we
wanted and so we've shifted away products from a few of those customers and from a few of those businesses and as a
result are not really being required to ship much of anything from a utilization standpoint.
Our CapEx for the first half of the year is up about $53 to $55 million. Our inventory is up about a $130 million and
those are the big uses of cash in the first half of the year. Rest assured that I am not happy about that and I have made it
abundantly clear to my team and the supply chain that this isn't just simply about, gee, I now have – I had 80 buildings,
now I have 75 buildings. This is a about getting a lot better and more efficient and I think we'll be there.
So the good news for us is while these things are always somewhat distracting, the reality is they have not required us
to do anything above the norm to protect the safety and quality of our products and as a consequence, [knock knock],
knock on wood, we have not suffered the same kinds of issues that others have.

<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: The other thing I think, that this allows us to do is really focus our time, attention and
resources on those remaining plants. So when you've got very low utilization plants, that's not helpful from a focus
standpoint. So we've got a very stringent balance score card in that we monitor quality, safety, sustainability along with
the usual cost and other measures. So we feel like we've got a very good program in place and by strengthening the
focus on the remaining plants, I think that will be good news overall.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Can I just ask – do you guys visit the plants frequently to make sure that you've got good
safety measures in place? And what kind of process do you have to do that on an ongoing basis?
<A - William R. Johnson>: We have an ongoing QRMP process. We have the best safety scores of any company in
our industry. We review them with the Board twice a year. We have a safety group as a part of our risk management
process. We have a quality group that's headquartered in the U.K., but it's our global group that visits every single
factory and also spends a lot of time in the new facilities. And I have to tell you, I think I made the comment earlier,
our people have just revisited the Quero factory and are coming back raving.
I mean Quero has something we don't have anywhere else in the world, and that's a biomass generator, which we're
using excess sugarcane now to fire up and saving us a ton of money, but if we can figure out a way to put cornhusks
through there, we can literally get free energy in our biggest factory. So there's a lot of activity. I will tell you, Rob, and
people that have worked for me a long time know, safety and quality are the two single biggest issues that I focus our
team on all the time. I think employees have the right to expect to work in a safe environment and I think our brands
are only as good as the quality reputation we have.
And we sit with our Board twice a year and the Corporate Social Responsibilities Committee and give them a detailed
update on this. And in my own personal goals of which I have four, 25% of my own personal goals are related to
quality and safety. So you can be assured that we take this highly seriously, all of this reports into Mike Milone, who,
in addition his operating responsibilities, then brings an operating mindset to ensuring that these are areas of great focus
and detail and believe me, this is one of the things that goes through every one of the single productivity initiatives that
we approve.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Thank you so much.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. Thank you, this is kind of a quick housekeeping question for Art. I just, I do quick math,
and I know you said originally you were going to get $0.05 to $0.07 FX benefit for the year. It looks like already you
have $0.08, and then if I just use like-for-like tax rates from last year, it looks like you've already gotten about $0.09
this year in tax benefit. So really I just want to see if you could provide some type of detailed tax estimate for Q3 and
Q4, one. And then two is there any updated guidance for EPS with FX?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: What we're talking about, looking to the goals, they are constant currency, so set aside
the currency. I think as you see where our currency rates are at now, yes, we have gotten I don't know $0.07, $0.08
something like that on a year-to-date basis. We really don't expect to get anything more out of currency over the back
half of the year.
Now, you tell me where the pound and euro go, and where the economies go, it's always a tough question, but at this
point we don't expect much from currency in that regard. And as Bill mentioned from a tax standpoint we'll actually see
a tax rate that's probably in line or slightly higher over the back half of the year, certainly as it compares to last year.
And as I mentioned the key is that for this fiscal year and frankly for next fiscal year we expect to have a mid-20s kind
of tax rate.

to – if we can get them brief because I know there's a lot of you in queue.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hey, everybody. First question is the $1.15 billion in operating cash flow that you
mentioned. Does that include or exclude the charges for the restructuring and the updated figures there?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: It excludes it. As I said, we'd be $1 billion reported and $1.15 billion excluding the
charges.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Second, I think you had mentioned, if my memory is correct on the acquisitions,
Quero and Foodstar, that those would be kind of earnings neutral for the year. Is that kind of still how you see it or are
those actually contributing now versus and that's kind of offsetting some of the other challenges?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Yes. I think that's a fair question. In the first half they contributed. We will spend a lot of
marketing money in the second half on Quero. We didn't spend any in the first half until we got the business and the
capacity where we wanted, and I think for the year you should assume, Eric, they will be neutral to slightly better.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Last thing, at the Analyst day you gave fiscal '13 guidance. I mean, are you kind of
withdrawing that or at this point we're just – it's just too volatile a world to comment or how do we think about that
$3.60 to $3.70 number?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Right now I'm not saying anything about it. I don't see – it's way too early to draw any
conclusions in terms of making any changes. So right now I think you should assume that we're holding to that number
until I tell you something else, but we're not going to give you guidance until May, and we never do, Eric, and you
know that. I get pressed at CAGNY and I get pressed in the Q3 call, and it is a volatile world and things are changing
and so in May we'll give you updated guidance, but right now I just don't see any reason to move off that guidance.
But I want to be clear that that doesn't mean we will or we won't, I'm just saying that right now it's just way too early.
And our second half is going to be pretty good, I think, and so I hope I am not proven wrong, but certainly based on
where I expect us to be from an earnings standpoint sequentially better in Q3 and Q4 and where I expect us to be from
a sales standpoint sequentially better and good organic sales in the second half and where I expect us to be in an
emerging markets and U.K perspective. I just think right now it's just too early to make any changes to it.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Have a nice Thanksgiving. Thank you.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: You too, Eric.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: All right, time for one more.

And our last question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. First quick housekeeping item, I noticed on
slide 55 you guys showed an FX benefit to EBIT of roughly $8 million, but at pre-tax it was $15 million, what is that
$7 million delta?

<A - William R. Johnson>: I can tell you what's on page 56 and on page 55, but I don't -or 54, but I don't know what's
on page 55. So we are having to pull that out to take a look at it.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: I suspect it's gain on transaction or translation hedges, currency hedges, would be my
guess.
<A - Margaret R. Nollen>: Yes. That's exactly what it is.
<Q - Jason English>: Okay. Thank you. And on sharper price points, your price point initiative with your innovation, I
think this is something you talked about when we went into the recession, it was an initiative you guys were going to
pursue. What's different this time versus then? Is it more breadth of product? Your ability to penetrate different
channels or maybe you can just elaborate on that?
<A - William R. Johnson>: Yes. We never did it. The U.S. has been very slow to react and so you'll see most of it
starting in the third quarter, late in the third quarter and so there is nothing different about it. It's just it has taken us
longer in the U.S. to get to where we need to be and you will see a flurry of activity in Q3 that in my view and the U.S.
company knows how I feel about this, in my view it should have happened in Q2. So there is really nothing different
about it, Jason. It's just a delay.
<Q - Jason English>: Okay. And one final question, it's a quick one. I just want to make sure I heard an answer to
another question correctly, it sounds like this mid-20s tax rate is sustainable at least into next year?
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Yes. Yes, that's the way we're viewing it, so yes, sort of mid-20-ish this year and next.
<Q - Jason English>: Okay. Thanks a lot guys. I will pass it on. Or, I guess I am the end. So have a good day.
<A - Arthur B. Winkleblack>: Thanks.
William R. Johnson
Thank you all for participating. I know it's a tough time of the year. I do hope that you'll appreciate the fact that we
spend the time with you that we do. As you know, there has never been a question asked that we won't answer, there
has never been a topic brought up we won't address. I have an opinion on everything including the Steelers and the
Bengals if anybody is interested. So have a happy Thanksgiving and a happy holiday and we continue to appreciate
your interest in the company and your patience and forbearance with us.
Margaret R. Nollen
All right. We will be seeing several of you in the comings weeks. Heinz is expected to report third quarter earnings on
February 17, the Friday before CAGNY, so that's new. We will then be presenting at CAGNY on Wednesday
afternoon, February 22, and additionally we will be presenting at CAGE in London on Tuesday, March 20.
With that, Mary Ann and I will be around all day to take any further questions and follow-up calls. The main number
for Investor Relations 412-456-6020 and we want to wish you all a warm and wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.
Thanks, everyone. Have a great day.
