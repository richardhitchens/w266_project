Thanks, Mark.
Our third quarter results were consistent with our expectations, and included a number of important milestones.
Revenue and earnings per share both set new records, with strong performances from the PC and the Data Center
groups. The trends we observed in the PC market last quarter continued with stability in mature markets offset by
ongoing declines in emerging markets.
The PC Client group launched Core M, a new family of products with full core performance in both compute and
graphics in a fanless design, enabling break through designs and form factors. The first of these systems will be
available by the end of this month.
In the Data Center, we saw double-digit revenue growth across all four major market segments. Enterprise grew 11%.
Networking grew 16%. And HPC and cloud service providers grew 22% and 34% respectively.
We also launched the new Xeon E5 processor, formally known as Grantley. This product family provides leadership
features and performance for compute, storage, and network work flows. Formally launched just five weeks ago, E5 is
already 10% of our DP or two-socket volume.
In the Mobile and Communications group, losses declined sequentially, and that's a trend we need to see continue.
Tablet volume was nearly 15 million units, and we remain on track to our 40 million unit goal for 2014.
Third parties estimate that we are now the second largest tablet SoC vendor worldwide, and the largest among
merchant suppliers. In addition, Samsung chose our Cat 6 LTE modem with carrier aggregation, known as the 7260 for
its recently announced Galaxy Alpha and Galaxy Note 4.
The strategic importance of these capabilities continues to grow. Our LTE technology, which we originally developed
for phones, is becoming increasingly valuable in tablets and even PCs as wireless wide area network connectivity
becomes increasingly common. We estimate, for example, that by 2018, the rate of baseband attached to tablets will
roughly double, and in PCs will rise to more than 15%.
Overall, we've made some good progress during this quarter. Yet, we have important work left to do. Within our
factory network, 14-nanometer yields improve meaningfully, but we're behind where we expected to be. These
challenges highlight just how difficult it has become to ramp advanced process technology.
I'm most pleased that our strategy for growth is beginning to yield results across a remarkably wide range of products.
We sold record volumes of PC, server, Internet of Things, phone and tablet products. The diversity and scale of our
products uniquely position us across the breadth of devices that compute and connect. Importantly, our results
demonstrate that we are building on our success in the PC and Data Center segments to successfully pursue adjacent
opportunity.
These businesses are the source of tremendous intellectual property. And that IP creates valuable and important
synergies that position us to compete in an increasingly diverse computing market. Let me share a few examples.
At IDF, I showed the world's thinnest tablet; a Dell Venue with Intel RealSense technology. It has an industry first 3D
camera that enables features like; after the fact focusing, and a host of capabilities that have the potential to change how
people engage with their photography. That technology was first developed for PCs, and was adopted for tablets. In this
case, we're in a position to differentiate in tablets precisely, because we invested in next generation technology for PC.

Another example of IP synergy is the Atom microarchitecture. We first brought Atom to market as an extension of the
PC product family. We've purposely evolved that IP to the point that it now spans from smartphones to tablets and
mainstream PCs and from storage, networking, and compute devices in the Data Center to the Internet of Things.
Lastly, I'm excited about the moves we're making to engage the ecosystem in new and potentially disruptive ways.
We're establishing our position and capabilities in emerging sectors like wearables before they become mainstream.
The Data Center team is customizing our Xeon products for specific customers and workloads. Custom SKUs now
number roughly 35, and over the last year, volume from custom SKUs has grown at 3X the rate of our off-the-shelf
product.
But we're also striking groundbreaking strategic agreement. Our recently announced collaborations with Rockchip and
more recently Spreadtrum will provide new sources of innovation and a new set of partners that will work with us to
scale Intel architecture.
Our vision is that, if it's smart and connected, it's best with Intel. The breadth of our results this quarter, our progress
against our strategic goals, and the changes we're making in our approach to end markets leave me convinced that our
strategy is working.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Brian.
The third quarter was the highest revenue in the company's history, with overall results demonstrating solid financial
growth as we approach the end of this year.
Focusing on our third quarter results, revenue came in at $14.6 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Both the PC Client
group and the Data Center group achieved better growth than we expected at the beginning of the quarter.
PC Client group revenue was up 9% from a year ago. We saw PC Client group platform unit volumes grow 15% year
over year. And inclusive of tablets, we saw almost 30% unit growth. Of note, our notebook platform units grew over
20% year over year, as we are enabling innovative two-in-one devices and growing our market segment share with Bay
Trail at lower price point.
Our Data Center group revenue grew 16% from a year ago, with platform volumes up 6% and platform average selling
prices up 9%. We are seeing robust growth rates across all the segments of our Data Center business.
Operating income for the third quarter was $4.5 billion, up $1 billion and 30% from a year ago. Operating income in
the PC Client group was $4.1 billion. And in the Data Center group, operating income was $1.9 billion. The Mobile
and Communications group had $1 billion of loss, which is an $81 million improvement from the second quarter.
The company generated $3.3 billion of net income for the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago. And earnings per
share was $0.66, up 14% from a year ago.
Our net inventory levels rose modestly quarter over quarter, as we were efficiently managing capacity while ramping
Broadwell on 14-nanometer. The worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate
in anticipation of the fourth quarter retail cycle.
Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margin of 65% was up 0.5 point from the second quarter and down one
point from our guidance. The increase from the second quarter was primarily due to lower platform unit cost on
22-nanometer and higher platform volume, mostly offset by higher production costs on 14-nanometer products.
Spending came in at $4.8 billion, $100 million lower than our outlook. The overall decrease in spending was driven by
efficiencies and one-time events like capital asset sales, partially offset by higher profit-dependent expenses.

The business continued to generate significant cash, with over $5.7 billion of cash from operations in Q3. We
purchased $2.4 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends, and repurchased over $4 billion of stock.
Total cash balance at the end of the quarter was roughly $16 billion, down approximately $1.7 billion from the prior
quarter. Our net cash balance, total cash less debt, is approximately $2 billion. And inclusive of our other longer-term
investments, it is more than $6 billion. This is down by almost $2 billion from the second quarter.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.7 billion,
up 1% from the third quarter. This forecast is in line with the historical average seasonal increase for the fourth quarter.
We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the fourth quarter to be 64%. The one point decrease
from the third quarter is driven by higher platform unit costs, higher factory startup costs, primarily offset by lower
production cost on 14-nanometer.
As we enter the fourth quarter, we are seeing our strategy play out in our financial results. In the third quarter, we grew
revenue 8% and grew operating profit 30% versus last year. We also shipped over 100 million units for the first time in
our history across a widening range of devices.
In the Client segment, we are seeing robust growth in the PC segment as a result of innovation, enabling lower price
points. We've grown to be the largest merchant supplier of tablet silicon, and we are winning large designs with our
LTE communications product. And our Internet of Things business is ramping Atom-based products and growing.
In the data center, we continue to innovate our products, bringing increased differentiation and value to our customers.
And underlying all of this is our manufacturing leadership. We have led the world to 14-nanometer and plan to do the
same with 10-nanometer process technology.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.

All right, moving on to Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask one question and just one
follow-up if you have one. Jamie, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Hi, guys. Congrats on the strong results. One bigger picture question, and then a smaller
picture one for my second follow-up, please. On the bigger picture one, your units in the PC Client group being up 15%
year-over-year, can you talk a little bit about what you think is driving that in the PC market that, I think most of the
third-party data provider says is flat? And do you think that delta can actually stay that large for a bit longer?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Hey, Ross. This is Stacy. I'll start it, and then I think Brian will fill in some of the color –
commentary about what we're seeing in the end market. So yes, we've seen some of the third-party data. When you
adjust for some of the other form factors, like core-based tablets and things, I'd say our view of the end market
compared to say an IDC isn't terribly different in terms of the growth rate. We would both say, it's relatively flat
year-on-year in the third quarter.
In terms of our billing results, I think there are a couple of things driving that. First, we saw in Q2, that we gained a
relatively significant amount of share once everybody had reported. If I had to branch predict it, that we probably
continue to gain some share in Q3. As is our usual, we'll wait to see all the third-party results come in to know for sure,
but our sense is that, we gain some share in the third quarter, so that helps.

And then, we're also seeing our customers putting in place a normal supply line in anticipation of a consumer-led
seasonal fourth quarter, and that's different than what we saw a year ago, where people were managing inventory levels
very low in anticipation of a very muted fourth quarter. So I think, the combination of those two things has our billing
results ahead of the IDC, but feels like, it's pretty appropriate based on where I sit.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So I think, Stacy, you covered it well. I think – from what we've seen, probably it covers
most of the gap between the two numbers.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Great. And I guess, as my follow-up, well, it's not really meaningful to the revenue side, it
surely is to the bottom line, and that's your Mobile Communications group. Can you talk a little bit about how we
should expect that contra-revenue impact to trend over time?
And I believe in the past, you've said that, you didn't think you'd get to profitability next year. But any sort of clues that
you could provide on how we should expect either the revenue or the profitability to trend as we get into next year?
Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. I'll start, and then Stacy can kind of jump in, because how you look at, how we're
adjusting the products and engineering is a little bit ahead of where you'd see the financials move. And so, we'll give
you one of the two sides of that equation.
So from a product standpoint, you saw throughout this year we did a very good job of – as we figure out how to get into
this market and work with our customers and partners, how to reduce the cost. Just on the general [indiscernible]
(15:44) picking the right P-mix, the right board layouts, reducing our part count. All of those kinds of – just I'll call
fundamental engineering efforts is what we're focused on. As we got to the end of the year, then we brought out the
Bay Trail cost reduce part, which is really focused on – the first part of that was really focused on this segment of the
market.
We're starting to see systems come onto the shelves as we go through the holiday season with Bay Trail CR, and that
part will start to have really a designed in cost reduced effort.
We said that, we'd have SoFIA, the 3G version out at the end of this year. We're on schedule. We've got SoFIA in the
labs running. It's starting its validation effort. We said, we'd have SoFIA LTE in the first half of next year. That's on
schedule, and then we announced several partnerships. Two main ones: Rockchip and then more recently Spreadtrum,
which are focused around the SoFIA architecture. Bringing parts for this mobile space really designed by people who
are in that ecosystem are very cost efficient, and are connected into both the China market and the worldwide market.
You'll see those parts come out as we go through next year.
So when we look at the end of next year, we'll look at a model – SoFIA is built to have no contra-revenue, and so when
you go through the next year, again, it will be somewhat mix dependent or part shift of the mix, and Stacy will talk to
you a little bit about that. That's why it's a bit hard to predict exactly when, but you'll see us mix the Bay Trail cost
reduce, Cherry Trail, and then a lot of SoFIA coming in, in both the tablet and phone space. And that really is what
drives the contra out of this system.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes. So, Ross, let me just add, as Brian said, the way the contra accounting works is, the contra
dollars that we recognized were associated with the platforms as they actually ship, and so what you're seeing right now
is the majority of our shipments are products that are carrying a fairly high contra dollar per unit.
As we ramp the Bay Trail CR and then the SoFIA products, you'll start to see the contra dollars per unit come down.
I'm not going to provide a specific forecast at this time for 2015. I'll stand behind the prior statements. We plan to make
a substantial improvement in the profitability of the segment next year, but don't get too far out ahead of your skis.
We're not at the point that we'll be profitable next year. It is still our goal, but it will take us little time to get there.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Great, thank you.

The next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Hey, thanks for taking my question, and nice quarter. Stacy, I just want to follow up. You talked
about the more normal kind of supply chain this year, helping Q2, Q3. You're actually not guiding to a down
December. So it seems like you're staying at that elevated rate. I mean, just some thoughts on seasonality. You also
have Broadwell who kind of launched it at an atypical point of the year. Is there any sort of catch up before you ramp
Broadwell into late first half next year?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So I want to make sure I'm answering the right question. You had one question on seasonality.
And I'm not sure, I understood the Broadwell question. So let me get into the seasonality, and I'll give it back over to
you.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Okay.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Or if you want to clarify it now, that's also fine.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: I just was pointing out that you're launching a platform, and kind of – usually you launch it for
back-to-school and holiday, and it's coming – the majority of the Broadwell SKU is coming kind of in the first half of
the year, so it's just atypical timing, so just thinking about seasonality. And then just wanted to clarify your comments;
you said the supply chain was building ahead, but it doesn't seem like it's pulling back, particularly much in Q4, just
thoughts there.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes, so just to clarify on the supply chain and seasonality for Q4, I wouldn't term it as building
ahead. What I'd say is a – appropriate amount of inventory in anticipation of a seasonal Q4. And if you go back a year
to Q3 of 2013, if you recall, we were talking about unusually low inventory levels based on our customers; I think I
used the word muted, having muted expectations about the fourth quarter.
Today, I'd say they have normal expectations about the third quarter. And our guidance for Q4 would be consistent
with that. We're guiding 1% up, if you take the midpoint of our guidance, that's kind of the seasonality we've seen over
the last several years, so it's pretty much in line with normal seasonality. In terms of Broadwell, and the impact on 2015
seasonality, I'm not providing a forecast yet for 2015. We'll talk more about 2015 when we get to the investor meeting,
which is just a few weeks away.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Okay, then just a follow-up on the gross margin. Given your full year guidance, you were
looking at a step down in December. Now it looks like the gross margin sustains quite nicely. Just what changed in that
outlook? And does any of those factors carry into first half next year?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes, so as you rightly pointed out, the gross margin forecast for the year is pretty much on. We
were a little light in Q3. We look a little better in Q4 based on the algebra that I gave you in last call. In essence, we're
seeing more of the 14-nanometer costs coming through in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, and that's why you
see that shift between quarters, and the year staying on track. And again, I'll sound a little bit like a broken record; in
terms of 2015, we're only a few weeks away from the investor meeting, and that's a great forum for us to talk about
longer term trends. So we're going to hold off on the 2015 questions until we get to the November investor meeting.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Thanks so much.

The next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Great. Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution.
DCG was up strongly in Q2, and again here in Q3, up 16% year-to-year, strong growth in all end markets. Do you
expect the breadth of spend to continue across the different customer base in Q4? I know cloud tends to be a bit lumpy.

Page 7 of 14
And then, do you expect to see continued double-digit growth in DCG in the fourth quarter?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. This is Brian. I think what we said was, we believe we can grow this business around
15% year-over-year. And you kind of framed it correctly that we do – especially in the cloud space, it tends to be
lumpy. If you take a look at what we're projecting for the fourth quarter, we're projecting right in line for that 15% for
the year. And it's got the normal mix of what we see across the enterprise and the cloud, and the HPC and that other
Data Centers. So we're not – we're expecting Q4 to kind of just progress from Q3. And then we're not changing our
forward-looking, what we believe we can grow this business at.
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Great, thank you for that. And then, I guess part of the reason for the lower gross margin profile
in the fourth quarter is the ramp of 14-nanometer across the multiple fabs. I think you said on the last call, take a couple
of quarters to ramp up to full manufacturing capability, after which time you would see ramp cost starting to come
down. Is that how you still see it?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yes, I think I said, you see a highly elevated cost for a couple quarters, and then it starts
coming down. But it takes a period of time for it to come down. That's the normal trend. We're certainly seeing those
elevated costs in Q3. You can see it in the gross margin lead time. You'll still see high sell through cost of those
products are selling through in the fourth quarter. In 2015, I'll get a lot more specific on some of the unit cost trends
next month at the investor meeting.
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator
The next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jim V. Covello>: Hey, guys. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. You guys referenced the opportunity for consumer
buying in the fourth quarter. We saw really good demand in the third quarter from consumers, driven by the new
products that you and Microsoft combined to introduce. They were great new products and the consumer uptake of
them is very good. Do you think that impacts the fourth quarter versus third quarter buying at all?
And then, I'll make my follow-up as part of this question. Do you see the iPhone 6 cannibalizing any kind of the
notebook demand, just given the price points are the same? Obviously, the functionality isn't the same. But given that
most of the top ten selling notebooks are right around that same price point as the notebooks (sic) [iPhone 6], do you
think there's any cannibalism going on there as you get to the fourth quarter? Is that part of the guidance? Thanks a lot.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Let me start just on a general basis, and then Stacy can jump in. I'd say in general, again,
we're predicting or we're forecasting a fourth quarter that's seasonal.
So what we saw in the third quarter plus as you said about 1% growth as we go into the fourth quarter, which is pretty
typical if you go back over the last three years of what we see Q3 to Q4. So we're seeing that same trend in consumer
being flat to a normal year's performance hold through the fourth quarter.
Your question about iPhone 6, no, we don't really see – typically we see a separation in that space between consumers
going out and buying phones versus PCs. And as you say, there's a big difference in the functionality and usage models
between those two. And I think people, when they want the usage model and the functionality of a PC, they look at that
cost. And as you said, it's very similar cost. I didn't say this is a really good value for the functionality I'm getting. And
so we typically haven't seen a cross between those two from a demand standpoint.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And I'd just come back and say I have a little issue with the question. I don't think we saw
extraordinary consumer demand in the third quarter. If you go back to the strength of end markets, I think we're pretty
aligned with the third parties. It was pretty flat. From an end market standpoint, it was pretty flat. We didn't see
anything unusual there. What we saw was some share gain, which caused us to have a nice bump in billings. And we

<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Good afternoon, guys, congratulations on the strong quarter. First question is for Stacy. Stacy,
when you look at the revenue in the PC Client group, I think year to date you're up about $1.1 billion, and yet operating
profits are up I think about twice that. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you're doing in OpEx in
that business around profitability. And I guess how much more do you have left to drive profitability in the core PC
Client group?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So I'll answer the question in regards to this year. And again, I'll probably hold off on a
discussion about 2015 until we get to the investor meeting. But I think what you see going on this year is probably
three things that are all contributing to the operating profit. First, they've got a great product portfolio. And so when
you look at where we're seeing growth, we're seeing nice growth in the Core i5, Core i7 segments of the market. And
then we've brought in some really good technology that's got a good cost structure at the low end of the market that
gives them a nice cost structure and allows them to go after unit growth. So I think this really all starts with the product
portfolio.
Adding to that, I think we have a couple of tailwinds on gross margin in 2014. Our 22-nanometer processors are just
spectacular, and we're at the low end of the cycle in terms of how much startup cost flows through and the PC Client
group picks up the majority of those.
And then I also think the leadership of that team has done a nice job of prioritizing investments. We've been making
investments in some new areas where Brian and I thought it was pretty important. And so they've had a bit of a
constrained budget, and I think they've done a nice job of bringing out technology that really helps their business while
prioritizing within a pretty constrained budget. So I'd say that's what's happened in 2014. The 2015 discussion will be
part of the investor meeting next month.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: That's helpful, Stacy. And then as my follow-up for Brian; Brian, you guys have been talking
about a stabilizing PC market for the last couple of quarters. But over the last couple of quarters you've been leaning
little more heavily on developed versus developing and corporate versus consumer. When you look at the Q3 results
and especially on the ASP line and your guidance for Q4, is this just seasonal consumer strength, or do you actually
think that both in the developed and developing market you can now start talking about turning a corner relative to
tablet cannibalization and perhaps PC stabilization in emerging market consumer?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: I think what we would phrase this as or what we did phrase this as it's seasonal. And so
we're not saying that there is a – in fact, we said that the consumer we believe is flat. There's seasonal growth as we
move into the fourth quarter, and we're still seeing that mature versus emerging market trends that we talked about in
the previous quarters where the mature markets are a bit stronger, the U.S. especially, Western Europe though as well;
and the emerging markets, China, Latin America, and some of the others, are still soft. And so those trends are
continuing. And when you look at the consumer as we go into the fourth quarter we've forecasted seasonal growth for
the consumer side.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Perfect. Thanks, guys, congratulations again.

The next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Great, thank you. I wonder if I could just push a little bit more on the gap between sort of 15%
unit growth versus the market. I think you attributed it to three factors: to share gains, to the Core-based tablet and to
the inventory environment a year ago. Which of those factors do you think is the most important just because there's
such a wide gap between the numbers?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I actually think they're all sizeable numbers and it's not unusual for us to have those kinds of
differences from the third parties. But I think coming back to the prior question to Brian, we've had sustained share
gains I think over a period of time. So it's probably a slightly larger number. And then kind of a normal amount of
inventory we've put in the system. You can do that math with the third element being the Core-based tablets, which I
think is going to be relatively smaller.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Okay, great. And then just to understand the tablet differential. If it's got a – anything that has a
Bay Trail-M or a Core is considered a PC unit the way that you're classifying, is that right?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: It's more of the Core. So products that have a Core, I use the Microsoft Surface as a great
example. We classify that in the PC side.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Got it.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: That's probably the cleanest example...
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And IDC would classify that in a different category. And so that's an adjustment you always
have to make. I'd also say there's a piece. We tend to have a difference with the third parties on an ongoing basis and I
think it comes down to the breadth of tracking in the white box deep in the emerging market, the Tier 3, Tier 4 cities;
very hard to get your arms around that holistically. And so we tend to see over long periods of times we'll have a
slightly higher billing number than they show as the market number. And best we can tell, it's just hard to get your arms
around the diversity of the market when you get into the white box channel of emerging markets. So that's always
going to be a difference between us.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Great, thank you very much.

The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm sorry to harp on it, but I want to go back to
this as well. So I understand you're saying, for your own business you think consumer is kind of seasonal and I guess
flattish for the year in Q4, but obviously you must -you and I guess your channel partners must be expecting a much
bigger ramp of consumer in Q4 given how much inventory you must have built into the channel in Q3.
So I guess how do you get comfort that, that consumer sell-through is going to be there in Q4? And what's going to be
the consequence if that consumer sell-through is not there? Is the corporate uptake still there? Is that going to be
enough to offset or like how do we, I guess, judge the potential scenarios around consumer demand in Q4 and the
sensitivity of your guidance around that?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: That's lot of different questions in one. Let me take a shot here, though. I'd say first the
inventory – this is Stacy, by the way and Brian will jump in. But I'd say at the inventory levels what we see is – when
you look at in terms of weeks of inventory, it's appropriate levels of inventory. It's kind of right in the range of what
we'd expect.

So you termed it as excessive inventory, I think. We're not seeing that. As always, if demand doesn't materialize, then
customers adjust their buying pattern and bring inventory levels down. But what we see is kind of normal levels of
inventory in anticipation of a seasonal Q4. That's what our customers think will happen. And that's, I think, what we
think will happen in terms of our seasonal results. You also had a question on kind of consumer versus enterprise and
the strength of enterprise, I'll let Brian talk about those market trends.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: First I just think I'll go back to the inventory comment as well. We do what I believe is a
really good job of watching our whole supply chain, from – below us, looking at things like on the mother board
ordering pattern at the ODMs in Asia and what's happening there to the pulls from our inventory hubs. Remember, a lot
of our – more than half of our products ships out of the hubs now and we actually control the inventory on it, so that the
OEM pulls it at the last moment of use. So we see the actual usage rates there to what's flying off the shelves at the
point-of-sale. So we're watching all of those and I think we've demonstrated in the past, back in the variety of market
moves that we'll react very quickly.
So as Stacy said, the current inventory is very typical for this 1% seasonal growth that we're forecasting for the fourth
quarter. And I'm comfortable. And I'm also even more comfortable that we'll be watching it. And if something did
happen, we could adjust in either direction.
The comment about consumer versus enterprise; as we said, we forecasted a standard seasonal consumer. So we're
expecting not a great holiday season, not a bad holiday season, a standard holiday season for the consumer in the PC
segment. We continue to see enterprise strength. It's shifting. It was strong in desktops earlier in the year. It's kind of
moved to Notebooks as we moved to the second half of the year. Some of the markets have shifted a little bit. But
overall, the enterprise, all the way from large enterprise to small, medium businesses stayed fairly strong through this
year, still seeing a mature market versus emerging market trend, mature being stronger than the emerging. But those
trends have stayed and we have just forecasted a seasonal consumer. So I'm pretty comfortable with where we're at.
And I think we've got the right tools in place to watch this.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. For my follow-up – let me ask the question in a different way then. How much did
the weeks of inventory in the channel go up in Q3 to keep – to bring them to levels that you would now classify as sort
of healthy and appropriate for a Q4 – for the Q4 patterns that you're talking about?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I'm going to hold off on quantifying that, Stacy. But I'd say we look at a range of
inventory in terms of forward-looking weeks and we're well within the normal band with that range. So we're not
seeing anything that's elevated there.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Okay. Thank you.

The next question comes from C.J. Muse from ISI Group.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for letting me ask questions. I guess first question, curious in
terms of whether your guidance changed at all in the last two week to three weeks given growing macro concerns,
declining commodity prices, weakness in Europe, et cetera? Anything in terms of your guide change with the vision of
seasonality maybe something a little better? I would love to hear your thoughts.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: The only guide we've provided is the one we've provided a couple of hours ago. So we watch
the markets all the time. I think if your question is, have we been kind of [slowing and doing triple checks after seeing
some of the, like the microchip results and things like that we did; we're not seeing anything that's unusual out there. So
– again, it's not a surprising forecast for Q4, it's kind of seasonally up on the back of a more or less seasonal Q3.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Just checking, that's helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up question, curious if you can
comment on operating leverage? If we go back to your initial guides for the year at flat revenues and now up around
6% at the midpoint of your guide, during that same time you've grown your OpEx by 5%. And in your prepared

remarks you talked about IP synergy, curious how we should think about operating leverage going forward?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, it's a long-term/short-term phenomenon that we've talked about and we will absolutely go
into this more in November, but we are still committed, Brian and I are still committed to bringing our spending as a
percentage of revenue down. We will be down a little bit this year just by dent of the increase in revenue. On the flip
side, this is very much a transitional time for us and we have been making some incremental investments over the
course of the last year in areas where we felt like we needed to and where we would generate a long-term return.
So we're glad we're able to bring it down a little bit, particularly the back half of 2014 is better than the first half. We'll
continue to bring it down. But we knew we were doing it during a time where we were making some elevated
investments that we felt we needed to make.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Very helpful, thank you.

The next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the carrier certification and some of the
competitive landscape you are seeing in LTE base bands? And I guess the bigger question, Brian, there is that other
than this roll-up of the tablet contra revenues, are there other actions you can take to reduce losses in the mobile
division?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. Let me try and answer your question. There was, I believe, two questions kind of
built in there. The first was around where are we with certifications on our LTE, where are we relative to our LTE
roadmap. What I would tell you is our 7260, as you've heard has had several design wins. We've been able to publicly
say two of them with Samsung. There are others in the works that we're working on right now.
As far as certifications with the carriers, we've begun certifications across the world and you will see the systems in
almost every geography as they come out. We've been shipping with a variety of products throughout this year in a
variety of the other markets, especially in Asia. So we feel fairly strong. We also still see us as only – there are only
two people out shipping cat 6 LTE modems right now, and we're one of those two. So we feel good about our roadmap.
We have a roadmap moving forward going beyond cat 6 that we feel is highly competitive and keeps us at or near the
leading edge. So from a modem standpoint, we feel very strong right now.
You asked, are there other things that we can do to reduce our MCG spending. I think there is. If you take a look at
what we're driving on our phone strategy, we're really driving a strategy that rather than go and push on our own into
the phone space, we're really going with strong partners that are in that space already and have the linkages and the
customer relationships.
And really Spreadtrum is the most I'd say perfect example of that, where they're strong in China, they're strong in other
parts of the world. They're a great supplier to several of the OEMs, and us bringing our SoFIA platform, our base IA,
along with our modem technology. And then over time will likely come into our silicon as well. That gives us and them
a competitive advantage and a cost advantage we believe, and a way to get into those markets in a very cost effective,
efficient way.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And if I can just add one thing. I think Brian talked about the first step is great product, second
step is getting the right investment level. And I think one of the things you're seeing from him and the company is a lot
of innovation in terms of how we go to market. There's a third piece here too, which is I think increasingly we're going
to see that the IP that we're creating for the Mobile group is useful and in fact becomes a competitive advantage across
the breadth of our product line. And Brian talked in his prepared remarks, if as we think happens over time, more of the
computers of the world, the notebook computers of the world are connecting via wireless LAN and we're one of the
only companies that has that IP. There's a lot of company synergy associated with us investing and leading in that
technology.

<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: I think that's a great point. You're going to need those modems in IoT. We said that
roughly 15% of the PCs in a couple years will need them. And then there's that synergy of we are going to buy and
even down in this space bring some of that innovation in IP like the RealSense cameras and all, all the way through the
mobile space as well, which will help us differentiate our products and working with our partners allow them to
differentiate as well.

The next question comes from Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for allowing me to ask you a question and congrats on the strong
results as well. If I could dig in a little bit on what's going on in your tablet goal, it does seem I've heard a 15 million
number for the quarter that you shipped. That would mean that you need to ship actually, I believe if I've added it up
right, about 10 million next quarter. Does that mean that the subsidies have peaked in the third quarter, or do you think
you're going to exceed your tablet shipment goal by an equal amount?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Let me answer the question on volume and I'll let Stacy talk about the subsidies. Your
numbers are very close. You're right. We hit about 15 million. We think we got 10 million to 12 million for Q4. We're
not going to necessarily try and blow the number out, but we're also not going to miss it by a million or two. So my
guess is, I guess somewhere between 40 million and 45 million is where we'll end up. Exactly where that is, we'll make
sure we're past the 40 million, but not – there's no need to go well above that.
As we said, that puts us as the largest merchant supplier to the tablet business, and we're really trying to move that
space now with both our cost reduction but also differentiating with products like the Dell Venue, which we believe is
the thinnest and has a lot of innovation with the first of the RealSense, a lot of other products with our other OEM
partners like Lenovo are moving forward. I'll let Stacy talk about what that means for our subsidies or our contra.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So the contra answer is a little bit complex, Doug, because keep in mind it has to do with both
volume and the mix of what we're shipping for the earlier answer to the question about different platforms come with
different subsidy dollars per unit. I'd expect net of all of that, we're going to see revenue results in this segment that
aren't terribly dissimilar from what we saw in Q3, and then we'll start to see reductions as we move into next year.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Okay, great. Thanks so much, and if I could for my follow-up, just one on some startup
accounting. Clearly, it did impact gross margin this quarter and your guidance. Is there any color that you can offer us
on what your outlook is in the way in which you think you're going to ramp 10-nanometer? It appears as though the
14-nanometer, the magnitude of ramp with the Broadwell platform is a little less than you might have expected as we
entered the year. Is that something that you think might repeat on future nodes?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Apologies, this is Stacy broken record Smith. I'll talk more about gross margin trends for 2015
next month when we get to the investor meeting. But you are seeing in the fourth quarter – you're seeing the front edge
of the startup costs associated with 10-nanometer, and that's right in line with the historical timing of what you'd
expect. We'll go through more next month when we talk about how that might look over the next couple of years, but
we're seeing at least the front edge of the timing that you'd expect, and it's about a point of gross margin next quarter.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Great, thanks so much. I had to try.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I understand.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Thanks, Doug. Operator, if you could, go ahead and introduce our last questioner, please.

Our final question comes from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question I had was on the tablet market. When
you look at the units that you have shipped so far this year and as you look into what you're expecting to ship next year,
to what extent are the tablets that you're shipping into, are they Android versus Windows tablets? And has that played
out differently than you expected, that mix, as Microsoft seems to have cut the price of the bundle of Windows and
Office?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So the – we got a mix of Android versus Windows pretty much played out as we
forecasted, probably 80% plus or so Android. Our mix represents pretty much what you see in the marketplace, so if
you walk into any store – so there hasn't been really any shift as we go through.
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Okay, thank you. And then the second question if I may, the – there's a view out there that the
PC growth that you've been seeing has been driven by mostly a Windows XP upgrade cycle. Could you update us on
your thoughts on that topic? Do you feel better about the idea that it's not just Windows XP but rather innovation
driving the demand? Thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: This is Stacy. There's no data that's going to prove the point one way or the other. But based on
what we see in our surveys, there's a variety of things that are causing people to go and upgrade their PCs. Certainly,
the Windows refresh is one of them, but it's also form factors, it's the age of the PCs and the price points. I think all of
that is playing in. And I think when we look across the breadth of our SKUs and knowing which of those are going into
business – large enterprise, small and medium consumer, we get a sense of we're seeing growth that's more broadly
than just something where people are upgrading Windows.
I'd tell you, the second part of your question in terms of where are we, I'd say, in the back half of the year believe that
the impact that we were seeing with XP is probably less than it was in the front half of the year, but there's likely a
pretty long tail that has some positive impact on the market for a while to come when you just look at the age of the
installed base and how many of those are now unsupported operating systems.
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Thank you. That's very helpful.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Great. Thanks, Mark.
