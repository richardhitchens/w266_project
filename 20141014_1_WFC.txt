I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.
John G. Stumpf
Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our strong results in the third quarter
reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and were driven by our continued focus on meeting our customers'
financial needs in the real economy.
Let me highlight our growth during the third quarter compared with a year ago. We generated earnings of $5.7 billion
and earnings per share of $1.02, both up 3%. We grew net interest income and noninterest income resulting in 4%
revenue growth, and our efficiency ratio improved to 57.7%. Pre-tax pre-provision profit increased 7%.
We had strong broad-based loan growth with our core loan portfolio up almost $51 billion or 7%. Our credit
performance continue to be excellent, with the net charge-off ratio declining to only 32 basis points on average loans on
an annualized basis. We had a $300 million reserve release this quarter, down from $900 million a year ago. In fact, in
my 32-plus years with the company, I've not seen credit better.
Our deposit franchise continued to generate strong customer and balance growth, with total deposits up $89 billion or
9%. We grew primary consumer checking customers by 4.9%, and primary small business and business checking
customers by 5.6%. This level of business performance has enabled us to maintain strong capital levels even while
returning more capital to our shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases. We returned a net $3.6
billion to our shareholders in the third quarter, up 29% from a year ago.
Before I turn it over to John Shrewsberry, our CFO, I'd like to take a minute or two and share some of my thoughts on
the economy and the housing market. While the path to a full economic recovery remains uneven, including the
volatility we've seen recently and the current low rate environment provides some challenges, I'm very optimistic about
the future. The U.S. economy added 248,000 jobs last month, the 48th straight monthly employment gain, tying the
record for the longest consecutive string of job gains ever.
There are currently more job openings than at any time since early 2001. Household wealth is at an all-time high, and
after years of paying down debt, the consumer debt burden is at the lowest level in over 30 years. Consumers are now
better positioned for increased spending and borrowing.
The U.S. economy is also benefiting from the increase in domestic oil and gas production, which is at the highest level
in almost 30 years and rising fast, up 14% over the past year. Fiscal conditions have improved at all levels of
government, and government payrolls are once again on the rise for the first time this decade.
Historically, most recoveries in this country have been led by housing. While the residential real estate market has
definitely gotten better, which is good for the U.S. economy, it has not fully recovered. I believe there are several
factors holding the housing market back from a complete recovery.
First, household formation is slower than it has been in the past. Second, national student debt balances have increased
leaving less money available to pay for a mortgage. Third, in some markets, inventory is not available, especially in
coastal areas. Finally, credit is still not attainable for all qualified borrowers due in part to the credit overlays that many
mortgage lenders, including Wells Fargo, use to help reduce repurchase risk.
Despite these challenges, our recent survey we conducted showed that homeownership is still an aspiration for 95% of
respondents. Home prices are up 7% over the past year, and I believe the housing market will continue its recovery,
driven by pent-up demand and affordability that even with the increase in home prices is still far better than the
historical average. These trends are all positive for our country, our customers, our shareholders, as well as Wells
Fargo, and we continue our service to the real economy.
Now, John Shrewsberry, CFO, will provide more details on our third quarter results. John?

John R. Shrewsberry
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly
supplement starting on page two. John and I will then answer your questions. Wells Fargo had another strong quarter
earning $5.7 billion and growing EPS to $1.02. Generating this level of consistent earnings while economic growth has
been uneven and interest rates have remained low, demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model. We grew
both revenue and pre-tax pre-provision profit from second quarter and have grown pre-tax pre-provision profit for four
consecutive quarters.
Our results also reflected solid loan and deposit growth that was diversified across our businesses. Our capital levels
remain strong even as we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share
repurchases.
As John highlighted, and as you can see on page three, we had strong year-over-year growth across a number of
important business drivers. We grew net interest income amidst a persistent low rate environment with strong earning
asset growth, and our ability to grow a non-interest income by $542 million or 6% from a year ago even as mortgage
originations declined by 40% demonstrates the benefit of our diversified sources of fee income.
Page four highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. We have over 90
businesses and, in any given quarter, some will drive more revenue growth than others. For example, the strength in the
markets over the past few years has benefited our market sensitive businesses. Market sensitive revenue was 5% of our
total revenue in the third quarter, up from 4% in the second quarter, but lower than the 7% contribution in the first
quarter.
Let me highlight some key drivers of our third quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective
starting on page five. Our balance sheet has never been stronger. We've increased our liquidity position, improved the
quality of our assets and hold more capital. Furthermore, while we're positioned to benefit from rising rates, we're
confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results if rates remain low.
Investment securities increased $9.9 billion from the second quarter with $25 billion of purchases partially offset by
run-off. We issued $16.3 billion of liquidity related long-term debt as well as some additional liquidity related
short-term funding during the third quarter. We are now solidly over 100% for the LCR, but keep in mind that the LCR
is a minimum requirement. We have a significant amount of cash available to deploy, both to meet our customers'
financial needs and to opportunistically purchase high quality assets.
Turning to the income statement on page six, revenue grew $147 million during the quarter, with growth in net interest
income and stable noninterest income. I will highlight the drivers of revenue growth in more detail later, but let me take
a moment now to highlight the growth in market sensitive revenue which increased $231 million from second quarter.
Net gains from debt securities were up $182 million as we sold securities, primarily non-agency MBS as part of our
ongoing balance sheet management. Net gains from equity investments were up $263 million from second quarter,
reflecting strong results in our venture capital businesses, but were down $135 million from first quarter. We've been in
these core businesses for decades and results are naturally cyclical and driven by market conditions. Non-controlling
interest reduces the impact of the equity gains to our net income and increased $166 million from second quarter.
The increase in market sensitive revenue from debt and equity gains was partially offset by $214 million of lower
trading gains. The decline in trading reflected $163 million of lower deferred compensation plan investment results
which was offset in employee benefits expense and lower customer accommodation trading.
Our results this quarter also reflected $227 million of lower income tax expense from the second quarter, reflecting tax
benefits primarily due to charitable donations of appreciated securities.
As shown on page seven, we continue to have strong broad-based loan growth in the third quarter, our 13th consecutive
quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core portfolio grew by $50.8 billion or 7% from a year ago, and was up $12.2

billion or 6% annualized from the second quarter. Our liquidating portfolio was down $21 billion from a year ago, and
is now only 8% of our total loans, down from 10% a year ago. Average loan yields have remained relatively stable over
the past year, and were up 1 basis point from second quarter.
On page eight, we highlight a number of our loan portfolios that had strong year-over-year growth. C&I loans were up
$23.8 billion or 13% from a year ago, with diversified growth that I will highlight on the next page.
We're the largest commercial real estate lender in the country and we're benefiting from the growth in new
construction. Our commercial real estate portfolio grew $3.1 billion from a year ago.
Foreign loans grew $700 million or 2% from a year ago reflecting growth in trade finance and the UK commercial real
estate acquisition we completed in the third quarter of last year.
Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $16.4 million or 9% from a year ago, with growth in high quality
nonconforming mortgages, primarily jumbo loans. The credit quality of our core mortgage portfolio was outstanding
with only 7 basis points of loss in the third quarter.
We're the number one auto lender in the country. Auto loans were up $5.5 billion or 11% from last year reflecting
strong originations. Credit card balances were up $2.8 billion or 11% from a year ago benefiting from continued
account growth.
Slide nine demonstrates the diversity of businesses that contributed to the growth in C&I loans. Let me highlight just a
few. Asset-backed finance increased $5.3 billion with increased utilization and new originations across all asset classes.
Corporate banking grew $4.4 billion, driven by new customer growth and higher utilization rates from existing
customers. And commercial banking, serving our middle market customers, grew $3.8 billion with diversified growth
across geographies and industries.
As you can see on page 10, average deposits totaled $1.1 trillion in the third quarter, up $25.6 billion from second
quarter with growth in both commercial and consumer balances. Due to our outstanding deposit franchise, we've been
able to grow deposits over 5% on a year-over-year basis every quarter since the third quarter of 2011.
Our primary consumer checking customers were up 4.9% from a year ago and we grew primary small business and
business banking checking customers by 5.6%. Our average deposit costs were 10 basis points in the third quarter,
consistent with second quarter, and 2 basis points lower than a year ago.
Our NIM declined 9 basis points from the second quarter, 4 basis points of this decline was from strong
customer-driven deposit growth because excess deposits remain invested in cash equivalents in the current
environment. Deposit growth put pressure on the NIM, but was basically neutral to net interest income.
Liquidity related actions, both term deposits and long-term debt also diluted the margin by 4 basis points. The impact
of all other balance sheet growth and repricing was again minimal this quarter reducing the margin by 1 basis point.
Despite the decline in the net interest margin, we continue to grow net interest income on a tax equivalent basis, up
$147 million from the second quarter as a result of the growth in earning assets, higher PCI accretion, and one
additional day in the quarter.
Our balance sheet is asset sensitive. So we're well positioned to benefit from higher rates. But we're not relying on rates
to increase in order to generate growth. As we have demonstrated in this historically low rate environment, we believe
we can grow net interest income over time, even if rates remain low.
While total non-interest income was unchanged from the second quarter, we had growth across a number of business
drivers including deposit service charges, retail brokerage, trust and investment management, card fees, commercial
real estate brokerage, and the market sensitive revenue that I highlighted earlier.
This growth was offset by lower investment banking fees which declined 24% from second quarter, consistent with the
decline in the market fee pools. Insurance was down $65 million reflecting the impact from the sale of 40 offices last
quarter and also seasonality in the crop insurance business. Other noninterest income was down $95 million from

second quarter, which had included the gain from the sale of the insurance offices.
Mortgage banking revenue declined $90 million from second quarter. Mortgage origination gains were up $266 million
from last quarter, primarily due to gain on sale margins increasing to 182 basis points and a higher mortgage repurchase
reserve release. The majority of our originations were tied to purchase activity, 70% of originations in the third quarter,
up from 59% a year ago. We currently expect originations to be down in the fourth quarter reflecting normal
seasonality in a purchase market.
Servicing income declined $356 million from second quarter, approximately one half of this decline was from higher
unreimbursed direct servicing costs which reduced gross servicing fees. The rest of the decline was driven by a lower
net mortgage servicing rights results reflecting lower carry and hedging gains. Our gain on sale margin is expected to
remain within the range we've seen over the past four quarters.
As shown on page 13, expenses were up $54 million from second quarter while our efficiency ratio improved to 57.7%.
We've consistently worked at improving our efficiency which has enabled us to maintain a high level of customer
service while we've continued to appropriately invest in our businesses. We've been significantly increasing our
investments in our already strong risk management practices.
Our quarterly expenses related to risk and compliance have increased by approximately $100 million over the past year,
and we've added over 1,500 team members in this area. Additionally, operating losses in the third quarter were $417
million, primarily reflecting litigation accruals. We expect our efficiency ratio will remain within our target range of
55% to 59% in the fourth quarter.
Turning to our business segments starting on page 14, Community Banking earned $3.5 billion in the third quarter, up
4% from a year ago and up 1% from second quarter. By consistently providing outstanding customer service with the
convenience of the most extensive store network in the country, an award winning mobile and online banking, we've
had strong net household growth. In fact, August was our strongest month for net retail bank household growth in over
three years. These additional households will help drive our future growth as we focus on offering customers the
products and services they need to help them succeed financially.
Our results continue to benefit from growth in our debit and credit card businesses. Debit card purchase volume was up
8% from a year ago, driven by primary checking customer growth and increased usage from existing customers. Credit
card purchase volume grew 16% from a year ago. We've continued to increase our credit card penetration rate growing
from 36% a year ago to 39.7%, and our new customers are spending more and transacting at a greater frequency. By
consistently focusing on meeting the financial needs of our small business customers, Wells Fargo has been America's
number one lender to small businesses for 12 consecutive years. We do business with one in 10 small businesses, and
grew primary business checking customers by 5.6% from a year ago.
Wholesale Banking earned $1.9 billion in the third quarter, down 3% from a year ago and 2% from second quarter.
While earnings were down, there were a number of underlying trends that demonstrated business momentum. Loan
growth remained strong, up $28.8 billion or 10% from a year ago with growth across many businesses as I highlighted
earlier.
Credit quality remained outstanding with seven consecutive quarters of net recoveries. Deposit growth was also strong
with average core deposits up $43.1 billion or 18% from a year ago, with diversified growth across wholesale
businesses. Wholesale Banking cross-sell increased to 7.2 products per relationship, up from 7.0 products per
relationship a year ago. And treasury management grew revenue by 9% from a year ago, reflecting new product sales
and repricing.
Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $550 million in the third quarter, up 22% from a year ago and 1% from
second quarter. Year-over-year results were driven by strong revenue growth, up 7% with increases in both net interest
income and noninterest income. Asset-based fees increased 18% from a year ago reflecting increased market valuation
and net flows. WBR results continue to benefit from strong loan growth, up 13% from a year ago, driven by growth in
high quality nonconforming mortgage loans and security based lending. This was WBR's fifth consecutive quarter of
double-digit year-over-year loan growth.

Turning to page 17, credit quality continue to improve with charge-offs at historic lows. Our net charge-off ratio
declined to just 32 basis points of average loans. Consumer losses were 62 basis points and commercial loans had a net
recovery of 2 basis points. The improvement in our asset quality reflected the benefit of the improving economy and
our continued focus on originating high quality loans. For example, approximately 57% of the consumer first mortgage
portfolio was originated after 2008 when new underwriting standards were implemented. Non-performing assets have
declined for eight consecutive quarters and were down $406 million from second quarter.
Non-accrual loans declined $607 million while foreclosed assets increased $201 million, driven by higher government
insured or guaranteed properties, primarily in judicial states. The reserve release was $300 million in the third quarter,
down $200 million from the second quarter and down $600 million from a year ago. We continue to expect future
reserve releases absent a significant deterioration in the economy, but expect a lower level of future releases as the rate
of credit improvement slows and the loan portfolio continues to grow.
Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced
approach fully phased-in at 10.46% in the third quarter. While the amount of RWA we determined under the
standardized and advanced approaches has been converging, our ratio this quarter was determined under the advanced
approach because RWA under the advanced approach was higher.
As shown on slide 19, our strong capital levels have allowed us to return more capital to our shareholders. We returned
$3.6 billion to shareholders in the third quarter and our net payout ratio was 66% in the third quarter within our target
range of 55% to 75%. Our common shares outstanding declined by 34.9 million shares in the quarter, the largest
decline in over six years. We purchased 48.7 million common shares and entered into a $1 billion forward repurchase
contract that's expected to settle in the fourth quarter for approximately 19.8 million shares. We've reduced our
common shares outstanding by 58.7 million shares from a year ago and expect further reductions in the fourth quarter.
In summary, our results in the third quarter reflect the benefit of our diversified business model which has enabled us to
produce strong and consistent results over a variety of economic and interest rate environments. Our results were driven
by strong loan and deposit growth and we grew revenue and pre-tax pre-provision profit. We increased our capital
levels and returned more capital to shareholders. We continue to execute against all of the targets we established at
Investor Day, operating within our stated ranges for ROA, ROE, efficiency ratio and capital return. Our balance sheet
has never been stronger reflecting higher capital and liquidity levels and improved asset quality.
While we're well positioned to benefit from increased economic activity and higher rates, as we've demonstrated by our
consistent financial performance in a variety of environments, we're not dependent on the economy improving our rates
rising to generate strong results. I'm optimistic about our future opportunities as we continue to focus on serving
customers and growing relationships.
I will now open up the call to questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. Please go ahead
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Yes. Good morning
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: So my first question is on the net interest income and interest margin. We hear you loud and
clear in terms of the message with regards to the NII trajectory. As we think about the net interest margin going
forward, giving the stability if your loan yields over the past three quarters and your funding costs also stable over the
past three quarters, it's really sort of the incremental hit on the margin in this rate environment really going to come

from deposit flow, given that you did issue $16 billion in debt in the quarter for liquidity purposes already.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So that's probably true, and it also has a lot to do with what we choose to do with the
excess deposits or, frankly, excess funding, as it sits on our balance sheet. We're making choices between leaving that
liquidity in cash equivalents sitting at the Fed, or deploying it in HQLA or loans for that matter if there's enough
demand for it, or other assets with yield. And we're making those determinations based on how we feel about entry
points in the market and what we think it does to our capital sensitivity in the event of a backup subsequently. And it's
those types of choices that are going to drive us to increase the all-in yield on the left side of the balance sheet, whether
the funding's coming from deposits or from term funding.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And my second question is given Governor Tarullo's speech early in September,
there are clearly two looming issues for the industry that may not be as relevant to Wells: higher CET1 buffers relative
to your short-term funding base; and also the interpretation of NSFR final rules from Basel. Do you see advantage sort
of given where you are on both the business mix and capital spectrum to perhaps take advantage of players that need to
have more stringent buffers, mainly in terms of continuing to grow market share in Wholesale Banking?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's possible. On both of those measures, we think we end up at the low end of the
risk-adjusted spectrum in terms of the bad outcomes that could occur. And that might give us an opportunity to do a
little bit more for our customers if they needed and if the risk-adjusted returns are appropriate. I think that we're all
waiting to see what happens to the returns in those businesses based on the actions taken by people who are more
constrained by both of those new ratios, what it means for pricing, what it means for customer behavior, et cetera. But
we're happy with the approach that we've taken and we're here to serve the customers that we have. But you're right,
we're probably at the more advantaged end of the spectrum with respect to both of those measures
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, Erika, so to add to that, nothing that's happening to date and nothing that we see in the
horizon will get in our way or impede our way to help customers and to serve them, and I think that puts us in a very
good position.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Great. I'll step off. Thank you for taking my questions
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: John, I appreciate your color on reminding us about that minority interest back out on some
of the trading-related activities. But just wonder if you can help us understand from those portfolios that still generate a
healthy amount of fee income, what's kind of left in the till there if you think across net gains from trading activities,
debt securities and net gains from equity investments, a question that comes up frequently with the investor
community?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. Well, there are a variety of different businesses that contribute to those results. So
the big drivers would be the venture activity that we have in Norwest Venture Partners, it would be the activity at
investment banking where we've got customer-accommodation trading. It's the impact of the hedging that we do for our
deferred comp program. And then there's – and at least in this quarter and probably in future quarters, some amount of
balance sheet management on the debt portfolio, and they all contribute.
So it's a diversified set of investments, different drivers in each case. Some of them are more sensitive to where we are
in the rate cycle, some of them are more sensitive to where we are in the equity valuation cycle. But they've contributed
more or less, call it, 4% or 5% to 7% or 8% over a number of quarters. And there isn't one thing that I would hang your

<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Yeah, I think that's the point, which is that you don't see any cliff coming as far as just the
ability to continue to realize either gains or benefit from those activities and there's some counter-cyclical pieces within
it as well?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: They are a part of what's a broader set of diversified noninterest income levers, right? So
whether they're contributing 4% or 7% as it has been in recent history and how they work in sync with all of the other
things that are going on in terms of customer-facing, fee-generating activity. That is the diversified model.
And, as I mentioned, some of them are more interest rate sensitive and we're in a low rate environment. So there's
higher unrealized gains. Some of them are levered to equity markets and exit strategies for portfolio investments, but I
would think of them as part of the broader mix of diversified noninterest income sources.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Understood. And my next question, just on the expense side, understanding that you're
going to still be living in this 55%, 59% range. We did see kind of flattish fee side, a little bit of NII growth, but then a
little bit of higher expense as well. And I'm just wondering, as you think about that level of expenses and continue to
manage forward in what's still looking to be a pretty tough rate environment than these ongoing challenges from NIM
pressure, any adjustments that you're thinking about or contemplating as far as just kind of the need to continue to
manage that expense base even tighter than you've already been? And where would opportunities be, if so?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We're always trying to be as efficient as we can be to make sure that we have the
resources available to deliver what customers need. And, of course, as we've mentioned, we're at a time when the focus
in the investment and the risk management area is very high. So we're working constantly to try and be as efficient as
we can in areas where it won't impact customers and where it doesn't hinder us in terms of our risk management
activity.
Some examples, which we've talked about a little bit before, are really in other areas. For example, the space that we
consume, the way we think about our purchasing, the technology that we use, et cetera, we can always be a little bit
more efficient. And it's a constant job here to try and make the most of that.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: But you guys haven't felt that incremental compliance burden increasing to a level where
you feel the need to pull the continuous improvement cord?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think we are pulling the continuous improvement cord and, in part, because we're
spending more in compliance and risk management like we're spending more in the customer experience and our
customer-facing activity. But in order to afford both of those things, we have to be really vigilant around the business
as usual expenses and that's continuous improvement.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Understood. Thanks, guys.

Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. John, question on the mortgage revenues. On the servicing side,
the gross servicing revenues are down about $200 million. You mentioned the unreimbursed servicing costs. Is that still
one-time-ish that the pop-up in those? It seems like those were coming down for a while and then they've kind of
reversed this quarter. That just bounce around, or any color you can give on that?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It had come down, it bounced back up. Our sense is the trajectory is going to be reduced
over the longer arc of the mortgage servicing cycle. It's going to be hard to forecast it quarter-to-quarter.

So I wouldn't expect it as low as it's been for the last couple of quarters. This may be a more average quarter. And over
some period of time as the level of non-performing loans, foreclosed assets, et cetera, begins to abate, then you'd expect
that to ratchet itself down. But this is probably a relatively normal level.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And in terms of capital on the advanced approach, you mentioned the RWA
kind of ratio to total assets seems like it got a little better on better credit quality and data refinements. Any more color
on that? Is that something that also just kind of bounces around quarter-to-quarter, or will you still have some model
improvements you can do from here?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: There's always more that we can do with improved and more focus on data and
modeling. But you could come to a point where just because of the nature of our assets, loans and securities, that attract
the risk weights that they do, that were constrained on the standardized side.
And we mentioned that they're converging, they're very close together right now in terms of the RWA calculation. But
the takeaway is that our capital level did increase a little bit in the quarter under the advanced approach. And in spite of
that, we're still earning north of 13% as an ROA, which we're very proud of.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Is that stuff that just rolled off in terms of the better credit quality, like older assets
that roll off? Is that why it's getting better?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's a combination of roll off and hard work around data and modeling and continuous
refinement.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And with that ratio at 10.46%, is this the kind of level that you want to run at on Tier
1 common?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Tough to say. As we said in Investor Day, this is probably in excess of the buffer that we
might have imagined when we originally vectored in toward our regulatory capital levels. And it's really a function of
CCAR and some of the assumptions that are made in the CCAR process as it's applied. So as we go from CCAR to
CCAR and we present our starting capital point, we present our expected capital generation and our capital actions and
what they yield in terms of capital levels, we're trying to manage that as appropriately as we can to get the right amount
of return back to shareholders, which we believe that we've done at a 66% payout ratio. But it's an art form because of
all of the inputs and the other actors in the process.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And just a quick follow-up to Erika's question. On the liquidity building, it
sounds like you are now above the minimums under your calculations, but you might decide to build some buffer going
forward, so we might expect a little bit more on that front from you?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So I think we're in a period where big banks are trying to figure out what the right buffer
is as a result of our own internal stress testing and the expectations on G-SIBs in particular. So we're in that phase. We
feel great about where we are right now. Nobody's mentioned TLAC yet, but there'd be some work to do to figure out
where we're going on that front and how that – what the interplay is between liquidity we've already built and what
future requirements are going to be. So I think the heavy lifting is probably behind us for the time being, but I wouldn't
say that we're stopped.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And, John, one of the strengths of the company, of course, is our continued ability to grow
high-quality, low-cost core deposits, which is critical in all of this.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.

<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Hi, guys.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Matt.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Hello, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Just following up on some of the rate related questions earlier. This is not a Wells
specific issue, but you are the first of kind of these provisional banks to come out. If the 10-year does stay, right now
it's sitting at 2.2% to 2%, my screen shows. Is this meaningful as we think about, I guess, both the NIM and then could
there be some opportunities on refis if we stay down here for a little bit?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, I don't know if that gets us back into an in-the-money refi scenario. We're
probably still some distance away from that. I think that it is meaningful, and it's more about the expectation of how
long rates stay low because that will influence the decision to redeploy cash equivalents into assets with duration. And
if you imagine that term rates are going to back up in the foreseeable future, just from a capital preservation
perspective, you're probably less likely to redeploy out of cash and into higher earning assets. And so we – that's a
calculus and a judgment that we make here relatively regularly. And it feels, frankly, like the market is now discounting
the idea that there's any sort of meaningful move up in rates in the 2015 timeframe.
So if we're going to be lower for longer, I think it means a lot for banks like ours, I think it means you have to be that
much more vigilant on expenses, I think it means you have to think about how your assets are deployed and how much
cash you think you really need to carry. And we'll be conducting that balance between the risk to capital if rates back
up and the risk to earnings if rates stay low and we're under-invested.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then I guess a somewhat related theme, spread pressure in the
commercial lending business. We saw your yields down about 10 bps quarter-to-quarter, and I guess there's two
phenomena that's going on, one, the new loans that you're adding are at lower spreads just generally speaking for the
industry, but then maybe some loans that you did a few years ago are coming up for renewal and there's some pricing
there. Maybe just talk about like which of those two is a bigger driver at this point as we think about the dynamics in
that book?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, I don't know which of those two drove the 10-basis point drop in this quarter, or
was a greater contributor to that drop in this quarter. It is a competitive environment out there. We're happy to be able
to have a full tool kit when we square off with our commercial customers because we're in a position to earn more of
their business and to generate more of a return on the risk capital that's associated with the loan that we're going to
make. We contrast ourselves with some other firms that we compete with who are getting paid primarily from the loan
yield itself and not from the broader relationship. So we like our competitive stance in that range. We have backed
away from the table in some situations, not so much on price, but where we see credit or terms getting a little bit frothy,
because that's another lever that people pull in order to keep for these types of assets.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. Any signs of stabilization in that spread, or just still under pressure?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, I think at some level it's got to be stabilized by the marginal player who's only
getting a return from the asset itself, because there are levels below which they can't go because they're not going to
generate a sufficient return on capital, and they have no other cards to play in terms of generating relationship returns
by providing product or service. And some of the smaller banks who participate in those markets would be examples of
that.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you very much.

<Q - Joseph Morford>: Thanks. Good morning, John and John.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: I guess, looking at your new C&I slide on page nine, how much of your growth do you think
is coming from market share gains as opposed to increased demand? And along those lines, last quarter you talked
about seeing increased confidence among business owners, is that still the case generally?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, speaking for market share gains, it depends on which column in that slide you're
talking about. I think we have leading market share and are increasing share in some of those businesses. In some of
them, they might include examples of businesses where we've chosen to slow down a little bit if the competitions got
racy. So it's a combination of things of both market share growth and of the size of the market increasing.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: So, Joe, if you look at more than just commercial customers broadly, there's actually been
fairly good activity. Now, there's been volatility lately in the market. But if you look at auto sales and we participate in
that business, of course, August was the biggest sales month, maybe in, I don't know how many years. Consumers, our
credit card activities are increasing. We're doing – we had growth in our mortgage portfolio. So it's really broad-based.
And when I'm out calling customers, corporate customers, middle market customers, there seems to be at least more
discussion about activity, and the marketplace is not totally ubiquitous. There's places that are stronger in energy, for
example, and those places are really doing well. Ag is having a pretty good year, technology. It depends on what part of
the economy it is, but clearly I see and I hear more optimism than I heard a year ago, for example.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Okay. That's helpful color. I guess, lastly, just can you share with us any thoughts on Apple
Pay and how readily you see it being adopted and what sort of impact it may have on the broader payments business?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, as you know, we are participating in that, and there are, I think, 7 million to 8 million
terminals or merchants out in the marketplace and only a few hundred thousand have the NFC chip in them, and that
you need that, the Near Field Communications chip. So this will take – there will be an adoption, but we're pleased and
excited on behalf of our customers to participate in that, and it will evolve over time.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Okay. Thanks so much.

<A>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hey. Couple of questions. One was on that you – like you did mention that obviously
something that you're in the review of. I think the expectation is that in the U.S. at least we'll have to have senior
through common 20% to 25% of risk weighted assets. And if you're on the high end of that range, could you give us a
sense of what you might do to minimize any impact?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, there's still a lot to know. We're seeing similar headline numbers, maybe a little bit
lower, 19.5% to 23.5%. And this is all research that's been published based on information that's in the market that
hasn't beneficially sanctioned, so who knows. And over what period of time it has to get phased in is unknown. What
counts, what doesn't count among your existing capital structure is unknown. What – which entities that you issue out
of and whether there are going to be caps on those types of things. There's a handful of questions that are unknown.
Our sense is that we're going to end up at the lower end of the range.

We calculate that we probably have about 18% today that qualifies. And if we end up having to issue, we'll probably be
issuing a form of senior unsecured mostly holdco debt, and that will happen over some period of time. And it will end
up being an earnings drag because we'll issue that debt and pay a corporate spread and we'll take that cash and we'll
reinvest it at some lower yielding either HQLA or equivalent, and it will become a new part of the cost structure and
capital structure of bank. So my short answer is there's still a lot to know, but we'll deal with it when it comes and it
doesn't seem insurmountable.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. And there's no rush to get it done quickly, right? I mean, I think you have until
1/1/2019?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Don't know yet, but I heard similarly that it will – there'll be a longish phase-in period.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Then two other quick questions. One's on the auto business and you highlighted that
you are nation's largest bank lender of auto. And wanted to understand how you're thinking about that given the risk
retention rules that are out there? Clearly, it's just a proposal. So it's not fully baked yet. But there's this outline that
you'd have to, at some time in the future, hold 5% of any securitizations that you do in auto. Does that matter to you?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It doesn't matter to us in our current business model because we don't securitize our auto
loans. We own a 100% of the risk on every one of them. And, frankly, in the auto loan securitization business for those
who do use securitization, that's the general business model which is that people own the bottom of the capital structure
and retain their own risk, which is different than mortgage. But that's how auto finance companies generally work. So I
don't think that's going to be, that's going to have a real impact on Wells Fargo.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. And I was thinking about it from the perspective of the competitive dynamic if that
were to come into play?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, to the extent that it makes it harder for other people to compete, then that could be
good for Wells Fargo.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. And then lastly just on mortgage, John, you mentioned at the beginning a lot of the
headwinds that are sitting in front of us in mortgage. One of the questions we get often is what about the credit box, and
is there an opportunity here as home prices improve and as consumer balance sheets improve that there is some
loosening up of standards on the credit box? Maybe you can speak to that.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, I would say, I don't know that's value so much. I think the bigger part of the credit box
right now to open up would be a better understanding of repurchase risk. And we're doing a lot of work with folks in
the government about that issue. I think that will influence it more than value of homes, although values are important.
But because your credit overlays today are not related to values, they're related to, in many cases, repurchase risk.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. And apparently the FHFA is working on crystallizing that more clearly for people, I
assume that's what you're talking about.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, exactly. There has to be – I think, it's helpful to America, to American homeowners,
prospective homeowners, to the agencies, and to originators that there is a understanding of when risk transfers. Now, if
the originator does a poor job and doesn't underwrite properly, sure they should be held accountable. But if a default
happens later and it's due to a technical issue unrelated to the payment ability of the customer, that could have been
known, then risk should transfer. And whenever that period of time is, I think that would be helpful. And there are a
number of Americans who want to buy a home, can afford to buy a home, who simply can get credit.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So do you think you, if you had a certain amount of clarity like two plus three years risk
transfers, assuming we did a good job as an underwriter, would that have a material impact on how you are putting on
your credit overlays?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, it would surely change, it would surely change the way we look at overlays. And I'm not
saying it is going to change the market. But those – every home that gets sold, that satisfies a customer's need not only
fulfills a dream, but a $1 spent on a home multiplies through the economy like no other thing that we do. I mean, a loan

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. Can you hear me?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah. Hi, Mike. Good morning.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hey. Hey, John, do you still dream about checking accounts? And the reason I ask, or do you
dream about them as much, because with the 10-year where it is, I mean, do you still go all gung ho, get as much
deposits as you can get for the long-term value, or do you somehow need to balance that with the need for shorter-term
profitability?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: In fact, Mike, I'm going to bed earlier these days so I can even dream longer about them. I still
just love checking, and here's why. But it's a good question, it's a serious question. First of all, when an account comes,
like we grew net primary checking accounts 4.9% on the consumer side and 5.6% on the business side, they don't come
alone. They come with a relationship. And the increases you're seeing in debit card activity and credit card, we almost
have 40% of our customers now carry our credit card. That was 22% in 2009. And they do other things with us. And,
secondly, you know how expensive it is to build liquidity for the LCR and other things, deposits are hugely important
in that. So, no, the love affair has not ended, and we won't be in this environment forever. But if we can serve
customers for a long time, that feels like forever, and we'd love that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Well, you mentioned that you are trying to mitigate the impact somewhat with expenses, and
you're actually increasing your number of branches, but I guess you're reducing the square feet. Can you give us some
sense of what sort of square foot reduction you're looking for in your bank branches, say, over five years or even 10
years?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, I'll give you – let me give you kind of a high level, and then I'll try to answer your
question specifically. When we – if you go back five years, six years, we had about 116 million square feet or 117
million square feet, and that was not only for our stores, but for all of our people.
Today that's in the 93 million square foot, 94 million square foot range. We still think we have quite a ways to go. We
have 6,200 banking stores, and we have another couple of thousand other advisor and mortgage stores. Let's talk about
the banking stores for a second.
We try to refresh 500, 600 of those every year, plus we're at pretty steady state right now. We're in that 6,200, we will
replace two with a new one and relocate it. When we do refresh them, we will reduce, in many case, square footage, or
increase the density in the stores.
I think you and I've actually had discussions about which is now three stores in the Washington area where these are, I
wouldn't say stores of the future in terms of replace all of our 6,200 stores, but they fit into the model where they are
1,000 square feet to 1,200 square feet. During the daytime it's a full functioning store, nighttime the walls fold in, it's a
ATM vestibule 7/24. So all of that matters in the mix. And the reason we are doing that is that we have found stores are
still critically important to the overall distribution community and convenience we provide customers.
So we will continue to march in this way. Doesn't mean we're going to replace every store, sometimes we're even
adding space because it's kind of the hub and spoke. So it's really a collage of store designs and activities that all fit into
this. But you're right, with the idea of reducing overhead, reducing space, we're providing the convenience customers
want.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So over the last five years, you reduced square feet by about one-fifth. Over the next five years,
how much do you think you can reduce it by?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I don't know that we have a absolute goal, but it'll continue to go down. There are lots of
opportunities, and that's going to be critical.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then just one separate question. You had a comment in the American Banker, I think it
was, and you alluded to it today, that it's tougher for some individuals to get a mortgage loan from Wells Fargo because
of the risk of repurchase. And so is this simply – would you describe this as an unintended consequence of some of the
regulatory actions over the past few years?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: I would say it's unintended consequence of activity. I don't know if it's so much on the
regulation side, but it sure is. It gives us cause to pause and other originators. We're not unique in this. With you have
repurchase requests that go back eight years and 10 years, and in many cases for things unrelated to the credit quality,
or the credit payment ability of the borrower at the time of the borrowing, we put overlays on.
Now, we've started to reduce a little bit of those as we start to understand more about repurchase, but it is an
unintended consequence. I don't know if it's so much regulation as it is the activities of the GSEs.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So is this a permanent dampening for the mortgage market?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: No, I actually think that we're going to – I'm hopeful we're going to figure this out. We're
working with actually community groups who are saying to us, this isn't working for us, and we're working with other
originators. We're working with the Mortgage Bankers Association, we're working with the Head of the FHFA, we're
working with the GSEs, we're working with government agencies, the Fed and others, because we need to figure this
out.

Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thanks. Good morning. You guys mentioned in response to an earlier question that we're not
going to be in this environment forever. Following up on that thought, I was hoping you could share your deposit
growth outlook just from a high level with QE now coming to an end. Would you expect to see a slowdown in overall
industry deposit growth and the corresponding excess liquidity building? And, if so, does that mean that some of the
excess liquidity-driven NIM compression that we've been seeing should abate?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Let me take a shot at that. Clearly, money supply and what's happening there has an influence.
But I can tell you our household growth, I think John mentioned this in his numbers, August was the strongest we've
seen in years. And because of where our store distribution and the geography of it, we happen to be in higher growth
states. We happen to get a disproportionate growth of millennials and emerging communities.
So, yeah, I can't tell you what's going to happen at the top of the house with M1 or M2, I like that, but I'm confident
about the way we run our retail franchise and the work we're doing at Wealth, Brokerage, Retirement. And frankly on
the corporate side in winning new customers and growing not only existing accounts, but growing new accounts. And,
frankly, that's one of the reason stores are important. Our strongest growth is in areas where we have the best
distribution of a store network, not that it's the only part of distribution, but it's a critical part for acquisition.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: One thing that I would add to that is that, our deposits are disproportionately core
deposits, operational deposits, relationship types of deposits and less so institutional deposits from people who are
probably more inclined to immediately shift out as the Fed does whatever they're going to do to drain reserves from the

system and to tighten monetary policy, if that ever happens.
And, as a result, we feel like we've got a stickier deposit base. And all things being equal, if we were – if it was a
question of losing deposits versus retaining them, we obviously have the ability to price our deposits to compete with
whatever the alternative investment opportunity or savings opportunity is for our customers, because we're sitting here
with a full service capability and lots of levers in the relationships that we have.
So unlike some firms that probably have a higher percentage of institutional deposits that are seeking the last basis
point of yield, I don't think – I think we compare favorably in terms of deposit stickiness.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. That's very helpful. I had a second question on the rate environment. Assuming that
we do start to see the Fed funds rate increase next year, how are you thinking about the potential for an environment
where the Fed's taking rates higher at the short end of the curve, but demand for treasuries remains strong at the low
end such that we end up with a flatter curve? How are you guys positioned to perform in that kind of environment?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It would actually be not a bad outcome at all because we would have less capital
pressure on loan rates backing up on our bond portfolio and we'd be benefiting as loans and other LIBOR linked assets
re-price at the short end. So at least with respect to those two drivers of accounting outcomes, those would be
favorable.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Excellent. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott Siefers>: Good morning, guys.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott Siefers>: I was hoping you could spend just a moment or two talking about the operating losses just given
the trajectory, they were up kind of substantially in the second quarter and then up another bit again. I mean, I can
imagine given some of the conversations that we've had on regulatory issues or what might be driving that, but can you
spend a second maybe discussing when or how or even why those might press them in and then hopefully begin to ebb
back down?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, we've mentioned that this month's elevated – or this quarter's elevated level
reflects primarily litigation accruals. And as a result, there's not much more specific color we can offer except to point
you to our crystal clear disclosure in our Qs and K that describe everything that's probable and estimable and then
some. And like anything else, it's hard to know whether you're cresting or not until you're on the other side of it. So we
feel this is a somewhat higher level than it's been recently, and we think it's well disclosed.
<Q - Scott Siefers>: Okay. All right. Sounds good. Thank you.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thank you. I wanted to talk about two different lines of questioning more long-term in
nature. One is that as you're pulling your short-term assets higher by about $25 billion each quarter and you mentioned
that in terms of liquidity, but is also adding about 2% to your asset sensitivity every quarter. So it just seems like you're

looking at the level of opportunities that you have in deciding to forego the yields of today and hope for better yields
tomorrow increasing asset sensitivity. So, John, I just want to get your feel for how you're kind of managing that
decision you mentioned several times.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, well, it's a complex decision. It involves our asset and liability committee and a lot
of discussion among management from time-to-time. And the items that you just mentioned tend to be a little bit
backward looking because you don't know what a quarter's loan growth is until it's happened and if floating rate loan
growth contributes to asset sensitivity.
The governing factor is probably what our capital sensitivity is to a back-up in rates if we deploy into duration
instruments and out of cash equivalents. And getting that right is important so that we don't find ourselves with higher
rates that we've always been waiting for and a higher level of economic activity which would probably mean more
non-interest income generation, more loan growth, lot of exciting activity, and at the same time be damaging our
capital to the point that we couldn't take full advantage of it. And so that is one of those marginal drivers that probably
causes us to be a little bit more in cash or a little bit more asset sensitive then versus being more fully invested today.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: But at least looking back, funding sources of long-term debt and sticky deposit to growth
with growth and short-term liquid assets, naturally I guess I just want to make sure we're both agreeing that that makes
you more asset sensitive each quarter.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: That makes us more asset sensitive. That's right.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then just real quickly, the other line of thinking was, John, how have you increased
the growth in households and businesses? I mean, moving that number up a full percentage point on the consumer side
and two full percentage points on the business side, long-term is a big driver. How do you see the source of those, and
is that sustainable at these higher levels?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, it's hard to know whether it's sustainable because, again, that's forward looking.
The reason that it's happening is a result of the quality of our people, the quality of our products, the execution of our
business model and just a consistent application of the value proposition that we're bringing. And it's paying dividends
like we thought that it would, hope that it would. Where it goes in the future is a function of a variety of inputs that are
hard to know. But we like our competitive standing. And so to the extent that we're growing faster than our large and
regional bank competition, we're not surprised by it, and that's what we expect.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And would you see that in the traditional markets or more in – you've got the Wachovia
markets and the franchise now pulled together. So are you really getting traction in being able to attract new customers
now that you've got all that processed?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think they're all traditional markets now.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, exactly. We don't think...
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Understand. I just didn't know if incrementally you're getting some new households in
those newer, let's say, markets.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: We're getting them in all of our markets.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: All right. Thanks.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: They're all good to us.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Appreciate it. Thank you all.

Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, guys. How are you?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hi, Nancy.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: This is sort of an overarching question, John and John, that goes to a lot of the stuff we're
hearing not only on your call, but on the JPMorgan Chase call about these sort of continuing calls for increased capital,
all these other new requirements that are being put on the industry to which there is seemingly no end. And there's – I'm
sure you've read this in the press as well, this beginning characterization of the banking industry as the new electric
utility. Are the regulators trying to enforce so much conformity on the industry that they're going to do away with the
dynamism and the inventiveness of the banking industry? John, could you just give us – either John, just give us
perspective on that and where you think that indeed is happening?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, there's no question that the global regulatory community apparently keeps adding
onto both capital and liquidity requirements that are going to have the combined effect of changing business models,
increasing operating costs, or financing costs. And then applying that to an increased denominator of equity in the ROE
calculation to an industry that, widely speaking – broadly speaking, other than Wells Fargo and perhaps some regional
banks, has not been overachieving in returns over the last couple of years. So if you roll the tape forward, I assume that
that gets mathematically worse before it gets better, unless a higher rate environment, a higher growth environment, a
real optimization on the part of the most impacted banks in terms of changing their business model allows them to
perform at a higher level. So I think it's a consequence of what you're describing. It is happening. And we can't tell how
anybody else is going to deal with it, but we've – as I mentioned earlier, we're proud to continue to generate a top of the
peer group type of set of returns in spite of the amount of capital that we're carrying and the ample liquidity that we're
carrying too.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Nancy, it's an interesting question, and there's no question that there's been increases. Some of
them are settled and different issues become binding constraints in different ways. Of our business, 97% of our
revenues come from the U.S. We love our international business, but we're dominant – our dominant part of our
business is here. That makes it a bit easier for us. And the challenge – and I think the opportunity for leadership is to
make sure that we do both. We meet or exceed the requirements on the capital liquidity and those side, and also we
continue invest in things that attract team members to us, attract customers to us, be dynamic in the marketplace,
differentiating, and we're so embedded in the real economy that the things we're doing continue to allow us to grow that
business. Can never predict the future, but that's a challenge for us as leaders, to do both.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: John, do you see yourself – John Stumpf, do you see yourself as having to change your
plans for growth, either businesses that you would like to be in, do you see that you might have to divest any of your
present businesses should this sort of regulatory mind set continue and intensify?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: At this point in time, the answer is no, because, again, virtually everything we do here starts
with our customer. And we look at relationship value and pricing and different businesses have different returns and so
forth. And we're always thinking about adjusting like few – last quarter we sold some smaller insurance offices. Doesn't
mean we don't like insurance business, we just – but so there's always things that are going on. But there's nothing in
anything that I see today that would say I can't be in this business or we can't be in that business, as it relates to
customers.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Thank you.

<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: I noticed that you had quite a bit of increase in construction loans quarter-over-quarter
after basically staying flat for several years. Is there something in particular that's causing the development and
expansion of construction loans? Or is that something that you're looking at like an initiative going forward?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, we're the largest commercial real estate lender in the country. And, as I have said
someplace recently, you fly around, go in any city, looks like a crane convention going on. I mean, there's a lot of
commercial activity going on, and we serve that community and that sector of the economy. There's also – housing is
better than it has been in the past. So I think it reflects more the natural activity happening in the marketplace as
opposed to us changing our strategy somehow.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Okay. And then in regard to the student loan business, are you still planning on selling
the FFELP portfolio by year-end, or can you talk about the overall investor appetite for these loans? And then...
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We – go ahead.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: And then separately on private side, I know this is a peak lending quarter for student
loans, but could you provide any color around the demand trend from students given the overall level of student debt
out there?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, with respect to the first part of your question, we still do intend to sell those loans.
I can't really comment on the specifics. The sale is moving forward, progressing as expected. And what I can tell you is
like any other fixed income asset category in this highly liquid environment, there's plenty of interest. But in terms of
whether it happens in the fourth quarter or later, I don't want to be too specific. We remain very committed to private
student lending, and, of course, our student lending team now will be even more focused on our private business once
we've sold the FFELP loans. And with respect to whether demand – after accounting for seasonality, as you mentioned,
has changed or not changed, we're at a point in time when a very high number of people are already student borrowers,
but it's still one of the three or four most important things that our customers do. They buy a home, they buy a car, they
finance their education and they save for retirement, and we expect that to continue.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.
John G. Stumpf
Okay. I think we're done with the call now. I want to first of all thank all of you for joining us and thank our 265,000
team members across our company for an outstanding quarter. If you look at the drivers of long-term growth, loans,
deposits, the capital, the liquidity we have, the household growth, it sure makes us optimistic about the future. We
operate within our ROA, ROE and efficiency ratio targets that we had provided a couple years ago. And we're really
proud that we've returned more capital to you, our owners. So we're well positioned for the future, and we'll see you in
90 days. Thank you very much everyone.
