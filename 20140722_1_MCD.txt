measures.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Don.
Don Thompson
Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our second quarter results, I wanted to provide a brief
perspective on our performance relative to our expectations. I also want to share with you how our strategies have
evolved to guide our actions going forward. As we shared with you at our investor meeting last November and in the
last couple of quarterly calls, we entered 2014 well aware of the challenges we face growing comparable sales and
margins amid ongoing broad-based challenges and cost pressures throughout our P&L. And we don't expect any
material changes to the operating environment in the second half of the year. Our financial model is built on growing
comparable sales, which, in turn, drive profitability. So when comparable sales are relatively flat, as in second quarter,
our ability to grow income is significantly impacted.
We've often said that there is no one silver bullet or single solution for driving sustained growth. In fact, the key to our
success over time has been that we have executed multiple initiatives simultaneously. Enduring success requires an
ever stronger foundation. So we are pushing forward on multiple fronts as we focus on those areas within our control to
enhance our relevance and appeal to consumers. Now, earlier this year, we evolved our Plan to Win framework,
refocusing our planning and actions on what matters most to our customers: relevant food choices; easier engagement
with our brand through digital; and greater transparency into the quality of our food and what we stand for as a brand.
Serving good food through good people and being a good neighbor in the communities in which we operate is what
McDonald's stands for.
In April, we shared our updated global Plan to Win framework with the more than 15,000 franchisees, suppliers and
company employees at our biennial worldwide convention. Our decentralized system is now moving forward as one
with more than 35,000 restaurants in 119 countries aligned around an evolved global Plan to Win framework and
executing in a way that takes into account local consumer needs and local business environments. As we work to regain
business momentum, we're pursuing two parallel paths. First, we're strengthening key foundational elements of our
business to deliver a better overall customer experience today. And second, we're making progress on comprehensive
strategies in pursuit of the sizeable growth opportunities that lie before us. These activities are interrelated. And
together, they position us to drive profitable growth over the long-term.
Let me talk first about the work currently underway to fortify foundational elements of our business today. These
include value first. We're evaluating the relationship between pricing and quality perceptions across our menu board
and that's because value is one of our brand pillars. So we must continue to fortify our position within this key
consumer attribute. Second, operations and service: around the world we are enhancing our operations and service
platforms to improve the customer experience and ultimately increase visits. This includes the service resets in the
United States and service and kitchen enhancements in Europe.
Third, marketing: we're taking actions to reestablish our marketing leadership position globally. In some markets, this
means adding fresh perspectives by bringing in new leadership or agency partners. In others, it means heightening our
awareness of how customers use McDonald's and creating stronger messages to reinforce our place in customers' lives.
And around the world, we're also strengthening our creative messages by placing greater emphasis on the quality of our
food and again reestablishing the emotional connection that our customers associate with the McDonald's experience.
The fourth area is simplification. We're streamlining our merchandising, menu board and product offerings. And in
addition to making it easier for customers to order their favorite products, this will reduce complexity in our
restaurants, which, in turn, should enhance accuracy and speed of service. Getting these foundational elements right is
critical to maximizing the impact of the additional growth initiatives that we are actively pursuing within the strategic
priorities of the Plan to Win framework. Specifically, these growth initiatives include menu customization and
personalization, digital engagement and brand trust.

In the area of menu customization and personalization, our initial efforts focus on delivering the best burger experience
to our customers. I'll talk more later about a learning lab we recently established in the United States to help us better
understand what matters most to customers in this arena today. We're also accelerating our digital efforts, as we've
talked about before, leveraging learning from markets like France and Australia, who are now executing some elements
of our e-commerce digital strategies. We're also testing various additional elements of our strategy in other markets,
like the U.S, Sweden and the U.K., as we refine and execute our global digital vision.
And we're taking meaningful action to become an even more respected brand, including our work with the World
Wildlife Fund and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, which was founded by the American Heart Association and
the Clinton Foundation. These represent just a subset of our broader sustainability efforts. We're pursuing these
initiatives holistically and building on investments we've already made to deliver an unparalleled experience to our
customers and consumers in general. It's these combined efforts that give me confidence in the future and our ability to
drive enduring profitable growth for our system and our shareholders over the long-term.
Let's now turn to performance for the quarter. Global comparable sales were relatively flat for the second quarter and
comparable quest counts were negative. Operating income was down 1% in constant currencies and earnings per share
was $1.40, a 1% increase in constant currencies. Several markets delivered solid results. Stronger operating income
performance in China, the U.K. and France was offset by weaker performance in markets including Germany, Japan,
the U.S. and Australia. These four markets remain priority areas of focus for us. And I'll talk more later about the
actions we're taking in these markets to re-ignite momentum.
We're moving with a sense of urgency, but recognize that it will take time to see the results of our actions. Our
franchise business model is a clear advantage for us, but it also requires alignment around our plans and actions and
this takes time. Once aligned, it takes time to enact changes in the restaurant and time for our customers to notice the
changes we've made and reward us with more visits. Therefore, we expect continued volatility across markets for the
second half of the year and expect full-year 2014 global comparable sales to be relatively similar to year-to-date June
performance, with July global comparable sales expected to be negative.
Let's talk more specifically about performance and the actions we're taking by geography, starting with the U.S. In the
United States, comparable sales for the quarter were down 1.5% and operating income increased 1%. While
comparable sales were disappointing, the U.S. is making progress in three critical areas: improving service through
their operations reset; focusing on menu; and strengthening our marketing position. The service reset was designed to
place greater emphasis on the critical role of proper staffing, scheduling and positioning in our restaurants across all
dayparts. Over the last six months, our operations support staff have been consulting with all franchised and
company-owned restaurants to recalibrate around service and customer experience standards.
Restaurants across the U.S. are now executing their plans. And we're beginning to see a reduction in order accuracy
complaints. From a menu standpoint, we're placing great emphasis on the balance between our core classics and the
number of new products that are being introduced into the marketplace. And this is to ensure that they can be delivered
at the speed and convenience that customers expect from McDonald's.
We're also continuing to innovate. We recently capped a restaurant on the West Coast and created a learning lab to help
us better understand what matters most to customers when it comes to delivering the absolute best burger experience. It
definitely starts with great ingredients, like our high-quality burger, 100% beef with a pinch of salt and pepper, but it's
more than that. It's about creating an engaging experience that addresses all elements of customers' sensory perceptions
and leverages the investments that we've already made in technology, reimaging our physical plants and digital to
create a more personalized, memorable experience that our customers will feel good about.
The U.S. is also taking actions to strengthen marketing leadership. We reorganized the Marketing department and are
reallocating our media mix to place greater emphasis on digital channels. We're also strengthening our creative to
connect more deeply with customers, placing an even greater emphasis on the quality of our great food and on the
strong emotional connection that customers already have with our great brand.

Let's now move to Europe, where comparable sales were down 1% for the quarter and operating income was down 4%
in constant currencies. These results reflect solid performance in the U.K. and France, partially offset by weak results in
Germany and a slowdown in Russia. The U.K.'s track record of solid performance continues, due, in part, to its strong
customer-centric planning process. While second quarter comparable sales were positive, they softened compared to
recent trends, partially because we're now lapping last year's successful blended ice roll-out.
We continue to grow market share through strong premium promotional activity, which is complemented by an
ongoing focus on breakfast, extended hours and side-by-side drive-thrus. Comparable sales continue to be positive in
France. And we're gaining market share, despite a contracting informal eating out industry. The recent launch of a new
premium chicken patty in April helped reinforce strong food quality perceptions in the marketplace.
Germany remains a primary area of focus, as negative sales and guest count momentum continues. The leadership team
is actively working to reset the foundation, focusing its efforts on improving our food quality and value perceptions and
regaining consumers' trust. This includes strengthening our Marketing organization in creative and evaluating our
affordability platform to ensure that we offer compelling value to customers across the entire menu.
Now, let's shift to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, where comparable sales were up 1.1% for the quarter and
operating income increased 1% in constant currencies. Strong comparable sales performance in China, as well as
positive performance in many other markets, were somewhat offset by continued weakness in Japan. In China,
comparable sales increased 8.8% for the quarter, partly reflecting the lap of last year's avian influenza. Given volatile
consumer sentiment in China, we're focused on enhancing our all-day value platform and drive traffic and grow market
share. At the same time, we're building on our strong momentum in breakfast and through brand extensions, such as
delivery, dessert kiosks and McCafé.
In Australia, affordability remains key to driving traffic, with consumer confidence at the lowest levels since 2008.
We're strengthening our value proposition by relaunching our Loose Change Menu, with compelling value offers. And
we're also making it easier for our customers to enjoy the great tasting McCafé beverages that they've grown to love.
Negative momentum in Japan persists amid a highly competitive environment and a contracting informal eating out
industry. The leadership team remains focused on regaining customer relevance and loyalty by re-positioning the
affordability platform to resonate more strongly with customers, while working to differentiate the McDonald's
experience through menu innovation and a focus on the family and Happy Meal business.
Around the world, markets continue to adjust their plans to be even more relevant to customers, but we recognize,
again, that it will take time to re-ignite momentum. Overall, 2014 is a year of strengthening the foundational drivers of
our business, activities that are critical in enabling and advancing our longer-term strategies.
Even during periods of softer performance, our business continues to generate significant levels of cash. Our first
priority regarding the use of cash is to invest in our business to drive future growth and future returns. In addition,
we've established an $18 billion to $20 billion cash return to shareholders target between 2014 and 2016. Year-to-date
June, we've returned $2.8 billion toward that goal.
I want to close by re-emphasizing my confidence in McDonald's. We continue to move forward as one system guided
by the framework of our global Plan to Win and relentlessly focused on the significant opportunities that exist within
our strategic global growth prioritizes: to optimize our menu by serving our customers' favorite food and drink; to
modernize the customer experience, so that it is even more memorable; to broaden accessibility, so that we deliver
unparalleled convenience and to become an even more trusted and respected brand. We're moving forward thoughtfully
and with a sense of urgency. Our plans and actions build on our core strengths. And I'm confident that they will
ultimately result in additional business from new and existing customers.
Thanks again, everyone. I'll now turn it over to Pete.

Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. The McDonald's System and our financial model are built with the expectation of
future sales growth. Yet, we know from history that our top-line growth over time is neither consistent nor linear. In
addition, any growth is a product of the significant bace off of which we operate, which includes serving approximately
70 million customers every day and generating industry-leading average unit volumes in virtually all of the countries in
which we operate.
Importantly, this large base also provides financial resiliency during periods of softer performance. Though we did not
meet our growth targets through the first six months, McDonald's still generated over $4.1 billion of operating income.
Our strong financial foundation allows us to remain focused on the significant long-term opportunities that we believe
McDonald's is uniquely positioned to seize, which is why we continue our disciplined approach to investing in targeted
growth opportunities.
We know that enduring success requires an ever-stronger foundation. So we are pushing forward on multiple fronts,
guided by our evolved Plan to Win framework and the strategic growth priorities. As Don discussed, it takes time to
evaluate and align with franchisees on the changes needed and then implement them in our restaurants in time for
customers to notice the changes and reward us with increased visits. I am confident that we are taking the right steps to
strengthen our foundation and position the company for future growth. Our charge over the next 12 to 18 months is to
accelerate the changes, effectively communicate the enhancements to our customers and execute at the highest
standards in our restaurants.
Now, turning to the results, for the six months ended June, system-wide sales increased 3% in constant currencies,
primarily due to expansion. Combined operating margin declined 60 basis points to 29.7% over that same period,
reflecting the softer results. McDonald's is primarily a franchisor, with over 80% of our global restaurants operated by
local businessmen and women. As such, franchise margins drive overall profitability, comprising approximately 70%
of restaurant margin dollars. In second quarter, the franchise margin dollars increased 2% in constant currencies, while
the margin percent declined 60 basis points to 82.2%. Expansion continued to contribute to the margin dollar growth,
whereas soft comparable sales, increased rent and depreciation expense, and the impact of refranchising pressured the
margin percent.
Global company-operated margin dollars for the quarter totaled $816 million, a 3% decline in constant currencies. The
margin percent decreased 60 basis points to 17.1%, as relatively flat comparable sales could not offset cost pressures
throughout the P&L.
Europe's margin decline, which I will discuss in a moment, accounted for the majority of the global margin decline. In
the U.S., second quarter company-operated margins declined 40 basis points to 18.3%, due to higher labor and 3%
higher commodity costs. As a result of effective risk management efforts and supplier production efficiencies, we are
maintaining our full-year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket of 1% to 2%.
In terms of pricing, the U.S. is running about 3% at the end of June. This is the midpoint for the full year 2014
projected food-away-from-home inflation of 2.5% to 3.5%. Through June, food-away-from-home inflation stands at
2.2%. So we will be disciplined with future price increases as we move through the second half of the year.
In Europe, second quarter company-operated margins decreased 80 basis points to 18.6%, primarily impacted by higher
commodity costs in Russia and Ukraine due to weaker currencies, as well as negative performance in Germany. Russia
and Ukraine import approximately half of their commodities, most of which are denominated in either euros or U.S.
dollars. For a perspective, Russia and Ukraine accounted for nearly all of Europe's second quarter company-operated
margin decline.
Europe's projected full-year commodity cost increase remains at 1% to 2%. Excluding currency, commodity costs were
relatively flat in the first half of the year, which implies a second half increase of about 2%. Our menu price increases
in Europe vary by market, with the overall segment averaging about 2% year-over-year.
Turning to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins for the quarter decreased 60 basis points
to 13.7%, as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher labor, occupancy and other costs. In addition,
new restaurant openings negatively impacted the segment's margin percent, though to a lesser degree than a year ago.

The decline in the margin percent was also impacted by the mix of relatively lower margin markets, like China,
contributing a greater share of the overall margin dollars. That being said, we are encouraged by the margin percent
improvements we are seeing in certain individual markets, including China, in this high growth area of the world.
With our current sales outlook and expected currency volatility in some of our company-owned markets, we expect
continued pressure on consolidated company-operated margins in the second half, with more significant pressure in the
U.S. due to higher labor expenses, partly as a result of planned minimum wage increases in several states and likely
less benefit from pricing.
Second quarter G&A expenses increased 3% in constant currencies, primarily due to our biennial worldwide
convention in April and higher employee costs, partly related to our long-term growth initiatives. One of our key
competitive advantages is our size and scale. And our convention is integral to maintaining alignment, so that we can
move together as one system. We have reduced our full-year projected constant currency G&A increase from 8% to 4%
to 5%, primarily due to lower incentive-based compensation as a result of not expecting to meet our growth targets.
Even with softer performance, the McDonald's business model continues to generate significant amounts of cash. Our
first priority remains reinvesting this cash in our business to build future returns and enhance shareholder value. These
investments are balanced between opening 1,500 to 1,600 new restaurants and reimaging over 1,000 existing locations
in 2014. We remain committed to this effort and are making steady progress toward these targets.
Through June, we have opened 461 new restaurants globally. And relative to reimaging, we have completed about 90
projects in the U.S., 100 in Europe and 120 in APMEA. Similar to prior years, new restaurant openings and reimaging
projects tend to be more loaded in the back half of the year.
Lastly, let me discuss foreign currency translation, which positively impacted second quarter EPS by $0.01. At current
exchange rates, we expect minimal impact on third quarter EPS, with a full-year negative impact of $0.04 to $0.05. As
usual, please take this as directional guidance only, because rates will change as we progress through the second half of
the year.
In closing, I remain confident in the choices we are making to position McDonald's for enduring profitable growth. We
are patiently and deliberately making investments today to strengthen our foundation and leverage our significant
competitive advantages in the $1.2 trillion global informal eating out category. Thanks.
Now, I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.
Kathy H. Martin
Great. Thanks, Pete. I'm going to open the call for analyst and investor questions.
Q&A
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: [Operator Instructions] So we're going to start with Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: Thank you. Thank you very much and good morning. I guess my question here is, how much
do you believe your ability to re-grow same-store sales in the system is really completely under your control at this
point? And what I meant by that is you look at your business and you're at peak sales per unit really without
game-changing platforms in the pipe, with competition that's arguably more of a headwind than you've ever witnessed.
And so I guess what I'm trying to understand, from your perspective, is what is it really that you can tweak at this point,
given all these factors, that is really going to get some serious incrementality out of this asset base? You know you talk
about better service, improved marketing, getting better at breakfast. And I just wonder if that's enough to really
continue to try to get incrementality out of a $2.6 million – $2.5 million average unit volume?
<A - Don Thompson>: Hey, Brian. This is Don. Thanks for the question. Brian, I think there's two different things that
are taking place. If I look at the longer-term, and you're asking kind of two questions, I think, the short and the

longer-term. If I look at the longer-term, Brian, I would tell you the strategic growth priorities that are set for the U.S.
business and around the world are solid, very solid. And they're really focused on, and let's take the U.S., menu
customization and personalization. And I mentioned starting with burger leadership, accelerating digital engagement,
actually, both the engagement and the experience, so e-commerce is a part of that, along with some other things that
we're looking at delivering to our customer base and then enhancing the overall brand relevance and trust, particularly
around our food quality and employment opportunity images in the side of the business that people look to relative to
that. So and those things are part of a much broader sustainability movement, if you would, in McDonald's than many
people have seen. I feel really, really good about where those strategies are going.
Those, combined with some of the broader development strategies we've seen in markets like APMEA, those
longer-term strategies are solid. In the shorter-term, what we're looking for is to fortify the base, the foundation, of
McDonald's today, so that we're ready for those growth opportunities. So to your point, as we look at the basic
marketing strengthening right now, are we making sure that the presence that we have, the awareness that we have and
the share of voice that we have are solid, strong and allocated to the appropriate media. That's being fortified.
If I look at the operational reset in the U.S., it is focused on the peak periods and our ability to deliver at those peak
periods, which has something to do, clearly, with the productivity in the restaurants and the staffing levels in the
restaurants. And these are things that our leadership operators have discussed in the United States with our U.S. team
and they're moving forward on those things.
So to fortify breakfast, the food quality messaging, the operations focus on the peak periods and staffing scheduling
positioning and then reasserting marketing leadership, those are foundational pieces, but they have to be reestablished,
Brian. Those, to your point, are probably more incremental. The other things that I mentioned, the longer-term growth
strategies, are stronger relative to how we look at growth into the future.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Buckingham.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Thank you. Wondering if you could talk a little or give us an update on the back of the house
prep tables in the United States and if we could expect – what type of margin benefit at the store level have you seen
there or the benefits that you can talk about that as well as any sort of new products that we could see as far as with the
extended refrigeration life, what does this enable you to do maybe going down the line?
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks, Matt. I'll talk a little bit about broader menu pipeline and then we can talk about the
back of the house. Relative to the broader menu pipeline, in the U.S. right now, they're really focused on a balance
between our core products, the core classic favorites, the Big Macs, the Quarters, the Nuggets, et cetera and also the
new products and new innovation. There are numerous products and ideas that are in the pipeline and in the global
pipeline from around the world. Our U.S. team is currently testing some of those and looking at some of those. They
are still in the areas that we've mentioned of chicken, beef, breakfast and beverages. So if I look at the broader menu,
that part is intact.
Relative to the kitchen and the productivity and efficiency initiatives in the kitchen, the high-density kitchen was
intended to give us more flexibility and allow refrigeration on the prep table, which gives us a little bit stronger
capability relative to products. You will see, and have seen, a couple of products, but you will be seeing more products
relative to that, but I want everyone to keep in mind this is going to be a balanced approach. It is not all new products
and not taking care of the core classics and favorites, because we need to see baseline improvements in all the core
products as well as a boost over the baseline based upon the new products that we implement.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question is from Joe Buckley, Bank of America.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you. Sort of a broad question talking about the global operating environment and
certainly the operating environment in the U.S. being tough for a couple of years now and the strategies you're
implementing are very execution-focused, and really haven't changed but also don't seem to be gaining fraction. What
should we be thinking about over the next 12 to 18 months from an incremental change that can drive sales?

And then secondly, does it make sense to keep opening stores at the pace, the current pace of expansion? I guess I'm
asking the question globally, because especially in the U.S., where I think you have a couple of hundred net stores
targeted, if I'm not mistaken.
<A - Don Thompson>: Hey, Joe. Thanks for the question. Last part first, if you look at the U.S. and you look at a
couple of hundred stores, keep in mind a large portion of those are relocation-based restaurants that we have, so on a
percentile basis, the U.S. is not opening a lot of stores. We are opening in opportunities and there continues to be
market opportunities for McDonald's. But there are not a lot of restaurants in the U.S. I think the number is about 120
stores net in the U.S. business.
So the broader development opportunities and growth opportunities across the Asia/Pacific, Middle East, Africa region
across markets like Russia. Clearly Pete, I and the team are looking at some of the markets, like the Russias of the
world given this current economic environment and determining what we decide to do, Russia, China, what that pace of
growth looks like. We do that in an ongoing way.
In the U.S., the focal point that we have to grow this business is, as I mentioned, secure the foundational elements of
the business. We've got to make sure that our restaurants, both company-operated and franchise, are operating at the
right level. So this is not about one side or the other side. This is simply about making sure that the restaurants are
running well and that they're staffed effectively. Clearly, there has been some level of trepidation relative to staffing up
our restaurants based upon some of the legislative impact of things that are coming down the pipe, such as whether it be
healthcare reform or the potential of minimum wage from a Federal perspective, but even more broadly, more state
minimum wage increases.
So there's a little trepidation relative to that, but, as I mentioned earlier, the franchisees, with our company team in the
U.S., have really had some great discussions around what they call Operations Reset and are focused on building the
business at those peak periods. We understand how profitable that is across the dayparts, but we're also not giving up
on the growth strategies. Those growth strategies around digital engagement, around what we are able to do with our
ability to have a balanced menu and to afford customization for our customers, that, incorporated with some of the
things that we're looking at and doing relative to reestablishing a higher respected brand profile for McDonald's, all of
those things are going to be well intact and moving forward. So over the next, you know, 12 to 18 months, expect to
see us focused on both those parallel paths. In the near-term, you're going to see more on the foundational piece
through the rest of 2014. You will see more of the other aspects at some point in 2015.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good morning. I just – I wanted to piggyback on the last question and maybe ask from
a big picture perspective, why do you think it's taking so long to stabilize the sales trends in places like the U.S. and
Germany? And I guess part two of the question would be is do you think you need to make more radical changes to the
strategy than what you're talking about based on the trajectory or the recovery or maybe lack of recovery that you're
seeing?
<A - Don Thompson>: All right, David. Thanks for the question. I'll speak about this in two different ways. One is I'll
give a little update on the priority markets. And the other one is really how do we look at, I'll call it, turnaround time?
The taking the turnaround time piece first, we are clearly moving with a sense of urgency. And anyone inside the
system knows that and it's quite an aggressive sense of urgency. Toward the end of the first quarter, we had the priority
market visits, as we had talked about earlier on one of our calls. Post that times, the markets themselves with the
franchisees and the company employees, have been getting together to discuss the local action plans that it takes to
drive the business.
It just so happens that most of these markets, those opportunities are around the three areas we've talking about: around
the value/affordability arena; around the strength and focus of our marketing and how we are marketing with a balance
between core and new products; and also making sure that, as we look at our broader business, that we are focused on
bringing customers forward and they understand the transparency and food quality levels within McDonald's.

So those things are things we're moving forward aggressively on and the markets are putting those plans together. In a
franchised organization like ours, it does take some time. As I mentioned, the strength of our system is our franchisees.
There's no doubt about it. At the same time, it takes time to get that alignment and then time to get these things in the
restaurants and time for them to move forward. So we understand that. We understand the timeline. We want to do it
right. I don't want to continue to have implementations that are not consumer-based, because then we come back six, 12
months later and we're changing those again. So we're doing these things in the right way with the right processes, but
it does take some time.
The other piece relative to the priority markets, just a bit of an update, different markets will take different times
relative to their recovery pace. If you all remember back in the early 2000s, the U.K. was a challenging market. It took
us several years. And, interestingly enough, to focus of similar things that we're talking about now, a slightly deeper
hole at that time, but we've been able to come back with a very balanced approach and we've had very strong market
success.
Germany, today, is in that kind of a mode. We've got to have that kind of a recovery. Similar to U.K., Japan is in a
similar mode as that. I think the U.S. is moving forward a bit, at a bit more aggressive or stronger or quicker pace, if
you would. However, it is still going to take time in the U.S. as we solidify these foundational elements. Australia,
Australia also I think will be at a quicker pace. We're able to still do some innovations in Australia while we fortify
some of these base elements. In all of these markets, we've had some changes in our marketing functions, in our
marketing leadership. Some of these markets have had changes in our agencies. We've had some other leadership
personal changes in some of the markets.
So we believe we are moving forward urgently and aggressively, but we're also doing it in a way that will have some
long-standing impact. And believe me, this is not the kind of thing that I'm comfortable about. This is not the kind of
thing that I would say I sleep well at night over thinking that the pace of change is as quickly as I would like. But I
know that the markets are going through this in an appropriate way and at an appropriate pace and they are doing it
with a sense of urgency.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from David Palmer from RBC.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you. It does not look like McDonald's is defending traffic like it's done in similar
periods of low industry growth like 2009. You got price increases. I think you said 3% and, obviously, you're not
pounding away on the Dollar Menu like you did back then. But I know traffic is important to you guys. So when
McDonald's does improve its traffic, how do you – perhaps it's a 2015 event, what do you think would be that driver,
the key ingredients for that is? Will you lean on operations changes and digital engagement or perhaps could we see a
return to more active food news or something else? Thanks.
<A - Don Thompson>: David, I think you just hit them, but, again, I'll say that there's parallel paths here. We have to
make sure that the foundation is strong enough to accept the digital strategies and engagement that we're going to be
putting into the restaurant. The operational foundation has to be strong enough for us to be able to more forward with
customization and personalization at the level that we want to at McDonald's. Back in 2000 and – if you look in the
2008, 2009 timeframe, this was a slightly different timeframe, several things and I'll mention a couple of them. One of
them, the strength of the broader legislative impact on cash flow was not as aggressive. Having said that, what that
means is that clearly as a franchisee or a franchisor, as we look at the margins, there is, as I mentioned earlier, there has
been some trepidation around if you staff up, then is this going to hurt cash flow even more? But I think that the
strength of the U.S. team, with our franchisees, is addressing that and beginning to address that appropriately relative to
the need for us to do that to move into these growth strategies, so that part is a little bit different.
The other thing that's different is that back then, we made a modification to the Dollar Menu, which was merely
product-based. And we were able to do that with one product change or, at the time, we had two product changes over
about a five-year period. At this point, we are looking at the overall pricing structure of our menu board, because we
have seen a bit of a split relative to the lower end of the menu and then the higher end. All of these things the U.S. team
is looking at as we look at the price tiers. So there are a couple of differences, David, nonetheless, we're not giving up
on value or affordability. And I know it's one of the things that's being implemented in the U.S. business.

<A - Peter Bensen>: And, David, as you think about pricing for the rest of this year, we've said we're up about 3%
trailing 12 June, but in May, we had about 90 basis points of pricing roll-off from a year ago, and we only replaced that
with about 30 basis points of pricing. And as we look to that broader food-away-from-home, that's projected to be up
2.5% to 3.5%. It's only up to 2.2% through June. So we're keeping an eye on all those metrics, too. So don't think we
aren't conscious of what that consumer is feeling today and their ability to come into McDonald's more often and kind
of walking that delicate balance between that aspect of the business as well as some of these additional cross pressures
that Don mentioned that are coming down the pike.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you very much. Don, maybe a follow-up, you talked a lot about the
franchise system and how it takes a little bit of time to move that system relative to if you owned it yourself, but, at the
same time, I think you noted earlier this year that the franchisees, based on your meetings with them, your discussions,
and whatnot, they're still very engaged and supportive of the corporate initiative. I guess you had your convention
recently, but perhaps that's driven by the fact that profitably is still close to peak levels. But what are the complaints or
rumblings you're hearing, if any, of late? I don't know whether there's any things that management feels the need that
we need to prioritize this to address, whether it's the new product news, the promotional activity, pricing, remodels. I'm
just kind of wondering how that sentiment and how those relationships just over the past couple of years with the
struggles are trending.
<A - Don Thompson>: Yeah, thanks, Jeff. Any time there is softness in cash flow, we will have – we have to have
even more effective discussions, even more planning together as to how we move the business, and there will always
be concerns when we see softness in cash flow. This is a for-profit business. And so that's going to occur. And our
franchisees have those concerns, as well as we do in company-operated restaurants. So just to set that stage, we will
always have, when there's a softness in cash flow, the conversations we're having now. And the franchisees are not –
they are not at all-time highs. They've seen high levels of cash flow and so they want to get back to some of those
levels, clearly. And we want them back at those levels so that they can have personal cash flow, but invest in the
business, invest in the communities the way that they do. So we have engaged in clearly a lot more conversations and
communications around where we need to take this business.
The other thing I'll say, though, there's a realization that the franchisees have. They're not seeking and searching for a
silver bullet either. They understand what they've executed in the past to grow the business. It has been a group of
initiatives that have had tremendous impact on multiple fronts. So as we look forward into the future, the fact that we're
talking about food and the food experience, the fact that we're talking about the in-restaurant experience with digital
engagement experiences, the fact that we're talking about how this brand is perceived by consumers in their local
communities, all of those things fit very well together. And I think the franchisees are excited about that.
Clearly, in the current situation and environment, there are concerns that the franchisees have. And that is what we are
working through with them. But I will say that our leadership groups have been at the table and have been solid relative
to the way that they have given input, thoughts, and guidance in certain areas they'd like to see us move in. And we're
moving in many of those areas.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeff D. Farmer>: Thank you. Just shifting gears a little bit, as you guys think about your plan to refranchise, I
think you said at least 1,500 restaurants by the end of 2016, how should we view that as a potential impact on not only
that consolidated operating income margin, but also your ROIC number? And again, I just ask that in the context of I
think we're all pretty familiar with the margin tailwind you saw going back to the mid to late 2000s with developmental
licensing and things like that in Latin America, big margin tailwind, big ROIC tailwind. As you look at these group of
1,500 restaurants, how should we think about them?
<A - Peter Bensen>: Jeff, yeah, good question. Thanks. First of all, in terms of just to set expectations in terms of the
timing, we've done about 200 refranchises through this year. When we think about it the next two years, 2015 and
2016, will probably carry the bulk of that refranchising activity, in part, because there are some markets that we really

need to build that franchising infrastructure around to get that going in a more significant way.
That being said, directionally, while we haven't quantified some of those benefits that you're calling out, directionally,
those are benefits that we would expect to see to the P&L. So we expect franchising does have a favorable impact to
our overall combined operating margin. It does have a favorable impact to the G&A levels that we need to support the
business. It does have a favorable impact to the ROIIC, so those are all directionally consistent with where we plan to
go with this refranchising.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Don, you say you're moving with urgency, but, around that, you must have a set of deadlines
internally and some goals. And it seems like you've pushed this out. Originally, maybe you're talking about the first
half of this year being a reset and maybe some benefits to the second half. Now it seems like it's really going to be
pushed off into 2015. So what are the milestones specifically that you hope to achieve this year or even next quarter
toward those goals? And specifically, when are we going to see tangible benefits from both the customization and the
digital strategy either if it's this year or if it's 2015, what is the timeframe for those things?
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks, John. The last part, customization and digital strategies, we're seeing certain things in
some markets already. So we've got – clearly, as I mentioned, there are some things that we've been doing in France.
There are some things that we're already doing in Australia from a test perspective. You'll see some limited testing in
the U.S. the latter part of the year. 2015, again, you'll see more robustness in terms of some of the things that will come
to market in 2015. That is not saying that'll be January 1. That is saying that it'll be in 2015. The aspects around what
we're doing on customization and personalization, clearly, there's some things that we are looking at getting going this
year relative to testing. It's a big system, getting the operators engaged. And I think the U.S. system has begun to do
that. So I would say that you'll see more of that in 2015. That probably is as specific as I would get on that one.
I think that we also had, if I look across Europe, some very similar initiatives, some of the markets, as I mentioned,
U.K., Sweden, are doing some of the testing on digital. And, again, we just mentioned France, where they are. Australia
will be a little sooner on the digital end, however, that's 2015. As we look at that latter part of 2014, you'll see some. So
that kind of gives you the digital perspective.
The menu piece and reestablishing our leadership from a menu and marketing perspective, when we talk about
milestones, the milestones I have for the priority markets, so in Germany, we had to reestablish our marketing function.
We have to reestablish a more solid and balanced marketing plan. That is what the German team is working through
now with the franchisees.
In Australia, they're having some similar conversations of working through that aspect of it and the balance between
affordability core and the innovative nature of some of the new products. Clearly, in the U.S., we've talked quite a bit
about that. There is a sense of urgency. Yes, there are milestones relative to certain things. We'll have – I have thoughts
about everything from when certain changes occur. We're in the midst of the planning process now. And so we're
looking at the plans for 2015 as we move forward. However, we have not given up on 2014. We have a lot of activities
now to shore up the bases I've talked about and mentioned.
So from a milestone perspective, believe me, they are there. They are aggressive. We talk about them routinely and we
see them as we visit the marketplaces. What we're mindful of, John, is the fact that we want to make sure that this is
done, again, so it has sustaining and staying power, which means in our system, this has to be a collaborative approach
between ourselves and our franchisees. That's when things stay and last in the McDonald's System. So I feel that it's
moving in an appropriate direction. I am impatient as well. Believe me, our senior team is. Our operators are, but we
have to do this and do it in the right way, so that we have long-term enduring profitable growth and not just a flash in
the pan. But these are holistic solutions that will come together and I'm confident they'll drive the business over the
long-term.

<Q - Jason T. West>: Yeah, thanks. I guess just following up on a lot of the other lines of questioning here, just you
guys have obviously not been sitting on your hands the last couple of years, but – and you've seen some progress in
certain markets, but, overall, some of these trends just seem to be getting worse. So I was just wondering if you feel
like you've identified why the traffic numbers are declining and you have a much better sense of that now than maybe
you did a year ago. And is the learning lab that you mentioned on the West Coast to help understand what customers
want, kind of talk about how that's going to help you understand where the traffic's going and how to get people back in
the stores.
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks for the question, Jason. When we talk about our learning lab, so we have a learning lab
in the U.S. relative to that. We have a digital function over in Europe and France. We had the architecture decor studio
also over in France. So we have looked at – we have a lot of data on consumers and what consumers are looking for
from a trend perspective. When we look at our base trendlines and why they move where they move, why they've
eroded in these priority markets, we do today have a much better understanding of exactly why. We've had a bit of an
understanding in the past; however, our actions have not coincided with the actual, I would say, the data themselves,
when we put actions in place.
And we've hurried some of the actions. What we're doing now is looking at what those consumer expectations are and
putting together plans that are directly linked and related to those consumer expectations. That is what we're attempting
to do. So this is not chasing short-term sales or short-term guest counts. We are looking to continue to have a sustained
ability to grow guest counts, sales and profitability. So there are – clearly, there are things that we're looking at as we
move forward and those are some of the initiatives, as I've mentioned, as we've said on the call.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Great. Next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to jump over maybe to another part of the world, just ask
about China because I know you've called it out as a point of strength. It looked like maybe June slowed in China,
maybe pretty meaningfully. I wanted to ask about that trend. I assume it's unrelated to some of the negative press we've
seen, but if you could just comment on both of those dynamics, as well as I think Pete mentioned maybe some – there's
still a drag on margins from that kind of the lower margin and the mix there. Is that in any way a function I think of you
having gone after more of a value message? Or is it just the sort of continued need to kind of scale up to see the
margins hit kind of more system-wide averages?
<A - Peter Bensen>: Sara, it's Pete. I'll start on the margin end of that and Don will talk more broadly about trends in
China. Our APMEA margins over the next couple quarters are going to be a little bit misleading, because while we're
seeing growth in individual countries, so the quarter and year-to-date, we've seen growth in the margin in Australia, in
China, in Hong Kong, our three largest McOpCo markets in APMEA.
The fact that we've re-franchised in Australia, which is our highest McOpCo margin percentage, is changing the mix to
a lower margin percentage in total and the fact that the Australian dollar is weaker when you translate that into U.S.
dollars, that's giving even less weighting to Australia's high margins overall. So the segment, you know, virtually all of
the segment decline was as a result of these weighting and re-franchising combinations.
China itself grew margins in the quarter and year-to-date. And the drag from the new stores was down significantly
from a year ago. Now, positive comps are clearly a driver of that, but the team – you may have heard Dave Hoffmann
and the team over there talk about the go-to-market strategy, which is a very concentrated effort not only in China but
in some of our other emerging markets, to really look at the cost of opening the new restaurants and challenging the
level of investment that we need to today. Or can we build the restaurant with a little less cost today, but build it in such
a way that we can expand it easily in the future when you know sales volume dictate versus building the restaurant
today for a sales volume that we might not achieve until five years from now. So a much smarter approach, I would
say, to the development and we're starting to see some of those benefits already in our margins in China. And Don can
talk a little bit more broadly about the market.
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks, Sara, and thanks, Pete. Actually in China, Sara, our market – the market is performing
solidly, quite solidly. And I'll give you a little bit of background, a little backdrop on China relative to the economy and

then our performance, which actually if you look at our performance excluding the benefit of avian influenza for the
second quarter, it still would've been positive. So in over a two-year perspective, we are growing our business in China.
We're growing market share in China. Top ten markets, we're outpacing the competition in terms of growing market
share. So we're growing solidly in China. The macro environment is still challenged. There's fluctuating consumer
sentiment and that's expected to carry over into quarter three.
IEO visits are starting to recover a bit, but it's a little bit lower than it was a year ago. I would tell you that despite that,
some of the things we've talked about in some of the other markets actually bode true for China and we made those
adjustments. So all-day value, we went from just a lunchtime value to an all-day value platform. That continues to
perform well. Again, relative to avian influenza, we're comping on top of what the impact of that was. Brand extensions
are helping us to move forward. We've focused on breakfast in China for the last several years. That's continuing to be
a positive contributor. And some of these things are even in the face of other initiatives that we've implemented, some
of the things we focused on with the night business last year.
So China is actually moving in a positive direction. And we feel solid about the performance in China. It is still a
challenging economy, however, and everyone should realize that. GDP is below 8% and we know what that means.
There's still some acceleration in some of the operating-related costs relative to labor as they look to normalize, if you
would, or redistribute some of the wealth across China so everyone grows a bit. But they're still growing automobiles.
We're still growing drive-thrus. Our sites are, to Pete's point, are solid in terms of the new sites they we're opening. We
closed some of the sites last year because we thought they may have been too early. I think Kenneth and the team had
done a great job with that. So relative to China, we're feeling, again, that the performance in China is solid.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Great. So we have six folks still in the queue. I know we're just about out of time, but we are
going to take those six. So for those of you who can stay over for a few minutes, you know, we'll carry on. So next
question is from Bryan Elliott from Raymond James.
<Q - Bryan C. Elliott>: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks. Just as you look at the news this week out of China, are we at a
tipping point? Are you considering potentially backwardly immigrating to protect your brand and what really are the
solutions to the situation there from a supplier standpoint?
<A - Don Thompson>: Hi, Bryan. We have some very solid suppliers across the McDonald's System. And they, as we
are, are committed to the highest standards of food safety for our customers. And that's always the number one priority.
As we look at, you know, some of the alleged issues that are taking place now, you know, if those things clearly are
confirmed at a level that we would think it is a higher-level decision that is caused us to have a breach relative to
consumer trust, we will deal with that effectively, swiftly and appropriately. We are no longer serving a product from
the primary facility there that has the challenges and the issues.
I know that there's a couple other facilities that they had that have been cleared now by the Chinese Government. The
matter is being thoroughly investigated. And we're cooperating fully with the authorities. As you know, we do have
audits of our suppliers. In this case, we do feel that we were a bit deceived relative to one of these plants, so we're
clearly looking at that. What does it mean from a broader perspective relative to integration of the supply chain?
We enjoy and have benefited from what we call the three-legged stool, which is the supply chain as a separate entity,
just as our franchisees are a separate entity, other than McDonald's Corporation. They bring great us innovations.
They've grown with us in multiple countries around the world. They understand our expectations. They understand the
way we value consumer safety and our standards and they understand the fact that they will be under scrutiny if there is
ever a challenge relative to our consumers. And so we continue to make those points. And we continue to drive forward
to make sure that we protect our customers and protect the broader brand interest as we move forward in issues like this
one.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Hi. Great. Thank you. Just some related U.S. topics, if I may, I remember back in 2002,
again, I think it was actually using some franchise consultants, you really drove some QSC&V into franchisees and
either showed them a path to measurable improvement at the store level or showed them a path to exiting the system.

So at what point are you kind of in another phase in terms of getting a 20 year commitment out of franchisees and
making sure you know that you have the right people on board with you?
And the second, I think related topic is around the effectiveness and the efficiency of your advertising and product
development, does seems to be lagging your peers even a fraction of the size. So was wondering if there was a
structural opportunity to change the effectiveness and the speed to market of that advertising and product development
in the U.S. or whether it's just I think, as I've heard, that it's just about improving execution or tactics? Thanks.
<A - Don Thompson>: Hey, John. Thanks for the question. Relative to the franchisees and, John, you know we have a
lot of collaboration and committees that are shared between the franchisees and the company and our suppliers. So as
we engage and address the business as we move forward, we have a lot of communication with each other. One of
those points of communications clearly, every year, is around operating standards of McDonald's and what we call
growth criteria and also the restaurant operations improvement process, which is really focused on quality food, quality
service and cleanliness in the restaurants. And we have had clearly a lot of conversations about how and when and
where and what the processes are for abiding by that. We still have those processes in place.
Those processes started back, to your point, in the 2001, 2002 timeframe. They are in place, everything from a process
for improvement for those restaurants that are not performing at the appropriate levels, to how we look at franchisee
engagement, to how we look at our own company-operated restaurant performance. So we don't need to have a separate
initiative. And I think you know as you talk about it, it was almost I got a sense of an up or out kind of a conversation.
We have ongoing conversations with each other relative to the performance of our restaurants. And clearly, are we
having those now? Yes we are. We have them all the time.
But what's important is that we focus on the standards and adherence to the standards, not some kind of a process to
move franchisees out of the business. We have a process and, frankly, based on our improvement processes, we tend to
be able to improve the business in a different way. We are no more or less aggressive than we were in 2002 at this point
in time. It is very similar.
Relative to marketing, there is a focus on marketing effectiveness. You're absolutely right as we look at share of voice,
as we look at the impact that our creative has, as we look at the reach today that creative has and we look at the
distribution outlets and our media allocation.
Having said that, there is also a focus on how our marketing messages are conveying the emotional quotient, if you
would, of the brand. And that means that there has to be changes. So when I mentioned leadership changes in
marketing or agency changes, those are not incremental effectiveness changes, John. Those are changes based upon the
fact that we may not be getting the content or the reach or the awareness that we desire and demand as a McDonald's
brand. And when we make those changes, we don't do it lightly. Those of the kind of changes that we need to drive the
business. And those changes are occurring in several of our critical markets around the world.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar.
<Q - R. J. Hottovy>: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dive down into Europe a little bit more. It looks like
the June results, the negative 3.4% comp, a little bit softer than what we'd seen. Europe had recently been a point of
relative outperformance. Just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything more than just the things you mentioned in
Germany between the marketing changes there, as well as the Russia situation going on, whether or not you're seeing
competition intensify or seeing less impact from reimaging or some of the menu innovations there, just kind of wanted
to get a better sense of your perspective on Europe.
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks, R. J. I think you hit it pretty well. You know, Germany still remains weak and showed
further deceleration in the second quarter. As I mentioned, there are teams in the franchisees and the changes that we've
made in terms of leadership and process. Those things are moving forward. It's going to take a while in Germany. We
have lost share in that market.
If I look at France and the U.K., those markets are gaining share. And our performance has been solid. And we had
similar conversations about France several years ago, could we make the turn? And some of the things that we've put in

place in France, Casse-Croûte, Petit Plaisir, on the affordability end. We've had a great balance across the menu in
terms of the core products. We've had new innovations. We've had the digital strategies that have been implemented.
So those things are, even in a very, very tough environment, our business in France is still thriving. And so I think it
goes to show, the things that we're talking about are not just things that we dream up, but they are the things that we
have implemented in markets around the world. So France is still performing. The U.K. is performing. As we
mentioned, they just lapped on top of the blended ice roll-out, but we still have solid performance there, a very
balanced approach to the business and we're still moving forward and growing. There has been, you know one thing
we've seen, a little bit of decline in retail footfall traffic, but aside from that, R. J., nothing that I would say was much
broader than that point.
Russia, a slowdown in comp sales there, I think the economy has recently entered a recession. It's taking a hit based
upon the geopolitical issues that are apparent there. There's lower consumer confidence. We have seen some new
competitors enter the market, but, as you know, that is a market that we have been in and a market that we're growing
in and growing more drive-thrus in. And we feel very good about our positioning there and the opportunities in front of
us in Russia. But at this point, there is a – we are seeing some softness in Russia, I think largely due to some of the
geopolitical concerns and consumer confidence.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Howard Penney from Hedgeye.
<Q - Howard W. Penney>: Hi. Thank you very much. Don, the last time McDonald's sort of went through an
extended period of declining same-store sales, it took a much bigger event and a major sort of restructuring to get – to
realign the organization. And I know you've put forth a plan, the plans to improve sales and you believe, I honestly
believe that you think you believe, you've got the right plans, but the fact of the matter is you might not have the right
plan. And there could be some give and takes and it might not work as you've laid it out. Do you have a contingency
plan or is there a backup plan to what might not work of what you've put forth today? And what are the chances do you
think that an extended period of sales will lead to a bigger sort of effort to improve your top-line sales? Thanks very
much.
<A - Don Thompson>: Okay. Thanks for the question, Howard. I know you and I talked recently when we were
together at least at the investor meeting last year. Some of those basic fundamental things that we talked about are the
things that we're focused on now to shore up the business, clearly. Relative to contingencies, the great thing about the
McDonald's System is we are 119 countries. We're a very diverse portfolio of businesses. So we have the opportunity
to test multiple things and parts of initiatives in different areas of the world. So when I talk about the digital strategy,
part of the test of what's taken place in France, what we're implementing as a result of those learnings in Australia, what
subsets of that are being tested in the Swedens and the U.S.' and the U.K.'s of the world, really as we formulate these
strategies, we are constantly, I guess you'd say, iterating around the improvements and the data that we've seen in
several markets.
So relative to contingencies, I guess that I would say it's almost a living contingency as to the way that we implement
major initiatives, so the digital initiative being one, customization or personalization efforts being another. Even on
those, it may be based upon a different product complement. So in the U.S., it's going to be about burger leadership. In
many markets across Europe, it'll be about that initially. There are other areas where it will be the chicken platforms
and portfolios. So we are learning as we go. Outside of focusing – the things that we're focused on, Howard, we know
we have to get much better at, and they're also areas of we believe greater opportunity for us. So the whole notion of
the respected brand and our sustainability-based efforts and how those things play out, not only have we done some of
those historically, but most people don't know about them and we have to even get that even more accelerated. So we
know that that's something our customers want. And it bodes well relative to our business plan.
What we're doing around customization and food, it goes right at what consumers are asking us for across demographic
tiers. And so we know they're the right things to do. I will tell you, Howard, the broader question that is out there now
and the broader question that we're answering in the local markets is around what we do to shore up the foundation now
even in these environments, even in these economies, even with the other cash flow impact points that may be out
there, how we ensure that together we move to shore up the base. So we're ready for the incremental customers that will

come and we build back up our peak periods. And so that kind of is the foundation of it. To your point, it's almost an
evolving contingency plan. And believe me, there are several other areas that we are looking at outside of the ones I
mentioned, but those are the ones that we know will be a solid part of our future growth strategy.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Keith Siegner from UBS.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thank you very much. I'd like to circle back to the question on the consumer insights from
earlier and maybe just ask you in a different way especially given how much attention this got at the November Analyst
Day last year. Forgetting the plan for a second, just looking at that data that you're collecting, which I understand is
pretty robust. The customers who aren't coming as much or maybe aren't coming these days, why are they saying that's
the case? I mean, what are they highlighting? How has that evolved as the year progresses? Is it a lack of compelling
new news? Is healthfulness or quality, in general, coming up more often? Is it the engagement? Like what are the folks
not coming actually saying in the data? Thanks.
<A - Don Thompson>: Wow, Keith, that's a big question for a global brand. I will tell you that...
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Just the U.S.
<A - Don Thompson>: If you look in the U.S., there are several things we've seen in the U.S. You all know that the
QSR industry as a whole is soft in the U.S. There are a lot of things that are out there in the U.S. right now ranging
from, as I mentioned, some of the legislative matters that are on the board relative to impact of healthcare next year,
potential of minimum wage changes, what happens relative to immigration reform costs, particularly around E-Verify.
There are challenges and changes relative to legislation in terms of whether or not there'll be re-ups on some of the tax
credits, tax benefits. So there's a lot of things that for a franchisee they're looking at relative to cash flow. That is one of
the things that then flows through relative to execution in the restaurants.
When we first began Operations Reset, we were hearing from customers that the restaurants were getting too
complicated. It was a little confusing on the menu boards. We needed to get some level of simplification. I will say at
the same time, we're saying and customers are saying, we want a little more customization and personalization, so we
want some different tastes. We want some different condiments. The U.S. is moving forward with that, with the
high-density kitchen and prep for that.
We're also hearing that there are some consumer confidence-related concerns around discretionary spending. In the
U.S., we see a bifurcation based upon what's taking place in markets that are greater than $75,000 from an overall
income perspective and those that are less than, say, $45,000. These are two different worlds today. Those markets at
the higher end, discretionary spending is still flowing fairly well. Markets at the lower end, it's a little bit tighter. The
geographic positioning of McDonald's around the U.S. is broad. And so we're in both of those sub-markets and pretty
good distribution. That's a little different than some of our competitor set.
So clearly, the economy is a bit of a concern. And we're hopeful that the economy will continue to improve and that
improvement will be across all segments. But we also have to make sure that we're thriving in this environment, so
having the right affordability messaging, which may be slightly different in some of these markets than it is in others.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right. Our last question is from Paul Westra from Stifel.
<Q - Paul L. Westra>: Great. Thanks. Very similar question to Keith's about the U.S. business, maybe talk a little bit
about more, if you could, about the weakness perhaps in the overall U.S. QSR category and specifically, do you sense
any incremental competitive challenges coming from the convenience store business, which you mentioned before, on
the low end perhaps and perhaps quick casual on the high end? And I know this year's emphasis is on the increasing
frequency of the base business and perhaps base consumer, but once that's stabilized, perhaps talk a little bit about the
more intermediate-term opportunity of product line extensions to maybe thwart or maybe regain some share from these
lower end and higher end categories?
<A - Don Thompson>: Yeah, Paul. I would tell you that several years ago we began to have conversations just around
broader market segments and sets and what we were seeing. I will tell you, any place a person can stop, we view as a
competitor, whether it's a petrol station or it's a convenience store or it's a grocery store, or ready-to-eat foods or

take-home food. We view the whole set as a competitor. As we look at our business, when you've got that many places
that you can view as a competitor, what you have to focus on is what you're good at and what you know you can excel
at and differentiate. We know that the speed of service at McDonald's, the accuracy of the service, the food quality,
even in our segment which is the quick service restaurant segment, are critically important. The transparency of our
food and the fact that we know that we have very high quality food at McDonald's is one of the messages that I think
we have to get out even stronger. And it's one of the things that the overall quick service restaurant industry has
struggled with for years and years and years.
And so we believe that some of the things that we've talked about from menu personalization, customization, the
high-density kitchens, highlighting some of the condiments on the prep table, those things also help us, but it also has
to be thread throughout our marketing and our awareness campaigns. Those are the things that we're focused on and
make sure that those things take place. As you look at food-away-from-home, right now, we know that the
food-away-from-home industry is one that is still increasing, albeit above a 2% percentile rate. Interestingly enough,
food-at-home is a 2.4% increase.
So they're all in the ballpark of normalized, I'd guess I'd call it, normal inflation at this point in time. If one of those
shoots up or down, we have to take note of it relative to what that means to our affordability platforms. If the economy
gets better or worse, we have to take note of that relative to what impact it may have on our breakfast business and
travel pads. So there's a lot of things we look at. I couldn't give you, Paul, super-specifics on any one item, but there's a
lot of things we have to look at as we manage the business, particularly in the U.S. and go forward.
Kathy H. Martin
Okay. Thanks. And we're going to go right into Don's closing comments.
Don Thompson
Thank you all very much. We wanted to take a little extra time because we know that you have questions, interests
relative to the McDonald's business. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning. We remain committed, as
you can tell through the Plan to Win and our strategic growth priorities, as we work to strengthen the key foundational
elements of our business. And I've mentioned how critical those are. We know that we can drive our business through
the growth initiatives that will enhance our customer relevance and appeal.
We're seeing that in some of the markets around the world. Those initiatives and implementations will be broader as we
move forward. Our defensible competitive advantages, our resilient business model, the communications and alignment
that we strive for and have with our Owner/Operators, our suppliers and company teams, those things give me
confidence that as we execute our plans to drive profitable growth through our system, we will be successful. And our
shareholders will reap the benefits of that over the long-term.
So thanks, again, for joining us this morning and have a great day, everyone.
