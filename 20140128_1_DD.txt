MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is John, and I will be your conference operator for today's call. At this time I would like to
welcome everyone to the du Pont Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Carl Lukach, Vice President of Investor Relations. Carl, you
may begin.
Carl J. Lukach
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover du Pont's fourth quarter
2013 performance. Joining me are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; and Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and
CFO. The slides for today's presentation can be found on our website along with our news release. Please note that we
have also posted our fourth quarter segment performance slides and outlook commentary this morning.
During the course of this conference call we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to slide two for our
disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements.
Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a
number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review du Pont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially. We also will refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you
review our reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and on our website. For
today's agenda, Ellen will start with opening comments, Nick will review our fourth quarter financial performance and

2014 outlook, and I'll provide business segment insights. We'll conclude with Ellen's comments and then follow with
your questions.
With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Great. Thank you, Carl, and good morning, and thank all of you for joining us. I'm pleased to review du Pont's fourth
quarter and full year 2013 performance. We closed 2013 with strong fourth quarter results. Our revenue grew 6%.
Segment operating earnings grew 52%. Our margin improved almost 400 basis points and operating earnings per share
of $0.59 was nearly triple last year. Results came in largely as expected and communicated to you three months ago.
Most of our businesses grew revenue and earnings. The exception, as anticipated, was our Performance Chemicals
segment, although the trends there are clearly positive. We posted a fourth quarter operating earnings profit in our Ag
segment which as you know, historically records a seasonal loss at this time of the year.
Our Nutrition and Health segment grew earnings 40%, Safety & Protection grew 57%, and Electronics and
Communications more than doubled its operating earnings. Segment earnings growth and margin improvement were
driven by new product sales, higher volumes, improved plant utilization rates, good cost control and productivity gains.
Demand for du Pont products was higher in key industries and across all regions. Demand from automotive and
industrial markets was better than earlier in the year. Demand from food ingredients markets were stable, and we saw
clear signs of a recovery in the photovoltaic market, principally in China. In Ag, demand for our insecticides was very
strong in Latin America, driven by heavy insect pressure and the excellent performance of Rynaxypyr. Nick will take
you through our fourth quarter financials next.
So let me focus now on our full-year performance. Our 2013 revenue growth of 3% and operating earnings growth of
3% overcame significant price declines and market disruptions in the global TiO2 market. This resulted in Performance
Chemicals segment operating earnings declining 45%, or $0.66 per share, overshadowing the strong performance of
our other businesses.
Aside from Performance Chemicals, our combined businesses, in a sluggish global economy, grew revenues 5% while
delivering 11% earnings growth, much more in line with our long-term target growth rates of 7% and 12%. And our
operating margins increased about 100 basis points to 16.8%. Importantly, these businesses delivered solid results by
continuing to execute well against our strategic and operational priorities.
Specifically regarding innovation, our integrated customer-centric innovation team connected with our exceptional
science resources to deliver a steady stream of new products. For the year, we introduced 1753 new products, and our
market winning products like Optimum AcreMax technologies, Optimum AQUAmax hybrids, Rynaxypyr insecticides
and Solamet paste contributed to market share gains. Regarding global reach, our volume growth in developing markets
was 11% in the fourth quarter and for the year as we successfully leveraged our market positions.
For productivity, we exceeded our goals including residual cost elimination for the year. And as you know from our
announcements, we moved decisively forward in 2013 to reshape our portfolio for higher growth. In February we
completed the $5 billion divestiture of performance coatings. In July we acquired the controlling interest in Pannar
Seed in South Africa. In October we announced the decision to separate our $7 billion Performance Chemicals
segment, and in November we announced that we'd signed definitive agreements to sell Glass Laminating Solutions
and Vinyls, a part of the packaging and industrial polymers business in Performance Materials. These events followed
our 2011 Danisco acquisition, and they are all integral steps in our plan to refine our portfolio and deliver higher and
less cyclical growth.
In 2013 we raised our dividend 5% for the second consecutive year and we executed a $1 billion share buyback. Today
we announced that our board has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, and that we expect to complete
$2 billion this year. Nick will provide more details about the program.
With that, I'll turn it over to Nick and Carl, and then I'll come back to address 2014. Nick?

Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on slide three. As Ellen
indicated, we had a strong fourth quarter with operating earnings per share up 195%, almost triple a weak fourth
quarter last year.
In Agriculture, strong insecticide sales growth in Latin America, coupled with earlier seed shipments for the safrinha
corn season in Brazil and earlier seed shipments in North America, contributed to our positive earnings for the segment.
In Electronics and Communications, operating earnings more than doubled last year on higher operating margins fueled
by stronger demand for Solamet paste and Tedlar films in photovoltaics. Likewise, higher margins in Safety and
Protection were driven by improved demand for Kevlar and Nomex fibers. In fact, this was the fourth consecutive
quarter of operating margin improvement in Safety and Protection. Operating earnings in this segment were up 57%
and we saw continued productivity gains.
Finally in Nutrition and Health, operating earnings increased 40% due to improved pricing and stronger demand for
cultures, probiotics and specialty proteins.
Consolidated net sales of $7.7 billion were up 6% versus the prior year. Volume increased 9%, led by Electronics and
Communication, which grew volumes 17%. In Agriculture, volumes grew 14%, reflecting the earlier timing of seed
shipments that we anticipated. Weaker local pricing of 2% in the quarter was primarily driven by Performance
Chemicals and significantly lower pass-through metals pricing in Electronics and Communications.
From a currency perspective, the dollar continued to strengthen against most other currencies, particularly the Brazilian
real and the Japanese yen. This impact, however, was partially offset by a weaker dollar versus the euro. The net result
was a $0.04 hurt for the quarter. For the full year, currency was a $0.15 per share headwind versus last year.
In 2013, we delivered solid revenue growth, double-digit operating earnings growth in three of our segments and
operating margin improvement in five segments. However, these gains were largely offset by the steep 45%, or $0.66
per share decline we experienced in our Performance Chemicals segment earnings as a result of the significantly lower
global TiO2 prices throughout 2013.
For the full year, our 20.8% base tax rate was about a point lower than the base tax rate we anticipated three months
ago and more than three points lower than the prior year. This lower rate in 2013 primarily results from the favorable
geographic mix of earnings. Additionally, our base tax rate for 2013 was favorably impacted by the inclusion of the
U.S. R&D credit and other U.S. business tax provisions that were re-enacted in the first quarter of 2013. The
significantly lower fourth quarter rate reflects a year-to-date catch-up adjustment to our full-year base tax rate of
20.8%.
Turning now to slide four, I'd like to highlight some of our geographic results. Sales in developing markets increased
9% during the quarter on 11% higher volume. Sales in developing EMEA increased 16% in the quarter versus fourth
quarter 2012 where our acquisition of Pannar Seed in South Africa contributed favorably to the growth as we
broadened our geographic footprint. In Latin America, sales grew 8% on 12% higher volume where demand for our
insecticides was very strong. In developing Asia, sales grew 6% in the quarter on 13% higher volumes.
Now let's turn to the fourth quarter segment operating earnings analysis shown on slide five. You can see clearly here
the strong performance we had across all of our segments. You can also see that in the fourth quarter, we had only a
slight decline in Performance Chemicals versus the prior year. In a few minutes, Carl will provide you more details for
each of these segments.
Turning now to slide six, you can see the major contributions of the year-over-year change. Strong segment results
contributed $0.26 higher operating earnings in the quarter and this includes the decline from Performance Chemicals
and the $0.04 currency hurt. The lower tax – base tax rate provided an $0.11 benefit in the quarter versus 2012, a few
cents better than we had anticipated in October. The favorable variance in corporate expenses provided a benefit of

$0.03 in the quarter, reflecting ongoing cost control in our support functions. Let me also point out here that we met the
$300 million in savings that we targeted for 2013 for the program including the successful elimination of corporate
residual costs that were left following the Performance Coatings divestiture. As previously communicated, we
highlighted the overhang in corporate costs so that our progress to eliminate them could be easily tracked by our
investors.
In addition, we met our fixed costs in working capital productivity targets. In total, both the 2012 restructuring and the
fixed costs and working capital initiatives contributed significantly to offsetting inflation and helping to fund our
growth investments. Moreover, we expect to continue to deliver ongoing productivity in 2014.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide seven; we ended the year with $1.3 billion of free cash flow on a
total company basis versus $3.1 billion last year. This decline primarily reflects changes in working capital in our Ag
segment and the lower Performance Chemicals earnings, along with the absence of Performance Coatings earnings in
2013 following our divestiture. Capital expenditures were up modestly from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. We ended
2013 with a net debt of $3.4 billion, which was $4 billion less that our position in December 2012. Year-end cash
balances increased to about $9 billion as anticipated.
Let me also point out here that our unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities decreased nearly $5 billion, from $13 billion
last year to $8 billion now. We have previously communicated to you that we expected the unfunded liabilities to
decrease $2 billion to $3 billion. However, the impact of the higher discount rate and higher-than-projected trust asset
returns, including the strong equity market performance in the fourth quarter, brought our unfunded pension and OPEB
liability down even more than we had anticipated. As a result, we have significantly improved the strength of our
balance sheet.
Turn now to slide eight. I'd like to review our assumptions regarding our key markets and the broader economy in
2014. These highlights form the foundation for our 2014 guidance. Broadly speaking, we expect global growth of about
3% against a backdrop of a world economy that continues to face many uncertainties. We expect global industrial
production to increase about 4% in 2014. We see signs of recovery in Europe and Japan, with growth firming in China.
In Agriculture, the fundamentals are healthy and we anticipate lower planted acres that will favor soybeans versus corn
as commodity prices transition off their 2012 peak. Auto and Housing are also expected to improve.
With this backdrop, now let's turn to slide nine. We expect 4% revenue growth in 2014 to about $37 billion. This
includes nearly a 2% decline from portfolio changes. Our outlook for operating earnings per share is $4.20 to $4.45, up
8% to 15% from 2013. This takes into account the fourth quarter early seed shipments highlighted in our news release
and anticipates a slight reduction in diluted shares outstanding by year-end. For the full year, we expect our base tax
rate to be about 22% and capital expenditures to be about equal to last year at $1.9 billion. Pharmaceutical royalties will
be minimal this year, so beginning in 2014, they will be reported as part of other.
In our reporting, similar to 2013, non-operating pension [ph] expenses (18:27) will be excluded from operating
earnings. We anticipate these expenses will be about $0.09 per share for the company compared to $0.39 last year. As
mentioned previously, the significant reduction in 2014 is due to the higher discount rate and higher pension asset
returns achieved in 2013. It is exactly this level of volatility that prompted our decision to exclude non-operating
pension and OPEB from our operating results.
Also in 2014, in order to provide you a clear understanding of the underlying performance of our segments, we will
exclude from operating earnings the transaction related costs for the separation of Performance Chemicals and report
them on Schedule B of our earnings report. Be assured that separation work is well underway and we intend to provide
you with a full-year estimate of these costs later in the year.
Turning now to slide 10, I'll cover a few details about share repurchase announcement this morning. Today we
announce that our Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program of the company's common
stock. While the program is not time limited, we intend to complete $2 billion this year. Assuming today's price and
expected dilution from benefit plans, we have assumed that the current year repurchase will reduce diluted shares
outstanding at year-end by about 1% to 1.5%, taking into account the averaging of the shares each quarter and for the

year. We expect to begin repurchasing shares in the first quarter with the impact on fully diluted average shares
occurring across the remaining quarters. We plan to fund the repurchase from our current cash balance and will update
you as we execute against this program.
Our new $5 billion program, as I said, is not time limited or restricted to dilution, and replaces our previous $2 billion
program from 2011 which still had $1.7 billion outstanding. Most important, we believe this repurchase, while
meaningful in amount, is a measured approach that takes into consideration our improved balance sheet position and
adheres to our financial disciplines while at the same time providing us with the flexibility for making investments that
support growth in our businesses. We believe this share buyback program is part of a continued commitment to provide
attractive cash returns to our shareholders, and today's announcement reflects the confidence that we have in our plan to
build a higher growth, higher value company.
Our market environment continues to be a dynamic one. In looking back at 2013 we overcame significant TiO2 and
currency headwinds, and in looking forward in 2014, we see continued gradual sequential improvements in the
economy and in our businesses. We're encouraged as we enter 2014 and we're focused on executing our plans but
remain poised to capitalize on changing market conditions and growth opportunities.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Carl to review the segments. Carl?
Carl J. Lukach
Thanks, Nick. I'd like to now provide some brief segment insights. As a reminder, the slides and complete segment
commentary are posted on the Investor Center website under Events and Presentations, along with other materials for
today's call.
In Agriculture on slide 11, we completed another successful year of industry-leading performance, with 13% annual
growth in sales, and 16% annual growth in operating earnings. We delivered a 60-basis-point increase in operating
margins despite the impact of higher seed input costs earlier in the year. Highlights included more than a one point of
corn share gain in North America, a three point share gain in the 2013 Brazil safrinha corn season, the successful
launch of Approach picoxystrobin fungicide in the U.S., and Rynaxypyr insecticide exceeding $1 billion in annual
sales.
Typically our Agriculture segment has a seasonal loss in the fourth quarter, but this year operating earnings were
positive for the first time at $88 million. Earnings improvement was driven by strong insecticide sales in Latin America
led by Rynaxypyr, earlier seed shipments in the Brazil safrinha corn season and earlier direct seed shipments to North
American farmers. As a result of the earlier timing of seed shipments, about $100 million of operating earnings were
realized in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter of 2014. As we move into 2014, the global Ag economy remains
healthy. Farmer cash income and commodity prices are transitioning off of peak levels as global stocks are rebuilding
from historically low levels. We feel good about our seed and crop protection order books in North America, which are
in line with our expectations for the season.
For the first half of 2014, we anticipate modest increases in both sales and operating earnings with growth rates
negatively impacted by the previously mentioned timing change. We expect operating margins to partially recover
following last year's one point first half decline, as we benefit from lower seed input costs while continuing to make
targeted investments globally for growth. For the full year, we expect modest global growth in sales with earnings up
moderately.
In Electronics and Communications on slide 12, operating earnings increased $50 million to $93 million driven by
higher sales volume and improved plant utilization. Higher volume, mainly from demand improvement and share gains
in photovoltaic markets, was offset in part by lower selling prices largely from the pass-through of substantially lower
metals prices. For the full year, we expect sales to increase slightly as volume gains are tempered by declining metal
prices with moderate growth in earnings.

In Industrial Biosciences on slide 13, sales of $326 million were 9% higher on strong demand for Sorona polymer, for
carpeting and apparel, and enzymes for ethanol production. Looking ahead, we expect full year operating earnings to be
up substantially from healthy enzyme demand in our core markets, animal nutrition, detergents and ethanol.
On slide 14, Nutrition and Health operating earnings of $81 million increased $23 million driven by pricing gains and
increased demand in specialty proteins, probiotics and cultures. Operating margin improved more than two points as
pricing gains, mix enrichment and productivity actions more than offset growth investments. For the full year, we
expect modestly higher sales and significant operating earnings growth. We expect full year operating margin to grow
as we progress toward our long-term margin goals.
Turning now to slide 15, as anticipated we did record a modest fourth quarter earnings decline in Performance
Chemicals versus last year, but we see signs that the market is stabilizing. Fourth quarter TiO2 volumes increased 18%,
marking four consecutive quarters of year-over-year volume growth. Volumes were fueled by stronger demand in
Europe and China. We view customer inventory levels as normal, and producer inventory levels remained essentially
unchanged from the third quarter. Full year volumes for our TiO2 business were up 14% versus the prior year. We
expect earnings will be down significantly in the first quarter versus last year due to the lower year-over-year prices in
TiO2 and fluoro products. However, we expect full year 2014 earnings will be up modestly due to higher segment
volumes.
In Performance Materials on slide 16, we delivered another solid quarter by maintaining our focus on application
development while leveraging our global reach. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $295 million increased $22
million or 8%. Sales of $1.6 billion were up 3% with higher volumes partially offset by lower prices. Our polymer sales
into the China automotive market, for example, were up 23% versus the prior year, marking two consecutive quarters
where growth exceeded 20%. 2013 was a strong year, and we increased full year operating margins by 100 basis points
to 20%.
In 2014, operating earnings are forecasted to be essentially flat as modest volume growth is offset by lower capacity
due to a scheduled ethylene outage and the impact of portfolio changes, principally the Glass Laminating
Solutions/Vinyls sale anticipated later in the year.
In Safety and Protection on slide 17, improved demand for Kevlar and Nomex fibers, coupled with the benefits of our
prior-year restructuring and productivity gains, lifted quarterly earnings by 57%. Operating margins for the segment
also improved for the fourth consecutive quarter. While segment sales were up 1%, a strong sales mix delivered the
positive earnings growth despite continued weakness in the governmental spending section in all regions.
For 2014, operating earnings will be up moderately reflecting improved demand with a richer sales mix alongside
continuing productivity gains.
That concludes our comments about segments. Now I'll turn it back to Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Great. Thank you, Carl. As we move forward in 2014, we have positive momentum across our portfolio. While
uncertainties exist, market demand is improving and we're executing successfully against our value creation plan. We
expect the gradual, sequential improvement in the global economy that we saw at the end of last year to continue.
From a regional perspective, we expect gradual improvement in the U.S. economy to continue. Demand projections
from the automotive and housing industries are positive. This provides a good platform for growth in our Performance
Materials, Safety and Protection, Industrial Bioscience and Performance Chemicals segments.
In Europe, our business has improved in each of the past two quarters. We expect sequential growth to continue as
industrial production across Europe recovers from recession.
In Central and Eastern Europe, our largest business is in Agriculture, where we see plenty of opportunity for continued
growth in 2014. In addition, we expect our Advanced Materials businesses to benefit from the GDP growth that is

projected in developing Europe.
In China, we're assuming GDP growth will remain in the 7% to 8% range and anticipate continued improvement in key
areas like photovoltaics and automotive. We are closely monitoring infrastructure investments, as they have a positive
implication for du Pont in our Electronics and Communications, Performance Chemicals and Safety and Protection
businesses.
From an industry perspective, we expect healthy fundamentals in the automotive industry, as global car builds are
projected to increase about 4%. We'll continue to leverage our innovation centers to partner with OEMs and apply our
world class application development expertise to meet their challenges in performance, light weighting and energy
efficiency.
In the global TiO2 market, we saw the industry stabilize in 2013 with stronger global demand driving lower inventory
levels throughout the value chain. In 2014, we anticipate that industry fundamentals will continue to show
improvement, but the timing and strength of a recovery is evolving.
In Agriculture, we expect another year of solid operating earnings growth against a backdrop of an Ag economy which
remains healthy but where farmer income and commodity prices are transitioning off of their peak.
Though growers remain somewhat uncertain about the total planted areas and which crop to plant, our attractive value
proposition to maximize their profitability is clear. Our order book in Seed and Crop Protection confirms that our
customers continue to demand our newest, high-performing, innovative Seed and Crop Protection technologies.
Our strategies and priorities are clear, goals are defined and in place and we are executing well. We remain focused on
advancing our operational priorities: innovation, global reach and strong execution. Paired with disciplined capital
allocation, these priorities will enable us to continue our track record of delivering increased value for our shareholders,
while achieving our long-term growth targets.
Our businesses will leverage their scientific capability to increase return on research and development while expanding
our pipeline. We continue to strengthen our market penetration in developing markets and increase collaboration with
the region's fast-growing companies. And we'll continue a relentless focus on cost and capital productivity across the
company as we've successfully done over the past five years.
In summary, we're looking forward to 2014 and to advancing each of our strategic and operational priorities. These
priorities form the backbone of our value creation strategy and chart the best pathway to building a higher-growth,
higher-value du Pont company for our shareholders.
Carl, back to you.

Okay. Thank you, Ellen. Let's open up the line now for your questions. John?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from
P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, hi. Good morning. A quick question on Ag. Ag pricing was flat in 4Q, but maybe there was
some impact of the real devaluation. So can you talk about what kind of local seed pricing did you achieve in the
safrinha season in Brazil and in North America?

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So thanks, P.J. The planning has begun in Brazil. It's a dynamic situation. We find
people that are still very interested in what the seed can do with them. I mean, safrinha corn acres are going to be down,
but they're interested in the new technologies, the new hybrids. We continue to see good demand for our
high-performing products. And South American pricing, our cart prices are flat to up slightly. North America, I'm
sorry, our cart prices are flat to up slightly, and expect modest price increases based on a lot of mix improvement there.
So it still is – the order books are about as expected. It still is a very dynamic situation, but we see it one playing out
strongly in terms of the newer products and what we can do then to impact their yield in 2014.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: And my follow-up question is totally on the royalty payments to Monsanto that you'll have in
2014 in 2015. Can you just walk us through, how does that impact your income statement and cash flow? Thank you.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, as you know, royalty payments, we record them as we sell units. So we have a
small introductory launch in 2014 that's – so it's going to have a small impact. I think if I remember correctly, it's going
to be about 5% of our 2014 sales volume will be these products.

And our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if Nick could clarify something on share repurchase. It
looks like you're going to buy back about, I don't know, 32 million shares this year. How many shares are you going to
issue, in that when you did your 1.5% calculation, I couldn't tell what came from an average share count difference and
what came from newly issued shares?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Hey, Jeff. Thanks. So your calculation is about right. I mean, you have to look at the
price when the shares are purchased. But if you do it based on today's pricing, you would say somewhere around 30
million shares would be coming back. And then you also have to consider the time element of when those are going to
occur, as to how much they're going to impact the diluted share count. But specifically around your, how many are
going to be reissued in the way of dilution, if you look historically, somewhere in the range of, oh, 8 million shares to
12 million shares, new shares, issued historically on a per-year basis.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay. Great. And for my follow-up, you've got a turnaround in your Orange, Texas cracker.
I guess that begins in May. So I would imagine that that doesn't affect your first quarter Performance Materials results.
Is that correct, it would affect the second quarter Performance Materials results?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, it'll affect the second and third quarter because of the lack of volume that will
be coming out in the second. We think it'll bleed over a little bit to the third as well.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Thank you.

Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Just a question on corporate costs. Nick, you mentioned that you've pretty much offset the $200
million stranded costs associated with Coatings. I'm wondering what's the amount of stranded costs that you see once
you exit Performance Chemicals. And is there a view to try and get ahead of that and maybe take more aggressive
action on corporate infrastructure cost this year?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: So when you looked – we talked about this a little bit before, Don. When you look at
the people that were involved in the Coatings divestiture, a significant number, very labor-intensive, less folks in the P
Chem side, so less of the overhead impact that would be applicable than you saw in the Coatings side. The number's

about half of an overhang in that one versus what was on the P Chem side. But then when you talk about the other
opportunities, maybe Ellen you want to...?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, so as I take a look at it, and although the people are left, and that does have an
impact, it is about 20% of our company from a revenue base. And so we're taking the opportunity in 2014 to relook at
our corporate core, to relook at how we support the businesses from every function and how the businesses deploy
regionally to understand, is there a different opportunity for us to take some action this year that would enable a more
efficient, more effective structure going into the spend. So we're in the beginning of that process right now, we're
benchmarking other companies, looking deeply into our own – how we structure that, and I think that we'll be talking
about that more as the year goes on because my goal would be to, as we effect this spin, to go into it with momentum in
terms of the corporate core and not have that overhead be with us for the year as it has been in 2013.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: And do you have a preliminary target for what additional costs you might be able to take out
beyond the stranded costs?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: No, we'll share that with you we get something that has some meaning behind it.

And our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Ellen, just on TiO2, are you expecting some price increases in the back half of
the year?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, TiO2 is one of the hardest things to predict and as I call it the market and the
industry is evolving. We've seen it bottoming, we've seen volume progression as you've seen. I think it's going to
depend on how strong the economy is and what kind of growth we see there next year. And I think it'll play out much
as the markets we see. We're saying first quarter earnings are going to be down, it's just the math of where the volume
and price is, but that for the full year, it's going to be – our P Chem segment's going to be up a little bit. So we do
believe that the economy and what the markets are doing will predict exactly how that's going to play out.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: And just on Safety, strong Q4 results. Ellen, can you talk about the mix impact in Q4 and the
potential for margins in 2014 given the improved mix and perhaps filling up Cooper River as well?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. So, we delivered strong fourth quarter, obviously especially from operating
earnings standpoint, and that's driven off of demand for Kevlar and Nomex and even the service businesses closing out
some of their year-end projects and things like that. We saw the benefits from the restructuring and the productivity in
that segment that we put in. We have seen improved plant utilization at Cooper River, and that's really what's driving
the four consecutive quarters of operating margin improvement. In 2014, we expect mix to be a positive, so a slight
margin improvement from that as we continue to drive in that business. We're making progress, I think we're getting
the job done, and we'll continue to improve throughout 2014.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: And I do want to just add, and the progress we're talking about is not only from the
utilization but also from the productivity and the restructuring work that was done and realizing that value.
Operator
And the next question is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on TiO2. I was intrigued by your comments that
there's been improvement in Europe and China, but it would seem that maybe the end markets have been stronger in the
U.S. So is there something peculiar about why you haven't seen better trends in the North American markets?

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, I think that the North American season, we're just heading into now. So I think
the – in North America, because of construction, didn't have as big of an impact as we saw with the variability in China
and with Europe being on its back. I mean, we saw growth in all regions. It was just notable in Europe and China.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: And on your Orange turnaround, are you going to be able to add any incremental capacity to
that low-cost unit?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I'd love to, but I don't think so. We just – we need to get this done so we can continue
to operate it at the very high utilizations that we operate that unit.

Our next question is from John Roberts from UBS.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Morning, John.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Would you expect the Ag business to return to a loss in the next fourth quarter? Or are those
distribution changes in the U.S. and Latin America continuing so that you might see the same kind of effect at the end
of this year?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: You're asking the same question I was asking the team. I think what we see is, with
the progression of the Crop Protection products, specifically insecticide, Rynaxypyr, which has a huge impact in the
fourth quarter in Latin America, we see with localizing our production capability in Latin America in the seed business
has enabled us to shorten those supply lines. And people want their hybrids and their [ph] current (45:01) sizes and
things like that.
So we think that it'll be positive in the fourth quarter going forward. So we'll see. I mean, a lot of it depends on how the
season down in Latin America plays out. And the safrinha corn shipments, those investments have enabled us to
basically deliver on that in the fourth quarter.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Is it too early to talk about emerging market industrial trends? The stock market's obviously
very concerned about that. But you're a little bit further up in the supply chain in many of your businesses that maybe
you're just not seeing anything yet.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. I mean that's one, I mean, we read the papers too, so we're looking at that very,
very strongly. We had a good 2013 in emerging markets. I mean if you look at it in total, volumes were up 10%. Now
sales were up 6% and that's based on TiO2 pricing and the metals pass-through was a negative last year. But we
finished the year strong in the fourth quarter with volumes up 11%, and that was largely driven by China with
photovoltaics. And they were catching up for the year, and that's not lost on me. They had a weak first half in 2013, but
photovoltaics was catching up. Tio2 volumes were there. So we watch it very, very carefully because every quarter
seems to be a new quarter in the emerging markets, and you've got to be very agile and be able to move very quickly
depending on the trends. So we are cautiously -optimistic may be too strong a word, but we think it's going to be
sequentially – continue to improve.

I'm sorry. Next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ernie Ortiz>: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Ernie Ortiz filling in for John. So you saw some pretty good
volume growth in Electronics and Communications, but pricing seems to be getting weaker. What are you seeing in the
PV markets? And any idea when the inflection point is for pricing in Electronics?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So pricing in Electronics is purely silver. So if you think about the change in silver
price over the last year, it's been negative, I don't know, 10%, 12%, and that'll continue in the first quarter. So the
pricing of our materials ex-silver is very much a function of the efficiency that is enabled in the solar modules and the
like. And we're getting really good response off of our new Solamet paste business and the Tedlar films because of
their longevity and their ability to create long warranties on these units. So the year-over-year kind of pricing is a
function of silver, and we're making impact based on the functionality of the materials themselves and that's enabling
share gains for us in that marketplace.
<Q - Ernie Ortiz>: Great. And as a follow-up, I think you had guided to about $300 million of pre-tax cost savings in
2013. So first, were you able to achieve that? And any kind of guidance for 2014, or how we should think about that for
2014?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, we had strong performance on our productivity targets. We were able to – as I
mentioned in the call, we were able to get rid of all of the DPC overhang. That is gone. And we were able to meet all of
our other targets around fixed cost productivity. As far as next year goes, we're going to continue to drive productivity
within the company. We'll have some additional gain from the restructuring effort that occurred in 2012, about another
$150 million more there, and we're looking at about another $300 million of other productivity gains. So if you look
towards 2014, it's probably going to be around that $400 million to $450 million range.
<Q - Ernie Ortiz>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. Your pension deficit narrowed about twice as much as expected. It
sounds like that was mostly capital markets related. But my question is what implications, if any, does that have on
capitalization of Performance Chemicals as you spin it off, in terms of debt load or allocation of the pension?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, so let's talk just a little bit about what happened on the pension liability first,
Kevin. So when you look at it, driven by really three things, about half of the reduction in the liability came from the
discount rate changing. And if you look at the global discount rates, they improved by about 69 basis points. So 69
basis points had a little over $2.5 billion of impact on the liability. The other two components were the return on the
assets were much better than anticipated in the original estimates, almost double. And the changes in the OPEB plan
adjustments, those two together account for the other half or roughly about $5 billion of liability reduction.
Now how does this impact the P Chem piece? I've talked about this before. These are decisions that we're going to be
making as we move forward with the separation. But when you look at the decision around what goes to P Chem in the
way of potential pension liability or debt, it's really an either/or there. So you can choose to put no pension and load up
on more debt or you can choose to put pension in debt. It's a balance. And so those decisions will be made further out
in the process. But this really won't have an impact on that as we move forward.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: As a follow-up if I may, I think last month, Nick, when you unveiled your macro outlook
for 2014 you had the dollar strengthening about 2%. Is that still the case today or have you made any adjustments there,
given the volatility that we've seen?

Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. A question on use of cash. Obviously you
unveiled the new share buyback program today and you indicated that you got $1.7 billion of debt maturing here in the
first half. Was wondering if you were going to pay that off or refi that. And then what's the current M&A market like
out there? And what are the possibilities that we could see du Pont be active in doing something from a corporate
perspective?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Great. Frank, so you're right about the $1.7 billion of debt and that's just going to pay
that off; we're not going to refi that, so we'll use the cash we have on hand to do that as well as the $2 billion share
repurchase. So – and as far as the M&A market, we continue to look. Ellen, maybe you want to -
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, no, we continue to look and see that there is opportunities, smaller in nature,
more specific to geographies like Pannar or Technology, and we continue to pursue them. As you know, I have a pretty
high bar in terms of what's required for us to effect that, and we continue to work in those markets. So we calculated
that this buyback still has the opportunity for us to do some bolt ons and some things like that. So, but we thought it
was important given the big change from the pension and OPEB standpoint that we be clear about how we're going to
utilize our cash.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: That's very helpful. Sorry that you're going to pay down that loan, Nick, because I was
actually going to offer you a teaser rate and a toaster if we got part of that business. Lastly, on the spin-off of
Performance Chemicals, what is your current thoughts on timing? And does the possibility exist that there might be a
sale involved of part or all of that asset?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, so the timing is still as we discussed, second quarter of 2015. We're working on
the carve-out. We've named the leaders as you've seen. We'll continue that planning process. That's five quarters from
now, and so we'll see what happens, transpires between now and then. But we have a good economic model of what
this spin will bring and I think we're driving down that path.

Our next question is from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning. Two quick ones. First, on the Electronics and Communications segment,
considering the strength of the year-over-year performance expected in Q1, how are you expecting the cadence in the
balance of the year? And are there any headwinds that are becoming more severe over the course of the year? And then
on the Nutrition business, can you give a quick survey of regional trends? Thank you.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, so Electronics is always one that is hard to predict. We've given you the input
for the first quarter. For the whole year, we are expecting that the growth and installations on PV to be about the same
as where – it has been about 15, and so we expect that to continue. We saw a lot of our volume this year in the second
half of the year. So the first part of 2014 looks like it's starting strong. We will see where that goes. We're thinking that
for a whole year, we're in good shape for moderate earnings growth, even with the change in the silver pricing
year-over-year.
So that's one that we watch very carefully because there is a lot of noise out there, relative to whether it's trade issues or
things like that. But I'll tell you, with the efficiencies and where the pricing is on these modules today, it really is
driving adoption rates that should be able to accomplish the growth this year.

<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: And with that moderate earnings growth, because, what Ellen said on the metals
piece, the top line is going to be only slightly up. But without the metals piece, would be more in the modest range.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, as far as Nutrition in the regions go, there's no standouts. We're seeing, broadly,
demand across all regions, real interest in some products like probiotics and the real differentiated food ingredients.
And we're seeing it in Latin America, we're seeing it in Asia, North America, Europe and so we're making great
progress in that business. And we've spent the time over the last two years really building out the capability for that
business in the emerging markets, and we're seeing the result of that. So we're very pleased with the progress we're
making.

Our next question is from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Yeah, good morning. Just want to go back to the seed pull forward, real quick. I mean, just a
quick calculation. To me, that seems like it's over 1.5 million bags of seed that got pulled forward. One, is that roughly
– which I would put, I'd say 10% of your seed sales in the Americas. Is that about the right sizing of it? And then what's
the split between Latin America and North America?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, no, I think you're – the numbers you're quoting are high from my standpoint. I
think it's 60 – it's 60/40 really; 60% Latin America, about 40% is U.S.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Okay. And then just one last one quick. On the lead paint litigation in California that you guys
got extricated from, is that still your responsibility? Or is that the responsibility of your paint business that you spun
off, Axalta?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Not the – du Pont was the person that was named in the suit, and nobody's responsible
for it because we got excluded.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: No, Ellen, but you're still handling the legal side of it. So you're still defending yourself. That
didn't get passed on to Axalta, I guess, is the way...?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: No. That litigation was a du Pont litigation, historically.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Michael Ritzenthaler>: Good morning. Within Ag, I'm wondering if there are any updated thoughts around the
acreage estimates for the latest seed products, with the earlier seed delivery for corn looking at 10 million acres of
AcreMax, two-thirds – I'm sorry, AQUAmax and two-thirds from AcreMax? And then, with more favorable soybean
economics, whether the soy supply chain is geared for more substantial growth than the one-third that [ph] Paul (58:59)
was talking about three or four months ago?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, I think on AQUAmax, last year we did just over seven million acres. This year,
it's going to be over 10 million. So I think we performed well. We're happy with what we saw out of that performance
in 2013, and I think that's going to continue to make progress. We see the new varieties, the new hybrids, really
continuing to penetrate as people understand what the value of that truly is. So we're making good progress there and
the order book is showing that. It confirms the grower demand for our newest technologies, and I think another proof
point there is that cash payments for North America's season are up slightly. And so they are – I think that's a positive
as well.

<Q - Michael Ritzenthaler>: Sure. And then real briefly on TiO2 feedstock pricing. I don't know if there was any part
of your prepared comments that talked about your outlook for feedstock supply and demand, not necessarily TiO2 itself
but just on the feedstock side.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, I guess -
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, so when you look at market costs for ore, they're down from the peak. It all
depends on the contractual arrangements you have. So our ore costs may be up slightly. But even with that ore cost
being up slightly, we're still very advantaged versus the market environment.
