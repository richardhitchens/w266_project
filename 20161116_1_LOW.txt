Good morning and thanks for your interest in Lowe's.
Our third quarter operating results were below our expectations due to slower sales in the first two months of the
quarter. While we expected moderation in the second half of the year, as reflected in our guidance, traffic slowed more
than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October, which put pressure on our profitability.
Our third quarter comparable sales grew 2.7%, which was driven by a 0.5% increase in transactions and a 2.2%
increase in average ticket. Our U.S. Home Improvement comp was 2.6%. The comps for our South and West divisions
were in line with our expectations. In contrast, we experienced continued softness in our North division throughout the
quarter. We posted positive comps in 11 of our 15 regions. Overall, we drove positive comps in 10 of our 13 product
categories, while one category was also flat.
We saw relative strength in big-ticket purchases driven by outdoor power equipment and appliances. Continued strong
demand from Pro customers was evident in lumber and building materials as well as tools and hardware. And lawn and
garden also performed well as we helped customers tackle exterior maintenance and prepare their lawns for winter.
We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Pro business. It's the strong foundation we've built with this
important customer drove comps well above the company average. And we remain focused on providing best-in-class
omni-channel customer experiences that will make Lowe's, the project authority. We continue to see strength in our
Project Specialist Interiors program with strong growth in both leads and comps again this quarter. And we posted 20%
comp growth in lowes.com, driven by robust growth in both transactions and ticket following our website redesign in
Q2.
Our Orchard Supply Hardware business drove mid-single-digit comps for the quarter. And internationally, we
continued our strong performance, including double-digit comps in Mexico and mid-single digit comps in Canada in
local currency. We also made continued progress on the integration of RONA, which remains on track. With RONA,
we have fortified our Canadian market position particularly in Québec. We are now well positioned to capitalize on the
market's strong long-term fundamentals.
We reported earnings per share of $0.43 for the quarter, which included several non-cash charges. First, we reported
further impairment on our investment in the Masters joint venture. Second, we wrote off projects that were canceled as
part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives in an effort to focus on critical projects that will drive our desired
outcomes. And finally, we reported goodwill and long lived asset impairments associated with our Orchard Supply
Hardware operations as part of a strategic reassessment of the business during the quarter. Bob will discuss these items
in greater details in his comments.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.88, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Delivering on our commitment to return
excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $550 million of stock under our share repurchase program
and paid $309 million in dividends. As we look ahead, we are laser-focused on improving productivity across the
organization.
Our immediate focus is continuing to optimize associate hours to better match customer demand. And while we've
made progress in driving productivity in recent years, we are in the process of evaluating meaningful incremental
opportunities to drive shareholder value while continuing to meet customers' needs in an omni-channel environment.
We look forward to discuss these opportunities with you at our upcoming analyst and investor conference on December
7.
Turning to the economic landscape, we have a continued opportunity to benefit from a fundamentally solid but
moderating home improvement market. Home improvement growth has continued to outpace overall retail sales thus
far in the second half of the year. The industry will continue to benefit from several factors including a solid consumer
backdrop, lagging benefits from existing home sales, and rising home prices that encourage the customer to engage in
discretionary remodels and upgrades on top of routine maintenance.
We believe that strengthening demand for revolving credit will also continue to support big-ticket spending while
moderating gains in the job market and incremental income growth should contribute to solid growth and overall

consumer spending. We expect that housing will continue to be a bright spot in the economy. Home sales started out
quite strong in 2016 and are now moderating to a sustainable pace. Home price appreciation should persist, which
along with stronger incomes should motivate more homeowners to spend on home improvements. We're also
encouraged by growth in first-time home buyer activity, which is expected to continue through 2017.
Our third quarter consumer sentiment survey shares a similar trend with consumers' favorable views around their
personal finances holding steady. We continue to see supportive trends for the home improvement industry.
Specifically, we found that over half of homeowners believe the value of their home is increasing and home
improvement spending intentions held steady, continuing to outpace overall spending intentions.
While this was no doubt a challenging quarter, we will continue to better match labor to demand and drive productivity.
Importantly, our fundamental strategy remains intact. We will continue to focus on providing customers with the best
omni-channel experiences to assist with their home improvement projects, whether they choose to connect in the store,
online, in their home, or through Lowe's contact centers. At the same time, Pro continues to outperform, and we'll
remain focused on deepening our relationship with this important customer.
Before I close, I'd like to thank our employees for their incredible commitment to serving customers. Their dedication
was certainly evident during times of need, including Hurricane Matthew and the extreme flooding in Louisiana. As
true members of the community, the team helped customers prepare for and rebuild after these disasters.
Thank you again for your interest in Lowe's. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Rick
Ricky D. Damron
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone.
As Robert mentioned, traffic slowed more than expected in the first two months of the quarter before improving in
October. Our Labor Day and Columbus Day events drove sequential comp improvement in the South and the West,
resulting in third quarter comps for those divisions that were in line with our expectations. However, we saw continued
softness in our North division throughout the quarter.
We posted positive comps in 10 of 13 product categories, while one category was flat. Both outdoor power equipment
and lawn and garden performed well given a focus on exterior maintenance and winter lawn preparation, as well as
opportunities from an extended planting and lawn cutting season. Once again, we drove above average comps in
appliances by leveraging our leading brands and service advantages as well as our investments in the customer
experience, both in-store and online.
Within seasonal living, grills posted double-digit comps, bolstered by our Weber and Char-Broil brand partnerships.
Additionally, our customer experience design capabilities continued to pay dividends. Leveraging our larger store
format in a space that was initially planned for outdoor living experience, we created a seasonal stage to anticipate
customers' needs for the season, showcasing an experience that helped drive a 65% comp in Halloween products, and
addressing fall preparation needs like lawn care and seasonal maintenance. We have now transitioned this space to our
holiday decor experience in preparation for the upcoming selling season. Once again, leveraging the seasonal stage, we
intend to help customers refresh their homes for guests, decorate, and organize their homes after the holidays.
We saw continued strong demand from the Pro customer, with comps well above the company average. Pro activity
drove solid comps in lumber and building materials and tools and hardware. We were able to capitalize on this demand
by improving our total assortment with destination brands like Marshalltown, a trusted Pro band and the leading
supplier of cement masonry tools, which rolled out to stores this quarter. This adds to our impressive portfolio of
Pro-focused tool brands, including exclusive by Hitachi and Bostitch, the number one and number two brands in
pneumatics, Vaughan, a leader in the hammer category, and our extensive private-label line of Kobalt tools.
The Louisiana floods and Hurricane Matthew drove broad-based demand across product categories. Our merchant,
vendor, logistics, and store teams worked closely together to identify the products needed before and after the storms

and efficiently moved inventory to the areas of greatest need. Historically, most major storms have four distinct phases;
first, preparation in advance of the storm; second, impact when the storm actually causes damage; third, cleanup; and
fourth, recovery when customers begin to make repairs and replace damaged items.
In the third quarter, we experienced preparation, impact, and some initial cleanup from Hurricane Matthew, and we're
into the recovery phase from the Louisiana floods. We expect hurricane recovery to begin in the fourth quarter and
extend into 2017. Bob will share further details about the impacts of these events in his comments.
We continue to focus on our strategic priorities, one of which is leveraging our omni-channel capabilities to help
customers achieve great project results. Customers can engage with our associates in-store for expert advice, our
content on lowes.com for inspiration, our contact centers for ongoing support, and our project specialists who work
with them in their homes to design, plan, and manage their home improvement projects.
In the second quarter, we relaunched our lowes.com site, providing an upgraded online shopping experience with
optimized functionality and display for touchscreen devices, improved product and content recommendations, refined
search algorithms, larger product images, and expanded product views, including video content. We've seen a great
response to the new website this quarter, which along with our flexible fulfillment options of buy online pickup in store
and buy online deliver from store combined to drive lowes.com comp growth of 20%.
Furthering our omni-channel capabilities, this quarter we completed the national rollout of our interior project
specialists. Both interior and exterior project specialists are now available across all U.S. home improvement stores to
meet with customers in their homes to design, plan, and complete their home improvement projects. This in-home
selling program represents another critical element of our omni-channel strategy with a differentiated capability in
capturing and servicing project demand. Our in-home sales program continues to outperform, with double-digit sales
growth again this quarter.
Our Pro business continues to thrive with comps well above the company average, driven by a favorable macro
backdrop as well as our continued efforts to optimize our product and service offering to better serve the Pro customer.
Beyond improvements in our tools offering, we have also strengthened our overall portfolio of Pro-focused brands and
made necessary investments into our inventory depth to optimally serve the Pro customer.
And we continue to incorporate feedback from Pro customers and store employees into a better offering and experience
while working to identify local market opportunities and introduce products optimized to local preferences to further
increase our relevance with Pros. Our ProServices team continues to advance a multi-level customer engagement
strategy across the country through LowesForPros.com and our national sales team, at the market level with our
Account Executive ProServices or AEPs, and at the store level, with our dedicated in-store ProServices teams.
Last year's relaunch of LowesForPros.com made it easy for Pros to manage multiple properties and quickly purchase
items nationwide. This full omni-channel experience allows Pros to easily order online and choose their preferred
fulfillment option of parcel, store pickup, or store delivery saving them both time and money.
Our AEPs work with larger regional customers to help them order and replenish products across multiple geographies
and locations. Our AEPs have been very effective in growing our business with larger Pro customers, especially
maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO customers. We currently have over 200 Pro outside sales representatives
in the field and continue to be very pleased with the program's results. And once again, we saw double-digit growth in
AEP sales this quarter, which contributed to the strong Pro comp growth. Our focus on further strengthening our
portfolio of brands, improving our inventory depth, and continuing to build upon our omni-channel offering through
our relaunch of LowsForPros.com and our growing ProServices team are all part of a broader commitment to build on a
strong foundation with the Pro.
In addition to our efforts to grow top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. As
Robert said, we are focused on optimizing associate hours to better match labor to customer demand. When we
experienced softer sales in the early part of the quarter, we worked to adjust labor accordingly. In fact, payroll average
improved substantially from August to September following our staffing adjustments. In order to maximize our
profitability, we will continue to optimize our mix of customer facing to non-customer facing hours.

While this was a challenging quarter, we continue to focus on executing our strategic priorities and making progress on
our initiatives to drive topline growth and improve productivity and profitability.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert F. Hull
Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone.
First, let me remind you that Q3 includes a full quarter of RONA's financial results. In conjunction with the transaction,
RONA's operating results were adjusted to reflect purchase accounting as well as to align their accounting policies with
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. They will be included in our comps sales calculation after we
anniversary the transaction in the second quarter of 2017.
Now, on to our Q3 results, sales for the third quarter were $15.7 billion, an increase of 9.6%. Total customer
transactions grew 7.5% with RONA accounting for about 85% of the increase. And total average ticket increased 2% to
$68.68. The sales increase was driven by the addition of RONA, an increase in comp sales, and new stores. For Q3,
approximately $900 million or 6.3% of the sales growth came from RONA. New stores contributed approximately 60
basis points of the sales growth.
Comps sales were 2.7% driven by an average ticket increase of 2.2% and transaction growth of one half of 1%.
Looking at monthly trends, comps were 1% in August, 2.1% in September, and 5.1% in October. We estimate that the
net impact of weather positively impacted comp sales in the quarter by approximately 60 basis points. The benefits of
serving customers in storm-impacted areas was somewhat offset by heavy rain in the middle of the country in August
as well as extreme heat early in the quarter.
Gross margin for the quarter was 34.35% of sales, which decreased 40 basis points from Q3 last year. Gross margin
was negatively impacted by RONA due to both purchase accounting adjustments and the mix of business. In the
quarter, these items negatively impacted gross margin by 46 basis points. SG&A for the quarter was 25.98% of sales,
which deleveraged 309 basis points.
As Robert noted, there were several non-cash charges negatively impacting our results. Our one-third interest in the
Australian joint venture is classified as a long-term investment on our balance sheet. Per the terms of the joint venture
agreement, our investment should be valued as a going concern as of January 18, 2016, the date we exercised our put
option. However, Woolworths, the majority partner, has commenced the wind-down process.
Given this unilateral action, accounting rules require us to recognize an incremental $290 million charge, which
contributed 184 basis points to the deleverage. Our claim related to going-concern value as of January 18, which is
above and beyond the amounts expected to be received through the wind-down process, will be recognized as realized.
This matter is currently in arbitration.
Also, as part of an ongoing review of our strategic initiatives in an effort to focus on critical projects that will drive our
desired outcomes, we made the decision to cancel and re-scope a number of projects resulting in a write-off of $96
million, which caused 60 basis points of deleverage. A number of these projects were technology-enabled, and we were
trying to customize a solution. With technology advancing so rapidly, off-the-shelf products became less costly, and a
faster deployment alternative.
Lastly, we recorded $76 million of goodwill and long-lived asset impairments related to our Orchard Supply Hardware
operations, resulting in 48 basis points of deleverage. We invested in Orchard in 2013 to capitalize on the opportunities
to significantly increase our market share in California.
Post-acquisition, we made critical investments to improve the infrastructure and remodel retail facilities that, prior to
bankruptcy, had been neglected. In addition, we launched several initiatives as we work to reinvigorate the Orchard
business model.

Specifically, we tested a variety of things, including new store opening density, new market penetration approaches and
atypical prototypes to allow for more metro market penetration. Over the past two years our combination of some tests
proved more difficult to achieve, and pressures from the historic drought conditions on the gardening and nursery
business have caused the business to perform below our expectations.
Learnings from these tests have shaped how we take the brand and market opportunity forward. In fact, we've begun to
see these learnings reflected in our results. As Robert noted, Orchard drove mid-single-digit comps in the quarter.
Adjusting for the non-cash charges, SG&A for the quarter was 23.05% of sales, which deleveraged 16 basis points.
This deleverage was from the following items: risk insurance, which was driven by a favorable adjustment last year
that didn't repeat this year; private label credit costs due to an increase in loan losses; and store payroll as a result of
slow sales trends early in the quarter. These items were partially offset by 27 basis points of leverage and bonus.
Depreciation for the quarter was $378 million, which was 2.4% of sales and leveraged 21 basis points. Earnings before
interests and taxes or EBIT decreased 328 basis points to 5.97% of sales. Adjusted EBIT decreased 35 basis points to
8.9% of sales. RONA impact associated with purchase accounting adjustments, the mix of business and integration
costs negatively impacted EBIT by 55 basis points in the quarter.
For the quarter, interest expense was $163 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 51.2%. The higher rate
was driven by the joint venture non-cash charge, which was a long-term capital loss.
Future recoveries related to our claim will be capital gain and result in a reduction in the effective tax rate in the quarter
they are realized. Earnings per share were $0.43 for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.88. Earnings from
RONA's operating results offset purchase accounting adjustments and integration costs.
Now, to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was
$960 million. Inventory at nearly $11 billion increased $556 million or 5.3% versus Q3 last year. The increase relates
to the addition of RONA. Inventory turnover was 3.89x, up 4 basis points to last year. Asset turnover increased 4 basis
points to.
Moving on to the liabilities section of the balance sheet, accounts payable of $7.8 billion represented a 6.8% increase
over Q3 last year due to the timing of purchases year-over-year, terms improvement as well as the addition of RONA.
At the end of the third quarter lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.36x.
Return on invested capital was 13.6%. The net impact of last year's non-cash impairment charge related to our
Australian joint venture and this year's foreign currency hedge gain and non-cash charges hurt ROIC by 318 basis
points.
Now, looking at the statement of cash flows, year-to-date operating cash flow was $5.3 billion. Capital expenditures
were $820 million, resulting in free cash flow of over $4.4 billion, which was up 20% to last year.
In August, we entered into a $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, which settled in the quarter for 3.4
million shares. Also, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares for $300 million through the open market. In
total, we repurchased $550 million of stock in the quarter. We've approximately $630 million remaining under share
repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. First, a reminder that fiscal 2016
will include an extra week in the fourth quarter, for a total of 14 weeks and 53 weeks for the year. Also, based on our
year-to-date operating performance and updated expectations for the fourth quarter, we revised our fiscal 2016 business
outlook.
For 2016, we now expect total sales increase of 9% to 10%, driven by a variety of factors. First, we are forecasting a
comp sales increase of 3% to 4%. Second, we expect RONA to contribute 4% to sales growth. Next, we anticipate the
53rd week will aid total sales by 1.5%. Lastly, we plan to open 40 stores, which adds 0.5%.

On a GAAP basis, we're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 65 basis points. While the acquisition of
RONA adds EBIT dollars, there's a negative impact to the percent of sales due to both RONA's lower EBIT rate and
the impacts of purchase accounting I noted a moment ago. Combined, these items pressure EBIT by 35 basis points for
the year.
Negative impacts to Q4 are estimated to be 40 basis points. For Q4 on a GAAP basis, we expect EBIT improvement of
approximately 490 basis points. The impact of last year's joint venture charge is 400 basis points. The remaining 90
basis points of expected EBIT growth comes from primarily expense leverage, notably bonus and depreciation.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 40.1%. The higher than expected rate is driven by the joint venture non-cash
charge. For the year on a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.52.
We're forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.6 billion. Our forecast for capital expenditures is
approximately $1.5 billion, which results in estimated free cash flow of $4.1 billion for 2016. Our guidance assumes
approximately $3.5 billion in share repurchase for 2016.
Regina, we're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. So the growth you put up in the
second quarter was a little less than half of the growth of the industry, with pronounced underperformance in traffic. Do
you think that was more due to draw or conversion? And how do you improve each of those factors while improving
your cost structure?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Mike, as we've talked about in the past, we've put in place systems to monitor the inflow of
customer traffic. As a result, we've been able to monitor that relative to our transaction activity to have a perspective on
conversion rate. For the third quarter, we actually saw a modest improvement in conversion rate, which means the
problem is more related to draw.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: And how do you anticipate improving that with costs under pressure?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Hi, Michael. This is Mike McDermott. As Bob and Robert stated, our traffic slowed
more than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October. We saw particular weakness in the
North. Additionally, we found that we've got opportunities to improve our customer engagement, promotional
targeting, and marketing reach across the country.
Throughout the quarter, we made some necessary adjustments to our consumer messaging, further refined our media
mix, and tweaked our promotional activity in the quarter, which supported that improvement that we saw in October.
We anticipate improved traffic in the fourth quarter as we continue to work those actions.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay. My follow-up question is, as you look across your store base, has the slowdown
that you experienced throughout the last couple of quarters been consistent across the entire population of stores, or has
it been more pronounced in certain types of areas, more rural areas have underperformed, more suburban or urban
areas, adjusting for the weather?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Michael, this is Rick. As we look at our store base, we continued, as we said, to see softness
in the North. As we communicated in Q2, the North was from an overall performance expectation our
lower-performing division at that time. So we saw that trend continue into Q3. As Mike said, we have some
opportunity to continue to improve our mix to this customer as it relates to how we're going to market from a media
perspective and how they consume marketing and advertising, so we know we have some opportunity to do that.

When we look at the overall store base, we see our largest opportunities to be in the most urban markets, where we
have more significant competitive pressure either out-stored and by multiple locations to the competition and/or in most
of our three-way markets. So I would say, from a geographical standpoint and a store-base standpoint, we still see most
of the pressure coming from the heavy dense metro and urban markets.

Your next question will come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. So first question for Robert Niblock, today you mentioned in your comments
moderating home improvement market. I don't know if I interpreted or heard it right. I know last quarter we talked
about not seeing a lot of change in wholesale trends. You mentioned the survey that you run for sentiment, so it
sounded like things were okay. Again, I don't know if I'm taking that moderating comment out of context, but curious
what's changed from second to third quarter, especially if there were some maybe weather issues that maybe explain
some of the early quarter weakness.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yes, Simeon. I'll be glad to clarify that for you. Overall, from a consumer standpoint, their
feelings around the home, the value of their home increasing, with that their intentions to invest in the home have all
continued to be strong during the year. From the beginning of the year, based on what we saw in the data, we said that
we had thought home improvement would – the overall factors would moderate some as we went through the year. So
for example, total housing turnover is expected to be annualized at 4.8% versus 7.3% last year.
Home price appreciation, this year the forecast is 4.9% versus 5.5% last year, so still strong numbers, but moderating;
disposable income at 2.6% annualized this year versus 3.5% last year. And part of that was driven by the increased
turnover that we saw a year ago. We knew that, that would moderate some, so we still expect it to be very healthy
environment. We still think the number one driver that's out there is continued appreciation in homes, but it has
moderated some. It's still a very healthy industry, but not to the extent that we would've seen the numbers supporting a
year ago.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up, in the press release, this quote, you're evaluating
meaningful incremental opportunities to drive shareholder value. Can you talk about the timing, the size, the
magnitude, and then what's prompting you to make that comment now? What's causing that?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: We've obviously been for a while looking at ways to improve productivity. And so, we've
been undertaking initiative throughout the past couple of months looking at our productivity and opportunities to
improve that, rationalize our cost structure. A couple of things, we talked about the project – portfolio rationalization
that we mentioned, as Bob mentioned, some technology-enabled projects to get us to focus on the critical few, which
led to the non-cash write-off that you saw in our press release, today.
Rick talked about continued work to optimize our labor hours in the store against our customer demand, and we have a
number of other work streams underway as well as we're looking across the entire organization and say, how do we
better rationalize, what we're doing. If you think about as we're moving to an omni-channel world and continuing to
move that way in an accelerating pace, and we're making sure we're investing in the right areas to make sure that we
support where the customer wants us to be.
So as I've said, we've got some other work streams in place, and we'll be able to give you additional detail, we believe
at the Analyst and Investor Conference, but we're not ready today to get into those details with you. It is a
comprehensive review.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. I guess just to clarify, and I guess some of this will be teed up at the Investor Day,
but is it more SG&A streamlining? Because I know you took this Orchard write-off, but you mentioned Orchard comps

sounded like they were pretty healthy. So I'm just trying to connect those two?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: There are a couple of things. One is – I think we have two things, one is, as you heard, a
little bit ago from both Rick and from Mike McDermott. It's like we have an opportunity to continue to drive sales and
traffic into our stores by continuing to look at our marketing message, the promotional cadence we use, the move that
we've made to digital over the past few months that has been – where we've seen great response to as we continue to
remix – I think, with our media mix modeling to what we've been able to remix the message. So it is driving additional
traffic to drive additional sales on one hand, on the other hand it is rationalizing our cost across the organization. So it
really is a two-pronged approach.
Specifically, with regard to Orchard that you mentioned, as Bob talked a little bit about in his comments, we bought out
of bankruptcy. The impact on the customer franchise from bankruptcy, the remodeling of the stores, the fact that we're
going to change the technology and platform out there and bring it up to speed; all of those things.
The lifting was just a little heavier than we thought, but we're at a great point now as we're starting to see our great
performance in the fundamental stores that are out – we've kind of rationalized how we're going to use Orchard going
forward. So we're still very optimistic about what we can – what Orchard can do for us. Just getting to this point was a
little more difficult than we had anticipated.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Thanks, good morning. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much weather
impacted each of the months of the quarter, you saw a nice improvement in October. Just trying to understand how
much of that would've been weather? And then just wondering, did you see an improvement in the non-weather
impacted markets in October as well?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: So, Seth, as we think about the weather impact, the heavy rains in the middle of the country,
which in fact led to the flood in Louisiana, as well as extreme heat had a pretty significant negative impact on the
month of August. So the net impact was probably 80 basis points unfavorable in August.
As we think about the recovery efforts, mostly as Rick said, given the stage for Louisiana flooding, which is about
two-thirds of the benefit we're seeing from the recovery efforts. That would've helped September about 90 basis points,
and would've helped October by roughly 150 basis points. If you exclude the benefit from serving customers in those
impacted markets, we did see an improvement in underlying trends in the month of October.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then, just as you look at the Pro side of the business, it's nice to
hear it's outperforming. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the outperformance? Maybe how that compares to
prior quarters? And I know there's been a big focus on effective promotions to try to get that customer reengaged here
as you improve the assortment and the offering. Just give us a sense of how that's played out. Thanks.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Sure. The performance in Pro has continued to be strong. As we've talked about over the
past several quarters, the Pro consumer continues to outpace our DIY consumers across the business portfolio. And I
think a lot of that still continues to focus on really a few things that we've done, Seth, to continue to drive that
customer.
The merchants first have done an outstanding job in working with the operators to bring in the brands that really drive
relevance with the Pro. We've talked a lot about that, but we don't want to underestimate the impact that having the
right brands in our stores that these customers really value does to help us drive that business.
Second thing that I would highlight is the fact that we continue to leverage our organization from that multi-level
design approach to really be able to service these customers in a different and unique way, leveraging our National

Accounts teams to really help them that perspective. Diving deep at the market level and really working with our larger
MRO customers and larger accounts to drive incremental share, and be more relevant from that perspective. Leveraging
our 5 Ways to Save programs, where I think, our Pro see significant value in our initiatives to drive incremental value
for them. The relaunch of LowesForPros.com from in Q2 of last year, which was really an informational site into a
commerce site and the transactional site has continued to help us drive significant growth.
And then fourth, the investments we've made into inventory to continue to improve our breadth and our depth of
products that are really critical to this customer. So we see this as a continued evolution of our Pro initiative. We are
extremely pleased with the receptivity of the Pro to the actions that we're taking. And I think that shows in the numbers
especially this quarter and over this last several quarters as we continue to drive greater relevance with the customer.
<Q - Seth I. Sigman>: Okay. Thanks. Very helpful.

Your next question will come from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot, and good morning. So, Mike McDermott, in his remarks today talked about
some of the actions that you took through the quarter to enhance sales performance including tweaking the promotional
cadence and some other things. Can you talk about what impacts that had on profitability over the course of the
quarter? Clearly, you had a much better month in October. Was there some cost to operating margin or operating
margin trend associated with some of the changes that you made?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Matt, I'll start with the profitability and let Mike add some color. As we think about the
comp progression as we talked about, payroll was a little heavy to start the quarter given sales trends. Rick described
the significant improvement in payroll productivity from August to September, so we feel really good where we are
exiting the quarter.
From a promotional standpoint, the reported margin was down 40 basis points. Absent the RONA impact of 46 basis
points, margin was actually up six basis points. So we feel really good about the ability to refine the promotional mix
without having a disproportionate drag on gross margin.
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: I would only add to that by saying working closely with our vendor partners, the
merchants have done a great job working on cost of goods in a consistent way and making sure that we remix our
promotional strategy consistent with where the consumers' mind is. Promotional environment in the third quarter was in
line with previous periods with the exception of only a couple of categories. We saw a little bit of elevated activity in
the appliance business really related to additional competitors in the space. Some elevated activity in flooring as the
carpet industry in general is in decline. And grills really related to specific close out activity associated with Weber's
re-launch of their Genesis line. Behavior is fairly typical across competitors as everybody's shifting promotional focus
to engage the customer. And early indications in the fourth quarter, our promotional activity seems comparable from an
intensity perspective versus prior year.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: That's very helpful detail. One quick follow up. So, your earnings guidance was quite
precise, which I guess is most important. You have still for the year a one percentage point range of comp outcomes
between 3% and 4%, which when we put that variability to the fourth quarter, suggest a much wider range. Do you care
to weigh in at all on what kind of sales thought process underlies that earnings number for the quarter?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Matt, coming out of a tough third quarter, we did, as you might imagine, spent quite a bit of
time thinking about our outlook for the fourth quarter, and in fact, wanted to put forth both sales and earnings figures
that we felt confident in our ability to achieve. So as we think about the implied comp for the fourth quarter, it's a 2%
comp. So certainly coming off of 2.7% in the third quarter with strengthening trends at the end of the quarter, we felt –
feel like that's certainly achievable. And in fact, we're off to a good start in the fourth quarter, running ahead of the 2%
comp expectations.

From a profitability perspective, we take a look at the levers we have. I mentioned in my comments for Q4, absent the
JV charge last year at 90 basis points of EBIT expansion coming from bonus and depreciation, we feel pretty confident
about the ability, based on the forecast, to achieve those. So we feel good about where we are coming out of Q3 and
feel good about the start to Q4, and confident in our ability to achieve the implied Q4 results.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Matt, this is Robert. As we said on...
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thank you for that clarification. I appreciate it. Oh, go ahead.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: As you know, as we've talked in the past, Q4 can be a very weather-sensitive quarter. We
had great weather last year, so we are cycling some pretty strong comps that we had in the December – January
timeframe. So we took that all into account when we built our guidance. As Bob said, even though we're very pleased
with the way the quarter started, we took all that into account as we looked at putting the implied guidance out there for
you.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Thanks. I'm strategically curious how you're thinking about balancing the investment in SG&A
relative to your sales or market share performance. A lot on productivity that you've identified opportunities with
productivity that it sounds like you're going to talk more about. But I'm curious, as you think about investing to perform
better on the top line relative to saving to improve leverage and productivity, just curious strategically how you're
thinking about how you're balancing those two.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Eric. I'll start. But certainly, what we're focused on is where do we need to be investing that
is going to resonate with the consumer, particularly in an omni-channel environment today and give us the payback that
we need. So some great examples, as we've talked about, it's how we're looking at our media mix modeling and the
amount we're investing in digital and how it's going to resonate with the consumer, social media, all those type of
things. The things Rick's doing to look at how we're allocating labor hours across the store and we think about how
we're engaging with the consumer today online, in-home, in-store, how we're reallocating those hours to ensure that
we're there at the right times so that we're investing where it makes sense for the consumer.
We talked about our rationalization of projects, technology-enabled. So which are the ones that will really resonate
with the consumer where we can add the best value and focusing on those. And then separately, looking across the
organization, whether it's from looking at things like enterprise, strategic sourcing, how are we allocating all of our – or
aggregating all of our spend together so that we're getting better value associated with that. Where are other areas
where in today's environment that we have invested in the past but we don't need to invest in the future? That we can
rationalize that spending, that helps drive the ability to invest in areas that resonate with the consumer and also drive
better productivity across the organization.
So it is a comprehensive review that we're undertaking with a number of work streams, with executives on point and in
charge of those various work streams as they're working together to really look at how we're going to deliver greater
value for shareholders in the future as well as drive the ongoing relationship that consumers require in an omni-channel
environment.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: I guess as a follow-up, I'd be curious as you think about and you stated earlier that you
underperformed the market growth this quarter. As you move forward, and maybe this is something for Mike
McDermott in his new role, is there a commitment? And what is the strategy or cornerstones of the strategy to get back
to growing at least in line, if not ahead of the market, or is that not as relevant of a metric for you as you think about the
business moving forward?

<A - Michael P. McDermott>: It's certainly relevant to grow in excess of the market. Where we're going to spend a lot
of our time initially is focusing our marketing spend as it relates to our digital platforms, allowing us to be more nimble
in shifting our messaging and adjusting to weather or traffic dynamics as we see them unfold throughout the quarter.
We've worked to reduce our print advertising and expand our presence on social media, increase digital advertising,
including digital display, online video and search. So I think there's an opportunity for us to take a look at the
investment, the overall investment that we've got in marketing. Really that analog-to-digital transformation is where
we'll focus initially to make sure that we're driving traffic to any of the contact points for our customer.

Your next question comes from the line of Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alan Rifkin>: Thank you very much. As we move into the recovery phase from both the flooding and the
hurricane, can you may be shed some color on what you think the benefit will be both to the fourth quarter as well as to
2017, and how long that tail may in fact last?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Alan, as Rick talked about in his comments, there are stages to each event in the recovery
efforts. Each store event is difficult to predict. It depends on the type of damage. It depends upon the amount of
recovery required. It depends upon the population density in which the storm activity occurs. So we do expect further
benefit into Q4 and 2017, but that's tough to estimate going forward.
<Q - Alan Rifkin>: Okay. And my follow-up, if I may, could you maybe just provide, Robert, an update on how the
assimilation of RONA is going, what you're seeing with respect to systems conversions and potential nameplate
changes? If you can give us an update there, that would be great.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Alan, as I said in my comments, we're to date very pleased with what's going on with the
RONA assimilation. I just met up and met with the team here last month. I'm very pleased about the activities, the work
streams they have in place to do the assimilation integration. Now actually Richard Maltsbarger, since that report's up
through him, is in the room. I'll get him to talk a little bit more detail about how the integration is going. Richard?
<A - Richard D. Maltsbarger>: Sure. Alan, thank you for the question. As you know, when we set out on the RONA
journey, we specifically focused on key areas of top line and bottom line synergy, and both are very well on track.
We've been quite confident and encouraged by the first six months of working together as a team, specifically seeing
great progress towards what we announced as a critical element of this in terms of rolling out appliances across all of
Canada and seeing great share uptake in the markets in which we're testing that. We're also seeing great combinations
of the two teams identifying new areas of synergy and joint operations that we may not have even planned on prior to
the deal.
<Q - Alan Rifkin>: Okay. If I may, relative to where your original expectations are, do you believe, Robert, that the
benefits may be greater, the same, or not as great as what you originally thought when you completed the deal?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Alan, I'd say we're six months into it. We feel good about what has taken place today and
where we're at from an integration standpoint. As Richard indicated, we're seeing incremental opportunity that we
believe that's out there. But as you know, as you get through this, there could still be some unknowns. So to get here
until to say that we think it's dramatically better than what we thought six months ago, no, but to sit here and say that
basically what we're seeing, we're even more confident in at least the business case, if not greater at this point. In the
integration journey, I'd say, that we're confident in the business case and see upside to it but not ready to quantify it at
this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: I wanted to follow up on some of the category growth in the third quarter.
Which core categories were actually negative in the quarter? And as you think about core repair and model categories
like mill work, rough plumbing, rough electrical and paint, did you see improvement in those categories as the quarter
progressed? And then, Robert, you mentioned that you expected more moderate growth but still solid growth in the
home improvement industry going forward. How should we think about that growth? What do you think 2015 grew
and how do you think about the growth rate going forward?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: I'll start off, Chris, and I'll get Mike McDermott talk a little more about it in detail. Just to
your high-level question, paint and kitchens were the two categories that were negative during the quarter, and Mike
will give you some more details on how they progressed and our thoughts there.
Yeah, as I said, the overall environment from a macro standpoint moderated somewhat from housing turnover, home
value appreciation, but it's still a very healthy environment. When you combine that with the fact that we performed
below our expectations we know we have opportunity to improve our performance. And marry that up, we still think
there's great opportunity for our outlook, our performance going forward as we continue to improve our execution in an
environment that may be just slightly less robust than what it was a year ago.
So that's kind of the way I would sum up kind of the headline story, and with that I'll get Mike McDermott to talk a
little bit more about the detailed product categories.
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Sure. Paint had soft performance early in the quarter that we were unable to overcome
as the business improved throughout. Softness was primarily due to weakness in exterior paint projects within the
North region specifically. We also saw the Kitchen category deliver a negative comp for the quarter while we drove a
positive comp in cabinets and countertops, the aggregate kitchen comp was reduced by weaker performance in closet
organization and shelving. The other category that was flat was millwork, and we did see improvement throughout the
quarter in that product category.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: And then, Mike, you are new to the role, Mike Jones I think to the surprise of
lot of investors did left the company earlier, actually not too long ago. Can you talk about how your views on the
business are going to be different from the way that Mike Jones approached it? And how do you think about this
transition opportunity going forward?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Well, I'm very excited about the opportunity to serve our customers and our team
members. I can tell you we're going to be laser-focused on delivering the best omni-channel experience possible, and
supporting our customers through their home improvement project needs. So different or the same, our focus is on the
customer and evolving to serve their needs.
<Q - Christopher Michael Horvers>: Okay. And then one quick last one. Bob, with some of the changes, the
write-offs, how should we think about this impact depreciation going forward? And then related to that, how are you
thinking about the impact to actually the flow-through model? I know you talk about 20 basis points of EBIT above –
for each point comp above one. Do any of these write-offs change that algorithm? Thanks very much

<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Chris, as we think about I guess both for 2016 both the GAAP as well as the adjusted EBIT
outlook, we are at about 24 basis points flow-through, so a touch below of 25 basis points to 30 basis points range.
We'll talk more about the future when we see you next month for our analyst conference regarding specific
expectations for 2017 through 2019. As it relates to depreciation, depreciation is down modestly this year, even
including the depreciation associated with RONA. This will reduce that depreciation trajectory somewhat for 2017, but
nothing material.

Your next question...
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: If we could just have one more question.
Operator
And your final question will come from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Great. I got couple of questions. One question, two parts. Bob, you mentioned RONA was 55 bps
EBIT in the third quarter because of the mix of purchase accounting and then the actual business mix. And I think you
said it was 40 bps in your guidance for the fourth quarter. Is it fair to assume that the fourth quarter is now just a clean
mix impact of RONA or is there still some other runoffs and purchase accounting in there? And I have a follow up.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So when I talked about the purchase accounting impacts last quarter, there were more
pronounced early and dissipate over time to the extent they are essentially immaterial as we get into 2017. So, yes, as
we get further away from the transaction, a large proportion of the EBIT impact is from the mix of business, yes.
<Q - Greg Melich>: So if you take the 55 bps it might've been 25 bps purchase accounting in the third quarter, it might
be 10 bps in the fourth quarter and then fade?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: That's a good way to think about it.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Conceptually. And then second, I think it ties into – and Mike it was great to hear your thoughts
about the new role and things to focus on. As we look at the quarter and how the traffic improved, is it fair to say that
the improvement in the comp, if you back out the weather, was more traffic or ticket driven? And Mike if you think
about the chief customer role and you mentioned omni-channel, how do you view that in terms of a way to drive traffic
and transaction counts as you think into not just the fourth quarter but next year?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: I think we'll continue to focus on a balance between traffic and ticket utilizing all of
our omni-channel resources. So when I think about the role of Chief Customer Officer, it really is to balance those two
things. Leveraging all the tools at our disposal.
<Q - Greg Melich>: And on the traffic improvement that you have seen since the summer, is it fair to say that the
comp improvement was all traffic or was there ticket and traffic in that?
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: There was ticket and traffic in that improvement.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Great. Thanks, good luck.
<A - Michael P. McDermott>: Thank you.
