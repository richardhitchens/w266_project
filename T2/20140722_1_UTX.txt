Okay. Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the press release today, UTC reported second
quarter earnings per share of $1.84, that's up 12% excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. Adjusted
segment operating margins expanded by 90 basis points to 17.1% in the quarter. That concludes a solid first half with
4% organic sales growth and earnings per share up 11%, excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. All
of that gives us confidence to increase the bottom end of our EPS range. So we now expect 2014 earnings per share of
$6.75 to $6.85, that's growth of 9% to 10% versus our previous guidance of $6.65 to $6.85.
Okay, turning to slide two, organic sales. Organic sales grew 3% in the quarter, led by strong growth at Aerospace
Systems and Otis. In the commercial businesses, we saw 3% growth in the America, led by 15% growth at Otis.
In Europe, where the economic recovery remains tepid, organic sales were down 1% in the quarter. However, Asia saw
a 5% growth. In China, specifically, commercial sales grew by 10%, lead by Otis, which was up 15%.
Looking at Aerospace, continued weakness in defense where sales were down 4% was more than offset by strong
growth in commercial OE and the aftermarket where overall sales increased 7%.
Moving to slide three, order trends, overall trends remain positive for the majority of our portfolio. And just a reminder,
we will talk to the commercial businesses on a constant currency basis as we usually do. In our commercial businesses,
we continue to see traction in North America. U.S. consumer confidence hit a six-year high in June and the outlook for
commercial construction remains encouraging.
ABI trends are positive and we continue to see that coming through in our orders at Otis, where North America new
equipment orders were up 44%. Commercial HVAC orders were up 3% in the quarter. North American residential
HVAC orders were down slightly versus last year. And you'll recall we had a very strong first quarter as distributors
ordered ahead of the summer cooling season, but residential orders year-to-date are essentially in line with our
expectations for the year.
In Europe, as I said before, the economic recovery remains slow. Eurozone PMI and economic sentiment eased some in
June on concerns over the rising oil prices and the situations in the Middle East and the Ukraine. But, both indicators
remain in positive territory and growth is expected to pick up in the second half. And we saw that reflected in UTC's
order rates in the region. Otis' new equipment orders were up 10%, led by strong growth in Eastern Europe where
orders were up more than 20%, while in developed Europe orders grew at a 4% rate.
CCS Fire & Security product orders grew 18% and commercial refrigeration orders were up 5% and commercial
HVAC grew at 2%.
In China, as you know, the government has recently stepped up spending on infrastructure project and eased banks'
reserve requirements to shore up growth. In the second quarter, orders for CCS commercial HVAC were up 7% and
Fire products were up 10%. Otis' new equipment orders were flat on a tough compare from last year. You'll recall that
last year Otis saw orders up 39% in China in the second quarter, partly due to a large order for the Goldin Finance 117
Tower in Tianjin. China new equipment backlog is up 20% versus the prior year. And on a unit basis, new equipment
orders were up 12% in the quarter. So our Building & Industrial Systems businesses continue to be well positioned as
we head into the back half of the year.
Moving to Aerospace with airline profits expected to be almost $18 billion this year and ongoing growth in air traffic,
we continue to see solid conversion of new equipment backlogs and growth in our commercial aftermarket businesses.
At Pratt & Whitney, commercial spares orders were down 6% due in part to a strong first quarter. Total large
commercial engine aftermarket sales were up 10% in the quarter on the back of a continued trend of heavy overhauls
going through our shops, and this continues to support our expectations for full-year aftermarket growth of about 5%.
At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial spares orders were up 28%, driven primarily by strength in provisioning.
While some uncertainties still exists in the global economic outlook, order rates and macroeconomic trends continue to
support our assumptions for organic growth of about 4% for the full year.
Okay, so on slide four, taking a closer look at the second quarter, total reported sales increased 7% as 3% organic
growth and the $830 million cumulative sales adjustment for the Canadian Maritime Program were partially offset by

headwinds from net divestitures. Segment operating profit grew 8% and operating margins increased by 90 basis
points, including the benefit from pension. CCS saw the benefit of restructuring and product cost reduction initiatives
where operating profit grew 9% leading to margin expansion of 210 basis points.
Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems expanded margins by 150 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, each
on the benefits from cost reduction actions and lower pension expense. Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.84,
that's up 8%. Restructuring costs and other one-time items, which include the CMHP charge in the quarter, were fully
offset by favorable tax-related items. You'll recall the second quarter of 2013 had $0.05 of net gains. Absent the impact
of the prior year net gains, earnings per share were up 12%.
Free cash flow in the quarter was 80% of net income. Capital expenditures were $406 million, that's up 10% versus last
year, as we continue to invest for the ramp-up in commercial aero. And working capital grew by more than $400
million in the quarter. We acquired $335 million of our stock under our share repurchase programs and we expect to
buyback a similar amount in the third quarter.
Let me stop there for now, I'll be back more to talk about full year. But first, let me turn it over to Jay to take you
through the business unit results.
Jay Malave
Thanks, Greg. Turning to page five, Otis sales improved 7% in the quarter with new equipment sales up mid-teens
including solid growth from all areas, most notably in China, the Americas, and the Middle East. Service sales were up
slightly. Operating profit was up 3% in constant currency. Strong new equipment volume, most notably in Asia and the
Americas, drove the increase in operating profit moderated by continued pricing pressure. New equipment orders were
up 3% with double-digit growth in the Americas and Europe.
As Greg mentioned earlier, orders in China were flat for the quarter against a tough compare to last year, which
included the Goldin Finance 117 in Tianjin project. While new equipment activity in China is normalizing to levels in
line with our expectations for the year, we were encouraged in the quarter with solid growth in new equipment unit
bookings.
Based on year-to-date trends, we now expect the operating profit for the full year to increase $100 million to $125
million from our prior expectation of $100 million to $150 million on mid-single-digit sales growth. Otis expects to see
improving performance in the second half from strong new equipment sales growth and continued improvement in
factory performance in North America.
On slide six, Climate, Controls & Security increased profit 9% in the quarter on 3% lower sales, resulting in margin
expansion of 210 basis points to 19%. Organic sales were down 1% with mixed results across regions. Organic sales
[indiscernible] (9:11) digit, including slower backlog conversions in the commercial HVAC business. Transicold was
flattish and Europe was up slightly. U.S. residential HVAC was flat for the quarter following a solid first quarter, which
included the benefit of early distributor stocking. For the first half, the residential HVAC business reported
high-single-digit sales growth in line with the full year expectation. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by
restructuring and integration savings, lower commodity costs, as well as continuing product cost reduction effort.
Equipment orders were up 2% with global commercial HVAC equipment up low-single-digit led by China. Orders for
global Fire & Security products were up mid-single-digit, more than offsetting a decline in the Fire & Security field
businesses. Transicold equipment orders were up mid-single-digit. Based on first half results, we continue to expect
profit growth of $225 million to $250 million for the full year at CCS, now on low-single-digits organic sales growth
from our previous expectation of mid-single-digit.
Turning to Aerospace on slide seven, at Pratt & Whitney, operating profit was up 11% on 1% lower sales, resulting in
margin expansion of 150 basis points. Organic sales were up 1% as 10% growth in large commercial aftermarket more
than offset declines in commercial OE and military. The operating profit growth was mainly driven by lower pension
costs and restructuring savings. In the absence of last year's contract closeout benefit, it was partially offset by a gain

on the sale of product line this quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney's operating profit to be
up $175 million to $200 million on low-single-digit sales growth.
UTC Aerospace Systems delivered another solid quarter with 14% operating profit growth on 9% higher sales. Sales
growth was driven by higher commercial OE and aftermarket volume, up a combined 16%, partially offset by a
low-single-digit decline in military sales. Year-on-year profit growth was driven by higher commercial aftermarket
volume, a favorable impact from a customer contract settlement, continued synergy traction and pension tailwind,
partially offset by higher engineering spend on new OE programs. Operating margins increased 70 basis points to
16.7%.
Orders for commercial spares grew 28% at a year-over-year basis, led by strength in provisioning. Commercial spares
in the first half of the year are up 18% on a year-over-year basis with year-to-date book-to-bill just north of 1.0. For the
year, we continue to expect profit growth of $300 million to $350 million on mid- to high-single-digit sales growth at
UTC Aerospace Systems.
Turning to Sikorsky on slide nine, operating profit decreased by 10% on 1% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky
shipped a total of 63 aircraft, including 46 based on military platforms and 17 commercial. The sales decrease was
driven by lower U.S. Government OE and aftermarket volumes, partially offset by higher international military and
commercial OE sales. On profit, the headwinds from net unfavorable contract performance adjustments, primarily in
the military business more than offset benefits from restructuring, pension, and other cost reduction actions. During the
second quarter, Sikorsky was awarded two significant contracts for the development of the VXX Marine One
replacement aircraft for the U.S. Navy and a combat search and rescue helicopter for the U.S. Air Force. These
contracts in total exceed $2.5 billion with follow-on production orders expected to exceed $10 billion.
Based on CMHP contract amendments and other contract performance adjustments, as well as aftermarket trends
through the first half, we now expect higher year-over-year operating profit of about $25 million on low-single-digit
sales growth from our prior expectation of flattish profit on high-single-digit sales growth.
With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay, thanks, Jay. So overall another solid quarter for UTC and we continue to achieve important program milestones
and secure key wins for the future. Some highlights in the quarter, we announced several significant wins at the
Farnborough Air Show last week. At Pratt & Whitney, we continue to see strong demand for the GTF engine across
platforms, including recent wins on the A320neo, CSeries, Embraer E2, and MRJ. Customers clearly see the advantage
of the GTF product and have placed firm and option orders for 6,000 engines. In May, Pratt delivered the first ship set
of Geared Turbofan engines to Airbus and it's ready to support the first flight of the neo later this year.
As you've no-doubt heard, we've had a couple of engine-related development issues in the quarter. While certainly
disappointing, these things do happen in development programs, which is why we put the engines through such a
rigorous test process. The good news is that the issues are unrelated and in the big picture, the fixes will be relatively
minor. We're pleased that the Pentagon has approved the JSF for resumed flying on a limited basis. The F135 engine
has accumulated more than 26,000 ground and flight test hours, but we continue to learn and develop the technology to
provide our customers with the capability and reliability they require.
On the CSeries, we understand the root cause of the incident and we're working closely with Bombardier to resume
flight testing as soon as possible. The fundamental architecture of the Geared Turbofan engine remains sound and with
nearly 10,000 hours of ground and flight testing, it's the most mature of the new-generation of advanced commercial
engines entering the market. With significant testing behind us, we look forward to bringing the GTF engine family
into service in 2015.
Also in the quarter, on the Aerospace Systems segment, we were selected to provide wheels and carbon brakes for both
Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320neo platform. They also secured new long-term MRO contracts from several

airlines and they celebrated the delivery of the 10,000th Boeing 737 nacelle.
At Sikorsky, they were selected on two key U.S. DoD programs in the quarter. It was awarded the engineering and
manufacturing development contracts to build the next-generation Marine One Presidential helicopter and to develop
new combat search and rescue helicopters for the U.S. Air Force. Combined, these two programs represent over $12
billion of future sales opportunity.
On the commercial side, the Civil Aviation Administration of China recently issued a type certificate for the S-76D,
which allows Sikorsky to begin delivering the helicopter to customers in China. We're also pleased that Sikorsky and
the Canadian Government conclude contract amendments in the second quarter, which define a final configuration for
the CMH aircraft and a phased delivery schedule, allowing for the retirement of Canadian Sea King helicopters
beginning next year.
We recorded sales of $830 million and a charge of $438 million in the third quarter reflecting the cumulative effect of
progress to-date towards completion of the modified program. This puts the CMHP OE losses largely behind us. Under
percentage of completion accounting, we will have some small charges as we progress on the program but they're
manageable within the Sikorsky numbers going forward.
The Building & Industrial Systems business had a solid second quarter with a combined 7% profit growth. Integration
activities continued to progress well with Otis and CCS teams finding a way to serve our customers more efficiently. A
recent example of this was in Hong Kong where UTC Building & Industrial Systems was selected to provide building
systems for the iSQUARE Shopping and Entertainment Complex. This project will include intelligent building
management systems, chiller plant optimization, and remote monitoring. iSQUARE is also equipped with Otis
escalators.
So each of the businesses is well-positioned in our core markets and we're delivering real value to our customers and
securing key orders that will drive top line growth well into the future.
All right, taking a look at the rest of the year, not much really changed from the last time we spoke. As you know, the
compares get tougher as we move through the year. But first half order rates and end market trends continue to be
broadly in line with our expectations. And we're confident in the revised guidance range of $6.75 to $6.85 with a path
towards the higher end on sales of about $65 billion, up from our prior expectation of about $64 billion, primarily on
the Q2 CMHP sales adjustment.
And we now expect quarterly earnings per share growth of about 7% to 10% in the last two quarters of the year, absent
the impact of gains and restructuring. On restructuring, we're investing about $375 million for the year and we spent
$180 million in the first half. So you can expect to see about $100 million of restructuring spent in each of the next two
quarters.
As we committed, we expect the restructuring and one-time charges including the second quarter CMHP charge will be
offset by gains during the course of the year. We also continue to anticipate debt pay down of about $1 billion this year
and we now expect share repurchase of $1.25 billion for the year. That's an increase of $250 million from our prior
expectations. On the M&A side, we expect spend will now be a little bit less than $1 billion. As you know, at UTC, we
typically deliver free cash flow greater than or equal to net income. Through the first half, free cash flow is 81% of net
income. And cash flow is generally stronger in the second half. But as I sit here today, I think 90% to 100% for 2014 is
more realistic based on the continued investments we're making on the aerospace side to deal with the aerospace cycle.
Looking forward, we remain focused on growth and execution in 2014. We're well-positioned in our segments and
we'll continue to capitalize on our industry-leading franchises and global scale. The UTC portfolio is poised to take
advantage of the commercial aerospace growth and urbanization megatrends over the next decade.
So, with that, let's open up the call for questions. Kevin?

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Greg, I was wondering if you could address a little bit cash flow in the next year at least at a
high level. Obviously, the working capital burden may remain heavy, but do you still feel that you're at kind of a peak
level for CapEx and how might those items trend in the next year?
A – [004F0K-E Greg Hayes]>: Yeah. I think, as we said before, Jeff, I think CapEx definitely peaked this year. It's just
shy of $2 billion, that's up from about $1.7 billion from last year. And then next year we'll see that come down $200
million, $300 million as the ramp, or the facilitization of the ramp is pretty much complete by next year. Again, we're
going to start delivering on these engines at the end of next year, and we have to be ready, so the money's going out
now, it's part of the working capital build as well. And we're going to continue to target 100% of free cash flow to net
income both this year and next year. I think we're just acknowledging now that it's going to be really difficult to do this
year just given the big CapEx ramp and the working capital ramp associated with the GTF launch.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on U.S. commercial HVAC trends
both around the applied and unitary market?
<A - Jay Malave>: Jeff, just for – in total commercial HVAC orders, we're up low-single-digit. The applied was
actually up higher, mid- to high-single-digit and the light commercial was up a little bit low-single digits.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Those are order numbers or...?
<A - Jay Malave>: Those are orders.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And do you have sales?
<A - Jay Malave>: Sales, I do not have sales in front of me. I'll have to get back to you on that, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: All right. Thanks. I'll pass the floor.

Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: On the UTAS spares side, obviously some pretty good numbers and I know it's provisioning.
But, does that give you more confidence in your profit guidance for the year for UTAS? Or how is that all flowing
through?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I mean there's a lot of elements to the profit growth at the Aerospace Systems group in the
back half of the year. There's a big chunk of synergies coming through. And obviously the aftermarket is supportive of
the guidance. Clearly, it's a big number for UTAS and the back half is going to be big. But generally, I think what
we've guided to about high-single-digits, I think, Jay, for Aerospace Systems after market growth?
<A - Jay Malave>: Yes.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It's obviously a little bit better than that, though. So I think it all just goes to the back half of
the year and everything should be pretty much in line.

<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. And then over at CCS, you brought the mid-single-digit down to low-single-digits for
expected organic growth. Can you give some color on, not in the quarter, but just in terms of the guidance for the year,
where – which end markets that's lower in?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. So first half of the year, organic growth at CCS was about 1%. Back half of the year,
we're expecting about 4%. So we've got a little bit of a hill here in the back half of the year. And again, still confident
we're going to hit that guidance number out there, $225 million to $250 million even around the lower sales
expectations. I think generally things are in line with what we expect. I mean resi was a little soft in the second quarter,
but that's really just relates to the big pre-buy we saw in Q1, so I think it's about up 9% year-to-date, we expect it to be
up at a high-single-digits, in that range in the back half of the year as well. Order rates on the commercial businesses, or
commercial HVAC, has improved. Orders rates at Transicold have pretty much stabilized. So again, I think all the
pieces are in place to get to that 4% growth. And, obviously, there's cost reduction initiatives and other things that give
us confidence to hit that number. But, generally speaking, I think Geraud and the team will pretty well on track to
deliver that back half growth.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. If I look at the Pratt EBIT guidance for the year, I think it implies growth of
about $120 million in the second half. You did about plus $70 million in the first half. And I guess if you look at what's
gone on in Q2, you've had weaker commercial spares orders. And also you mentioned maybe there might be some extra
E&D needed for engine fixes. So I guess, what gives you the confidence that you'll see a bit step-up in year-on-year
EBIT growth in Pratt in the second half?
<A - Jay Malave>: Julian, what we have – for the year for Pratt, a substantial part of their profit growth is restructuring
savings, which is pretty much baked, a lot of that was taken last year as well as pension benefit, again, that's pretty
much going to be reflected in their results. Aftermarket, as Greg said, is up 10% year-to-date that will moderate a little
bit in the back half. The other piece of it is it will actually get a little bit better performance out of the military business,
a little bit wider on shipments on the military engines, particularly in the JSF. We'll see that ramp-up in the second half
of the year and we'll also get a little bit of lift out of Pratt & Whitney Canada, who's off to a reasonable start
year-to-date. So those two businesses will help offset some moderation I'd say in the large commercial aftermarket.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, and I'd also just point out, we're in the process of definitizing lot or LRIP 7 with the
JSF, so there were a number of engines that could have, or should have gone out the door here in the second quarter.
There are more than 12 of them that will go out here in the third quarter, so you're going to see a bump in military OE
coming into the third quarter which is going to help as well.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then just my follow up is that in BIS, your China sales in the first half are
up about 12%, I think in total. What do you expect for that second half revenue growth number to be?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think on the Otis, what we've guided to is mid-teens, about 15%, which is exactly what we
saw here in the second quarter. The CCS a little bit lighter than that, just a little less than 10% in the back half and
again, order rates, as we look at the GST business and the other businesses, the commercial HVAC all supportive of
that back half.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: On Otis, what was it that lowered your guidance outlook for profit for the year? Has the
outlook changed at all in terms of pricing or demand?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, I think it was a small tweak. I think we took down the top end by about $25 million.
We've grown earnings just under $30 million in the first half of the year. We saw a nice return to profitability growth in
the second quarter. But it's just the realization that we're probably not going to get to the top end of the range. Continue
to make investments in new products, I think we saw that when we were in China a couple of weeks ago,
[indiscernible] (27:25) that factory transformation is pretty much complete, you're going to get some tailwind from that.
It's probably not going to get to the top end – again, Europe pricing is a little choppy and it's just a realization that's
more likely towards the middle of that range.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. And then on UTAS, when you look at how the 787 program is going, can you
comment on progress there, and as you look forward, presumably the program will become bigger contributor to UTAS
margins. How should we think about this trajectory for the 787 in terms of profitability?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, clearly, 787, we're still in a negative margin situation across all of 787. I think we
talked last year, we mentioned we were down – we're losing about $3 million a ship set, that number is coming down
significantly. Within I think in 2015, 2016, we'll be close to a break-even point on 787, so coming down the learning
curve as we expected, still a lot of work to do. Reliability is improving on the aircraft systems that are out there. We're
close to our contractual goals that we've got with The Boeing Company, continue to work with Boeing on product
improvement opportunities. So program is going well and there are really no surprises there.
<A - Jay Malave>: And also Doug, we've got the Dash-9 coming on line here too. And don't forget, part of the growth
and provisioning this year – this quarter was on the back of the 787, so you see nice profitability and provisioning
which helps offset at least a portion of the negative margin associated with the OE.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And is the Dash-9 leading to some significant change activity for you in this that sort of
pushes the trajectory back a little?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No. There's – a few of the systems are different on the Dash-9. The environmental control,
so ECS system was upgraded but most of the other systems are the same so it's actually helping in terms of the learning
curve on the product.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay, great. Thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Doug.

Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes, good morning, Greg.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Peter.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: First a clarification on the GTF engine fix, I assume that's applying out to all the models. Is
that going to affect any of the certification timeline?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, in fact, really this particular fix we think is just related to the CSeries engine itself. Each
of the architecture is a little bit different and we have not seen a similar issue on any of the other models that are out
there.

<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. And then just a quick one on just Pratt & Whitney Canada: are you seeing any ready
change regarding the lower end of the business jet market? Just I think that's 40% of your mix up there.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. No. I guess the best word to describe it is it is still a little choppy. I mean deliveries
are picking up a little bit, but there's still a lot of used inventory out there. Orders are really not picked up. I think the
best news there is flying hours have picked up a little bit and, as you know, most of that business is on powered by the
hour. So, we're still seeing a decent cash inflow but really not seeing a big step change in terms of the growth in the
market.

Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Greg, I was wondering if you could kick off on China on the orders trends you've seen there.
Have you seen any shift in market share on your various products?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Nothing dramatic, I would say. I think again Otis has regained its – or is regaining, I guess, I
should say, the share that we had lost in previous years which is really a trend that started last year. It's continuing into
this year, getting a little bit more traction on the commercial HVAC side and GST continues to gain a little bit of a
share. But again, generally everything is improving as about as we had expected in China there.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: And then secondly, on the Aerospace Systems aftermarket, did you actually say what the
aftermarket revenue growth was in the quarter? And it would be helpful if you could split out how much was
provisioning.
<A - Jay Malave>: Total aftermarket revenue growth was up around 10% in the quarter. It was led by again, spares
were up low-teens – spare sales were up low-teens in the quarter.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: And the amount that was Provisioning?
<A - Jay Malave>: Provisioning sales, let's see. Those – I have orders Rob, but I'll have to get back to you on the sales
element of provisioning versus parts.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. But I imagine this could be lumpy, this provisioning.
<A - Jay Malave>: Yes.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Provisioning is very lumpy. So that 28% growth that we saw here in Q2, don't look for that
to repeat, but again it's primarily 787 related which is good news; a lot of airlines out there are taking new aircraft,
which leads to all of this provisioning. The trend will continue, but just not at that 28% rate.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: All right. Thanks so much.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Rob.

Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So, you had a flat compare in orders in Otis China against a very stiff compare, but if you
look at the monthly data on residential housing prices, it looks like it's rolling over. What's your expectation for orders
in the third and fourth quarter and for growth in China Otis next year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I wish I had a crystal ball, Cai, to answer that question. Generally, I mean, I think the thing
to think about in the back half of the year is backlog which is up about 20%. So we're expecting about 15% sales
growth. So, we've got, I would say, the backlog to carry us through the – at least through this year and even into next
year. Orders have continued to be good. Last year, orders in the second quarter were up 39%, obviously on the back of
that one large order, but you take out the Tianjin 117 order last year, orders were up about 14% or 15% this year on an
apples-to-apples basis. So, the trends have remained positive in the business.
Back half of the year, is it going to slow? Probably, I think again, is it going to be somewhere between 5% and 10%?
Perhaps. We've seen the Chinese economy is cooling a little bit, they still expect growth of 7.5%. Residential prices, we
know, have been moderating and even coming down in some markets and that's a big piece of our business. But,
infrastructure has more than taken up the slack where we're seeing the drop on the residential side.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Terrific. And then kind of getting back to spares, Boeing is saying they're going to have
about 16 to 18 new customers, introductions this year and the same next year. And next year we also have the A350
coming online. So maybe give us some color on the expectation for continuing vigor and provision, I mean maybe not
at 28% this year and next year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Look, I think that's all baked into what we consider to be the guidance for this year, which
was high-single-digits, 9% kind of growth in the Aerospace Systems aftermarket. Clearly, the introduction of the 787 to
all of these new customers is what's driving the provisioning growth this quarter and will continue to drive it into next
quarter. So I mean it's great that this plane is going to so many different customers. It really does support a lot more
provisioning, although not everybody gets provisioning. Some people go on our total care package where we're actually
providing the spares for them. But again, I think, the trends that we're seeing this year, there's nothing out there that
would tell me those trends should not continue into next year. But, I guess, it's a little early to start talking about 2015
guidance.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Cai.

Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: ...much. Greg, you've had a lot of restructuring items. I appreciate some of the walk. But
could you talk a little bit about tax rates for the second half of the year? I mean we know a 16% rate in this quarter's not
sustainable. And then I'll have a follow up.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I would ignore the ETR, the effective tax rate, in this quarter because, again, all these
one-time tax-related items that we had, the settlement of the 2009 and 2010 tax years, a couple of other minor tax
adjustments, the rate wanted to be about 31% in the first quarter on an operating basis. Back half of the year, we're
expecting about 29%. So again, get a little bit of better news in taxes coming up, but not a lot. The wild card out there,
of course, is extenders, which we still don't have in the guidance and whether that happens this year or not, I think
nobody knows. But obviously, it still gives us upside if it does.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: But to follow up, that 29% does not include some of the benefits that you've outlined, that
you're likely to recoup or record as gains during the balance of the year, right?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, there's about $0.25 of additional gains we're going to see in the back half of the year
on top of the $0.28 that we picked up in Q2 on the tax rate. So when I'm talking about that 29% rate, that is operational,
that's not, I would say, the reported rate. We'll pull all those gains out of the math for you so that we can try and keep it
clean in terms of an operating result.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: So those gains also include, like, the Watsco benefit that'll show up in the third quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: The Watsco benefit – you're talking about the option exercise?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Yes, sir.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. It's small. I mean it's not very big at all.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then the last thing is just to go to Pratt. I mean, we've had these collaboration and
tangible benefits for some time that have helped the numbers, how do you sort of see that playing out and doesn't that
sort of help the reported results at Pratt over the intermediate term before you transition to the GTF?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So you're talking about the collaboration benefits associated with the IAE transaction, Cai –
or I'm sorry, Howard?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Usually I get confused with George.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Sorry, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: That's all right. Thanks, Greg. Yes, I am. I mean some of them I know are installment
payments and effect to Rolls, but the balance reflects, I think, pricing of engines. Could you – doesn't that sort of help
the Pratt numbers
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, in fact, you really need to go back to the original IAE transaction where as part of the
consideration for Rolls transferring its share of IAE to Pratt, we agreed to give them higher pricing on the OE side. So
that was really part of the purchase consideration. So the losses on the engines actually go up as a result of that. But
under the purchase accounting rules, that becomes an intangible as we ship those engines. Those losses go into
intangible asset, really part of the purchase price. And also it starts to shrink dramatically because those are only
engines that were in backlog as of the day that we closed on the IAE transaction. All the new orders for these that we've
had don't reflect any of that benefit, although they do reflect the higher price we pay to Rolls-Royce on the new – on
their share of the engine. So, it's out there. It was all contemplated, or at least the collaboration piece all contemplated
as part of the overall consideration just like the flight hour payments.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Ron.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Good morning. Just two quick ones for you. Your prior guidance, I believe, didn't – had $0.05
in it for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter. Now that that's out of the guidance, how come you guys didn't take up the
higher end of your range by $0.05 or so which was the – had the previous guidance for the Canadian Maritime in it?
Make sense?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, your precision exceeds our accuracy, though. The fact is, you're right. We did have
$120 million baked in for the CMH, the back half of the year, there will still be about $50 million of CMH-related cost
in addition to the charge. So normally, we could have picked up a little bit. We did take Sikorsky's guidance up about
$25 million. But they've had some much slower military after-market sales than what they have expected, they have
some EACs that have gone against them in the first half of the year. So, they've consumed about $50 million of the

good news associated with what should have been guidance on the CMHP. So really we've only increased by $25
million which is a couple of pennies and we just didn't feel like we were going to take up the top end of the range for
$0.02.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay. Okay, great. And then switching over to Climate, Controls & Security, in the quarter,
the margins were really good, right, 19% before the one-time stuff. How should we think about that through the
remainder of the year? That's a pretty darn good trend, right?
<A - Jay Malave>: Yes, it's a great trend, Ron, but don't forget that second quarter's typically the heaviest, particularly
on the U.S. residential side. So you'll always see a stronger margin percentage in the second quarter and even third
quarter. That will come down sequentially. There'll still be margin expansion over the last year but you're talking
probably on average in the range of say 17% in the back half of the year.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay. And then I guess, I mean was there any one-time positive things, in there? Or big sales
or something that...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No. It was a very, very clean quarter. Nothing that – no one-timers or anything like that.
Everything got pulled out that would have been a one-timer. So, very clean quarter, again, good performance on the
cost side, good traction really around the whole business from a cost standpoint.

Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: How are you doing?
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Greg, I wondered if you might be able to just actually provide more detail on what the CSeries
engine fix and resolution is? And how the implementation of that is going to play out? Because the, what we can see in
the press has been fairly high level and it sounds simple, but I guess the aircraft has now been grounded almost two
months. So any more detail there would be really helpful.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. I didn't get my engineering degree, unfortunately, so I'm not going to be able to give
you probably the technical answer that you're looking for. We do know, I mean we identified root cause of the engine
oil seal leak early on in the investigation. We have a fix in place. We're continuing to work with the customer,
Bombardier, to work with the Canadian airworthiness authorities to get the plane flying again. We expect it will be in a
couple of weeks.
Again, this is not a big, big deal in terms of the architecture. This happened back in the turbine section. It had nothing
to do with the gear up front. And really a relatively minor fix. Unfortunate that it happened when it did, in the testing
program. But again, not a big fix in terms of engineering development costs.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay. But seeming like another couple of weeks before the aircrafts are back in the air it
sounds like?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. I can't give you anything better than that. I think that's what we heard earlier this week.
And I know the folks at Pratt and Bombardier are working as hard as they can to get that thing flying again.

versus parts break out? Can you actually just provide those numbers?

Our next question comes from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Hey, everyone.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Yes, I might have missed this before, Otis China orders. What was the attachment rate and
maybe some broader context of where you expect to see that trend over the next year or so with the new regulations?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, I think the conversion rates or the attachment rates as you're referring to I think are
pretty consistent with what we've seen where we're getting somewhere around 60% or so on the Otis China brand and a
much lower conversion rate on the XOEC, and the Sigma brands again. You recall we sell direct at the Otis China
Limited and we're selling through distribution. So attachment rates in total are still around 25% across the portfolio,
nudging upwards a little bit as we're trying to again make a big push towards the aftermarket.
I think aftermarket service grew 20% last year, and we expect it to grow another 20% this year. We added 50 branches
last year and we're in the process of adding another 50 branches this year. So we're putting the infrastructure in place to
support the continued growth in the service. And the real key will be for us to work with our distributors through the
distribution model to make sure that we can capture more of the aftermarket or conversion from the XOEC brand.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Great. And then on capital allocation, just the update that you've given us this morning,
boosting buybacks and maybe cutting back on that placeholder on M&A. Just put this in context for us. And also, how
are you funding the buybacks? Most of your cash is offshore, so what's the expectation in terms of funding those?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. Well again, we're working to get some of that cash back as tax efficiently as we can. As
I sit here today, I think we spent less than $90 million on M&A through the first half of the year, and it's just a
realization as we're sitting in July, we've got a couple of smaller deals in the pipeline, but you're talking less than $250
million or $300 million each, so hard to imagine we're going to get towards that billion dollar placeholder. So we just
take it down directionally and we'll give you more guidance at the end of September.
And again, we're taking up the share buyback and looking at the price over the last month or so, we've obviously been
trading down. It's a very attractive investment in terms of our M&A dollars, so we're going to put more there, and then
we are going to be patient on the M&A side.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a couple of quick ones. Greg, you said the CMH, the charges going forward would be
manageable, but I think last quarter you said the charge you were going to take was going to be about 70% to 75% of
the total loss which would imply, if that didn't change, kind of $125 million or so to go. Is that still the right order of
magnitude and how should we think about the phasing of that over the next two years?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, so just to be clear, when we took the charge for the $438 million, that included all the
losses going forward out of the program and it included an extension of the initial in-service aftermarket training and
support which actually drove the loss higher because instead of putting these aircraft in service in 2015 and 2016, it's
going to take it out through 2021 before we're done, so that drove about another $100 million of losses that we're going
to recognize as part of this whole charge.
If you think about it, back half of the year, we'll probably see, as I said, $50 million, about $25 million a quarter. Next
year, the total number grows – it's around $20 million a quarter, not quite. And then really, after that, it becomes noise
because the aftermarket starts – they start accumulating hours on the aftermarket which more than offsets any of the
losses that we are going to have as we complete.
So we're about 70% done. We've incurred about $700 million of losses on that program. So you can nominally think
there's about $300 million to go between now and 2021, but the real headwind is third quarter and fourth quarter this
year and then next year and then it's really behind us.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. Great. That's great color. Thanks. And then, just as a quick follow-up, Jay, you
mentioned in your remarks the difference in unit order growth versus dollar bookings at China Otis. Could you give us
those numbers?
<A - Jay Malave>: Yes, the unit bookings were up, I think Greg mentioned in his remarks are up 12%.

tougher, yet you're forecasting organic growth for the most part, in line with what we saw in the first half, can you just
talk about kind of at a high level what's going to drive that?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, there's a couple of things. I mentioned before we saw – we didn't get a bunch of the JSF
engines out the door at Pratt. That contract should be done here in another month or so, so that's going to help the
military side at Pratt. Continue to see a ramp on the Aerospace Systems side; aftermarket is going to continue to grow. I

think again, as I look at the backlog today, it really supports the back half sales forecast, orders down 6% at Pratt in the
aftermarket, but total aftermarket was still up 10%. We're seeing heavy overhauls going through the shops.
It looks like it should be pretty achievable to get to that 4% growth, I think. Clearly, Otis has the backlog, not just in
China but around the world, you see new equipment orders continue to grow. CCS has good backlog in its businesses
and really no – and again, could bad things happen? Absolutely, but really as we sit here today, I feel pretty good about
the overall economic growth in our markets.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And on GTF, you mentioned some of the wins at Farnborough, but looking out versus
your competitor it looked like your competitor actually announced more orders. It looks like market share has kind of
shifted a couple of points in favor of the LEAP. So could you just talk about how you think GTF's doing overall in the
market and what kind of pricing you're seeing on GTF relative to what you're realizing on V2500? Thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. I think again, it was a big air show. I think GE announced a lot of orders in conjunction
with GECAS. We've got right now about 6,200 engines. I think on order we said 6,000 engines, right now, I think it's
about 6,200 engines. And we've got just about 50% market share. It's lumpy. These campaigns happen sporadically
where it'll be 100 engines or 200 engines that get awarded at a time. GE's been successful in the last couple of weeks.
At the end of the day, I think the market will decide which technology is best and we still think the GTF architecture in
terms of what it does from a fuel efficiency, from a noise, from an emission standpoint is going to outperform the
LEAP in the marketplace. And that will ultimately be the determinant of what the market share is.
In terms of pricing, pricing is tough, but it's always tough in this entry into a service phase. So I would say there's not
much difference that we have seen in terms of market pricing dynamics. But it's a tough market out there.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Just a couple of clean-ups. The order rates at Pratt in particular, can you just help us
with the split between the V's and maybe the 2000, 4000; 4000 in particular?
<A - Jay Malave>: Yes, again, the order rates, the V's were up high teens, the 2,000s were down substantially, 70%
plus, again on that tough compare. The 4,000s were down around 10% in that range. And again, a little bit of just
timing of shop visits there. We actually saw, some of the older models we're seeing nice content per visit and we
actually saw nice growth on the older models. So, it was actually some of the newer models that showed a little bit of
more weakness, and that again, is more of a function of just timing.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: As you look out to 2015, can you give a rough proportional mix, is it still about
50%/50% between V's and other or is it going to be 60%/40%, about that point?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes, the V's are essentially growing at 10% to 15% and I would say the older engines will be
flattish going forward so you're going to see that mix shift continue to probably 55% and going towards 60%.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Okay. And then the other clean-up, Jay, the contract benefit size on UTAS, can you
size that?
<A - Jay Malave>: Yes. It's about $0.03
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.
<A - Jay Malave>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Myles.

Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: The Aero margin looked weak to me, particularly with what you size as the gain. You were
down sequentially from the first quarter and revenues were up a couple of hundred million. So can you just tell me
what was going on there?
<A - Jay Malave>: George, it was basically the E&D, they were up in E&D and this is the highest quarter for E&D
and you can see Aerospace Systems and we expect that to come back down in the back half of the year.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: They accounted for all of the increase in E&D in the quarter.
<A - Jay Malave>: Right.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And then how much was the gain at Aero in the quarter?
<A - Jay Malave>: That was...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Are you talking about the contract settlement?
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes.
<A - Jay Malave>: Yes.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: That was $0.03.
<A - Jay Malave>: $0.03.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. I meant to ask that at Pratt you had also mentioned there was some gain. How big
was that one?
<A - Jay Malave>: Less than $20 million.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Okay, thanks very much.
<A - Jay Malave>: Thank you.
