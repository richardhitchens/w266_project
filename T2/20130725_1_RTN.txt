William H. Swanson
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. The company continued to perform well in the second quarter. Sales,
margins, EPS and cash flow were all ahead of expectation on strong international sales growth. Our solid execution on
productivity initiatives is helping to drive both our financial performance and our ability to provide affordable solutions
for our customers.
Combining these initiatives with our technology investments and innovation yields a powerful strategy that continues
to show positive results. We remain confident in our overall outlook and have raised our EPS guidance for the year.
Let me take a minute to update you regarding the progress of our business consolidation efforts. We've successfully
consolidated from six businesses to four. Our investments in common systems have enabled us to move swiftly through
the consolidation process. We are ahead of plan and are already seeing tangible results.
With the new structure in place, the team has been identifying additional opportunities to drive cost savings by
streamlining product lines and reducing footprint and fixed costs. Further, we see potential for additional product
synergies across the company. We're pleased with the progress we've made, and as always we're challenging our teams
to do more.
In the U.S. the debate surrounding near and long-term resource allocation to national security is ongoing. Congress and
the administration continue to work toward a compromise on the fiscal 2014 budget and are not there yet. Current
versions of the budget don't include sequestration and barring some type of grand bargain, the defense budget
ultimately will need to be reconciled with the cap spelled out in the Budget Control Act of 2011, which is about $50
billion lower than the currently proposed levels. The outcome remains unclear but as we've said all along, we remain
focused on executing our strategy and managing the business in order to deliver the best value for our customers and
shareholders, whatever the environment.
International continues to be a key driver of the business. In the second quarter International grew by 10% compared to
last year's second quarter and was 27% of total sales. International also represents 26% of bookings in the quarter.
Last month, as we've done many times in the past, we attended one of the largest aerospace industry events in the
world, Paris Air Show. We met with a number of international customers; in fact, Raytheon hosted over 1,400 guests
and the largest number of delegations ever, reflecting a 16% increase compared to the last time we were there in 2011.
This demonstrates the significant global interest we continue to see for our technology and our innovative solutions.
The timing of International awards is always difficult to peg with certainty. In the quarter we made notable progress.
Oman ordered AMRAAM missiles for their ground-based air defense system and we're now in the final negotiations
for the remaining part of the program. We continue to make progress on both Qatar and Kuwait Patriot as well as –
both of which are expected in the second half of the year.
We were thrilled to be selected for the F-16 RACR program by South Korea early in the second quarter. These are
always tough competitions, and we're awaiting word on the next one, Taiwan's F-16 radar upgrade, led by the U.S. Air
Force. A decision is expected soon.
As some of you know, we were expecting Next Generation Jammer program to be awarded in the second quarter.
Instead it occurred right after the close. This was a key competitive win for the company and it solidifies Raytheon's
position as a premier electronic warfare provider. The Next Generation Jammer is a critical component of our
enterprise-wide EW strategy which was launched back in 2011. This strategy aligns us with our customers evolving
requirements to address the increasingly sophisticated anti-access, anti-area denial threats that are emerging globally.
A significant factor behind our innovative approach to Next Generation Jammer competition was our ability to leverage
the investments we've made in gallium nitride or GaN technology. We've been investing in GaN for the past decade
and our in-house technology development in this area is a huge competitive discriminator, allowing us to increase the
power and improve the efficiency of our offering. And importantly, this positions us well for future competitions.

While offering innovative solutions can be a competitive advantage, making them affordable is equally as important.
The benefits we derive from our supply chain, global business services and recent business consolidation initiatives, for
example, allow us to offer improved affordability for our customers without compromising our financial performance.
This is critical in today's economic environment where customers have limited resources available to achieve their
missions.
Given this, Raytheon's ability to execute is key and our continued solid operating performance is a testament to the
dedication of the Raytheon team. I want to thank them for all that they do, for continually rising to the challenges and
for remaining focused on our mission, which is customer success. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
David C. Wajsgras
Okay. Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. I have a few opening remarks starting with the second quarter highlights
and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks I will be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this
morning.
So if everyone could please move to Page 3, we performed well in the second quarter. Our adjusted EPS of $1.64 was
up 4%, driven by continued operational improvement and capital deployment actions. Adjusted operating margin was
13.7%, up 10 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. On a year-to-date basis adjusted operating margin
was 13.5%, up 20 basis points.
Sales of $6.1 billion were up 2% compared with last year's second quarter. We exceeded the high end of our prior
guidance and I'll discuss the reasons in just a minute.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $200 million better than last year, primarily due to
the timing of our required pension contributions. We are increasing our full-year EPS guidance, which I'll address
further in just a few minutes as well, along with other updates to our 2013 outlook.
During the quarter the company repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for $225 million, bringing the
year-to-date share repurchase to 7.6 million shares for $450 million. In the quarter we consolidated from six businesses
to four and are now reporting in the new structure. In the attachments that accompany the press release we've recast our
historical results going back to 2011 to reflect the consolidation.
Just as a reminder, we combined two of our formers businesses, IIS and RTSC, to form the new Intelligence
Information and Services business. We also moved the previous NCS product lines to the remaining Raytheon
businesses. Additionally, we realigned some of our smaller product lines across Raytheon to enhance complementary
product areas. These moves allow us to further streamline operations, leverage customer synergies and reduce our
overhead costs.
Turning now to Page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Our total company
bookings for the quarter were $5.3 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $8.9 billion. Second quarter bookings were
impacted by the timing of a few potential awards including Next Gen Jammer, Kuwait Patriot and Aegis Multi-year.
Looking back at our trailing four quarters, our book-to-bill is about one, driven by our strong bookings in the back half
of 2012.
As I mentioned on the last two calls, we continue to see the order book back-end loaded for 2013. We are making
progress on a number of opportunities, for example as we just discussed, we were awarded Next Gen Jammer after the
close of the quarter and we're in final negotiations on an air defense system for the country of Oman. We expect the
book-to-bill ratio to expand in the second half and our bookings outlook remains unchanged for the year.
For the quarter, International was 26% of our total company bookings. For the year we now expect International to be
in the range of 30% to 32% of total company bookings.
Notable awards in the quarter included $543 million at Missile Systems for AMRAAM for the U.S. Air Force, U.S.
Navy and International customers. MS also booked $228 million for SM-3 and $224 million on EKV, both for the

Missile Defense Agency as well as $132 million on Paveway for International customers and $98 million for the JSOW
for the U.S. Navy and International customers.
IIS booked $582 million for domestic training and $117 million for foreign training in support of the Warfighter
FOCUS Program. Integrated Defense Systems booked $93 million for in-service support for the Royal Australian Navy
and $85 million on the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System Program for the FAA. And Space and
Airborne Systems booked $78 million for the production of Electronic Warfare Systems for an International customer.
In addition, IIS and SAS booked $252 million and $351 million respectively on a number of classified programs.
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $32.4 billion. It's worth noting that approximately 37% of our backlog is
from International programs.
If you'd now move to Page 5, we're pleased with our sales performance in the quarter which was ahead of our
expectation and importantly, driven by strong International performance. Our International business increased by
approximately 10% in the quarter. This was partially offset by our Domestic business which declined about 1%. For the
second quarter our International sales were approximately 27% of total sales.
Looking at the businesses, all were at or above our expectations. IDS had second quarter 2013 net sales of $1.7 billion,
up 9% from the comparable period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on various International air
and missile defense programs. IIS net sales of about $1.6 billion were essentially in line with the same period last year.
Missile Systems had second quarter 2013 net sales of $1.7 billion, an increase of 7% on a year-over-year basis. The
increase was primarily due to higher sales on SM-3 and an International Paveway program. And SAS had net sales of
$1.6 billion, down from the comparable period last year, primarily due to the timing of classified programs.
Now moving ahead to Page 6, we're pleased by the improvement in our overall company margins driven by program
performance at IDS. Our adjusted margin was 13.7%, an increase of 10 basis points. And on a year-to-date basis our
margin was 13.5%, up 20 basis points over the comparable period in 2012. The strength in our underlying margin in the
quarter was due to our continued focus on execution.
As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the progress that we've made with our consolidation initiative. We've
completed the initial phases of the business consolidation and have realigned our key product lines. We believe these
efforts will drive improved affordability for our customers and improve our competitiveness. It bears noting that our
consolidation efforts are only one element of our overall focus on productivity. Other key aspects include strategic
sourcing, where we're optimizing our supply chain, as well as our facility utilization efforts. We are consolidating
facilities to improve utilization and further reduce our fixed cost base.
So looking at the business margins, all were in line or better than our expectations. IDS' margin was [audio
gap](15:10-15:13) quarter compared with the same period last year, solid operational performance and favorable mix
drove the improvement. Margins for IIS and Missiles were essentially in line with our expectations and SAS was
slightly ahead. Overall the company continues to perform well.
So if you'd now move to Page 7. Second quarter 2013 adjusted EPS was $1.64, up 4%. The increase was driven by
operational improvement and capital deployment actions, more specifically share repurchases. And on a year-to-date
basis adjusted EPS was $3.20, up 5% from the same period last year.
On Page 8 I would like to briefly comment on our updated outlook for 2013. Based on our performance year-to-date,
we have narrowed our sales guidance range, raising the low end by $300 million. We now expect our full-year 2013 net
sales to be in the range of between $23.5 billion and $23.7 billion with a bias toward the high end. The second half of
the year assumes impacts from both sequestration and now a continuing resolution in the fourth quarter.
You'll note that we raised our full-year 2013 EPS guidance by $0.25 on the low end and by $0.20 on the high end. We
now expect to be between $5.51 and $5.61 and on an adjusted basis, for adjusted EPS, to be between $6.00 and $6.10.
The increase is essentially driven by performance and also includes about $0.05 from the expected benefits of our
business consolidation. Additionally we are projecting a slightly improved tax rate and a reduced share count.

During the quarter we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for $225 million and on a year-to-date basis
have purchased 7.6 million shares for $450 million. Our strong cash generation does give us some flexibility with
respect to near-term capital deployment actions. Overall we've improved our outlook compared to the initial plan for
2013 that we first spoke to in January, and this is reflected in our updated share count guidance. In dollar terms we now
expect share repurchases in the back half of the year to be modestly higher than in the first half of the year. And
although not on the page, it's worth noting that we still see our bookings outlook for the year in the range of $23.5
billion plus or minus $500 million. This outlook is unchanged from our prior estimates.
Now if you turn to Page 9, we've raised the low end of our sales guidance range for each of our businesses. The
increase in margin guidance reflects our strong overall program execution and productivity initiatives including the
business consolidation.
On Page 10 we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, earnings
per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations for the balance of 2013.
Now before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize. We saw solid operating performance in the second quarter and
exceeded the sales, EPS, margin and operating cash flow guidance we provided back in April despite the challenging
environment. As we look to the balance of the year, the pipeline of International and Domestic opportunities is strong.
We continue to move forward with our productivity initiatives and are very pleased with our progress to date. These
efforts bode well for our customers and our shareholders and we're confident in our outlook for the year.
So with that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. You may
proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning, guys and good quarter.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thank you.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a few quick ones; first, Dave, on the IDS margin performance. You called out in your
prepared remarks both favorable mix and strong performance. I wondered if you might parse that out a bit for us if you
can to kind of separate the impact of mix versus what may have been some favorable EAC adjustments?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. So the performance is reflected in our EAC adjustments. I appreciate the way you
articulated the question. And that's up, for IDS it's up about $24 million in the quarter. And as you just noted, that
business is also impacted by a change in mix driven by the strong International sales in the quarter. The weighting of
the improvement I would say is more towards the performance side than the mix side.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. Great. And one for Bill, just wondered if you'd expand a little bit more on Next Gen
Jammer? I mean obviously it seems like all we ever talk about these days is capital deployment and bookings, but
obviously it's a big competitive win for you guys and you hinted at how this would enhance your EW offering in future
competitions. I wondered if you might expand a little bit on that and how you see this impacting the business over the
long term in kind of general terms? Just interested in any color you can share there.
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, it's a great question. In 2011 we started really putting the focus on EW. I mean
clearly for us we're an electronics house, AESAs and that type of technology is what we really kind of hug around here,
I guess no better way to say it. And our SAS business out in California teaming up with our Missile business and our
IDS business worked very hard on this offering. I can add some color. This Next Generation Jammer replaces the
ALQ-99 and for me it's a little personal. It's the first program I ever worked on in Raytheon, so it'll tell you how long
ALQ-99 has been around.

<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Oh, Bill, it's not that long.
<A - William H. Swanson>: But it's – when you think about it, there aren't many opportunities like this. This program
is a program by executing it right, people will be able to start and finish their careers on it. And from that standpoint it's
a hallmark program. They don't come around that long. The competition was conducted by NAVAIR who's probably
one of the best in the business at evaluating technology and what they're looking for. And clearly for us our GaN
technology allowed us to meet the weight and the power requirements which were extremely difficult on this. And why
it was important I think is where you're coming from, is back in 2011 we saw that things were going to start winding
down in Iraq and in Afghanistan someday, and when that happens our forward presence changes.
And when your forward presence changes, now you have to think about the world differently. How do you get in, do
what you have to do and get out without anyone getting hurt? And Electronic Warfare is the way that you can do that;
you deny your enemy the capabilities that he needs to be able to deny you that access. So for us we saw this and we've
been working on it here for some time and I'm really proud of our SAS business because this was one of the toughest
competitions around. And everybody knew it was probably the last big one for some time, an EW, and it just solidifies
us in that marketplace not only domestically but internationally. And that was what was really key. I hope that color
helps.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Yeah, that's great. Thanks guys.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.
Operator
Your next question will comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. You may proceed.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Bill, I was wondering if you could – I know you mentioned a couple of the International
Missile Defense pursuits in your opening remarks, but if we could just take a step back maybe, if you could
characterize the way you're looking at, on a multi-year basis, where we are in terms of International Missile Defense
demand? Is there a replacement cycle or an upgrade cycle that's going on here? How much of the strength that you're
expecting to see in the second half of the year is really sustainable into 2014 and 2015? Where are we in this whole
cycle?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I think the way I would say is that we're probably in the second or third inning, if I
wanted to relate it to a baseball game. And from that standpoint there's still innings to play. The nice part about
Raytheon's portfolio, whether it be the standard missile family, whether it be our radar family in the sense of I
affectionately call our big radars that we do, dinosaurs. They're one of a kind, they're big and they do hang around for a
long time, but they also reflect the latest technology in the world.
Our TPY-2's are in demand for anyone that wants to be able to detect something. They're the only radars like it in the
world. And the company has the ability now to remote launch, which means if you can detect it someplace, you can
launch from another place and you tie that all together with Command and Control or your Air and Missile Defense
Systems. So for me this is early. We see plenty of opportunities. The Mideast, even parts of Europe, especially Asia,
too, all need this capability. So I feel pretty good about the company's ability to go do that. And we've got a lot more
innings to go play here.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Yeah, that's a lot earlier – I was going to say a lot earlier in the game than I would've thought
you would have said. Is this about existing customers that we've seen the last couple years coming back and buying
more? Is it new technologies they're going to be buying? How would you characterize that?

<A - William H. Swanson>: I'd characterize it from a standpoint that some have the capability and there's a lot that
don't. And some that have the capability, one of the things that if you have the infrastructure in place, you have what
we call P3I Pre Planned Product Improvements and we can help them in discrimination, we can help them tie it in
together into their net. So it's a – there's many facets to missile defense and no one's at the stage of where the United
States is, that's why I probably put it in the early innings because you asked me about International. If you'd asked me
domestically, here we might provide them a radar or two and we've got more standard missiles to deliver, but the rest of
the world needs to catch up to the U.S., if that helps.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay, and then just – it does. Thank you. And then just one quick one for Dave, when you
announced your restructuring in March you noted there would be $85 million of cost saves but it wasn't going to impact
financial guidance. I was wondering, now that we see first half results, if you could give us any sense as to where the
realignment has impacted numbers and what we should be thinking about for the second half of the year in that regard
as well?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. So Tom Kennedy, our recently appointed Executive Vice President and COO, led the
effort on the business consolidation. We have exceeded our scheduled milestone objectives. When I initially looked to
2013 I suggested that from a financial performance perspective the cost of implementation would essentially offset the
financial benefits, the savings. Given what we've been able to accomplish, we're now seeing about a $0.05 impact in a
positive way for the year and that's included in our guidance. There was a couple of cents in 2000 – a couple of cents in
the second quarter and about $0.03 in the back half of the year. Also our overall gross savings from the program, we
had initially set up a target of about $85 million. And we are now well in excess of that number from a forecast
standpoint.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: We're seeing that in segment operating income?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, that's a good question, Joe. You're seeing it across the board in the four segments.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. You may proceed.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I wanted to follow on that, on the organization. So the improvement in margins, Dave,
you referred to that as partially due to improved performance and this is the guidance and partially due to the benefits
of consolidation. But if we consider that you've got one-time implementation costs associated with that for this year,
would we expect that the benefit is actually somewhat more than what we're seeing here and we should see that
probably in the next year? In 2014?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, remember, much of that and at some point all of that goes back to our customers.
And that's just the way this business works, it's the way the industry works. It does make us more competitive as we go
forward. There will be some benefit in 2014, but again there is a wear-away given the contracts expire and then new
contracts come on line and need to be negotiated with our new cost structure.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. But understanding that the fixed price component of your business has gone up
some over time, that benefit might be greater, I would think, than it would have been in the past in terms of...
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: That's correct. That's a good way to think about it. That's a fair way to think about it.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And then also on the organization, I know, Bill, you've said in the past that the new
structure gives you some synergies that are beyond cost, basically the ability to do C4ISR better, things like that, that

can work for International customers, but what I'm interested in here is how much more can that get you? You have a
huge presence right now, particularly in Missile Defense. Where do you see the upside actually coming out by being
able to integrate things better in this new organization?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I think we – I saw it at the Paris Air Show, sat down with one of our customers. I won't
say which one or which business. And we were sitting there and they had an existing contract, they're going to be
signing a new contract with us and we were at the table and they started to talk about a problem in one, through one's
service, another through a different service, and all of a sudden they're sitting there and we have both right at the table
and they're underneath one person and it's fixed instantaneously. There was no debate, no nothing, surfaced, done,
finished. And just – that would have taken some coordination before to go through it and get the alignment. And for me
it just – I just sat there and smiled for a minute and watched how nice it worked.
And it's not to say it wouldn't have been done in the past, it would've, but it took a little more coordination. And now
it's all integrated in one area in the Command and Control and it's done. And so it's just one example that's real that's
right in my mind that I see. And oh, by the way, domestically when we deal with the Navy in one area, we used to add
it in two separate businesses. And now the Navy realizes we can pull it together because the two parts of the Navy
didn't talk to each other and now they got us looking at it both ways and we're saving both sides money. So I really do
see it and I have concrete examples of it.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question will comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. You may proceed.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks very much. Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Bill, just a quick one for you hopefully. On the x4 front as you grow towards around 30% of
revenues and potentially beyond that from export sales, what sort of impact does this have on the structure of the firm?
And also the way that you manage risk?
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, it's – you know it's a great question because I have this theory that back when we
were at 18% we went in and put some things in place to be able to handle 20%, and then we set a goal for ourselves at
25% and we changed our structure a little bit to be able to do that, and now we're getting to 30%. And at each 5%
increment we've seen a fundamental change in the way we have to do it, and the way I would say is you have to think
more globally than you have to think internationally. And for that is how do we have a bigger presence in country?
How do we make sure that our teams are on the ground and that we're integrated into the culture and that the business
climate that we do?
And I can tell you that Raytheon will be making a shift in how we look at our International business because 30% will
happen and we'll be prepared for it. And then as we get to that milestone we'll be thinking about 35% because you've
got to think in increments to go do it. And there's not one cookie cutter approach because we've sold in 120 countries.
We have active about 82 now. And that changes, but our presence changes. If you look at Saudi or Japan, we've been
there 50 years and that's a long time; and we want to be there another 50. And so each model is different because Japan
you have trading companies, in the Mideast you need a presence. So, we are thinking of it and you'll probably hear
changes about what we're going to go do to be able to handle that, if that helps.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Yes, that's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up, technical question on the Jammer
program; I see one of your competitors has protested the award. Does that mean that you haven't actually started work
on it yet?

<A - William H. Swanson>: No, the – what happens, you're correct, is when there's a protest in the first 10 days there's
a stop work put out in that regard. That's normal. The NAVAIR will now go handle the protest with the GAO and one
of the things that we're very comfortable about is NAVAIR is the best at doing this. And they are very thorough. And
you have to look at the protest results that people have against them. And this is not a competition that happened
overnight. They've seen us perform on kind of proof of principal contracts so NAVAIR has seen all four of us operate.
And we feel very comfortable in their selection. Of course we're biased, but we feel comfortable.

Your next question will comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. You may proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Bill, I was going to ask if you could just give us an update on a couple of different
programs. This speaks to some of the things you've already addressed, but Patriot for Turkey, AMDR and then I was
wondering if we should be concerned about Space Fence?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I would say one, the head of Space Command – I'll start in reverse order, basically
has said they're ready to go. They've made their selection and they can award. I think part of the internal scammer
review the DoD had, they're going to go through and determine what they're going to do in this regard. As an engineer
and I look at what Space Fence is trying to do and I think of the debris that's up in space and I think of all the assets,
whether they be commercial satellites, whether they be the Space Station, whatever is up there for any country, people
need to map that debris and be able to move things out of the way because I've got to tell you, losing a satellite or
damaging the Space Station will pay for a Space Fence really quickly. But people have to make the decision. These are
tough economic times and the Department will go through that.
AMDR is due to be awarded this fall. And from what we gather it's one of the Navy's top priorities. It's survived all the
reviews and we'll see what happens in that regard. I think your other one was Turkey. Of course you can pick up the
papers and see the thing that goes on political; I mean it's one of the things we live with internationally. Kuwait, I'm
surprised you didn't ask about it, but Kuwait for example we have an LOA sitting on the Minister of Defense's desk and
Parliament was dissolved and they'll be forming a new Parliament July 27. And after that they'll put it together and then
we'll expect the LOA to float forward and we'll get moving that way.
Regarding Turkey, they have the same political unrest now. They'll probably make a decision in the third quarter. I
think they've asked for proposals to be extended and then we'll take it from there. But that's the nature of International
business.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Dave, just on that, how much of those Patriot orders are in your booking? Or how do you
figure those into the $23.5 billion you're talking about? And then the other thing I wanted to ask you is just on cash
flow, it looks like you brought forward some cash flow from Q3 just based on the guidance and the numbers you – the
way they adjusted. Is that correct?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, that's correct. That's right. So on the first part, it's – it would be not very traditional
for us to give out specifics on what programs specifically are valued at in our guidance. I will say that, from a bookings
standpoint, these are all significant awards from a value standpoint, but in our guidance we factor the overall value
quite a bit. So – and this can be anywhere from the 20% to 50% value of what the potential program might be,
depending on a lot of different probability estimates. From a sales standpoint I would say some of these larger ones are
not significant drivers in the back half from a sales standpoint. And so that's kind of the way to think about some of
these International Patriot programs that Bill just took us through.

Your next question will comes from the line of Yair Reiner from Oppenheimer. You may proceed.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Thank you. Good morning and congrats on the strong results. I just wanted to ask about the
guidance for the back half of the year, it implies a pretty sharp drop-off in terms of the revenue momentum across the
business. I know you attributed that to sequestration and potentially a CR in the fourth quarter. I'm wondering, to what
extent is that reflected in what you're seeing today across your businesses? Or is that just in anticipation of the fact that
eventually the budget kind of needs to kick in?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. So again, the way you framed the question is accurate; the second half does reflect
our current thinking relative to the impact of sequestration on a continuing resolution in the fourth quarter of the
calendar year. So if we see things differently going forward, obviously we will update the outlook. I mean what we're
seeing today kind of represents the way we see things playing out from a sales cadence standpoint. I do want to
mention that I did speak to our bias earlier in the discussion being to the high end of the range. It's probably worth
noting, I would say it's most definitely worth noting, that from an internal perspective we do have targets for sale that
exceed the high end of our guidance, but at this stage we believe that the guidance we put out is a prudent way to look
at it.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Great. Thank you. And then just a quick one on the tax rate, is the decline there reflective of the
International mix? And if so, should we expect that there is going to be a downward bias on that moving forward?
Thank you.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. We have a number of tax planning initiatives that are taking place, and the tax group
has done an excellent job in managing our tax obligations. We did take the rate down about 50 basis points from an
ETR standpoint for the balance of – for 2013 versus where we were thinking a few months back. Going forward I'd
suggest that you can think about the tax rate in that general range.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Thank you.

Your next question will comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS. You may proceed.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: On the revisiting the booking side, just wanted to make sure I'm doing the math correctly,
that you're basically assuming for the full year that domestic bookings are down around 20% and offset by about 20%
growth in International. And if so, what does that mean, Dave, for advances in the back half of the year if some of these
International awards that you're anticipating actually come through?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, advances have been pretty consistent year-in and year-out relative to our direct
commercial sales with International customers. Again, when we look at those and we think about how they might

impact cash flow for the year, it's also factored. So we're comfortable with the range that we put out there. From a cash
flow standpoint, again I probably should have mentioned this earlier; we are also biased toward the higher end of the
cash flow guidance. One thing I do want to remind everyone of is that this year there is some ramping down of
advances given some of the strength in 2012, and we'll see how things play out. But again, overall, again, there's a lot
of different moving parts here. We factor everything and are quite comfortable with the outlook.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And was that on domestic bookings, is that right? You're expecting about 20% decline
in domestic bookings this year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, let me just – let me walk through this briefly. So from a – on a full-year basis with
respect to the overall domestic bookings as a percent of the total, we see it in the 68% to 70% range when we close out
the year. And importantly, Bill mentioned this earlier, we see International in the 30% to 32% range.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Could you give the EAC number for the quarter yet?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: The EAC number, no I haven't. And I knew you were going to ask before you got off this
call. The EAC number for the quarter approximates about 2.6% of sales. And the overall number is I believe about – I
don't have it in front of me, about $156 million positive.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Your next question will comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Dave, just related to the comment about sales being towards the high end this year, I guess
what got better to get the additional $300 million? And can you talk just in terms of what that implies for U.S. DoD,
non-DoD and non-U.S. growth this year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. Well, it's again the strength of our overall international business. And it's clearly what
drove the second quarter results from a sales standpoint and a good portion of that does flow through to the year. So on
an overall basis for the year from a domestic standpoint, we're seeing the sales profile down about 6% to 7% and from
an International standpoint we're seeing sales up about 6% to 7%. And I suppose that's the law of large numbers, that
they're the exact same percent, but for the company the guidance for sales is down in the range of the 3% to 4% area.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then if I look at your – the outlook for the margins, certainly has a – implies the
second half is a big step down and I guess mostly in IDS. Can you talk about why that's coming down so much?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. So we did have strong margins in the quarter and you're correct, specifically at IDS.
In the back half margins still remain strong but lower than the first half given the cadence of our efficiencies which are
weighted to the first half as well as some new programs starting up and some of our longer-duration production
programs ramping down. I – it's important to point out that we did increase the full-year outlook for margins.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: And then one last question for Bill just on that AMDR competition, does the result of the
compact systems engineering decision earlier in the year have any bearing on that? Or is there any way to get insight
into how that may play out?
<A - William H. Swanson>: The initial one, I mean if you look at it that was for the overall weapons system. And
clearly Lockheed had a nice win there and – but they've been doing that since the whole thing started, so to displace
somebody that's been doing something for 30 years really gets hard. AMDR, don't – it's hard also, but it's a brand-new
radar. And there what the customer's looking for is innovation. They're looking for detection capability. They're
looking at discrimination capability and for that one it is different. And the playing field is, I'd want to say, a little more

level in that regard of being able to compete.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay.
<A - William H. Swanson>: But it's an S-band radar and we're – we like win everything in X-band, so this is a new

Your next question will comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. You may proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much and good performance, guys.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thanks, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So Bill, you mentioned Taiwan AESA radar, what's the timing on that? And what's the
sequencing that you expect between the U.S. Air Force decision on the F-16 radar and Taiwan's?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I expect that at any time soon, Cai. It's – I mean it could've happened already but it didn't.
It just takes a while to get things through and of course the building is trying to balance a bunch of things now, so it
could be any time. I think they have everything in there. I think from a point of view the South Koreans determined that
they were going to do it on their time table and they went through one of the toughest competitions that I've seen and
they selected us, and now the Air Force will select for Taiwan. They've asked Taiwan to go do that. And it looks like
the International world is updating their F-16's before the U.S. will update theirs is the way I describe the timing.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. But the Air Force will decide, so if the Air Force decides for you or Brand X, that's
probably what the Air Force ultimately will buy. Is that one way of thinking of it?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Not necessarily. I mean this is a competitive world. We thrive on competition here; we
don't run from it. So I would imagine that they could compete Taiwan and then they could go compete U.S. radars, and
we're ready to do that.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Great. And Dave, one for you, you know a number of your peers have talked about pensions,
some of them better prospects for next year, some of them maybe not as good because of the impact of the uptick in
rates. Could you comment on what you see based on where we are today? And particularly your, as I recall, your
pension contributions were going to go up next year and the impact on your contributions for next year? Thanks.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. So I'm glad you asked the question. 2013 the FAS/CAS adjustment is expected to be
around $286 million. Looking further out, there's a number of variables that obviously impact the FAS/CAS adjustment
and the funding requirements including the discount rate, the return on assets and other actuarial assumptions. The CAS
harmonization rules and the pension funding stabilization law, that's part of PPA. Now if rates remain flat, if we hold
all assumptions constant, our FAS/CAS adjustment in 2014 could be $100 million to $150 million less than 2013. So,
that's a positive pick-up from a financial results standpoint.
Looking beyond 2014 we see the FAS/CAS adjustment, it could become favorable in 2015, possibly as much as $350
million to $400 million positive, again assuming no change in the discount rates and assuming we meet our expected
returns. And when I say no change, I'm taking 2013 as a baseline. Now if we set the discount rate today, sort of as we're
sitting here, it would likely be 50 basis points to 75 basis points higher than what we're using in 2013, the point at the
end of 2012. And again, it's for 2013 results. But if they were to increase about 50 basis points it would additionally
improve our FAS/CAS in 2014 and beyond by maybe upwards of $200 million each year assuming the discount rate
and the environment persists.

Page 13 of 14
So let me get a little more specific, and I know I'm being lengthy here but a number of folks have asked. Our 2014
FAS/CAS, again with a higher interest rate environment, the 2014 FAS/CAS adjustment could be $250 million to $350
million less than what we're seeing in 2013. And looking beyond 2014 the FAS/CAS adjustment again becomes
favorable in 2015 and could be as much as $0.5 billion, and that's positive. Again, that's assuming that the interest rate
environment persists at about 50 basis points to 75 basis points higher than where we are today. So from a funding
standpoint, if interest rates again stay at this level that I just suggested where we are today, the net funding is about
breakeven for next year.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: When you say net, so basically what you contribute less CAS?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, what – this is what happens. Essentially we have the gross funding and then you have
the CAS reimbursement, essentially, through the contract actions. And frankly whether interest rates stay up or interest
rates stay where they are – where they were in the beginning of 2013, the net funding contribution is about breakeven
next year. So it doesn't really move it that much.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: One quick follow-up, Northrop mentioned that the impact of higher rates had an adverse
impact on their return on assets year-to-date. They were only up 50 bps through the end of June. What's your ROA look
like year-to-date?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So yeah, they may be heavily weighted into fixed income and other interest-sensitive
investments. I don't know that, but that may be the case. For us I would say more than on a year-to-date basis but as of
just a couple of days ago we were just under 8% return on assets.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. Good work. Thanks.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay.
<A - Todd Ernst>: Francis, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay. And that question will comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. You may proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the call here. I just want to step back and ask a
bigger picture question and Bill and Dave, you can both weight in, or one of you; as we look at the orders that you've
taken or the bookings that you've gotten this year, obviously there will be revenue streams that we're going to see out in
the future. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the margin expectations on those bookings?
And maybe you can do that by talking about the contract mix itself and whether it represents a departure from your
current revenue streams? Just harkening back to the beginning of the year when you talked a little bit about your
margins for 2013 being negative impact – having a negative impact due to some more development work, and
obviously you've just now signed on some development work; we don't have a good understanding of the rest of the
bookings that you've just made. If you could just talk a little bit about how your contract mix may or may not be
changing as we move out over the next several quarters?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I think what's important is what I tried to talk about a little bit, that we look at
International being 30% to 32%, I think those are the numbers that Dave gave there so when you look at International
clearly for us we understand that marketplace. We understand it because we know the risks that are in there and part of
our responsibility is to be able to mitigate those risks as we go through the program. So on International we start
slower, retire the risk and then build up as we get towards the end. I don't see that changing in the way we do it. We go
through every one of the bids here to make sure that they take place in the same manner, but what we also do is a key
thing for us is affordability.
So as we look at a tougher environment, how do we make sure that we are able to deliver at an affordable price but at
the same time deliver the kind of margins you all expect from us as investors? So that's absolutely key. Clearly the

development programs that you get into, whether they be Next Generation Jammer, whether they be AMDR or Space
Fence, those also start lower but those turn into, much like what Zumwalt was years ago for us, it started low and then
turned into the production for the three ships there and have the regular margins you expect for us.
So, there's always an ebb and flow. And Dave takes that into account. He and his team do a great job at modeling not
only what we have in the business but what we're looking at in the future of the business so that we can make sure
there's no surprises coming because one of the things that we try and be is transparent as we look at that going forward.
So there is an ebb and flow there but I would tell you we have our foot on the throttle here from a standpoint of what
we can do because we know what we're bidding. And the bidding philosophy in this company has not changed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. And specifically to International and some of these Missile Defense Systems that you
signed here of late and you said that you're in the second or third inning so clearly there's more to go.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yup.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Will there be a need for incremental development work to be done on any of those systems
to fit International requirements?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, we always do that. And then the other thing is that we as a company are never
satisfied. We can find ways to continue – one of the things that's tough is O&M. And a lot of people don't think about
maintenance, and our engineers look at the total life cycle and they're constantly trying to find ways to reduce the O&M
costs or operating costs of our customers. So if we can take devices or technology – I mean look at Patriot. The Patriot I
started on is not the Patriot we're delivering today. Two-thirds of it was redesigned for UAE, and as we keep delivering
Patriot we keep upgrading it. And oh, by the way, once you upgrade it, you can go back to all our other customers and
offer them the upgraded hardware to reduce their costs, reduce the spare content and so forth. So it's a never-ending
opportunity for us here at Raytheon.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Great. Thanks very much.
