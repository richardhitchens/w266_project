Martin J. Barrington
Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Altria successfully delivered against its
financial goals in 2013 and continued its strong track record of delivering earnings and dividends growth for its
shareholders. For the full year, Altria delivered adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7.7% on the strength of its diverse
business model and solid performance by its core tobacco businesses. We also enhanced our capital structure in 2013
and provided significant cash returns to our shareholders. We increased our dividend by 9.1% in 2013, our 47th
dividend increase in the last 44 years, and paid shareholders more than $3.6 billion in dividends.
Altria further rewarded shareholders by repurchasing shares totaling $600 million in 2013. We have approximately
$457 million remaining in the current $1 billion program, which we expect to complete by the end of the third quarter
of 2014. Of course, the timing of any purchases will depend on marketplace conditions and other factors.
In the fourth quarter of 2013, Altria tendered for high coupon debt and replaced it with new lower-cost debt. These
transactions, along with the retirement of debt at its scheduled maturity, improved our debt maturity profile and
lowered future interest expense. As a result of our 2013 capital markets activities, Altria reduced its weighted average
coupon rate to 5.9% at the year-end 2013 from 7.2% at year-end 2012.
We also delivered on our cost reduction commitments. Altria completed its cost reduction program in the fourth quarter
of 2013 by achieving $400 million in annualized savings versus previously planned spending. And Altria continued to
deliver value to shareholders through its diverse income streams, including our equity investment in SABMiller, which
generated pre-tax income of approximately $1 billion for Altria in 2013.
So in summary, in 2013 Altria complemented its operating companies' performance by effectively employing multiple
tools: cost savings, share repurchases, debt management and its SABMiller investment, to enhance shareholder value.
Let's turn to the performance of our core businesses. In the Smokeable Products segment, PM USA delivered on its
strategy to maximize income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro over time. The segment grew
adjusted operating companies' income for the quarter and the full year, primarily through higher pricing. Investments in
the Marlboro brand architecture and product expansions helped PM USA balance income growth and share gains to
maintain its marketplace leadership. Marlboro grew one-tenth of a retail share point for the year.
In the Smokeless Product segment our strategy is to maximize income by growing volume at or ahead of the smokeless
category and to maintain modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. In 2013 the smokeless product
segment produced solid adjusted operating companies' income growth, primarily through higher pricing and volume,
and grew Copenhagen and Skoal's combined volume and retail share. Driven by its strong brand equity, Copenhagen
performed well in both the quarter and the year, while Skoal continued to face strong competitive pressure.
In the Wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered double-digit operating companies' income growth for the full year
through higher pricing and its focus on increasing distribution of premium wines.
Altria also took important steps in 2013 to develop and commercialize innovative products for adult tobacco
consumers. In the fourth quarter, Altria increased its investment in the e-vapor category. Nu Mark expanded the
MarkTen e-cigarettes' test market into Arizona with a new flavor system and packaging configuration. So far, MarkTen
is off to a very strong start in Arizona and has been effective at gaining trial. It's now available in about 1,900 Arizona
stores and about 5,000 stores across both the Arizona and Indiana test markets. Nu Mark is making good progress in
understanding adult smokers' and vapors' preferences and the MarkTen value equation in a disciplined way.
Also in December, Altria announced its agreements with Phillip Morris International that create opportunities to
commercialize our e-vapor products internationally and to expand our innovative products portfolio in the U.S.

Through licensing, regulatory engagement and contract manufacturing arrangements, Altria is providing PMI with an
exclusive license to commercialize Altria's e-vapor products internationally and PMI is providing exclusive rights to
two of its innovative next-generation products to Altria for commercialization in the U.S.
We have also agreed to cooperate with PMI on scientific assessment, regulatory engagement and sharing of
improvements regarding these products. We view these agreements as mutually beneficial to us and PMI and an
important opportunity to advance Altria's development of innovative products for adult tobacco consumers.
So 2013 was a successful year for Altria. We delivered against our strategy to maximize the core tobacco business
while innovating and investing to grow new revenue streams for the future. Altria delivered 2013 total shareholder
return of 28.6%, which outpaced the S&P Food, Beverage and Tobacco [ph] Index's return of 23.9%. (8:04)
Looking ahead to 2014, our core tobacco businesses are well positioned to deliver strong income growth through their
leading premium brands. We also expect to benefit from lower interest expense, a lower effective tax rate and a
reduction in shares from our ongoing current share repurchase program. However, we plan to make disciplined and
incremental investments to build our e-vapor business and we anticipate continued variability in gains from asset sales
at Phillip Morris Capital Corporation.
Finally, although some economic indicators are improving, adult tobacco consumers continue to face challenges. Altria
thus forecasts its 2014 adjusted diluted EPS will increase by 6% to 9% to a range of $2.52 to $2.59 from its 2013 base
of $2.38.
I'll now turn things over to Howard, who will discuss our business results in more detail.
Howard A. Willard
Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. As Marty mentioned, each of our reportable segments grew adjusted
operating companies' income in 2013. Notably, each of the segments also expanded adjusted operating companies'
income margins through solid price realization and a continued focus on cost management.
Although we have concluded the $400 million cost reduction program, we will continue to focus on carefully managing
costs in 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Smokeable Products segment's reported operating companies' income
increased 4.5% to $1.6 billion, primarily driven by higher pricing, lower selling, general and administrative costs and
lower restructuring charges, partially offset by lower reported shipment volume.
The segment's fourth quarter adjusted operating companies' income grew 3.6% and its adjusted operating income
companies' margins grew 2.2 percentage points to 42.1%. For the full year, Altria's Smokeable Products segment grew
reported operating companies' income 13.2% to over $7 billion, primarily through higher pricing, PM USA's
non-participating manufacturers adjustment settlement and the NPM Arbitration Panel Decision as well as lower
selling, general and administrative expenses.
These factors were partially offset by lower reported shipment volume and higher resolution expense. Excluding the
impact of items detailed in today's press release, including the NPM adjustment items, adjusted operating companies'
income increased 2.4% in 2013, to approximately $6.4 billion. For the full year, the Smokeable Products segment's
adjusted operating companies' income margins increased 1 percentage point, to 42.2% in 2013.
Over the past couple of years, PM USA estimates that cigarette category volumes have declined at a rate of 3% to 4%,
and we believe that trend continued in 2013. After adjusting for trade inventory changes and other factors, PM USA
estimates that its domestic cigarette shipment volumes decreased approximately 4% for both the fourth quarter and full
year of 2013 and that the category also declined approximately 4%.
Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share grew by two-tenths of a share point, to 43.7%. PM USA's total share of the
cigarette category was up three-tenths of a share point to 50.7% for the quarter. Marlboro's retail share was 43.7% for
the full year as well. Share gains by Marlboro and L&M were partially offset by share losses on other portfolio brands.

In 2013 L&M continued to gain retail share, as the total discount segment was flat to declining. In total, PM USA
achieved a 50.6% share of the cigarette category in 2013, up from 50.3% in 2012. We're pleased with the performance
of both PM USA and Marlboro, especially in light of competitive line extensions and price promotions in the second
half of 2013.
In the machine-made large cigar category, Middleton's volume decreased 3.2% for the full year. Black & Mild declined
1.3 retail share points, driven by heightened competitive activity from low-priced cigar brands. Middleton adjusted its
plans during the year and moderated its decline rate, although the competitive environment remains difficult. For the
fourth quarter, Middleton's volume increased 8.5%. Black & Mild's retail share was down seven-tenths of a share point
in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Smokeless Products, in the fourth quarter reported operating companies' income for the segment was
essentially flat, while adjusted OCI increased by 1.2%, primarily driven by higher pricing and offset by higher
promotional investments and lower volume. For the full year, the Smokeless Products segment delivered reported
operating companies' income growth of 9.9% and adjusted OCI growth of 7%, to over $1 billion, due primarily to
higher pricing, increased volume, lower restructuring charges and effective cost management. These factors were
partially offset by higher promotional spending and mix. The Smokeless Products segment's adjusted operating
companies' income margin grew by 1.5 percentage points, to 62.3% for 2013.
Due to calendar differences, the Smokeless Products segment had one less shipping day in the fourth quarter and the
full year of 2013, representing approximately one full week of volume, which affected reported shipments for both
periods. In particular, Copenhagen and Skoal combined reported shipment volume was down 3.5% for the fourth
quarter. For the full year, Copenhagen and Skoal combined reported shipment volume increased 4.3%.
After adjusting for calendar differences, trade inventory changes and other factors, USSTC and PM USA estimate their
smokeless shipment volume grew 5% and that the smokeless category volume for both periods grew at a rate of
approximately 5.5%. For the full year, USSTC grew combined Copenhagen and Skoal retail share by three-tenths of a
share point, to 50.7%, supported by product expansions over the past several years, including Copenhagen Wintergreen
and Southern Blend.
Ste. Michelle delivered another year of strong income and volume growth. Wine segment operating companies' income
increased 9.8% in the fourth quarter and 13.5%, to $118 million, for the full year. Wine shipment volume grew 5.8%
for the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year, primarily on the strong performance of 14 Hands.
That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, let
me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 34% for the
fourth quarter and the full year of 2013. In 2012, Marlboro's price gap was 34% for the fourth quarter and 35% for the
full year.
Marlboro's net pack price was $5.86 in the fourth quarter, up from $5.75 a year ago, and $5.83 for the full year, up from
$5.74 in 2012. The lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.38 in the fourth quarter and $4.34 for the full year, up $0.09
and $0.08 versus 2012, respectfully.
The cigarette discount category retail share was 25.2% for the fourth quarter and 25.3% for the full year of 2013. For
the fourth quarter of 2012, the discount category retail share was 25.6% and for the full year of 2012 discount category
share was 25.4%.
The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.47 per pack,
unchanged from the third quarter and up $0.06 per pack from the fourth quarter of 2012. Copenhagen's retail price was
$4.07 for the fourth quarter and $4.06 for the full year and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was 35% for
the fourth quarter and 36% for the full year.
Copenhagen's fourth quarter 2012 retail price was $4.04 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was 38%.
For the full year of 2012, Copenhagen's retail price was $4.04 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was
39%.

Operator, do we have any questions?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Vivien.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: My first question has to do with your outlook for 2014 and specifically for the U.S.
cigarette category combustibles. Can you offer a little color on how you're thinking about category volumes for the
year?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, as you know, we don't forecast volume going forward, but I can tell you that what
we see over the last several years is that the cigarette volume declines have been in the range of 3% to 4%. And we've
gone through our model on that of both secular decline and price elasticity. That's what we see basically in 2013, the
continuation of that trend, and we don't see any particular drivers in 2013 that caused us to believe any differently about
that.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: That's fair. Given kind of the state of the consumer, do you think it's fair to say that volume
declines will probably come in at the lower end of that range like they did in 2013?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, it's hard to say going forward. I do think that a word or two about the consumer is
important; it's a good question. The macro trends are improving in some domains. But the way we look at our business
is always, well, how do those macro trends impact our adult tobacco consumer? And so I can tell you how we're
thinking about it is that unemployment remains unfortunately high at about, what, 6%, 7%. Underemployment is higher
than that. Labor participation rates are not robust. And as you know, the adult tobacco consumer tends to over index in
those domains. So it's hard to find a lot of encouragement there.
Consumer confidence generally is up, but it's nowhere around where we'd like to see it, which is a typical score of, say,
100 before the recession hit. We watch housing starts pretty carefully. We see some improvement in the housing
figures, but, again, they're far below where they should be. So we're always hopeful, we're always hopeful that the
economy is going to improve for everyone. It's just hard to find a lot of drivers to cause us to believe that for the adult
tobacco consumer 2014 is going to look very much different than 2013.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: That makes a lot of sense to me. One last one, please. On the competitive landscape you
cited some stepped up competitive activity in the back half. Would you categorize that as relatively rational? Are you
seeing any shift in kind of competitive posturing?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, you know, I say what I always say about this, this is a business that has always
been competitive. It was competitive in 2013. You know, our plans assume that the businesses will continue to be
competitive. I think what's important, though, I think, is to look at how PM USA is able to navigate through that
environment. We had very good price realization, as you saw last year, we had margin expansion, grew adjusted OCI to
nearly $6.5 billion, modestly grew Marlboro's share, modestly grew overall PM USA share. And that was at a time
when we continued to invest in our brands like through the Marlboro architecture. So, what I would say to you, Vivien,
is even though it's competitive, it's an environment in which PM USA has been able to really effectively operate on its
strategy, have very good results in 2013.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Perfect. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: I had two questions, Marty. The first, can you explain or speak to this gap in the fourth
quarter between your cigarette shipments down 5.8% and your estimate that the underlying consumption was down
4%? And I ask that in the context that the timing of your end-of-year price increases both years were fairly similar.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, this comes up from time to time. I think we talked about this actually in the first
quarter, if memory serves. It really is the difference in trade inventory movements and other factors. But the trade
inventory movements, as you know, make a big difference. If you look at it throughout the quarter, though, on an
adjusted basis or for the full year, David, on an adjusted basis, we're confident that it's about 4%. The pricing, as I
remember it, for the quarter was I think PM USA announced its pricing I think the last week of November this quarter
to have become effective around the first of the year. And when we model it out, that's what it looks like to us.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. And then, Marty, with respect to MarkTen, could you speak to the market share
you've been able to generate in the geographies in which you're competing, what the trajectory of your market share has
been in those markets? And also because the spending, you can see in the P&L, wasn't insignificant this year and you're
calling out that as a potential headwind in 2014, what's the potential opportunity that you're calibrating your spending
against?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, that's a great question about MarkTen. Thanks for asking it. Look, we have about
a month's worth of data and so I don't want to roll out numbers. We'll have more to say about this in CAGNY, which is
coming up, and I hope to have some numbers to show you there.
What I can tell you is that we have a plan that we've set out in Arizona, the same way we did in Indiana really, about
what we're trying to learn. That's how you do test markets in a disciplined kind of a way. And I think we have a very
good plan in place to learn. And what we've learned is so far we wanted to get broad distribution of our MarkTen
product at retail and our sales force has done a great job of doing that. As I mentioned in the remarks, we're in about
1,900 stores there. We wanted to find out trade acceptance. And I can tell you the trade acceptance of the product is
enthusiastic. And so we're learning a lot about working with the trade there.
I can tell you, we like the MarkTen product a lot. It is a terrific product. We think we have a good offering and we
believe if we can get it in the hands of consumers that they will think so, too. And so we have a revised promotion plan
that is setting is out to do exactly that. I can assure you when we enter these test markets, though, we have very specific
goals that we're setting out to answer and learn from. We have metrics that we put in place to know whether we're
achieving them. And then of course we're always looking to try to leverage those learnings, as we did, for example,
from Indiana to Arizona about learning our way forward. We believe that's the right way forward in emerging
categories. We try to learn wisely and we try to learn it in a disciplined kind of a way.
So that's how we're thinking about Arizona. And, again, I hope we'll have more for you at CAGNY about that.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay, thanks. See you then.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling in.

Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: My first question is on Marlboro. And I guess I'm trying to get a sense of the overall health
of your Marlboro franchise in light of the recent line extensions with edge and NXT earlier last year. How incremental
were these lines and how well did your core Marlboro perform? And then any learnings from these extensions in how
full is your Marlboro innovation pipeline for this year?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, well, we think Marlboro performed terrifically. And we've talked from time to
time about its brand equity using a variety of measures. I won't repeat them all here. You know what they are in terms
of its scale, in terms of being the largest brand everywhere, in terms of being able to have a real premium price gap
that's been constant despite bad recessions and FETs and so forth and so on.
When we roll out Marlboro extensions, we always check to make sure that they are incremental to the equity of
Marlboro. So when we bring out products like NXT or we bring out products like Edge, we're confident that they're
adding to the Marlboro equity and we measure that, as you know, Bonnie, over time. This has been the most successful
brand in the category for decades. And our approach continues to be that to do that over time.
We've spoken before about the number of SKUs in Marlboro. We don't bring them out willy-nilly. We try to make sure
there's a consumer demand for them there. And, of course, we're always trying to attract adult competitive smokers.
And I think that PM USA has done a very good job with that both over time and in 2013.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay, thanks for that. And then I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the agreement
you reached with Phillip Morris International. To me, it seems like very big opportunity. So could you talk a little bit
more about this opportunity as well as timing and next steps? And also, how should we think about the potential upside
to your earnings from the royalty payments you'll receive as PMI rolls out your e-cigs technology internationally? And
then finally as you look into the future, could you talk about how you envision your reduced risk portfolio evolving?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Okay, there's a lot there. Let me see if I can unpack that a little bit for us. It is an
important step forward. And I appreciate your asking about it. From the Altria perspective, as I was just discussing with
David, we really like our technology in e-vapor. We think we've done a very good job with that. And so it's great that
we have an opportunity to partner with PMI so that it can be sold in international markets. As you know, PMI is a
terrific company, we have a high regard for it. It has global scale, it has global infrastructure. And I think putting our
technology in PMI's hands to try to sell that to adult vapors elsewhere in the world is a good thing for Altria. It's a good
thing for PMI.
I think in addition, as we've spoken about previously, our innovation strategy for adult tobacco consumers is to offer
them a variety of products that are innovative from conventional products and may hold out the promise, if FDA were
ever to approve them, of reduced harm. And that's exactly what PMI has been working on with its NGP Platforms 1
and 2. So, we now have those in our portfolio through this agreement. And as PMI and with our support work on FDA,
it's an extremely important strategic step forward for harm reduction I think for consumers and we're hopeful about
that.
In terms of contribution to earnings, I think it's early there. There are royalty agreements in place, but really I think this
is more about getting the products in each other's hands and seeing if we can bring them to adult tobacco consumers
and see if they'll take them. So from our perspective, that's the way we're thinking about innovation. We follow the
consumer. The consumer will decide about innovative products. Our job is to invent them, to commercialize them and
to work with the FDA where appropriate to make sure that they make it to market. That's kinds of our strategy in a

Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Thilo.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Just to follow up on the MarkTen question, in your base case for MarkTen, what level of indoor
usage restrictions is built into that base business model?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: You broke up just a little bit, Thilo. Say it again?
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Oh, sorry. For the base business case for MarkTen, what level of usage restrictions similar to
smoking bans, what level of usage restrictions do you have included in that base business case for MarkTen?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, we've modeled out basically three scenarios. You know, we don't know, there are
some unknowns obviously in e-vapor and innovation generally. They regard excise taxes, technology improvements
and then the regulatory situation. So rather than to have [inaudible] (31:22), we have built three cases where we assume
there's varying degrees of flexibility or regulation there, so we've actually done three cases.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: And what's the assumption for the base case?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, I'm not going to get into the proprietary nature of how we've modeled it out. I
think it's fair to say, though, if there's a general belief by the regulators and others that movement to e-vapor is a good
thing for adult tobacco consumers, you can assume there will be greater migration than less.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Fair enough. And then in your outlook for fiscal 2014 – or calendar 2014, what impact will the
end of the tobacco grower buyout have on the competitive landscape? What's the expectation there?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Howard?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I mean, I think with regard to the end of the quota, it happens really to impact the
fourth quarter of 2014, and that really occurs across the industry. So I think it's a cost reduction opportunity really
across the sector in the U.S. With regard to how the various players react to that cost reduction, I think we'll have to
wait and see how that plays out. But, of course, we continue to be focused on our strategy in the Smokeable segment of
maximizing profitability while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro. And, clearly, that cost reduction is
an opportunity.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: So there's no assumption yet that you will be willing to share whether you can be able to keep that
cost reduction or whether you have to pass it on to smokers, given the competitive environment?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I think we're not going share kind of our plan at that level of detail. But certainly
that is one of the items that's baked into our overall guidance for the year.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. And then last question I had for you. Can you give us an update on your strategy and plans
for L&M? I think so far you've always commented that it was supposed to offset the share losses for Basic. Is that still
the case, or is there maybe something more ambitious in place for L&M these days?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No, I think it's pretty much as we've described it before, Thilo. There are some people
who participate in the discount segment. That's not our focus, of course, but we want to have an offering there. L&M is
the offering that we give them. Our retailer trade partners in particular like for us to have a good discount brand in
there, but we're not trying to grow the discount category. That's not our focus.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay, perfect. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Greg Hessler with Bank of America.
<Q>: [indiscernible] (34:07) for Greg.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning.
<Q>: Good morning. Quick question for you about your debt plans and capital structure plans going forward. I know
you guys did the tender at the end of last year as well as paying down that maturity. What are your plans for the
upcoming maturity? And do you – kind of as a follow up to that, do you have any more liability management plans
going on in the future?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: You know, I think we're pretty pleased with the progress we've made on our balance sheet.
We've got our weighted average interest cost down to 5.9%. And we feel pretty comfortable with our current credit
ratings as well as our current debt to EBITDA ratio. So I don't know that I would communicate anything beyond the
fact that we've been following a pretty consistent strategy over time to bring our interest rate down. We think we've
been successful and we'll continue to look for opportunities in the future to improve that. But we're certainly not going
to share anything at the detail level about changes in the short term.
<Q>: Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thank you for calling in.

Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with CLSA.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: So your price mix in smokeable in the quarter was good. It was roughly about the pace
it's been all year, or even a slight uptick from 3Q even despite the competitive launch of Newport Gold. What are you
seeing kinds of in the marketplace there and can you compare or contrast that to when Newport Red would have
launched?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, I guess maybe I'll take it up a level. We did have good price realization, as you can
see, both throughout all the quarters and above 4% for the year. So I think this is consistent with what Howard just said
about trying to maximize income in the Smokeable segment.
You know, it's always a balance between growing income and watching the share. And I think PM USA did a good job
of that and I expect they'll do a good job of that in 2014. Manufacturers do launch products into the market from time
to time. You do see promotional pricing as they try to gain adult tobacco consumer awareness. That's just part of the
usual backdrop of how the business gets done, Michael.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: All right. That's helpful, thanks. And somewhat related on margins, you had a strong lift
in that segment as well against a decent comparison and an even stronger one the year before. Is there anything
specifically driving that? Or part of what I'd love to get a little color on, too, is the fourth quarter has gone from one of
the lowest margin quarters in the year to one of the higher ones. Is there any shifts you've made in the operations or is it
just getting some better pricing there? What's been driving that?

<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I wouldn't put too much into quarter-to-quarter variations in the cost trend. I would
probably tend to look at this full year of 2013 compared to the prior year to get a better estimate. Certainly, you're
pointing out the fact that we had an above trend for the quarter's cost reduction in the fourth quarter, but I think that has
more to do with just the way the spending unfolded on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And, of course, we're always
managing to a full year so I don't think there's anything significant that I would call out that was a change in trend.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the review process for the [indiscernible] (37:48)
regulations with the FDA, it's been at the OMB now for close to two months. Is there any involvement you have with
them or any visibility you have on that process, or is it a little bit of a kind of a black box?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I mean, we've said before we have lots of ongoing relationships at the Agency and also
with OMB and others. But I just don't have anything to offer you on that. You're exactly right, it's been at OMB and
there have been periodic announcements that is coming, but we haven't seen it and we haven't really heard much about
when it might be coming other than what they've said.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: No, okay, that's helpful. And then just one last one on e-cigarettes in terms of how you
think about a broader launch nationally, is it just a question of getting the learning and the product honed or is there any
capacity issues or what are the sort of things that would trigger that into a national launch?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, we haven't said anything about that and I won't this morning. But we have a
disciplined way of learning our way in. All of the factors that you mentioned, of course, are important to make sure that
we would know if and when we decide to do that. We want to make sure the product offering would be right and the
branding is right and the promotion is right. We just think about this through our value equation that you've heard us
talk about before, and certainly you want to make sure the capacity is in line.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Great, thank you.

Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So, Marty, just wanted to go back to the 2014 outlook. You know, between the interest expenses
coming down, the lower taxes and the share buyback benefit, it seems like the operating income growth in 2014 is
expected to be pretty modest. And I understand you called out some of the headwinds, but was just hoping to get some
more perspective on is this really the stepped-up spending that's causing a bit of a slowdown in terms of the operating
profit growth? How should we think about that in the context of your guidance?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, thanks for asking. Listen, we have a good plan for 2014. I like the plans of our
operating companies. I think they've done a good job of that. But it's the factors that we identified for you, really, that
we're trying to explain, which is we do have some headwinds in terms of making investments in the innovative space.
And then we do have variability. I may ask Howard to comment on this. We have variability in the capital core
contributions from time to time.
You want to talk about that, Howard?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Sure. I mean, I think we've communicated this before, that as we unwind PMCC, not only
does the lease income come down over time, but there are asset sales that are quite variable on a year-to-year basis.
And certainly in 2013 we had quite strong asset sales after settling some of the tax issues with the IRS on the
LILO/SILO leases. We found the opportunity to sell several of those assets in 2013.

Page 11 of 13
So I think that certainly one of the drivers of the comparison from 2014 to 2013 is some of the lumpiness in PMCC's
income. And then I think the second thing is that while certainly we made investments in 2013 towards competing
effectively in the e-cigarette category, we are certainly planning in 2014 to make further investments as we focus on
being successful in that emerging new category.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just maybe a bit of a follow up on MarkTen and then just the e-vapor category
generally, Marty. As you obviously participate in the broader tobacco category, how do you sort of think about how
you build equity, brand equity, in e-vapor category versus cigarettes or smokeless? Are there some differences,
similarities that you can call out and your thought process in thinking about how to invest in that particular product or
category?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, I actually – that's a terrific question. You know, the brands obviously that have
been in the, take the cigarette category, have obviously been out there for some time. And brand equity, as you know, is
built over time. Marlboro's equity has been built over decades. And because everyone is now launching products and
trying to gain brand equity, it will take some time.
I think one of the advantages that some players will have is those that know how to build brands will have an advantage
here. I would argue that Altria and its operating companies have a long and a rich heritage of being able to build
brands. That's one. Two I think is making sure that you're being consumer centric; you always have to start with the
consumer, you have to give them the offering that they want and then you build equity off of that platform. So, that's
how we think about it at least. But it's early days in e-vapor, it's going to take some time for a lot of things to sort itself
out and it will take time for equity to be built in this category, just like most others.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: And the two test markets that you've entered, Marty, have you noticed the pick-up in the
category growth in those markets as you've entered in those markets?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: We – obviously, Arizona is very, very early. We'll have some data to share about this, I
expect, at CAGNY. I don't want to get ahead of looking at those numbers at this time, but we'll try to get that
information for you.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay, thank you.

We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Nik Modi with
RBC Capital.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Nik.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: So just two quick questions, Marty. You know, a lot of talk obviously about e-cigarettes and
taking share from regular cigarettes. But if you really look at the underlying trend and go back rolling over the last
three years, looks like for this particular year, in 2013, the category decline rates has actually moderated as the year
progressed despite e-cigarettes growing as fast as they've been growing. And I wondered if you could just provide some
big picture thoughts on that.
And then the second question, which is more specific to Arizona, can you talk about some of the product changes that
you've made to MarkTen relative to Indiana? Just kind of talk about some of the modifications that you made to the
product. Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. Thanks for your question. We continue to look carefully at the growth of
e-cigarettes and its potential effect on cigarette volumes and we continue to believe that it's modest. It obviously is a

category that has grown very fast and, you're right, it gets a lot of attention. But we believe it's probably still in the
secular decline rate, which we've estimated to be 2% to 3%, which makes up a variety of things, which is lower
incidents, fewer cigarettes per day, people dabbling in pipe tobacco. We believe that the e-cigarette number is probably
in that number.
With respect to Arizona, we made a couple of changes that are probably worth mentioning. One of them is we put a
new flavor system in. We think it's significantly enhanced the sensorial experience. We changed the bundle that we
were offering, including a charger in the kit. And I think those things have been extremely well received by the
consumer to-date.

Okay. Our next question comes from Christopher Growe with Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Just two questions for you. I wanted to ask first, maybe a bit of a follow-up to a
question earlier and Howard had a good response on the variability in PMCC. If you were to look at the fourth quarter
where that division has turned to a loss, is that – I just want to be clear or maybe you can characterize, was it heavy
investments in e-cigarettes, was that something, kind of a dramatic mover in the quarter? Or was it more about the
volatility in PMCC that caused that to turn to a loss in the quarter?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, certainly I would say that the year-over-year kind of variance there was driven by
both PMCC and e-cigarettes. But I would tell that you the Arizona test market, given that a lot of that investment
occurred in the fourth quarter, was certainly a driver.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And so would you then expect that division in 2014, just from your commentary,
to be down in profitability, noting the investments that you're making plus the volatility at PMCC?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I think as we indicated in the guidance paragraph, we do expect to make incremental
investments in the e-vapor business in 2014 compared to 2013.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And just a follow-up question on new products. And we've had a pretty slow
process around the Substantial Equivalence approvals from the FDA. And so I just was curious for Phillip Morris USA,
you've had a good bit of activity, new product activity, in that division. The longer this takes for SE applications, is it
putting the division at more of a disadvantage going forward? Do you have less in the hopper, if you will? Do you need
more sort of activity from the FDA on the SE applications?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: We're actually in pretty good shape, I would tell you. And we continue to interact with
the FDA regularly with about our SE applications. So I think while everyone would like to see more outcomes from the
Agency, I think we're actually in pretty good shape, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. If I could ask one follow up, which was just that you characterized the inventory
change in the fourth quarter. Could you, if you said it I didn't hear it, but could you characterize inventory levels? Are
you at the right level, if you will, or where you were maybe a year ago with the fourth quarter, given that change that
occurred in the quarter?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, the inventory level of cigarettes ended the quarter lower in 2013 than they did a
year ago is what we were trying to communicate.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you.

Our final question comes from the line of Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Todd Duvick>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning.
<Q - Todd Duvick>: I wanted to see if you could talk a little about the Smokeless category. It looks like your reported
volume was down for the quarter and for the year. But in here you talk about with some adjustments, shipment volume
you estimate actually grew about 5%.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Right.
<Q - Todd Duvick>: Can you help us reconcile the difference there?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. The principle difference was that in both the fourth quarter and in 2013 there was
one fewer shipping day. And in the smokeless business it happened to be a Monday when a lot of the volume goes out.
So it's roughly equivalent to a shipping week. And that basically explains it, a few other factors, but it's basically that
movement.
<Q - Todd Duvick>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
