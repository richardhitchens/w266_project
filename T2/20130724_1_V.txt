Byron H. Pollitt
Thank you, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, some color on the third quarter's 17% net
revenue growth. It is important to note that this growth rate benefited from the absence of significant one-time client
incentives incurred in the prior year. Without these one-time client incentives, revenue growth for Q3 would have been
closer to 14%. That said, payment volume growth was broad-based globally for the March quarter and we're seeing
double-digit growth rates in the June quarter for both credit and debit on a constant dollar basis. Based on these trends
and with three quarters of the fiscal year now on the books, we are raising full-year 2013 revenue guidance from low
double-digits to around 13%.
Second, service revenue, though up 7% on a year-over-year basis, it was down sequentially from the fiscal second
quarter. This was primarily due to the signing of the 10-year Chase deal, which was executed in fiscal Q3, but was
retroactive to the beginning of Q2. This contract, as discussed on the Q2 earnings call, disproportionately impacted the
service revenue line and resulted in offsetting reductions in gross service revenue and related client incentives. Because
it was signed in fiscal Q3, the service revenue impacts for both Q2 and Q3 were recorded in the current quarter. This
means the Q4 service revenue growth rate should be a more representative indicator of underlying growth.
Third, client incentive for the quarter, as a percentage of gross revenue were 14.8%. As described previously, two
quarters of Chase related incentive reductions were booked in Q3. This impact was contemplated in our most recent
full-year guidance, and we remain comfortable with client incentives as a percent of gross revenue in the 16% to 17%
range for the full year 2013.
Fourth, now that we have fully lapped implementation of the Dodd-Frank routing rules, beginning in June, quarterly
Interlink payment volume growth has turned positive for the first time in over a year. Going forward, as we lapped the
period during which Visa's post Dodd-Frank debit strategies took hold, we would expect healthy, but moderating
revenue growth rates for U.S. debit.
Fifth, given our earnings results year-to-date and our expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter, we are increasing our
fiscal 2013 adjusted EPS guidance from around 20% to the low 20%s. Lastly, as we remain committed to returning
excess cash to our shareholders, during the quarter we spent approximately $1 billion to repurchase 6 million shares at
an average price of approximately $177. This leaves $61 million remaining in our prior authorization. And as we
announced earlier, our board recently authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which will run through
July of 2014.
Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction
trends for the fiscal third quarter, followed by our results through July 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our
fiscal third quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014.
Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars was 13% above the March's quarter 9%. This
was driven by sustained growth in all of our regions, including the U.S., which saw some incremental benefit from the
lapping effects associated with U.S. debit regulations. More recently in the U.S. through July 21, payment volume
growth was 10%, compared with 11% in the June ending quarter. Drilling down further, U.S. credit growth of 10%
held at Q3 levels while debit, which also grew at 10%, experienced a healthy but moderating growth rate as we lapped
the growing impact of Visa's U.S. debit strategies.
Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 11% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter, which compares to a
10% rate in the March quarter. The U.S. grew 9%, and the rest of world 12%. Through July 21, cross-border volume on

a constant dollar basis grew 7%, with a U.S. growth rate of 9%, and the rest of world at 6%. The slowing growth in
July is most pronounced outside the U.S. and, we believe, is due in large part to the timing of Ramadan versus last year.
Based on historical travel patterns, we estimate the Ramadan impact to be in the 250 basis points to 300 basis points
range for the month, and, if past is prologue, we should see a bounce back in August.
Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 15 billion in the fiscal third quarter, a 14% increase over the
prior-year period. The U.S. grew 12%, while the rest of world delivered 23% growth. We have now fully lapped the
negative impacts associated with U.S. debit regulation. Through July 21, process transaction growth was a positive
14%.
Lastly, please note that in our operational performance data pack that was released with today's earnings results, we
updated the cash volume in our LAC region to account for several quarters of under-reporting by one of our largest
issuers in Brazil. As a reminder, these cash volumes have no impact to our revenue.
Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, a 17% increase
year-over-year, driven by solid growth globally in both domestic and international transactions and, as mentioned
earlier, aided by significant nonrecurring incentives in the prior-year quarter. Currency hedging resulted in only a
modest foreign exchange headwind on net revenue in the quarter. Looking ahead, after factoring in our hedging
program, we anticipate continued headwinds in the next fiscal quarter and for fiscal 2014.
Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 7% over the prior-year period. On a
sequential basis, growth was negatively impacted by the Chase agreement, which, as I previously outlined, resulted in
lower service revenue offset by a lower level of incentives paid to Chase.
Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion, up 15% over the prior-year's quarter, based on solid growth rates in Visa
processed transactions inside and outside the U.S., and strong CyberSource transaction growth. With the full lapping of
the implementation of U.S. debit regulation, data processing revenue growth is now relatively on par with processed
transaction growth.
International transaction revenue was up 14% to $854 million, reflecting solid strength in cross-border volume and
some modest benefit from higher currency volatility. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives as a percentage of gross
revenue for the quarter came in at 14.8%, positively impacted by the Chase deal. That said, we anticipate a meaningful
step-up in both incentive dollars and the percentage rate in Q4 due to anticipated deal activity both domestic and
international, which should put us within our 2013 guidance range of 16% to 17%.
Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year adjusted results. This was
primarily due to higher costs associated with investments in our growth strategies. Marketing expenses were up 4%
from the prior year, and stepped up from the prior quarter as we increased marketing to support a number of
sponsorship campaigns, including the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in South America, and the 2014 Sochi Winter
Olympics.
Operating margin for the quarter was 61%, and is consistent with our current guidance. Our effective tax rate for Q3
was 33.2%. While higher than our full-year guidance of 30% to 32%, the year-to-date figure of 31% is tracking to that
range. Net income at $1.2 billion was up 16% over the prior-year adjusted results. Fully diluted EPS was $1.88 for the
quarter, up 20% over prior-year adjusted results. Stronger than anticipated revenue and more aggressive share
repurchases were key drivers, and as noted earlier, our full-year adjusted EPS guidance is now low 20%s. Capital
expenditures, $122 million in the quarter, and continue to be in line with our full-year expectations.
At the end of the June quarter, we had 645 million shares of class A common stock outstanding on an as-converted
basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the June quarter totaled 651 million.
Finally, in terms of guidance, other than our refinement of full-year 2013 revenue guidance to around 13% and adjusted
diluted earnings per share growth to low 20%s, all other outstanding guidance metrics for the full year fiscal 2013 and
2014 remain the same.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.

Charles W. Scharf
Thank you, Byron, and good afternoon, everyone. First of all, I just want to reiterate that we feel very good about our
performance this quarter. There's very little new news in the underlying revenue trends, as Byron has just described,
which means that we continue to see broad-based growth geographically and also by product, and these are at growth
rates consistent with what we've seen in prior quarters.
People often ask us about what we see in the economy and what I guess we can say is we don't see meaningful changes
to the path of the economic recovery. And while an accelerating and certainly a more broad-based recovery would be
beneficial to us and our clients, we do continue to feel very good about our business and our ability to deliver strong
results in the current economic environment.
We did host our Investor Day on June 6, and I want to thank all those who attended both physically and listened in. We
know it was a lengthy call, but hopefully you found it productive. We certainly appreciate all the feedback that we
received.
Just a couple of quick reminders of some of the important themes that we covered. First of all, we feel great about the
strong foundation that this company has been built on. There's been strong historical growth. We have great partners,
and the company has a tradition of innovation.
Second, the macro trends have and will continue to provide tailwinds. The opportunity to move transactions from cash
to electronic means is still huge, and we believe will be there for years to come. This is true in both the developed and
the developing parts of the world. And as we pointed out on Investor Day, we have 22% share PCE in the emerging –
I'm sorry, within the developed markets, and 9% in the emerging markets, so there's still much room to grow, in
addition to us growing along with the growth of PCE across the world.
We love our core network. It's served us well. We think it provides us tremendous opportunities to leverage and grow
our business. Historically, what's really benefited us has been the global acceptance, the network reliability, safety,
security and soundness, and our risk-related tools are just a huge value-added component to the network. While we
continue to build on these historical strengths, as we pointed out at the Investor Day, the future for us will be about
using the network as a tool to continue to create more value for issuers, acquirers and merchants. And that includes us
building broader capabilities, but also giving them access to our network as a device that connects them together.
Third, the company has and continues to make huge investments in the future. We walked through some of the
additional spending that's been done to the tune of an additional $700 million versus prior years which are, for the most
part, all geared towards growth opportunities.
And lastly, we talked about our evolving rules and practices. Recognizing how the payments world is evolving, we
recognized the need to evolve our company but we also feel strongly that we need to continue to preserve some core
principles. Those include the importance of the Visa brand, the safety, security and soundness of the payment system,
that we continue to protect and control our intellectual property, and that we enable clients of all sizes to compete. So in
short, these are things that, while we think we can continue to do more and more for all of our clients, we think these
things could also add value to the Visa network.
Let me turn now to a little bit of an update on some of the regulatory and litigation items that have both been in the
news and we've spoken about. First of all, in the United States, on the MDL case, the deadline for the opt-outs was May
28. As expected, I'm sure you saw lawsuits that were filed against Visa, MasterCard and, in some cases, the banks from
retailers which opted out of the merchant settlement agreement last year. The final figures are still being calculated, but
our estimate of the opt-outs is that they represent slightly above 25% of our U.S. credit volume. We continue to expect
approval from the court sometime in the fall.
I do want to stress that, these are proceedings that have been ongoing for a long period of time. We remain committed
to figuring out how to work with merchants of all sizes to resolve all of our differences amicably, and we, as you've

heard from us, are focused on finding new ways to work with them in conjunction with acquirers and issuers to support
all of the individual constituents' growth objectives.
Secondly, Canada. Yesterday Canada's Competition Tribunal issued its decision to dismiss the Competition Bureau's
case and uphold our No Surcharge and Honor All Cards rule. We have and we will continue to engage with legislators
and regulators around the world to promote the understanding of the value of electronic payments to consumers,
merchants and governments broadly.
Let me now turn to Europe. And as a reminder, Visa, Inc. and Visa Europe are separate, independent operating
companies. First of all, let me talk about in May we alerted you to a European Commission inquiry by the Director of
General Competition related to inter-regional credit interchange rates. That investigation specifically relates to the
interchange applied to transactions between a non-European Union cardholder and a merchant located within the
European Union. We continue to assess their claims, and we are working in a productive and professional manager
(sic) [manner] with them and hope to reach resolution, but there's nothing more to report at this time.
Separately, the European Commission earlier today released proposed legislation for the payments industry in the
European Union, which had been expected. The proposed legislation covers a wide range of topics related to the
European payments industry, including domestic and intra-E.U. cross-border interchange rates, co-badging
requirements, processing requirements and point of sale rules such as Honor All Cards. Most recent announcement
from the Commission appears to address issues similar to the Commission's competition case, but the proposed
regulation would only apply to transactions when the issuer and the acquirer are located in the European Union.
We understand the proposed legislation is the beginning of what we expect could be a long process which could take 18
months to 24 months. We'll continue to keep you updated if we learn of any more developments in either of these two
proceedings. Also in Europe, I'm sure we would get a question about the Visa Europe put and there is no update on
that.
Let me move now and just talk for a second about a topic which has – a lot of you were writing about and has gotten a
lot of press and that's tokenization. And I'll start with stating the obvious, which is we all know the transactions are
increasingly moving to digital card not present channels due to the growth of web commerce, mobile and digital
wallets. As you've heard from us in the past, we've been building our capabilities to deal with transactions like this,
both technically and through our rules and requirements. V.me and CyberSource are just two examples where we've
made significant investments to build capabilities in this space.
And as we talk about tokenization, I do want to just make the point that tokenization is not a new concept to us.
Historically, we defined the 16-digit account number and message set, and these effectively operate as tokens in the
payment system today. The reality is the development of digital commerce and related risk makes the evolution of
these existing tokens to a more secure form very necessary in a way that works both in the physical and the digital
worlds. We need to eliminate the flow of sensitive data that might be vulnerable to a breach, and new entrants into the
payment ecosystem has also brought into question whether the appropriate information will continue to flow between
merchant, acquirer, issuer and consumer.
And rightly so, the entire payments industry is focused on this. You read earlier this month about efforts that the
clearinghouse has underway with its 22 U.S. banks to do some work on this topic as well. We believe that we play a
critical role in helping define the standards for token implementation broadly. We're working closely across the entire
payments ecosystem, defined very broadly, to do this. This is an area where everyone needs to work closely together,
and it's paramount that we ensure transparency, security and integrity so that the integrity of the payment system
remains.
Successful tokenization initiatives must also be interoperable and standardized and do several very important things.
Number one is they need to deliver value to all stakeholders. That includes issuers, consumers, merchants, acquirers,
payment gateways and everyone involved in the digital commerce platform. It's got to be standard spaced, technology
agnostic, such that a tokenization solution builds on the existing open nature of the payments industry while also
aligning with emerging payment innovation such as mobile and digital wallets.

As I said before, it needs to deliver at least the same level as transparency and reliability that exists today. And equally
important, it needs to address the needs of everyone globally, not just in the United States. As I said before, we're
committed to working on this broadly with all of our partners. It's something we are working on, and we feel very good
about the progress that we're making with our partners on this one.
In conclusion, I just want to also talk about the repurchase program that Byron mentioned. It's the ninth share
repurchase program that the company has authorized. Since the IPO, our board of directors has authorized over 11
billion in share repurchase programs, and as we've talked about I think almost on every call and at the Investor Day
since I've joined, that we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders, both through repurchase programs
like this as well as further dividend increases. So, having been here for nine months, as I commented at Investor Day, I
remain more bullish as each day goes on when we look at the opportunities that exist in the industry and the assets, and
the ideas, and the people that we have at Visa.
So with that, Operator, Byron and I are ready to take any questions that are out there.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew Jeffrey>: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Charlie, could you speak broadly about
Visa's U.S. consumer credit share and how you feel you're positioned to expand share and continue above trend line
growth, especially as some of your competitors potentially are sharpening the pencil a little bit in the U.S.?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Sure. Listen, I think we're blessed with just an outstanding U.S. credit franchise, which has
been built-up through the years through terrific relationships for sure. We look at the partners that we have and look at
their performance and certainly our performance has been helped by their strong performance. And that's true both on
the issuer side as well as on the cobrand side. We've also been certainly beneficiaries in the United States credit market
as the affluent customer has recovered more quickly than the non-affluent customers, and as we look forward, a more
broad-based recovery is something, which should be additive to the affluent business that we have today.
Ultimately our ability to compete as effectively as we have within the United States revolves around all of the things
that we've been talking about here that we know we need to continue to build out. Those include what we're doing in
the digital space. They include what we're doing in the mobile space, as well as just the continuing to provide the
flexibility that we've talked about in terms of our core product set. So listen, – and I know from the prior role that I
played, the market has always been a competitive one. There have always been networks out there competing for the
same business. The pencils have been sharped for a period of time, and as we think about what we've got to do going
forward, we certainly expect that to continue.
Operator
Our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC. Your line is open.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: Thanks. I'm just interested to know, how important local market processing through DPS and
VPS is to you guys. From a long-term growth perspective, it does represent an important enhancer to the yield as
you've talked about. You highlighted it at the Analyst Day, and it seems to be kind of coming up, with some pros and
cons in various economies as you kind of outlined in your prepared remarks. So if you could just speak to that point, I'd
appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Yeah. Listen, I mean, as we talked about at Investor Day, processing, we think, the second
part of the equation that we can provide for our customers. When we process the transaction, when the transaction goes
over a network, we are enabled to – that gives us the opportunity to do all the things that we can do, both from a risk

perspective as well as being able to provide all the analytical information that we can provide back to the issuers in
order for them to help grow their business.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: And I would just add, the more we integrate into the processing pipeline, the more we have an
opportunity to differentiate our service offering. So in the case of DPS, this creates an opportunity for us to introduce
more innovative product services via mobile, as an example, and to add to form factors that expand the activation
capability or opportunity for our clients. So where we can provide processing services like DPS, which have the single
largest debit scale potentially outside of China, I suppose, this is an area where we can excel in delivering client
service.
Operator
Our next question comes from Donald Fandetti of the Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yes. Charlie, I was curious if there are any updates on the Visa-Chase network deal in terms
of timing? I think there was going to be some type of pilot or something by the end of the year. And then also I was
wondering if you have any sense on the scope of that initiative? Would it just be for merchants or transactions that are
acquired through Paymentech or could that be broaden to other merchants indirectly?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Okay. So on the first part of the question, I continue to say this, which is when it comes to
what Chase Merchant Service is doing, there are a series of questions that you need to ask them about. What we're
doing is providing the capabilities that we outlined several quarters ago. We are on schedule to deliver the ability for
CMS to be in the marketplace by the fourth quarter. What actually winds up in the marketplace is really driven by them
through their discussions with merchants. And, again, so that's a question for them. And the agreement holds that they
need to have a direct relationship with a merchant in order to take advantage of whatever it is they intend to provide
through CMS. And so, as I said, I would expect that sometime as we get into next year that we would start to see some
things in the marketplace. And at that point, we'll all be in a position to evaluate what we think the benefits of them are.
Operator
Our next question will come from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could give us an update on V.me,
specifically on merchant acceptance. It seems from my perspective that – haven't seen as broader acceptance I would
expect at this point. I think you had some concrete goals for the top 100 retailers by the end of this year. Is there an
acceleration coming? What's the issue? Is it difficult to get merchants to add V.me? And then in line with that, or along
those lines, MCX, is this something that you think potentially is a competitive threat? It seems to be getting a little bit
of momentum. And as V.me a key part of your strategy in combating merchant mobile wallets? Thanks.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: So let me start with V.me. You know, I guess when we talk about V.me, you can't – it's
hard to separate out how we're doing with issuers versus how we're doing with merchants because in our discussions
with each, we really need to have to grow both sides in order to be successful, right? As the chicken and the egg, which
is, merchants aren't going to – want to spend the time and the effort and the money to establish V.me on their site,
unless they think there's a real need for it, and the issuers are going to be careful about marketing it to their clients until
there's a meaningful amount of acceptance.
Having said that, we now have about 90 U.S. financial institutions as partners. They include BofA, PNC, BBVA, ICBA
and others, and some of those have started actively to market these programs. We have signed an additional 72
merchants this past quarter, bringing the total signed number of merchants to 253, many, many of which will go live in
the coming weeks and months. So there is a lot more coming here. There is a fairly significant pipeline of merchants.
As we continue to work with acquirers on this to get in the marketplace, we'll report back.

And MCX was the second question. Listen, I think MCX, we know what you know about MCX which is you might
know more than us. So our view on MCX is that we will learn as they continue to disclose what it is they're doing, and
we're focused on doing what we can to build the right kind of tools to work with merchants so that they want to do
business with us.

Our next question will come from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Great. Thanks. That was pretty clean. I guess I'll just ask about U.S. debit growth. That did
bounce back nicely to 12%. I was just looking at the 10-Q. It says Interlink process transactions were up 25%, and
those were running down pretty sharply, so that was a pretty big step-up. Curious, is that sustainable? And what's
driving it? Did you flip on some new cards? Or is it paved? Any detail there would be great. Thanks.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: So, Tien-tsin, remember, we're lapping the implementation of the Dodd-Frank, not supposed
to say Durbin anymore, Dodd-Frank rules which took effect April 1 of last year. So it was in that quarter that we
experienced the single largest negative growth rate in terms of Interlink volume. In fact, it was a 54% reduction in
payment volume growth in the June ending quarter 2012. And then in the coming quarters, as our strategies began to
gradually take hold, we started to see a less negative growth rate.
So one could deduce from that, that in terms of actual year-over-year growth rates, it's conceivable that this June ending
quarter might be high tide and then as we begin to lap the other quarters, the subsequent quarters, that the relative
growth rates have a tougher comp to deliver.
I'd also just like to underscore that there is no way we're going to recover all that market share that we have conceded
as a result of the legislative change, so I think that there will be – we still need a few more quarters in order to get to
some sort of normalized state, but as I said in my earnings commentary, in the subsequent quarters, we still expect
healthy growth rates in debit, but – to U.S. debit – but everything else being equal, they should moderate a bit as they
begin to lap the strategies we put into place which, in turn, had growing effectiveness as time passed.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: So let me just add to that. So the follow-up is, so we still think we have, from our
perspective, a business which can grow at a reasonable rate, understanding that we believe we've permanently lost
share because of legislation, and those two things can coexist.

Our next question will come from Glenn Green of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn Greene>: Thank you. Just regarding the E.U. proposal, I wanted to just get some context from you
regarding whether or not it's having any bearings on your discussions with Visa Europe regarding their potential to
exercise the put, as well as the negotiation of the specific terms, meaning has this been somewhat of a stumbling block
getting clarity on the E.U. proposal?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: I think you've got to ask – Visa Europe has a put, and so that means we don't have a call
and we can't even – we can't proactively engage them in a discussion on price or things like that. So what impacts
they're thinking relative to their desire to put the company, you really have to ask them. I mean, I think it's a
complicated set of circumstances. There's a lot going on in Europe right now, and I think you can make arguments
either way whether it makes – if you were sitting in their position, whether it would make you more willing or less
willing, but it's their decision, so they're the appropriate people to answer the question.

Our next question comes from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions. First, could you comment on
China? There seems to be some movement in terms of issuers being allowed to issue cards in China, some discussion
regarding processing. I was wondering if you could discuss if there's been any thawing of those discussions or your
thought process around timing of when the market might become open to you. Secondly, on incentives, like you said,
you got two quarters of benefit from the Chase deal in this quarter, I believe is what you said, but looking out to next
year, is it reasonable to believe that you could come in as a percentage of gross revenue below the bottom end of this
year's guidance due to the new arrangement? Or are other clients increasing and, therefore, that's a false assumption?
Thanks.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Why don't I start with China, and unfortunately, there's still not a lot of new news to talk
about with China. The agreement with the WTO requires China to issue regulations by the end of July to open up the
domestic market to foreign competition. From what we've seen, there have been some very small incremental things
announced by the Chinese government, but they have not been clear as we read the information to lay out a road map to
open up the domestic marketplace. So we're waiting with everyone else until that happens. We have no better idea than
anyone else what form that will take, what time period, the opportunity for us, in what time period that opportunity
would evolve. And so there's not a lot there.
Now having said that, we're still in the same place with we feel – from a long-term perspective, putting aside whether
it's one quarter, four quarters or eight quarters away, the opportunity to compete in the domestic marketplace in China,
with the capabilities that we have, we think could be significant over a long period of time. Unfortunately, we still don't
know what the time period is and what the requirements to participate will be.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Over to incentives, you ask an interesting question. There's clearly two forces at work here,
one of which is the Chase contract where the pricing has been restructured so that it is more per transaction. There are
still incentives related to the contract but not nearly at the magnitude that they were pre-contract. At the same time, the
vast majority of our issuers are in growth mode with their portfolios. The larger they grow their portfolios, the more
incentives we pay, and that has been our business model for decades. And so as is our practice, we will schedule those
out over the next coming – next two months. We will also take a hard look at what contracts are likely to renew in the
coming year, which also weighs into that calculation, and then give you a report out in October.
Let me just signal, in the spirit of your question, that it's best to, in our view, it is best to model incentives on a full year
basis, recognizing that they can have a lot of variation between quarters, and as I said in my earnings remarks, in Q4,
we expect an above average level of deal activity as we move to the closing out of our fiscal year, and, therefore, we
expect a higher percent – incentives as a percent of gross revenue, and you should not consider that representative of
the go-forward trend.

Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan of Janney. Your line is open.
<Q - Thomas C. McCrohan>: Hi. Thanks a lot, thanks for taking the questions. Just a quick question on
card-not-present given the growth in e-commerce. How much of Visa's volume today is card-not-present e-commerce
volume? And is the revenue yield on those type of transactions the same as for transactions that are card present?
Thanks.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Good question. That's not something that we have decided to speak about publicly at this
point. Inevitably, though, I think that's something that we will be talking about much more in the future since that is the
fastest growing channel that we have, and by way of form factor, within form factor, the fastest growing factor is
mobile, and the two of them clearly are linked. So I would say we're short on detail today but more to come in the
future.

Our next question will come from Moshe Katri of Cowen. Your line is open.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Hey, thanks. Byron, can you talk a bit about credit in the U.S.? Maybe compare what you're
seeing on the corporate side versus on the consumer side of the business, and if there were any changes during the
quarter?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: I would say that in terms of health, the corporate side is healthy, but the factors that are fueling
the really strong performance we've been experiencing in consumer credit are – constitute more of a tailwind. When we
look across the corporate spend, a lot of that has to do with the degree of recovery in the economies across the globe.
Our view is that the recovery, this is a technical term, is sluggish, which is one step above anemic, and given that
enthusiastic description, the very fact that we are seeing positive growth in corporate spend on cards in categories like
airlines and the T&E components we view as encouraging.
Having said that, there is for us, in our view, a significant opportunity to further penetrate the commercial sector. We
have invested significantly in our commercial information platforms that support that part of the business with our
commercial clients, and we believe with the investments we've made in our IntelliLink platform that we are well
positioned to experience meaningful growth in this market segment in years to come.

Our next question will come from Arvind Ramnani of BNP. Your line is open.
<Q - Arvind A. Ramnani>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Good quarter. I just had a quick question on your –
clearly the affluent has come back, but what are your assumptions for continued growth from the affluent market? And
also what's your view on the non-affluent market?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: So, the affluent part of our portfolio really has been the driver of the credit spend that we have
been reporting over the past year. In the last quarter or two, we are starting to see some participation from the next
income cohort down, but it is not yet significant, and therefore it's not a material driver in our results to-date.
As we look out into the coming year, when I described the economic – underlying economic growth as sluggish, if I
were to relate that to the U.S. creating 200,000 jobs a month, which is kind of the minimum to make any progress
against unemployment, we would describe that as not anemic but as sluggish growth and – but it is creating new jobs
and those new jobs ultimately translate into spend and so our outlook is that the non-affluent spend will contribute
more, but not significantly more to the payment volume spend in the coming year. That's how we're thinking about it.
And when we gave our guidance for 2014, the limited guidance at this point, that was the assumptions that underpinned
the growth rates we expressed.

Our next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Smitti Srethapramote>: Great. Thank you. International revenue growth was strong in relation to cross-border
volume growth. Can you talk about the drivers behind that? And how much of a lift did you guys get from a mix shift
towards tighter yielding geographies?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Yeah. So I would say there's a little bit of mix. There's a lot of volatility. So whenever there
is significant volatility in the currency markets, that translates into higher international revenue for us. That's something
that can be – can appear in one quarter and disappear the next relative to whatever an average volatility is. We have
been seeing, with the strengthening of the dollar, the volatility in the Australian dollar, Japanese yen to a lesser extent,
the euro and the sterling, the turbulence in those markets is really – and the associated volatility is the principal driver

Our next question comes from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay, great. Hey, just a two-part question about Europe. So if you were a network
competing in the vast majority of Europe, what do you like and not like about the EC's regulatory proposals that have
recently been released? And do – the second part of the question is, is there any worry that Europe's regulatory moves
might fuel merchants to push for regulation in other countries such as the U.S. and/or emerging countries?
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: Yeah. Again, so this is our view if we were Europeans, which we are certainly not. I guess
when we read it, the things that we like about it are I guess first of all, there's recognition in the value of interchange.
We can argue about what that number is. But we've heard lots of things through the years about whether interchange
should exist or not exist in some parts of the world and recognition that it belongs, is a statement in itself. And certainly
I put No Surcharge into that category as well. And then the thing I would say which straddles both sides, the good and
the bad, is level playing field. And so hard networks that operate both three party and four party models fall into both
sides of the camp. So on the one hand, it's a positive thing to bring some parts of their business into this level playing
field, but the fact is there's still a meaningful part of the marketplace that there's just, you can argue an unfair advantage
has been given and doesn't actually solve whatever the underlying regs are supposed to solve.
The second thing I would put in the negative category is co-badging, and the third thing I would put is this – the
splitting of processing from the brand. And second part of Rod's question was?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Will it metastasize to other areas of the world.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: And I think it is, the whole world, the world's a big place but everyone sees what everyone
else does for sure. So people have seen what happened here in the U.S. on debit. We've seen Australia. They've been
watching Canada. They've been watching Europe. So it certainly you have to believe that when one significant part of
the world does something that the other part of the world looks at it. In this case remember this is a – this is proposed
legislation. It will take several years for comments and for it to work through its process. So the things that have been
decided here as best I can tell are not set in stone, and we'll see how these things actually evolve in the marketplace.

Our next question will come from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is open.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Yeah. Hey, guys. Just looking at the 10-Q, rest of world revenue, not just the international
line, but actual but rest of world revenue was up 24% this quarter. The last four it was up about 10% to 14%, and I
think the explanation of some FX volatility probably helped on the cross-border part of that. But it was a pretty big
acceleration, maybe you can talk through maybe a couple of other reasons that, that also accelerated so much.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: There are two reasons that matter. You hit the first one, which is the boost in international is
reflected. We booked that into the rest of world line. And the second, if you recall, when I mentioned that the 17%
revenue growth for the quarter benefited from significant nonrecurring incentives, that brought the growth rate down by
several percentage points if you were to exclude those. All of those significant nonrecurring incentives were outside the
United States. So they had the effect of amplifying the growth rate of rest of world. And those are the two main drivers.

<Q - Jamie E. Friedman>: Hi. Quick question on EMV. It looks like we're about 18 months from the deadline set in
2015. Are you seeing banks accelerate the issuance of EMV cards ahead of the deadlines? And any comments on EMV
with regard to merchant acceptance would be interesting. Thank you.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: We certainly hear a fair amount being discussed about it, and we also have I think more
issuers in the United States issuing chip cards due to the importance of making for an easy acceptance experience when
people travel outside the United States. I don't have the numbers in terms of the amount of EMV cards that are being
issued today. It is bigger than it's been, but it's not the – by any stretch of the imagination, the majority of the cards yet.
But I did read something recently that suggested that the percentage of issuers that are intending to do it is growing, but
I don't think we know any more than that today. And on the merchant side, I would say it's a similar conversation with
the exception being to the extent that machines in merchants' facilities have to be replaced. They appear to be being
replaced with machines that will accept the new form of card.
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Brad, at this point we have time for one last question.
Operator
Our last question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks, guys. Just want to jump in. Year-to-date we're clearly seeing a more meaningful
margin expansion for this year, again, versus what we saw in the prior-year, or really prior year or two. Average
margins for the first three quarters are around 62.5%. So really more than a 100 basis points expansion year-over-year.
Is there anything unique about the year's quarterly revenues or maybe the operating leverage in the model in the past
quarter? Is that shouldn't repeat? Or is there something that we can expect this type of a margin upside just from
through operating leverage embedded in the model?
<A - Byron H. Pollitt>: Let me respond to that in two ways. First of all, I just want to anchor the group back into the
guidance for 2013, since we're talking margins, and you began with year-to-date. So we held our guidance at around
60% operating margin, which implies, the math implies that the year-to-date is trending higher than what we would
expect for the fourth quarter, which is why we kept it at around 60%, so point one.
Point two, there is fundamental operating leverage in the business as you know. We have been very consistent in that,
we don't solve for operating margins. We don't have targets. We don't have internal requirements. What we do solve for
are investments that drive shareholder value. It is the nature of our business that many of those investments are expense
versus capital, and, therefore, as we continue to ramp up the investments that support our growth strategies, it is – they
often carry a significant expense component to them and would immediately put downward pressure on the margins.
And I think it's safe to say that, that philosophy of investing for growth and value both today and tomorrow is a
philosophy we intend to follow. And that if that means some sacrifice of theoretically higher margins, we're fully
prepared to do that in the name of shareholder value.
<A - Charles W. Scharf>: And let me just add one more thing to that, which is, as has been pointed out by bunch of
you and also on this call is, we do operate in a competitive marketplace. And it wouldn't be right for our long-term
shareholder interests to be thinking about how our services should be priced based upon a commitment that we would
make to you all to continue to increase the margin levels that we have. We have to look at each transaction and say,
how does the market price those transactions? What value do we think we're providing? And have the ability to
compete effectively if we think it makes sense. And so that all gets factored into the guidance that's given.
John R. Carsky
And with that, we want to thank you all for joining us here today. And if anybody has follow-up questions, please feel
