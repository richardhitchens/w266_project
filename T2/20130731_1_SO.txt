Tom will open today's call with an update on regulatory activities, as well as the latest on the construction of Plant
Vogtle Unit 3 and Unit 4, and the Kemper County IGCC project. Art will then provide an overview of our second
quarter financial results, as well as the discussion on sales and the economy, and a brief update of our financing plans.
After closing remarks from Tom, we'll move to Q&A.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.
Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our company continued to excel at its longstanding mission of providing
clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to the customers and communities we serve and our 26,000 employees
remain committed to the customer focus philosophy that has been the firm foundation of our company's first 100 years.
Throughout our business, we are developing innovative solutions to the energy challenges that confront our region and
our nation. We also continue through our traditional operating companies to engage constructively with elected and
appointed officials at all levels of government. In fact, all of our operating companies have significant state regulatory
activity in progress during 2013. Here's a summary: Alabama Power completed a series of informal hearings two weeks
ago to review the rate stabilization and equalization or RSE rate setting process. These hearings included constructive
engagement by the Public Service Commissioners, staff, interveners and the public. We believe that Alabama Power
demonstrated that its return on total invested capital is fair and reasonable and served its customers' long-term interests.
We expect to learn the results of this review later this summer.
Georgia Power had arguably the busiest calendar for the year with three major regulatory filings. First, Georgia Power
filed its integrated resource plan in February, which was recently approved by the Public Service Commission. This
was an important step forward in affirming Georgia Power's plans for complying with the Mercury and Air Toxics
Standards or MATS rule. Included in the PSC ruling was the decertification of approximately 2100 megawatts of older
coal generation units and fuel switching for another 1400 megawatts. Second, Georgia Power filed its 8th Vogtle
Construction Monitoring or VCM report in February and it's currently in hearings regarding its request. Georgia Power
is seeking approval for actual costs of $209 million incurred from July through December of 2012.
As yet another demonstration of our constructive regulatory environment, Georgia Power entered into a stipulation with
the PSC staff today to waive the requirement to amend the certified cost during construction. This agreement, which is
subject to PSC approval, recognizes that the VCM process already addresses the verification and approval of actual
expenditures every six months. This stipulation also avoids the debating of issues that may be pertinent to Georgia
Power's ongoing commercial dispute with the Vogtle Unit 3 and Unit 4 contractors. The decision, which will now only
address actual costs through December 2012, is scheduled for October 15.
Third: Georgia Power has proposed a three-year rate plan and has asked to increase states' base rates by $482 million
with a one-time increase in January 2014. Hearings are scheduled to be held in October and November with a decision
by the Georgia PSC scheduled for December 17.
Meanwhile Gulf Power has filed for a base rate increase of $74 million. These rates would become effective in April of
2014. We currently expect hearings to conclude in December with a decision in the first quarter of 2014.
Finally, at Mississippi Power a hearing has been scheduled for October 1 to address the seven-year rate plan for
Kemper County IGCC. As a reminder this rate plan will cover the cost of the facility for the first seven years of
operation consistent with the settlement agreement we reached with the Mississippi PSC in January of this year. Finally
I'd like to give you an update on our Vogtle and Kemper County projects.
First, Plant Vogtle. Our progress at Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Unit 4 remained strong with more than 50% of construction
now complete. Since our last earnings call the Unit 3 containment vessel bottom head has been set and wall structures
have taken shape throughout the nuclear island. The Unit 3 containment vessel lower ring is more than 75% complete

and the middle ring is more than 40% complete.
Meanwhile at Unit 4, the nuclear island waterproofing and mud mat activities were completed and the installation of
basemat rebar is progressing well, applying lessons learned from the same activity conducted for Unit 3. Assembly of
the Unit 4 containment vessel bottom head is also complete. Outside of the nuclear islands work is proceeding on the
turbine building foundation, cooling tower structures and water intake structure. And modifications are being made to
existing switchyard and transmission equipment.
Upcoming major milestones expected to be completed in the fourth quarter include the setting of the Unit 3 auxiliary
building module also known as CA-20, and the placement of the first nuclear concrete in the Unit 4 nuclear island.
Vogtle remains a great value to Georgia Power's customers. Recall that our original estimate was for a 12% rate
increase for capital cost related to Vogtle Unit 3 and Unit 4. However, taking into account all the benefits that have
been realized since certification, that estimate has been reduced to a range between 6% and 8%. As well, the remaining
annual increases are expected to be less than 1% per year.
Meanwhile, construction at the Kemper County energy facility is also progressing well. Since our last earnings call, the
lignite mine has been placed into service and the final heavy lift as well as a significant portion of the startup activities
for the combined cycling units have been completed. Recognizing that piping is a key area of focus at this stage of the
project it's important to note that 90% of the piping has been fabricated and almost half is installed and that we have
been achieving our key installation targets for steel and pipe.
Looking ahead for the remainder of 2013, startup activities include the first fire of the first combustion turbine in late
August, sinking the steam turbine to the grid in October and heating up the first gasifier by year end. Our May 14
in-service date to which our construction startup plans are tied remains achievable.
Yesterday afternoon Mississippi Power filed its latest project update with the Mississippi Public Service Commission.
This update reflects the result of the most recent review of project activities and costs which included input from
additional industry construction specialists. The result of this review is an increase of $450 million to the project
completion estimate, which is reflected in the financial results we released this morning.
About half of this increase is for expected cost to achieve the schedule, which is centered on two key dates, the first
gasifier heat-up in late December and the in-service date of May 2014. About 30% of the increase is related to changes
in materials, and the remaining 20% is related to additional project contingency. As a reminder, we are honoring our
commitments to Mississippi Power's customers and regulators and are not seeking recovery of plant costs above the
$2.88 billion cost cap, net of DOE grants and exceptions to the cost cap.
While productivity, startup and systems integration remain the most significant risk to the cost estimate and schedule,
the Kemper project team remains focused on executing our plans and safely completing this facility to provide
Mississippi Power's customers a clean, safe, reliable and affordable generation resource for decades to come.
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. In the second quarter of 2013, we earned $0.34 per share, compared to $0.71 per share in the second
quarter of 2012, a decrease of $0.37 per share. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, we earned $0.43 per share,
compared to $1.14 per share for the same period in 2012, a decrease of $0.71 per share.
Our results for the second quarter 2013 include an after-tax charge against earnings of $278 million, or $0.32 per share,
related to the increased cost estimates for construction of the Kemper project. Recall that for the first quarter of 2013,
we announced a similar after-tax charge of $333 million, or $0.38 per share. This brings the total of after-tax charges
related to the Kemper project to $611 million or $0.70 per share for the six months ended June 30, 2013.
As explained previously, Mississippi Power will not seek recovery of estimated costs to complete the facility above the
$2.88 billion cost cap net of DOE grants and exceptions to the cost cap.

Year-to-date 2013 also included an after tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leverage
lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Also affecting year-over-year comparisons is a $21 million or
$0.02 per share of an insurance recovery related to the 2009 litigation settlement with MC Asset Recovery LLC
recorded during the second quarter of 2012. Excluding these items, earnings for the second quarter of 2013 were $0.66
per share, compared with $0.69 per share for the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of $0.03 per share.
Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2013, excluded these items – excluding these items were $1.15 per share,
compared with $1.12 per share for the same period in 2012, an increase of $0.03 per share.
The primary driver for our second quarter results was milder than expected weather, resulting in a decrease of $0.04 per
share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Weather was actually $0.03 per share below normal compared with $0.01 per
share above normal for the same period a year ago. As a point of interest, the second quarter of 2013 featured the
seventh highest level of rainfall in the past 50 years across all of Georgia and Alabama. While this lowered
temperatures and contributed negatively to our earnings, it also enabled us to increase hydroelectric generation by more
than 400% compared to the second quarter of 2012. Including the results of the first quarter, this has the – this has
resulted in fuel cost savings for customers of approximately $70 million this year, further evidence of the significant
value provided to our customers by a truly diverse generation portfolio. A more detailed summary of our
quarter-over-quarter drivers is included in the slide deck.
Turning now to a discussion of our economic outlook for the remainder of the year. Earlier this month we reengaged
with our economic round table participants. As a reminder, this group consists of several regional economists and
executives from a handful of our largest customers. The group agreed that the national economic recovery is advancing,
but at a very slow pace. GDP in the first quarter grew at 1.8% and estimates indicate that growth in the second quarter
was likely less than 1.5%. GDP growth in the second half of 2013 meanwhile is expected to be in the 1.5% to 2%
range, becoming slightly higher than that in 2014. Economic uncertainty continues to hinder the recovery, with
businesses focusing on issues such as global economic health, costs associated with the Affordable Care Act and U.S.
fiscal and monetary policy.
We believe that all of these issues are affecting electricity usage among all three of Southern Company's customer
categories. The round table participants also reaffirmed, however, that the southeast is once again on track to outpace
the national recovery, with the state of Georgia setting the pace. In our region's commercial and residential sectors, real
estate developers and retailers are more upbeat based on consistent sales levels, increased construction activity and
upward pressure on land and property pricing.
Industrial customers, meanwhile, have had a somewhat more tempered outlook on the second half of 2013, driven by
the recent slowing of exports and cautious inventory management. However, there is good news in certain segments
with auto production shifting from Asia to the U.S. and increased reshoring activity in appliances and textiles.
In terms of retail sales results for 2013, year-to-date weather-normal sales for all customer classes reflect a decline of
0.7% versus 2012. Adjusted for the leap year effect, overall sales growth is essentially flat.
Focusing on the second quarter, total weather-normal retail sales decreased 0.5% when compared with the same period
in 2012.
Industrial sales grew 0.6% for the second quarter of 2013, compared to the second quarter of 2012. Of our top eight
segments representing more than 70% of second quarter industrial sales, six reflected positive growth. Perhaps more
importantly, seven of the eight reflected better year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 2013 than they did in the
first quarter, even when adjusting for the leap year effect. Segments exhibiting the highest growth during the second
quarter were primarily in the housing related segments, such as textiles at 4.2%, lumber at 12.2% and stone, clay and
glass at 5.9%.
Residential sales declined 0.5% and commercial sales declined 1.6% during the second quarter of 2013 on a
weather-normal basis, compared with the second quarter of 2012. From an economic development standpoint, the
positive momentum of last year has carried over into 2013, as the southeast continues to be successful in attracting new

industry.
The state of Georgia, for instance, is bringing in manufacturing, distribution and new corporate headquarters as well as
Communications, IT, and Life Sciences industries. PulteGroup, a construction company, and PointClear Solutions, a
bioscience firm, are relocating their headquarters to Atlanta, while General Motors, InfoSystems, Ernst & Young and
athenahealth are all bringing well-paying IT jobs to Atlanta.
Georgia is also bringing new film studios into the state with the help of tax incentives. For instance, Mediant Studios is
building a studio complex outside of Savannah and is expected to create 1200 jobs, while Pinewood Shepperton plc, the
producer of the James Bond series, is building a $1 billion movie studio near Atlanta. According to the Institute of
Supply Management, 19 states are leading the U.S. manufacturing resurgence and Alabama and Mississippi are
amongst those at the top.
As expressed recently by the Chairman of Airbus Americas, Alabama puts forth an exceptional and well-coordinated
effort in locating new industries such as Airbus, Austal, Mercedes-Benz and ThyssenKrupp, just to name a few. This
focus on economic development is basic to our DNA across all of our traditional operating companies, as we continue
to work together to encourage economic growth for our region.
Moving now to an update of our financing plan for 2013, we have so far this year issued $1.4 billion of debt securities
with an average life of 19 years, and an average rate of 3.1%. Our plans include issuing another $2 billion of debt by
year end.
Turning now to our equity issuances, factoring in the updated Kemper cost estimates, we have updated our financing
plan to include approximately $520 million for the remainder of 2013, and approximately $600 million in 2014. We
plan to begin issuing new shares through our employee and dividend reinvestment plans in August, shortly after filing
our second quarter 10-Q. We should be well positioned relative to our long-term equity ratio of approximately 44% by
year end 2014. Our industry-leading financial integrity and A credit ratings continue to be priorities for us, as they have
served our customers and investors so well for years. Now I'd like to share our earnings estimate for the third quarter of
2013, which will be $1.13 per share.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thanks, Art. As our business environment evolves, Southern Company remains the same, an enterprise that succeeds
by exceling at the fundamentals and relying on the knowledge, skills and dedication of our people. As always, we
continue to focus on the long term with customers at the center of everything we do. This enables us to deliver
excellent value drivers including a commitment to industry-leading financial integrity, regular, predictable sustainable
growth and earnings per share and likewise dependable dividend growth.
We are now ready to take your questions. So, Operator, we'll now take the first question.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please
proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Good afternoon, guys. First question is on near-term, long-term earnings aspirations. I know that
you guys expect GDP growth to be better in the second half. What can/would you do if we get into, deep into the third
quarter and we're still seeing economic conditions below your expectations? Do you have the ability to manage your

cost profile such that we could still be comfortable with this year's earnings guidance?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, I believe so.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah. Greg, we kind of looked at the sensitivities around that. Of course, weather in the first
half was less than what we expected to be and we flexed around O&M to offset some of that. As we look at the end of
the year, if I were to assume that we would get no loan growth through the remainder of this year. The O&M flex is
actually less than what the O&M flex would be last year in terms of our ability to move around that.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Last year we made up $0.11 of negative weather I think...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: About 7.5% reduction in on-field O&M from what we had planned.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Right. So we feel confident.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. And then, longer term, is there a reason why your earnings per share growth rate slide is
not in this deck, as it was in the first quarter, where you were targeting 4% to 6% long-term growth off 2013?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No. Not really. Let's just kind of lay out what we do know. So, if you lay out the equity
issuances, that Art described, kind of year-by-year dilutive impact of that this year is like $0.015, next year is like
$0.025 and the third year is $0.02 cumulatively that's $0.015, $0.04, $0.06. That's our best guess at this point. Okay.
Outside of that we've got all of these – as I described in detail, we have all of these regulatory proceedings going and
you know that the outcome of the Georgia hearings are really important to our forward – earnings forecast. So, we are
very confident in our forecast for the year, the earnings range we described, and as has been our practice and everything
else, once we get a little more clarity on these rate regulatory issues, we will cover long-term guidance as we always,
do in our January call.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. So when I look at the financing and the CapEx plans, which you have alluded to here,
we're $1 billion dollars higher over the next three years, relative to the deck that you showed us on the Q4 call. And it
looks like the majority of that is in generation. And I'm presuming that the vast majority of that's Kemper?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's correct.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. But you're also somewhat higher on T&D, which obviously gives rate-based growth, so
that's positive. And there were some other small things. But it looks like the vast majority, is the generation, right?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's it.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay, thank you very much, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Of course there are swing factors, yes, and the other swing factors will be how active we
are at Southern Power.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Correct.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Right. Oh yes, that was my – last part of the question was and those Southern Power numbers are
to some degree place-holders for opportunistic, transactions to either build or acquire assets, is that right?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Perfect, that's it.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Got it, thank you, guys.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hi, Tom. Real quickly, following a little bit on Greg's question about Southern Power, how
much of that CapEx, the $2.4 billion or so, is actually spoken for at this point?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, we've got – we just closed the deal early, I guess, in the first quarter on Campo Verde.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Right.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And the amount of total investment there is about $450 million. So, there will be some
equity allocated to that. But the rest are still placeholders and we're actively working on other projects, but we're not in
the position to make any statements at this time.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You know that our practice – our practice is to only announce stuff when it's basically
done. We're close on some things, but we'll only announce that when we have clarity.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Understood. But it's an area where if you wanted to, if projects didn't meet the return
hurdles compared to some of the regulated businesses you can alternatively invest in, you could ratchet down CapEx
from this number at Southern Power pretty quickly?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure. The other issue is, as with all of our companies we have maintenance requirements,
which requires capital et cetera. But you're right, to the extent, we want to ratchet back capital at Southern Power that is
absolutely at our discretion.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And is there anything in the incremental CapEx in the new generation line, incremental
related to Vogtle?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. Thanks. Thanks guys, much appreciate it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Capital.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi Angie, how are you?
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So I might have missed it, but how do you
incorporate the impact of those write-downs of Kemper County on your equity needs? And should I worry about a
potential increase in dilution if those write-downs were to occur again?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Angie, that was what I laid out when I was talking with Greg. The annual diluted
impacts of the actions we've taken to date are $0.015 in 2013, $0.025 in 2014 and $0.02 more in 2015 that relates to the
timing of the issuance of the equity, okay?
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Yes, but that assumes that there no additional write-downs? Why didn't – you haven't really
started the gasifier yet and isn't that the most crucial portion of the IGCC plant?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's right. Let me just repeat though just to be very clear with everybody. I gave you
individual years in the aggregate – to give you the aggregate effects it is $0.015 in 2013 aggregate $0.04, aggregate
$0.06 in 2014 and 2015. And you are right so we believe we have taken action including adding $100 million to
contingency, most of that is related to the start-up and you are correct the most important issues going forward really

move away for materials to the start-up processes. And when we talk about meeting schedule it is important for us to
highlight two guideposts, if you will, two milestones. Obviously, the endpoint is targeted in-service date, May of 2014.
The most important milestone prior to that then will be achieving first fire in the gasifier, which we expect to achieve
by year-end 2013.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. Great. Separately, could you tell us anything about Alabama? I mean, I see that you
are showing a projected decision but is there a possibility for a settlement maybe some agreement on shedding some of
the ROE and increasing your equity ratios?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The words we used were very intentional. When you look at Alabama's return on total
invested capital, taking into account equity ratios, embedded cost of capital, they have one of the most attractive debt
balance sheets off of the benefit of their customers in the utility industry. We think that they're in a very fair position.
Rather than guess at what the commission might do, let's wait and see. We think we'll get some clarity reasonably soon
there.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. And my last question is what's going with the legal dispute with Shaw?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, recall, Shaw was purchased by Chicago Bridge & Iron, and the dispute really goes to
the consortium, which is Westinghouse, Chicago Bridge & Iron, and the leader of consortium is Toshiba. Okay? I can't
give you much of an update except to say this. We could settle that shortly or it could get into a prolonged mode and go
to litigation, in which case it would just be whenever the litigation is concluded; might take some time. I will say that
we think that the acquisition of Shaw by Chicago Bridge & Iron was positive in terms of our ability to negotiate and
resolve that dispute. But in terms of giving you any further clarity as to amounts or timing, we're really not in a position
to do that.
I'll say one more thing. The decision by the Georgia – the stipulation essentially we've reached with the staff and we
think the soon to be approval of the Georgia Public Service Commission with respect of eliminating the need for the
recertification process. They recognize as one of the important factors is that they don't want to get issues like that in
front of our ability to negotiate successfully with the consortium. All of this I think is constructive.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Great, thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Thank you, Angie.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Ali, how are you?
<Q - Ali Agha>: Hey. Tom, how are you doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Great. Just to be clear on the stipulation. So if I understood you correctly you have said that you will
withdraw your request to certify the increase in the construction cost, is that what you're saying in that stipulation?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, there is two factors that I think people recognize. When you consider the
effectiveness of the VCM process that is essentially a process whereby the commission evaluates and reviews and
approves, six months' worth of construction on some lagged basis, it's typically lagged six months. So in essence, right
now in front of the commission our costs related to July 2012 to December of 2012. We will hear their decision in
October. This is the eighth time we've been through Vogtle Construction monitoring process. We think it's working
exceedingly well. They have an independent monitor, Dr. Bill Jacobs and that process is going exceedingly smoothly
and we feel like that process is essentially belt and suspenders were you to layer on top of that, another process to

recertify the plant. So, what we've decided, what we've stipulated to, shall we say, is eliminate the need to recertify, just
let the VCM processes work, so there will be VCM 8, 9, 10 and so on, until the conclusion of the project. We feel like
that accomplishes the same thing, in terms of evaluating costs. And, of course, the other thing I just mentioned was you
don't want to get issues out in front of the negotiation in terms of being able to resolve successfully the commercial
dispute.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Right, but to be clear then so what you are saying, Tom, is that both any extra cost that you incur as
well as any delays that you may incur is that still – I mean your sense is that through the VCM assuming they approve
it, that should implicitly approve any cost overruns etcetera?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, and I would – and here again, I'm just going to pick a little bit. I wouldn't call those
cost overruns. I know there are increases in cost, but remember the math here originally we were at 12% associated
with the capital cost of Vogtle 3 and 4, now we think we are between 6% and 8%. The remaining annual price increases
that we expect to complete Vogtle 3 and 4 less than 1% a year. The $381 million largely increases in cost that are
associated with changing the schedule as we have are largely not exclusively but largely associated with our own
required oversight cost. Recall that the brick and mortar cost of Vogtle 3 and 4 over this period has only increased
0.5%. So, we think all of these things work exceptionally well. And any of this increase the $381 million will not cause
an increase in rates to customers. So, we think the VCM process is going to handle this exceptionally well and we don't
really need to go through the recertification that was originally contemplated.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. Secondly, just to clarify as you walk through the math on the equity issuance that you now
factored into your plan and the $0.06 of dilution through 2015. So, when we factored that in, does that still keep you on
that 4% to 6% EPS growth rate, or does everything ratchet down by that $0.06 is the way we should be thinking about
this?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So the question that we will address in January that I mentioned before, there is a lot in
front of us right now in a state regulatory plate, if you will, and, obviously, the biggest issue there is Georgia's triennial
rate case. The second probably biggest right now will be the Alabama decision; of course, a bit is related to the Gulf
decision, and of course, we have the ongoing process in Mississippi. I think it's best for us all to understand, if we're
talking about $0.015 and another $0.025 in 2014, I mean that all feels very manageable to me, but what we've got to do
rather than try and reassess long-term growth rates is let's let these processes go through, we'll give you a lot more
clarity once we know how we end up in all four of our jurisdictions at the end of this year. This is just a big regulatory
year for us.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Understood. Last question, Tom, looking at Kemper today with all the information and the extra
roughly $1 billion of cost, is that project still as attractive to you as you thought it would be going in frankly given
where we are today?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The honest – let me split that into two answers. Is it attractive to Mississippi's customers,
if we honor – as we honor the regulatory settlement that we reached, it has the economics of a nuclear plant; relatively
high capital cost, very cheap energy. It's exceedingly attractive in that respect. Is it attractive to Southern shareholders?
No. We are taking a hit here. We understand that, nobody here is happy about that, but that's the honest truth.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your
question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Hi, Tom. Just a clarification on the equity issuance plans. So, at the beginning of the year I
think you guys had ranges of zero to $300 million a year. Should we kind of assume that you are now kind of doing the
$300 million for both 2013, 2014, and then adding another $700 million essential for Kemper?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, I think that's – Steve, this is Art. I think that's fair. I think if you go back to where we
were – the way we think about, we kind of wipe out zero to $300 million now. We're taking into account the needs for
equity capital at Mississippi and possible equity capital needed for Southern Power and that's what the new numbers
represent.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And we have already suggested we've done Campo Verde which is $450 million there.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Southern Power.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. So, I guess, obviously tie-in is that reflecting more confidence that you are going to
do the Southern Power projects or is it more just wanting to kind of have extra balance sheet strength given all the stuff
going on?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, there's some placeholders out there that we are providing for but it is also supply
thing. When you go out and raise equity capital you can't just turn it off. So, it's – unless you shut down your program.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And I think we are conservative. So, I think it is a conservative estimate.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then I apologize, just on clarifying the Georgia stipulation.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: So, you would still do the annual reviews of six-month cost but the full recertification of the
project with updated data, you would not do?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, essentially eliminate, waive the rule.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Waive the rule to do the full recertification and that's from here on in; that's not just this
time?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right and just let the VCM process work. Everybody is happy with I think the way
that works out. There is one nuance. And I am actually glad you raised the question again because – remember in VCM
8, normally it is a six month process and because we were going to do recertification and all that other stuff, we
extended the timeframe what was it, from August into October.

And so, what we are going to do on – that would give you either an overlap or a contracted period for VCM 9. What we
are essentially going to do is roll VCM 9 and 10 together. So, we will probably make some filing around VCM 9, but
that will go through the evaluation of that cost along with the filing associated with VCM 10. So, imagine, if you will, 9
and 10 being rolled together. Then we'll be back on this six-month cycle.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And do – just do other parties to the case kind of agree with this? I know we just
filed today, but do you expect there will be opposition to this settlement? Or do you think everyone will agree?

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your
question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Hi. That last question Steve asked was what I was going to ask. So I'm going to follow
that up with, there has been some noise in the local press about the governor talking about potential sharing of
additional costs of Vogtle. Could you have any comment on that, Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Absolutely. We've been in contact with the governor about that. Actually, look, the
governor has been resolute in his support of this project. We think that quote that has been widely reported, probably
over-reported in our view, was taken out of context. The quote that people are referring to was him responding to what
something somebody else said, and there were statements after that quote. It really relates to he think Georgia Power is
doing a terrific job at the project and the project is great. The State of Georgia is proud to help lead the renaissance, a
variety of other things. I would not view that quote taken by itself to lead to anything that says the governor want
something other than the process that is currently being followed to happen. Nobody is suggesting that.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Then on Kemper, could you – it seems like this latest cost increase has had to do
with the review you've been doing since you changed the management.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: And you have a couple of places in your disclosures, you suggest that this is something
you'll be continuing to do on the go forward. Can you give us any more comfort or characterize how this analysis is
done and how – your confidence level, say versus when you took the initial big write-down before you changed
management?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure. So when we – if you recall, the first adjustment we made was right on the heels, you
know, frankly it was a surprise to everybody. It was right on the heels of all these big changes that we made. We also

disclosed that in fact an ongoing review was occurring. And recall, the first review was tied up, I would argue mostly
with the issues related to material, and type, and quantities, and metallurgy and all sorts of things and not just pipe, it
was cable and hangers and everything else.
So that is kind of what I would say most of that was. And it was, you know, it was our best estimate at the time, but we
all were very clear that there was more to go and we had to go back and look very closely. I would argue that the $450
million is characterized by, I would say, the whole group. And now we have we brought to bear not only the outsiders
and insiders we have been using, but construction industry specialists, particularly in gas handling systems, outside
construction, management evaluators, we have a variety of people in the boat right now.
Like, for example, when we evaluated the contingency that added, this $100 million extra contingency. We actually
had five different estimates of contingency that were resolved into one estimate. It has been a very, very thorough
review. And just to tell you, this is nothing that is arm's length.
Me and my management team, we have something called an executive review board, that is me and Art, and then it's
Paul Bowers at Georgia Power, who used to be President of Generation, Charles McCrary, CEO of Alabama, he is the
President of Generation, Mark Crosswhite, our COO, Kim Greene, our CEO of Southern Company Services. She
actually has experience in generation at TVA. We have Chris Womack. I'm probably leaving some people out, but we
all went to the plant site and spent a whole afternoon diving into all of the details with management. Recall, leading the
management team is the new CEO there, Ed Holland. And then we have our best construction guy, Ashley Baker and a
variety of other people. And we've really torn these numbers apart.
It is our best estimate. If I had to tell you where the future exposure may occur, I think it relates to schedule.
Interestingly, if you go back to some of the accounting issues we had after the year-end restatement in the first quarter,
and everything else was worries, and perhaps a lack of evidence, about our ability to double the productivity of
installing pipe, for example, in a month. Well, in fact, in the month of June we did that. So these were things that
people were questioning and looking hard at. In fact, the team on the ground accomplished that very challenging
objective.
So it's a challenge. But the report so far is that we believe the targets are achievable, related to schedule. And that is
where I think the biggest risk is right now.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay, thanks for that, Tom. Can I just ask one other thing? In the release you stressed the
rainfall situation and mild temperatures and tie a lot of that together to what went on in the economy in the second
quarter. I think weather's become a little more normal in the first month of Q3. Have you seen things just get back onto
a trajectory or ...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Jonathan, it may have been normal in New York. It's been awful here.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's raining right now. It's unbelievable how much. It's just been mild, let me put it that
way, with lots and lots of rainfall.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So whatever you were seeing Q2, you're continuing to see it?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. It got a little warmer at the end of July, but today again it's cloud cover and rain. So,
you know, we'll see. Just give you a little more line, yes, we like to do that. Whether it's the normal weather, how much
of that we had? I'm looking at Art right now.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Jonathan, if you go back and look at above-normal weather in the last 22 months, we've had
3 months out of those 22 months that were above normal.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And I know you said it was the seventh wettest quarter for Alabama and Georgia. It was
the second wettest quarter for Georgia in the past 50 years. This is just extraordinary, what we're living through now.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Thanks for all the color, Tom.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good afternoon, can you hear me?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes sir, can hear you fine.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. So, quick question, and again this kind of relates back to SCANA's
comments at the Analysts Day, but when it comes to the timeline for Vogtle and receipt of modules, how is that going?
They talked, at least initially, about receiving some parts perhaps ahead of schedule, versus others. Are you seeing
anything like that, to maybe offset some of the other pressures on schedule that we've talked about thus far?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, look. I think the major milestones that we pointed out in the fourth quarter will be
CA20. It's kind of the major critical path for us. And then of course pouring the basemat in Unit 4. So those are the two
big ones. We have seen an improvement. We've noted and if you've read the independent monitor's report that has been
an area of concern for some time is getting material out of the manufacturing facility in Louisiana. My sense is now,
that the material is being manufactured, it's really now focused on getting nuclear quality documentation related to the
material that is being delivered. That's what we're working on now. We've sent our own people to the site. That process
is improving.
And recall, too, that Chicago Bridge & Iron's acquisition of Shaw, we think is a big plus to improving that situation.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. And then going back to the IGCC side of the equation. You talked about
short term debt that last go around to kind of plug the balance sheet if you will temporarily. Is that all out of the picture
here, just want to be very clear, I mean, you talked all about equity but just want to be sure on the debt side what's
going on there.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah and again, I think we mentioned, that it's resolving Southern's equity ratio back to a
point before we began with the write-offs associated with the plant. That would be 43.5%, 44% and getting Mississippi
by that same timeframe back to close to their 50%, which is contemplated in their seven-year rate plan. So you know
there may be some intermittent debt and downloading, but we're not going to fund the cash to Mississippi until they
need it to do the construction additions that we've outlined.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And that's why we thought it was kind of instructive to give you the year by year effects
that we're seeing right now, of course you can see some variance there.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. So all of that is out of the way, the equity is done – or will be done now,
resolves everything?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, what we describe relates to the effects of Kemper completely.

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hi, Anthony.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: How you doing, guys?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good. How are you?
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: So far, so good. Hopefully, two softball questions. The first one relates to the great state
of Alabama, there was language in the press used – you read from some of the commissioners in Alabama that there
may be some changes in Alabama's rates or whatever. Just what is the process, has that become like if there is a
decision to maybe change the rate structure for Alabama Power does that become a full litigated rate proceeding and if
rates were reduced it's more of an end of 2014 event than maybe an end of 2013 event and the second question is
relative potential exposure, or what could potentially be higher in Kemper would be maybe scheduling. Is there way
that – is the company I guess tied down to getting the unit online at a certain date or if you don't make the schedule,
why spend the money, whatever, not work three shifts or whatever you're doing just to get the unit I guess finished with
a lower cost estimate?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey. Well, let me take Kemper, you take Alabama. Art used to be the CFO of Alabama.
He knows that state intimately. Look, we're spending some extra money every month now in order to hit the date, I
mean we talked about that before. And remember the first milestone to focus on is to get that gasifier heat-up by the
end of the year. So 12/31 is kind of what we want to do there.
What we save by spending more money now is exposure beyond the in-service date is essentially whatever's going to
be required to continue to get startup complete plus carrying cost plus whatever, and depending on how regulation
works, so this is kind of a murky area. We'll have more clarity on this probably later in the year. But the additional cost
beyond May could be somewhere between $15 million a month or $40 million a month. And all that is driven by kind
of how you recover the AFUDC, what happens to the test revenues for the electricity you sell as you continue to
start-up process, how the regulatory capture mechanisms will work. There's a – and how much more kind of
maintenance you will have to do in order to complete startup. So I know that's a wide range but it's a – it's a – it's a
whole range of factors that we're looking at.
In any event we think that the actions we're taking now that relate to increased costs to meet schedule is a dominant
solution. And represents no regrets. Ultimately delivering we think long term great value to customers. Art, why don't
you talk about Alabama.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Anthony, on the question about where does Alabama go and what kind of
arrangement, does it become more formal or does it become just some kind of agreement. You know, it's really hard to
say at this point. But I would imagine that it would be some kind of consent agreement that both the commission and
the company would sign onto. But again, that's a function of whatever the outcome of the commission's
recommendation would be.

<Q - Mark Barnett>: One quick question, you've covered the big construction projects a lot. So I'll leave that. But I
wanted to talk a little bit about the power usage situation. I know that there was a lot of impact from the weather. But
you know I can't help look at the commercial and wonder a little bit about what's going on there so far in the year and
wonder if you could provide a little bit of color on what you think is driving that kind of decline.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Mark, we've kind of looked at that as well. We were up in the first quarter on a
weather-normal basis, we are down in the second quarter on a weather-normal basis. And as we look back over the last
six or seven quarters, commercial has been very volatile. So it's kind of hard to get a pattern of growth. But as we think
about it in the second quarter, anyway, the lot of rainfall certainly has an effect on temperature, certainly has an effect
on usage from that perspective. But we think it also impacts recreational activity which reflects a lot of usage in the
summertime, going to the beach in the rain or going to an amusement park, what have you. Now these are just kind of
examples and we try to cite to ourselves. But you know, it's begin – it's a quandary to us as well.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So let me give you an example. You would not believe the depth we go to, to get arcane
information and try and get some enlightenment about this stuff. We actually measure the traffic on the Pensacola
Beach Bridge, and in fact, in the second quarter, the traffic on the Pensacola Beach Bridge was down 10%. What that
tells you is, nobody wants to go sit on the beach when it's raining. Likely and I've heard this from some other folks at
the Fed, likely it reduces traffic to restaurants. Things like that. Movie stuff. So I think that's what we're seeing here is
just a lack of activity or a reduced activity as a result.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Fair enough. And I mean this is going to be a little bit bigger picture, and I know MATS,
obviously much bigger impact on your fleet. But I was just wondering if you could share some thoughts. You know
we've got the rehearing of CSAPR here in October and the administration's new draft rule quote unquote on CO2,
something that's probably far out in 2015 but it is kind of a line in the sand I guess. I'm wondering what your feeling is
around the political situation and how that might play out.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So I'll take the political situation in GHG, I'll let you take rest of the stuff if you want to,
how about that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So it's pretty clear I think that there is a succession of moves, increased regulations around
carbon intensive energy forms, and the latest I think is greenhouse gases, the President came out and made an important
speech in our view about that. Here's kind of our beliefs on that. Number one nothing the President said to us was
terribly surprising. I think we wait to see how the details emerge. So that will be key. Our sense is, consistent with what
I think general beliefs are and it's what we have suggested in other calls, that probably the end of the summer sometime
they'll come out with some standards for new sources, and probably 2014 will be existing sources.
Recall, there are important considerations that will need to be made in order to understand the aggregate effect of
everything going on at EPA in terms of regulation. Because you just had this big math rule that caused certain
companies to spend billions of dollars. Now it impacted us more in terms of shifting away from coal and shutting down
some coal plants and converting some coal plants. We already had our scrubbers and SCRs pretty much in place.
The other thing that's just interesting to know. I mean think about Southern's position relative to almost anybody else in
the industry. When you think about new sources and exposure to carbon intensity, we're leading the renaissance of
nuclear in America. No carbon. We are going to get done successfully, with Kemper County. That has a carbon
footprint equivalent to or less than natural gas. So that's positive. We've made a huge shift away from coal to gas, to
where we used to be 70% energy from coal, now we're 45% with gas. We're the third largest consumer of natural gas in
the United States. We have extended our reach either through ownership or through contract with now about 1200
megawatts in about the last 12 months in terms of renewables, that's both procuring wind energy and either procuring
solar or owning solar.
When you consider that, plus what we've already been doing, in terms of energy efficiency, it's easy for me to say that
it would be hard to find somebody that's doing more in terms of kind of handling the GHG issue in a very practical,
both tactical and strategic way. Finally, we continue to be the only company in our industry invested in proprietary

robust research and development. We continue to work on new ideas. We continue to promote energy innovation. And
I think that will be a keystone of ours going forward.
In terms of things away from carbon, I'll let Art comment on that.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, Mark, I guess the biggest item we're dealing with right now would be the new effluent
guidelines that were published in – proposed rules that were published in June. Comments are due in September. I think
they outlined eight different options with four preferred. We are evaluating a lot of data around these and we will be
involved in commenting on the rules by that September date.
Don't really have a good feel in terms of cost related to that at this point. The other rules as you probably are aware,
coal ash, the final rule timing is still uncertain, but it might not be until next year. That's certainly the biggest element in
terms of cost for us. And then of course, 316 (b), those rules were postponed from April till November. And we'll get a
better chance to see what that final rule look like, as well. But the biggest element of the three of those is probably the
ash rule and there is a number of things going on as well but I'll stop at that point.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Dan.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Good afternoon, guys. Just a question on the solar program in Georgia that got approved by the
commission during the quarter. Just kind of if you could share your thoughts on how you see that playing through, you
know, is that going to be an investment from Georgia Power versus maybe a Southern Power and when we could see
action?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet. So 525 megawatts were approved. 100 megawatts of that I think is targeting
distributed generation, which I've talked about at some length in the past. And then kind of the other 425 megawatts
would be your more traditional central station approaches.
So that's part of the 2013 IRP, integrated resource plan that is competitive load. In other words, anybody can you know
go through a process and try and win the business. What we have said internally is that we'd like to win, you know, a
good bit of that business. And so there's really three ways, at least three ways we can attack it. One is, the Georgia retail
approach, essentially rate-basis. Another way would be is Georgia wholesale that is Georgia providing generation on a
wholesale basis, like they do on some of their other energy contracts.
Third would be essentially Southern Power or something similar to Southern Power owning it. Now the only nuance
Dan I'll thrown on you there distributed generation is enough of a different animal. We may take even a special
business unit approach to that. We may pull together some folks in the industry, I mean I'm sorry in the system, and
take a look at kind of how we might approach that business. That's much more a people-intensive business, than the
central station approaches. And then finally, recall that anybody that goes after this business will have to pass
essentially an evaluation by an independent monitor that will regularly as they do here assess your competitive bid.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Tom, when do you think you can have more on that and would that be potentially carved out of
moneys that you think will go to Southern Power or do you think that would be added into the CapEx program and the
slides today?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You know, I don't know. I don't think it's near term. I'll bet you – I don't know when the
soonest you could probably get stuff done. Maybe by 2015, 2016, somewhere in that timeframe. Those would be kind
of when I think the generation would come in. So back up a little bit so a year or two in advance of that. Something like

that.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Okay, got it. And then on – just on the economy, you guys gave a good run down on the
industrial side but can you talk a little bit about residential as far as household formation and home construction looks
right now and you know with that down demand for residential how deep are the usage reductions you guys are seeing
amongst that customer class?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, this is Art. The – what we've seen so far is, we've added year-to-date about 15,000
new customers; new meters, to our system. And our estimate for the year was about 24,000. So we're making good
progress on that front.
However, when we look at the usage of some of those new customers, a lot of them are multifamily units. Some are
single family homes, but the vast majority I think are multifamily.
And the way I kind of view it, Dan, is you know, you build a new – a new multifamily apartment building and it's
occupied over time. So our usage per customer for those new units is way down. And I think there is a function of, you
know, getting people to move in, fully, and to occupy those residence is as a normal customer would but that will turn
around. And we think that's part of our second-half equation.
But again, we've done a bit better than what we've expected on new customer growth, and with the housing improving
here in Atlanta and in Georgia, we see that continuing. Again, with all the announced jobs, IT-type jobs in and around
Atlanta, that will be attracting new people into the state, will certainly put more pressure on that equation as well.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: When you guys you know look at kind of the relationship between usage and GDP and that sort
of thing, if you look out to say 2014-15, what kind of load growth do you think is durably sustainable once we get
passed the slow first half of this year, if we do see a recovery?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well it is in our long-term estimate that heuristic is still pretty good 50% to 60% of GDP
growth. So that's kind of what we've been doing. So the other thing that's interesting, in fact we just had a guy come
speak to our board. Dan, one of the interesting things that really confounds people I think, people that especially they
think that energy efficiency is going to deplete electricity usage is that the economy is getting more and more
electrified.
And there are all sorts of interesting dynamics. When I give these speeches, I always hold up my iPhone at that point
and say we have all these goofy devices and here you are. But it is kind of much more than that. When you stream
something, like you want to watch some episode of Mad Men or something, you watch it for an hour on your iPad, son
of a gun, it isn't just what's going on in your house. You are lighting up servers all over the place. There are much more
significant compound effects of greater bandwidth in the information economy that are electricity intensive. We think,
and the work that we all have done and we showed this at the last fall financial conference, we continue to see the
evidence, that in fact, electricity consumption is trumping the drag by energy efficiency.
So we think we'll see this for some time. Longer-term, electricity sales we would think would be in the 1.3% range.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Okay, and I guess one last question because there's been recently topical, has been the long-term
contracted generation, going into some sort of yield CO mechanism where you can offer a big yield off the cash flows
and then raise capital when you need to invest. Have you guys – we've always done this before, but have you guys
looked at Southern Power as potentially unlocking some value going that route?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Dan, when you think about Southern Power and the long term contracted business that it
already has, it's such a well – good match to our regulated model. It really doesn't differentiate it like it would for say
NRGs and provide them with that benefit. We are already – Southern Company is already a yield CO in a way, I think
but -
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, we look at, here's the other way to answer that. We look at everything all the time.
We looked at this yield CO concept. I'm not sure unlocking value with Southern Power serves our long-term interest.
We use the other word here, in the world of finance there's lot of tricks and no magic. We really like the way our pieces

do that. But we remain committed to a long-term posture on those issues.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP Capital. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Vedula.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Yes.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey. How are you?
<Q - Vedula Murti>: I'm doing well, thank you. I'm wondering, I missed the very beginning, the date on which you
expect to hear from the commission in Alabama. And secondarily, I think if I recall properly, the ROE adjustments
we've seen for much smaller gas LDCs has been in the range of about 200 basis points roughly. So I'm wondering if
you could just remind us what your sensitivity is at Alabama Power for, with regards to, I'll call it 100 basis points or
whatever adjustments on the current ROE range you have?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, let me first just say, we said this in I think – we said it a little bit in the script, we said
it in the first question, look, we think the ROIC that Alabama enjoys is appropriate and serves our customers' long term
interest. In fact, when you consider the equity ratio, the debt ratio, the embedded cost of capital, Alabama is reasonable
and fair. So number one, you know, let's not get ahead of what the commission wants to do, but that's our position. In
terms of when the commission will rule, you know, it's just going to be in the months ahead. We don't think it's going
to be six months, but I think it will be in the next quarter or so.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: And there's no precedent in Alabama for doing anything retroactive. I think the decisions that I
don't recall anything from the decisions from Mobile and whatever that had anything to do retroactive for the full year
of 2013. This is all prospective, correct?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's our understanding. But you should remember Mobile and Alabama are completely
different. They have a much thicker equity ratio than Alabama does. I would hesitate to draw parallels between one
company and another. The other thing that would be fun to look at is if you could get a view of the webcast or whatever
of any of the proceedings. Alabama enjoys a lot of support by its customers. I think Alabama demonstrated successfully
their side of the argument.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: All right, Tom, thank you very much.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: How you doing? Yes, first of all, if the Kemper schedule for coming online slips past the 2014
spring deadline, what happens to the DOE subsidy? Is there any risk there or -?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, you lose them.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: You lose it for sure?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You lose ITC, not the DOE stuff. I'm sorry, right. So the $133 million investment tax
credit is what you would lose. I'm sorry, that's what I thought you were referring to.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Not the DOE funding.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: The DOE funding would be fine, right?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Correct.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Then, just in sort of the bigger picture here, Vogtle is the first new nuclear plant in
decades. And just how do we see it in terms of, in the context of Kemper? I mean obviously Kemper has been a
disappointment, as you mentioned, in terms of what was projected and what happened in terms of costs. Could you just,
not in any great detail, but just sort of a bigger picture. Obviously it's understandable that somebody might simply
think, hey, that Kemper, which is also a cutting edge technology kind of thing, why won't that happen at Vogtle? How
can we -?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Let me give you a simple answer. The simplest answer is we agreed to a cost cap with
only about 10% to 15% of the engineering done. And what's happened is, as we've completed the engineering, we ran
into the problem that oh my goodness we are going to run over on cost and schedule. We reduced the schedule at the
same time we agreed to the price cap. That actually occurred in early 2010, okay. We didn't know we had a problem
then, but in fact that's when we had a problem. We only knew we had the problem once the engineering became
complete and we saw the implications of the rapid construction. By any investigation that we've done here, the
construction has actually been exceedingly effective. Okay? That is completely the opposite of what we have seen in
Vogtle.
Because recall, the licensing process by the NRC, remember there were two pieces. The DCD, the design control
document was essentially a large scale engineering effort of the technology AP1000. and then the COL, which put that
technology on your site and took into account all the site-specific issues and then resulted in the combined
construction-operating license, essentially spoke for the lion's share of the engineering as you thought about moving
forward with construction. It was exactly the opposite of what we did at Kemper. And -
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And man oh man, I think that's going to serve us well on Vogtle. I think that's just one
single big reason why I don't expect Vogtle to be anything like Kemper.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Is there any risk of not having recertification at all to shareholders? In other words, I'm just
wondering is there any, I mean by foregoing recertification, is there any – just could you elaborate what the impact, if
any, that actually has?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Paul, I think it's really kind of a timing issue. You're going to evaluate all the costs
along the way, whether you do one or the other. If you force recertification now, the commission could do a lot of
different things with the new costs. Otherwise, they're going to cover those same costs through the VCM process.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: So it's just duplicate really?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It really is.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, I just wanted to make sure. And just finally on sales growth, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics I think released today the revised 2012 GDP at 2.8%. They also lowered the first half of this year or the first
quarter or whatever. But I mean, generally speaking, I mean this 0.5% to 0.6% of GDP growth doesn't seem to have
held in weather-adjusted for you guys, right? It was 0.4% for 2012 and you guys are characterizing with leap year this
year so far being flat.
So you know, without getting into, what's going on with industrial or commercial or whatever, just in general, I mean –
and I just also noticed with the Gulf Power thing that you guys are coming in a little bit sooner than expected because
of sales growth. I'm just sort of wondering, is there any thought about potentially revisiting of the projections there with
respect to sales growth?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Paul, we look at that all the time. Our marketing research, load research folks are
constantly evaluating. We have had some extreme weather in both 2012 and 2013. And so when you get to weather
normalization, it begins, it gets a little more fuzzy on the margins than it does when you've got normal weather. So
there's lots of issues here that could influence your actual results. You know, again the long-term, we kind of use that
more long-term than we do short-term. But sometimes those things will move on either side of it. Just in a period of
strange weather, and slower than expected economic growth.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, and just to underline what Art said and we try to get you guys to – we understand
you have a difficult job trying to figure all of this stuff out. That is a good long-term heuristic to use, to help you
understand it. Just remember that what we do is this detailed bottoms-up approach and then we circle back with these
economic forums that Art holds to confirm what we are saying inside. And then we have also insight through my work
with the Fed and I will say that what we're coming up internally is very consistent with what the Fed is finding.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, and then just in terms of long term EPS growth and I know this – I think Ali and Greg
were asking about this, but just to understand this, you did mention it's a regulatory year. Obviously things with
Kemper did not work out exactly as we had previously expected. Is the 4% to 6% growth – I know that you guys
usually address this in the fourth quarter, I mean, you did mention to Paul Ridzon that you were sort of reiterating the
guidance when asked in terms of 2013 in terms of your confidence. How should we think about your confidence for the
4% to 6% growth in January? If you could just elaborate a little bit more on that, just in terms of how do you feel about
that given all the stuff that's been happening?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, yeah, I think I would say what I said before. I appreciate you asking again. But I –
the most dominant thing is what's going to happen with Georgia. The second most dominant thing is what's going to
happen with Alabama. I think we've separated out the effects of Kemper, $0.015 this year, $0.025 independent and
$0.04 in the aggregate next year, etcetera. I mean we've been through that. So my view is, I'm just a little reluctant, I
guess I'm saying our 4% to 6% remains until I see a reason to change it. And I'm not going to change it until I see what
happens with this regulatory calendar that we have in front us in 2013.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. I appreciate that, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We'll stick to our guns on that one and we'll give you new estimates in January.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot, guys.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: You all – every six months will you all simply go in and ask for approval of the money you
spend in the prior six months on the plant and you won't come in and give the commission an update on here's what we
expect the total plant cost to be overall, meaning till the end of construction? Or will that last data point still be given in
the commission?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: It will still – Paul this is -
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, it's Michael. I'm sorry.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I'm sorry, Michael, I forgot. The way we think about it is there will still be communications
with the commission about total cost and we'll still file those projections with them but the actual approval will come in
each of the six month processes as Tom has described.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And all that, Michael, you should know, is hand in glove, we have an independent
evaluator, it's exactly the processes that we have been following so far through VCM 1 through 7 and the process we're
following now with the exception that we're not going to do the recertification with the 5% cost increase.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it, okay. So it's strictly not having to go through the formal process of getting
commission approval but there will still be the disclosure in the public domain about whether the cost has gone down
you know due to construction or due to lower financing cost or whether it – kind of your long-term projection of the
total plant cost?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Thank you, Mike.
Operator
Thank you. And at this time there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?
Thomas A. Fanning
The only thing we didn't talk about, I was just interested, I think I want to throw out there that we've received some
positive momentum certainly since we have Secretary Moniz assume his position with respect to loan guarantees. Our
view is that we've had a renewed sense of urgency. I can't tell you that we're more likely to get it or not but I can tell
you that the temperature has been turned up on the parties in seeking to achieve resolution on that negotiation. We
didn't talk about that, and I probably ought to throw that out there. That is another important factor that's positive for
Vogtle.
Anyway look, we're continuing to work hard, we hate the fact here we had another increase on Kemper, we're
continuing to work to make sure that that covers everything that we know. It is our best estimate. We're going to work
hard to bring that thing in now on time with the new numbers. We appreciate your following us, and we're going to
work hard on your behalf. Thank you very much.
