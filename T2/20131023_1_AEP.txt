Nicholas K. Akins
Thanks, Bette Jo. So, today, I'm happy to report that AEP had a good third quarter. With our performance in this
quarter, we've decided to modify our guidance range for 2013 to the upper end of the guidance range. Originally, it was
$3.05 to $3.25 range we had previously reported. We're changing that to $3.15 to $3.25 with a $3.20 midpoint.
Despite the continued overall stagnation of the economy, the continuous improvement in cost savings initiatives that
our employees continue to focus on have provided the company's ability to fully react to the current environment.
These sustainable initiatives and others to follow will continue to provide benefits to our customers and our
shareholders.
Coupled with our previous announcement by our board to increase the dividend payable by $0.01 a share to $0.50 a
share; these actions have been consistent with our plan to ensure continued positive performance for our shareholders.
We have increased our dividend by 3.72% on an annualized basis, with a 61% payout ratio, which is within our 60% to
70% targeted range.
The third quarter came in at $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis, and $1.10 per share on an operating earnings basis. The
difference this quarter is mainly attributable to the surprising decision by the PUCT, Public Utility Commission of
Texas, to include AFUDC in the cost capital related to the Turk Power Plant at SWEPCO and a smaller impairment
related to the Big Sandy scrubber project cost that was disallowed as part of the order in Kentucky approving 50% of
the Mitchell Plant to be transferred to Kentucky Power rate base. I'll discuss these cases in more detail a little bit later,
but so far, this year, we stand at $2.33 a share, on a GAAP basis and $2.63 per share on an operating basis, with the
differences attributable to the impairments that I just mentioned along with other impairments and benefits from
previous quarters that we reported.
Despite the impairments of last quarter, we performed well from an operating earnings perspective, and I'm proud of
our employees' efforts to control costs as an outcome of our repositioning efforts and continuous improvements. Also
solid regulatory recovery benefits and continued positive transmission performance have contributed as well.
We are pleased to see increases in the commercial load, primarily in Texas and Ohio, for the third quarter, but our
residential and industrial load continues to be challenged. The make-up at the top of the load though combined with the
margins in each class has resulted in a smaller year-to-date financial impact. However, the oscillating nature of the
quarter-to-quarter load cycles as we've looked at previous quarters that we've reported indicate a still tenuous economy.
I sort of call it a whack-a-mole economy, because the growth in each sector has not been well synchronized to indicate
true overall economic growth. Industrial load continues to be – to lag across many sectors including Primary Metals
and Mining, partially offset, in our service territory, by the shale gas activity in Texas and Ohio.
Moving to the major regulatory activities during the quarter, we were pleased overall with the Kentucky asset transfer
order. We received permission to transfer 50% of the Mitchell Plant to Kentucky Power and put in place a $44 million
surcharge while freezing base rates for a period of time.
We also keep the Off-System sales margins and the capacity payments. So it turned out to be a good order. The
Kentucky Commission did disallow, as I mentioned earlier, certain scrubber project related expenses that we had
earlier.
The West Virginia case continues – we continue to wait for a Commission order, which we expect relatively soon, but
based on the outcome that we saw in the FE, First Energy transfer order, we expect to have a reasonable outcome there
as well.
Regarding the Texas rate case order, involving the Turk Power Plant related costs, we were pleased that the plant was
found to be prudent. And the imposition, obviously the retroactive rates that we had mentioned earlier to the beginning
– almost to the beginning of the year, but we were disappointed that the Texas Commission surprisingly included
AFUDC and the cost cap related to the Turk construction costs.

We'll be filing a rehearing request with the Commission to show that the case history record does not support such an
outcome. To not allow quick recovery that we had requested and then also to not allow AFUDC recovery beyond what
was clearly a cap on the construction cost to build the unit, would send, I believe, a bad policy message on prudent in
current generating investment. We are indeed hopeful that after reviewing the record, the PUCT will reconsider its
decision particularly for a state that desperately needs to incent new generation capacity. We continue to be committed
to delivering 4% to 6% earnings growth off of our original 2013 guidance.
AEP believes that the cultural transformation efforts along with the ingenuity of our employees to achieve cost savings
through our continuous improvement efforts will ultimately mitigate the headwinds of a lack of load growth. We
believe our industry is no longer about just generation, transmission, and distribution but it's focused on infrastructure
investment, particularly in the transmission area and distribution and the customer and employee experiences that
include technological changes, and of course optimization of our portfolio of assets. So our company is transforming
from that perspective.
In November, at EEI, we'll be discussing specific cost savings expectations in areas such as lean generation, lean wires,
procurement, lean IT, corporate services from a lean perspective; the unregulated generation cost reduction initiatives
that Chuck Zebula and his team are working on, as well as other growth-related initiative areas such as transmission
expansion, and more effective cost allocation per capital – capital allocation, excuse me. This detail will demonstrate
our plan to achieve our 4% to 6% earnings growth rate plans for the future, so stay tuned for that.
Now, as I turn to the equalizer chart, I call it my equalizer chart, on page four of the presentation, I'd sort of go through
state-by-state, jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction, where we stand. The Ohio Power is showing up at 12.3%. Keep in mind, that
12.3% does not include Off-System sales, if you're thinking about it from a SEET perspective. If you exclude the
Off-System sales from the 12.3%, that brings you down below the 12% SEET cap. So I know people will have
questions about that. So – but it also – from an Ohio perspective, it doesn't include the $435 million of plant
write-downs that we've taken this year. So when you look at Ohio, you have to think about that from a consideration
perspective.
For West Virginia, we continue to see improvement in West Virginia. We expect – as I said earlier, the order is
expected pretty soon. So we'd expect that to continue to increase.
And then, on Kentucky, it's a sort of – it is one of our smaller jurisdictions, and we'd had a big Sandy 2 outage in the
third quarter that had some O&M expenses associated with that. So it's slightly lower than it was, but it continues in its
positive trajectory as well, particularly with the Kentucky order now in place.
And then I&M, that continues to improve. You're seeing – because it is a 12-month rolling average, the recent rate case
activity will continue to enable that to improve. PSO is pretty steady. It's decreased a little bit, but that's because
obviously PSO is doing what it needs to do to continue to invest in its distribution territory.
And then, SWEPCO, we expect that to continue to improve because it's not fully reflected in terms of rates, the recent
rate case development. It will continue to improve as well. And then AEP Texas is doing well. And then from a
transmission operation standpoint, we continue to have heavy investments in transmission. So that return has come
down slightly, but that's because of the heavy investment that's occurring and the lag associated with that.
So, overall, I'd say the equalizer chart across the area is looking good. No, just a slight change, I guess, from the
previous quarter, but overall, it's a 10.3% overall regulated operations ROE, which I think is pretty favorable in this
environment. So we've had a good strong quarter, and we certainly are looking for continued activity in November at
the EEI meeting, and certainly Brian will talk a little bit more about the detail that we will be providing there.
So, at this point, I'll turn it over to Brian.

Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. We are going to try a new format today for discussing comparative
year-on-year results. In an effort to avoid repetition and tedium, I'll handle both quarterly and year-to-date
reconciliations on the same slide, focusing primarily on the quarterly results but adding color to the year-to-date results
as needed. If we find that this new method is not helpful, then we'll revert to the old format next time. In any event, the
traditional slides that are you used to are in the appendix to the presentation.
So here we go. On slide five, you'll see that operating earnings for the third quarter were $533 million, or $1.10 per
share, compared to $496 million, or $1.02 per share recorded last year, an $0.08 per share improvement. For the
year-to-date period, our operating earnings were $1.277 billion, or $2.63 per share, versus last year's results of $1.255
billion, or $2.59 per share, an improvement of $0.04 per share.
Stepping through the detail from the top to bottom, you can see that the quarter was adversely affected by a
combination of certain Ohio transition items that were unfavorable $0.03 per share versus last year. This effect on
earnings was driven by an increase in customer switching, net of the capacity deferrals, and lower capacity payments
from competitive retail energy suppliers.
On a year-to-date basis, this item represented a significant drag to earnings for an unfavorable comparison of $0.24 per
share. As expected in our guidance, the effective income tax rate was unfavorable $0.04 per share for the quarter, due
to unfavorable year-on-year tax to book differences accounted for on a flow-through basis as well as positive
adjustments to state income tax returns that were recorded in 2012. For the year-to-date, this item is now unfavorable
$0.09 per share for the same reasons as for the quarter. Allowance for funds used during construction or AFUDC was
off $0.02 for the third quarter and $0.07 per share for the year-to-date, due primarily to the startup of the Turk Plant in
December of 2012.
Off-System sales margins net of sharing were down $0.02 per share for the quarter. This decline was largely driven by
prior period true-ups of PJM-related expenses that more than offset the effect of increased volumes and prices this year.
For the year-to-date, Off-Systems sales compared unfavorably to last year by $0.04 per share. The decline for this
period was driven by lower RPM capacity revenues that hurt results by $0.03 per share, as well as the PJM expense
items mentioned for the quarter.
As you can see, both AEP River Operations and our regulated retail load were unchanged and not drivers for the
quarterly results. The September year-to-date decline for River Operations reflects the lingering impact of drought
conditions from the back half of last year into the first half of this year. The year-to-date decline in regulated retail load
is driven by the lower industrial demand across much of our service territories. As will become clearer later in the
presentation, the decrease in retail margins is not as large as a decrease in retail load. I'll further discuss the economy
and our retail sales data in the upcoming slides.
Weather played an unfavorable role in our earnings comparison for the quarter. Temperatures were milder than last
summer, adversely affecting results by $0.08 per share. This result for the quarter was more than offset by the favorable
cushion that we had built up through June. Weather for the year-to-date period is now $0.02 per share favorable versus
normal. O&M expense net of offset items was favorable $0.06 per share for the quarter, and that brings our year-to-date
results almost even to last year.
The lower O&M expense for the quarter was driven by lower storm and employee-related expenses, partially offset by
higher transmission service expenses. Transmission operations added $0.01 per share for the quarter and $0.05 per
share for the year-to-date period, reflecting our continued significant investment in this area. Other items for the
quarterly comparison were favorable by $0.05 per share, and for the year-to-date period positive $0.09 per share. The
improvement for both periods was driven by lower long-term interest expense, lower depreciation expenses, and an
increase in third-party transmission revenues.
Finally, rate changes were favorable by $0.15 per share for the third quarter. This result pushes our favorable
year-to-date comparison to $0.36 per share. The improvement in earnings in both periods reflects successful regulatory
outcomes in multiple jurisdictions.

As you can see, we continue to overcome the challenges created by Ohio. In spite of these challenges, we have
executed on our plan to invest in our regulated operations, grow our transmission business and control expenses. Our
year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter allow us to narrow our operating earnings guidance for the
year to the upper half of the previously stated range of $3.05 per share to $3.25 per share. We are narrowing guidance
for 2013 to $3.15 to $3.25 per share, as Nick stated earlier.
Also, as I mentioned earlier, I want to spend some time looking at our regulated load so far this year. Turning to slide
six, you can see in the lower right quadrant that weather normalized load was down 1.5% for the quarter and 1.9% for
the year. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of declining retail sales.
You've probably already noticed from looking at the bottom half of the slide that the decline in retail sales is primarily
driven by industrial sales. Residential sales, shown in the upper left quadrant, were down 1.8% for the quarter, which
offset the strong first quarter results bringing the year-to-date growth essentially flat.
We continue to see modest customer growth of 0.7% in our western service territories but none to speak of in east.
Average usage per customer has declined, as more customers are utilizing efficient appliances in their homes and
taking advantage of various energy efficiency programs.
In the upper right quadrant, you can see that commercial sales were up 1.3% for the quarter, which offset the weak
second quarter results, making the year-to-date growth essentially flat. Commercial growth in the third quarter was
evenly spread across the AEP service territory.
In total, year-to-date commercial sales are down compared to last year. However, in Texas and Ohio, where we've seen
stronger employment growth, we are seeing commercial sales gains compared to last year.
Finally, in the lower left quadrant, you see the declines I mentioned earlier where the industrial class is down 3.9% for
the quarter and 5.1% for the year. If you exclude the effect of our largest customer, which had been operating at
reduced levels, the declines would have been 1.3% and 2.7% for the quarter and year-to-date periods respectively.
While not minimizing the importance of these declines, it's important to note that the effect on gross margin associated
with industrial declines is less than in other customer classes. The average realization from industrial customers is less
than half that for residential.
As I've done previously, let me stop here and share an update on the economy within AEP's footprint. AEP's service
territory continues to experience economic growth, although the growth has slowed somewhat recently, as we are
starting to see the impact of the federal fiscal austerity measures. This is particularly true in our western footprint,
where there are a number of military bases and a higher percentage of federal government employees than in our
eastern territory.
As you know, a large part of the sequestration cuts were targeted around defense spending. Therefore, it's not surprising
that for the quarter, GDP growth in AEP's western footprint was a mere 0.1% compared to 0.8% in our eastern territory
and an estimated 1.4% for the U.S.
Fortunately, the employment statistics which are a better indicator of electricity sales and GDP are not as weak. Job
growth in AEP's western footprint is up 1.6%, and is in step with the U.S., which is at 1.7%, while growth in the east
has moderated recently, to 0.6%. Even though our employment growth had been consistently stronger than the U.S.
over the past several years, the economy in AEP's service territory has not fully recovered from the recession. Most of
the employment growth over the last year has been in the service sector, which is consistent with our commercial sales
class growth, and has been the strongest in Texas and Ohio, as we mentioned earlier. Manufacturing employment
however remains weak.
With that segue, let's turn to slide seven where you'll see the quarterly results from our five largest industrial sectors.
Our largest sector, Primary Metals was down 18% from last year's third quarter. Earlier I mentioned the curtailed
production of our largest customer, and excluding that effect, this sector would have been down closer to 8%. That
customer has now fully ceased operations and so we expect to see this impact through the third quarter of next year.

We are seeing other metals customers curtailing operations until market conditions improve and some are taking
advantage of the situation to re-tool their operations.
Chemical Manufacturing is up 1.4% for the quarter, despite the year-to-date decline of 1.9%. If the global markets for
chemicals recover while natural gas prices remain low, this export industry is in position to experience recovery.
Petroleum & Coal Products are down 2.1% for the quarter versus the same period last year. This is due to a couple of
specific refineries that were down for maintenance in the third quarter. Excluding these two customers, sales to this
sector were flat for the quarter, and would have been up 2.3% for the year.
The Mining sector excluding Oil & Gas was down 2% for the quarter. This continuing decline reflects the impact of
recent mild winters, low natural gas prices, and weak demand from utilities and metals producers. Approximately 90%
of AEP mining load is located in our eastern footprint.
Paper Manufacturing was up 2.8% for the quarter, driven by higher demand in Ohio, which more than offset lower
demand in the west. Although not in our top five sectors, we continue to see growing sales in the Oil & Gas Extraction
and Pipeline Transportation sectors, driven by continued gains related to shale gas activity.
Turning to slide eight will give us an opportunity to review the financial health of the company. Our debt to total
capitalization continues to improve and now stands at 54.4%. Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to
total debt are solidly BBB and BAA2 at 4.6 times and 19.7% respectively.
On the bottom left-hand side of the graph, you'll see that our qualified pension liability funding has increased to 98%.
The company has aggressively funded this liability over the last three years to the benefit of our employees, retirees,
shareholders, and bond holders.
In addition to the funding, the company has been working hard to match the duration of the assets to the liabilities, and
to de-risk the plan as it approaches full funding. In addition to the pension results, our other post employment benefit
liability is now more than fully funded at 104.3%. This is due to some changes that were made last year in our
post-retirement medical plans.
Finally, let me give you some updates on some recent financing activity. Last week, AEP Transmission Company LLC,
priced commitments for $400 million of senior unsecured notes in maturities ranging from 5 years to 30 years. This
company is the holding company for the transcos that are in our existing service territories and seek to add incremental
transmission investment for the benefit of our customers at federally regulated rates.
The offering was a fantastic success, with spreads comparable to our larger rated utility companies, and in some cases
even lower than current indications demonstrating the strong appetite of investors for transmission specific debt. More
than half of the $400 million offering was for 30-year maturities including some delayed draws. Many thanks to our
investors and to those who believe that this business format would attract significant amounts of well-priced capital; it
is working out just as we said it would.
Lastly, on September 20, we received a financing order from the West Virginia Public Service Commission,
authorizing the securitization of the ENEC balance of $376 million, plus financing costs. We anticipate securitizing this
balance in the next few weeks, as we work to finalize the offering. It should be clear from the improving metrics on this
page that management is committed to a strong balance sheet and to our investment grade credit rating. We will
continue to demonstrate spending discipline, careful capital allocation, and thoughtful access to the debt capital
markets.
Finally, let me preview some of the detail that we will be sharing next month at the EEI Fall Financial Conference.
We'll provide support for the company's 4% to 6% operating earnings growth rate off of original 2013 guidance. We
will show how the growth comes from putting capital to work for the benefit of our customers and then doing the hard
work of getting the increased investment appropriately reflected in rates.
We will provide detail on the continuous improvement plans that the company has embarked on. We will share the
initiatives we have committed to for 2013 and describe the level of success we have had with those initiatives. We will

also discuss the plans we have for 2014 and what we think the magnitude of those opportunities are. This should
provide some insight into how we plan to fill the earnings gap presented by the low RPM auction results.
We have found a framework for continuous improvement that has worked well for us for over a year now. We evaluate
the size of the opportunity and then look to our employees to generate and analyze the ideas to capture the value. The
employees who do the work of this company have the experience and skill to show us how to provide better service and
how to do it more efficiently.
We will provide more detail on the range of investment opportunity available to our transcos and transmission JVs. In
the recent past, we have only shown the investment opportunity of approved projects or those that do not need
additional approvals.
In November, we'll provide more detail about those projects as well as an upside case, which includes currently
identified opportunities. This should give investors transparency into the growth potential of our transmission transcos
and JVs.
We'll also provide more detail into the cost structure and earnings opportunity of AEP Generation Resources, our
competitive generation affiliate. This will be a relatively small portion of our business going forward, but one that has
generated a lot of interest by investors.
Finally, we will provide some insights into the growth opportunity created by investment on behalf of our customers in
our regulated wires and integrated utility companies. These regulated businesses will be the lion's share of AEP's
business going forward. And we will show how putting capital to work to benefit our customers will allow us to grow
earnings over time. In November, we will be providing a lot of information designed to provide insight, transparency,
and credibility to our investment and growth goals.
At this time, we do not have plans to make any strategic announcements at the Fall EEI Conference, but rather details
on how we plan to grow the company over time.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. A couple of questions. Thanks for so much detail on your perspective on sales growth.
When you look at, for planning purposes, when you look out over the next 12 months to 24 months, when you
normalize for a lot of the idiosyncrasies in what's going on in your service territory, what are sort of the range of
expectations for sort of best case, worst case, base case sales growth going forward?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, Greg, good to hear from you. We have been assuming that load growth would be
relatively flat. And that's what we're assuming in our modeling, because you can't ignore what's going on with the
economy. You can't – and really, it's hard to tell what impact it would have in the future. Everybody is expecting – you
talk to economists, in every quarter it seems like the next quarter we're going to see an economic recovery. Well that's
been going on for years. So we're being deliberately conservative on that. And we'll continue to be that way.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Nick, that's great. Good to hear from you, too. So your plans to drive the 4% to 6%
earnings growth aspiration are sort of anchored in the assumption that you're going to have to plow through a relatively
flat sales growth picture.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, I'd say it really is flat, flat to low growth. It's certainly cost containment through the
efficiency efforts that we have ongoing and capital allocations, those areas where we can get more concurrent growth,
and better ROEs.

the ability to offset sort of post-2015 headwinds and continue to grow at that rate?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, you got it. That's – we'll show that based upon that original 2013 guidance range that
we gave, and if you look at that, the bottom line 4%, the top line 6%, we'll be in that range.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. A final question. The pension funding looks amazing. We've got a tax and accounting
team here that's done some analysis here at ISI on the impact of higher discount rates on all of the companies in the
S&P 500 and utilities in particular, given their large pensions seem to be particularly large beneficiaries of that going
into 2014. As you look at your planning, should it be our expectation that your pension, GAAP pension expenses
should decline dramatically next year or are you going to do things like take down the expected return because you are
now so well funded which would mitigate the impact of that decline?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, Brian.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Greg, it's Brian. So we have over time been de-risking our pension portfolio, shifting more of
the assets into fixed income, and away from equities, as we have become more fully funded. We are anticipating that in
a step-down basis, our pension costs will start to approach our annual draw on the pension, which will be close to about
$100 million. So next year, we anticipate it will be close to $125 million. And then we expect the expense over time
will approximate that $100 million per year level.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: And what was your pension expense budgeted for this year?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: We are anticipating it to be closer to $200 million, about $175 million, $180 million.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks very much. Take care.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Thanks, Greg.

And we have a question from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, good morning. How are you?
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Great. Just on the load growth questions Greg was asking, I guess if we were to draw it out
anything about the breakdown of customer growth on a more durable basis, do you think the commercial side continues
to show momentum and the laggards are going to be industrial or residential, how do you think within a flat load
growth profile do you see the customer classes behavior?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: You know, that's a great question. We see all three classes continuing to oscillate. And there
is a lot of discussion on whether just in general nature of the American economy moving to an industrial manufacturing
to more of a service economy. That would bode well for the commercial side of things.
On the other hand, we want some fundamental base of industrial and manufacturing to enable the sustaining nature of
commercial and ultimately residential growth. But to us, I think, I guess, the beauty of AEP is that we're in so many
areas of the country, and as Brian talked about, different parts of the country are experiencing different types of growth.
And based on that diversity and the diversity of the margins related to the components of the classes of customers, I
think, we're probably in pretty good stead to remain, at least from the overall perspective, being relatively flat, going
forward.
When you look at the components of the economy, though, in our service territory with the shale gas activity, with the
energy-related economy that we have in place, if we really start to see consumption pick up by a vibrant economy and

there is more focus on the energy infrastructure and the energy resources of this country, it's going to bode well for our
service territory.
So you could see – I mean you could see those kinds of measures pick up. But like I said earlier, that's all conjecture on
all of our parts at this point in time. I think it's going to take more of a federal and state policy and regulatory policy
that supports that kind of thing. And also, with the tax issues and things that need to be worked out by the federal
government, you're not – I mean you won't see much growth until we see some clarity around how to invest in this
country. And when you see that, I think, you will see a different makeup of what we're dealing with from a load cycle
perspective. But like I said we've been very conservative about it. We'll continue to be conservative until we see
indications otherwise. But when you look at the shale gas offsets, the chemical manufacturing sort of picking up a little
bit, that's sort of an early indication that maybe something is happening here, but it's hard to tell.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: And Nick, just on the shale gas related activity, how much of your industrial load is that today?
And can you give some color on how much that's been growing as an underlying class since it doesn't get broken out?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, Brian's got the detail on that?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: I do. Let me get to proper page here. And I'm having trouble finding it. So the pipeline and
oil & gas extraction are smaller percentages. It's in the 3% to 5% of our total industrial load. But the pipeline
transportation in particular grew at 26% for the quarter and well in the double digits for the year-to-date period. So
although it's smaller portions of our industrial load, the growth in those areas has been spectacular.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: And when you look at the Eagle Ford Shale area, for example, there is a whole list of
industrial manufacturing facilities that are coming online in Texas. Now some of them have been delayed in terms of
their startup, but you can see that kind of activity when you have a vibrant shale gas play in operation. And you are
now seeing Cline and there is another shale gas operation now in West Texas that's picking up as well. Oil and gas
activity is definitely now in a positive for the territory. And I think that's why you're seeing some of the commercial
activity in Ohio pick up as well, although the Utica Shale isn't as far along as the Eagle Ford Shale yet.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Hey, let me give you some more detail on that, Dan. Oil & gas extraction is 3.8% of total
industrial load. Pipeline transportation, our 10th largest sector, is 3.8% of industrial. And oil & gas extraction is up
almost 27% relative to the pre-recession peak. And the pipeline transportation is up 16% relative to the pre-recession
peak, so some pretty significant gains there over the last couple of years.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Great. Thank you, guys.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Good morning, Kit.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: So on the dividend increase, obviously two increases within three quarters here, and I get a
cumulative total of about 6.4% increase. What can we take away from this in terms of likely future growth in the
dividend, and when should we expect dividend change announcements in the future?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, I probably can't comment on the dividend change in the future, but I can say this is
consistent with what the board has laid out for us in terms of the expected range, the payout ratio, the 60% to 70%, and
they've also said that our dividend payout will be commensurate with the earnings capability of the company. So those
things, as long as it continues to play the way it is, then we should be in good shape.

<Q - Kit Konolige>: And Nick, you can't tell us anything about, should we expect dividend increases in the first
quarter, as previously, going back to that pattern or will it just be uncertain for a period of time?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, typically, we evaluate dividends in October, but you know, like I said, we'll have to
look at the situation at the time with our board and make that determination. But typically, typically it's October.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Right. Fair enough. And one other area to touch on. Previously, you've had a slide where you
show 2014 EPS range of $3.15 to $3.45, but I didn't see that in here. Are we just in a sort of quiet period for 2014 at
this stage or should we continue to think about 4% to 6% growth in 2014 off of the previous range for 2013?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, we haven't changed 2014. That guidance is still good.

And we do have a question from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: I wanted to follow up on load growth, apologies for the load growth questions but.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: That's okay.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: You had mentioned that in your long-term guidance, you are assuming flat load growth and
we've seen some challenging quarters here in terms of load growth. If load growth were to continue to trend negative,
as it has been, how much of a headwind is that to your overall growth aspiration?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes. It just depends on the components of what the load decreases are, because we have a
lot more margin in not only commercial but residential as well. So it'll depend on the components of it. But I can tell
you that if we continue to see load deterioration, then we believe we have the process in place to respond to that.
I keep saying this. This business is about optimization now. And you've got to remember too that I don't think load
growth gives you the entire picture of the earnings capability of the company, because we're having to reinvest in the
grid. We're having to invest not only from the distribution perspective but also the transmission enhancements
associated with it. And keep in mind too that we are producing earnings on the retail side beyond our own service
territory.
So, typically, we've always looked at load, because it was all like one integrated utility. And we had – we only had the
load increases. And really it's pretty measurable in terms of what the investment capability was, but we're sort of in a
different picture now where there will be more contributions from different areas. So but as that load changes, we'll
obviously be watching the makeup of that load, the financial impact of the margin capability of that load and making
adjustments accordingly.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: So, to Nick's point, Stephen, some of the challenges that we've seen in industrial, so far, we
know we're going to see at least through the third quarter of next year because of what's happened at that large Primary
Metals customer and to some degree that will be offset by what we're seeing in Chemicals, Pipeline Transportation, and
Oil & Gas Extraction. But in this year, we have seen that we're down overall load 1.7% year-to-date, but it's only
impacted earnings by $0.02 so far, so Nick's point that the combination of where we have load increases or declines
makes a huge difference as to what our results will be.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, and the large customer that shut down, even looking at that contract, and it was a
special contract obviously, when you look at that kind of financial impact, it was still negligible and we continued with
the earnings guidance that we provided. So I think you have to look at it really on a customer by customer basis and

what type of customer they are.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Fair point. And a lot of your growth is in areas like transmission that really are dependent on
load growth outlook.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: That's right.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: I guess just shifting over to the merchant side of the world, we've seen more challenging gas
environment, gas basis has been trending negative, as you think about the long-term merchant earnings outlook, and
think about the future, how does that factor in? Is that sort of in your current thinking in terms of – it's moving so
quickly, but just curious how you look at the headwinds in terms of the local gas price and the impact on power prices.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, it absolutely is in our thinking. You know, gas prices remain relatively low for a long
period of time. And I still believe they are going to remain low for the foreseeable future. And it's something that we
have to adjust to, from an unregulated standpoint, and Chuck Zebula who's taken over the generation, the unregulated
generation side of the group with the retail piece of it, he is very focused on bringing down his cost structure to enable
his business to continue to operate in a positive fashion.
And I mean there are several things you have to look at. One is certainly the natural gas picture. The other is the
capacity markets themselves. And the inability for those markets to actually pay long-term investors in appropriate
fashion, and that's something that we're working on as well.
And then also, the impact of distributor generation, although it's pretty minimal in our territory, you think about those
things, they're forcing functions for us to reform our business so that we can succeed in that kind of environment. And
that's what we're focused on and our board is really focused on that as well.

And we do have a question from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Hi, guys. Jonathan Arnold.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Hi there. The most – a couple of things were already answered. But I just wanted to – on
Greg's question about how long your – whether there's a definitive end point to your 4% to 6% growth aspiration, I
wasn't sure you really addressed that piece of the question.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No, that's our long-term growth forecast and it's as far as we can see at this point.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay, great. And then secondly, just as you look at it, assuming your load forecast of
around zero is the scenario you're dealing with, roughly how much of the 4% to 6% is coming from costs and
continuous improvement, and investment? Can you give us a kind of a little preview of maybe some of these EEI
buildups, is it half from cost savings, half from growth investments or some other mix?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, we'll certainly have more detail on that in November, but you know, we obviously are
making pretty good headway from a continuous improvement and cost reduction perspective. But you have to also
think about rates that have been put into effect, the transmission investment and all kinds of things together. So I
wouldn't look at one single area to determine what we're doing. So we'll certainly have more detail on that in
November.

And we do have a question from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good morning, congratulations.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: When did Ormet quit taking power and what's the strategy with Ohio to potentially mitigate
that?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, they shut down, I guess completely, just probably two weeks to three weeks ago; and
right now, there is no plan. I mean obviously from an Ohio perspective that was taken before the Ohio Commission, the
Ohio Commission dealt with it in the best way they could.
I think it was a situation where the world markets had a tremendous impact on all of the primary metals suppliers, and
that's really – I think that's going to be the primary driver as to what could happen in the future relative to those
particular types of businesses. So at this point, we're continuing on as business as usual, although it's unfortunate that
you wind up in a situation where so many jobs are impacted. But we have a lot of customers that have that kind of
experience. And certainly we did everything we could possibly do from a special contract perspective and from other
areas we're working with the Commission to enable them to stay in business as long as possible.
So I think we did everything we could do, and the Commission in our belief did everything that they could do. And I
think it's a matter of the business case itself supporting that kind of business in the future.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And can you just – I don't know if you've already shut the door on this next question – what's
your latest thinking about Ohio generation strategically?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes. We get that question a lot. From an Ohio generation perspective, we are still on path to
– our first course of action, obviously, is to complete corporate separation, to get that done. And then, secondly, Chuck
is busily working on what his cost structure is going to look like in the future to succeed in even a $59 per megawatt
day environment. We need to fully understand what that means.
And, also, we're pursuing changes within the PJM market construct to enable long-term investment decisions to be
made. Those are prerequisites for us to determine what the nature of that business is and does it fit within our portfolio
of companies. And I can't say at this point the timing of that; but certainly, I can tell you that our management, just like
our investors, are fully engaged in trying to determine that result, and our board obviously is very focused on those
types of issues as well. So it's not that we're sitting and waiting for corporate separation to complete before we start
thinking about it. I can assure you that a lot of thought is being given not only in terms of what milestones need to
occur, but also in terms of the information we need to make that kind of decision for the future.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, so we have the West Virginia case, that we ultimately want to complete, and then
there's three FERC-related cases that we intend on getting completed by the end of the year as well. And Brian, you
know the details on those?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: I don't. We got half of the – we filed for six, there are three more that are left to be done and
we don't have significant opposition in those. So we anticipate getting those shortly after we would be able to get what
we need from West Virginia.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, one's a Pool agreement. The other is – the operating agreements in place. And then
there is an interim agreement that would be put in place as well. If you need more detail, Rich Munczinski is here and
he can describe those for you.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: No, no, that's good.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Okay.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: But right now, it looks like those should all potentially be done by year end.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes. Three of them are already done and three to go in FERC, and then the corporate
separation. Yes.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: And then you've also got the other side of the financing and everything that's going on.
There's a lot of work going on associated with that activity as well.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay. Just a clarification from a follow-up on the dividend. So you increased it another 2%.
You had increased it 4% beginning of the year, the indicated rate, so that would be over 6%, but then you're saying that
this is a 4% increase for the year. I assume that's like the dividends paid?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, that's right.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: For this calendar year, up 4%?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: That's right.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: When we look forward to think about growth in the dividend, is it off dividends paid in
2013, or the indicated rate? It's just a different way of looking at dividend growth than we normally look at I think. So
I'm just curious.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It's just math, Steve, as you know. So what we're trying to do is as the board adjusted their
stated dividend payout ratio to that 60% to 70%, we're trying to stay in that range and I think you'll see us grow
earnings with regulated earnings over time.

<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Hi. Good morning. Just hopefully two quick questions. One is I guess I think you call it
the equalizer slide, slide four, and you give GAAP ROEs. Is there any way of getting maybe your regulated ROE here?

And the second question is related to I guess the aluminum sector or primary metal manufacturing, where Brian said
some of the manufacturers are using this opportunity to re-tool their plants. With the re-tooling, do you think that
makes them competitive in the current environment, and we get back to a pre-recession load or where do we settle back
in it?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: So let me start with the second question first, Anthony. So for instance, some of the things
that we've seen some people do in terms of re-tooling we have one customer who is taking down three boilers that they
had and are replacing it with a more, a single more efficient boiler. So in that case, they are becoming more efficient,
and we don't expect the load to come back to the pre-recession load.
In other instances, people are saying hey, prices aren't high enough here for us to continue operating at the levels that
we were. We're going to take the plant down. We're going to do preventive maintenance and get the plant back online
at a time when aluminum prices recover. So it's really a combination of both of those things. Some of it is efficiency
and the load will be reduced when it comes back, and another is just taking opportunistic outages.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: You know, the interesting thing we're seeing is, with the customers that are obviously still
connected to the system that haven't gone out of business, those are still the demand charges – the demand ratchet that's
in place for the industrial customers, has not diminished. So that's a positive in terms of sort of an indication of where
they are at this point in time.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: And then the equalizer.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, the equalizer graph.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, Anthony, we can definitely get for you the GAAP ROEs that are represented there. But
you are correct, in a place like Texas, we are having the effects of the securitization, and absent that, the regulated
wires return in Texas is much closer to 10%. So we can get you the detail on those for each of these, a GAAP return
rather than the pro forma earned ROEs that we have listed on the slide.
And as Nick was saying, about Ohio, if we had reflected the impact of the write-offs that we had, that 12.3% return that
you see there in Ohio would be significantly lower than what we're showing there. They're much closer to 6%.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: So, I guess, other than Ohio and Texas, I mean, the GAAP and regulated ROE are
within the same ballpark. It's just those two outliers. Just because if you think about the company can keep managing
costs, but one gets to wires to say, "Hey, you can't really manage costs in Ohio and AEP Texas because you're already
at 12%," whereas maybe the middle ground on this slide – I guess, it says here Oklahoma – you could manage costs but
I guess there is a big difference between GAAP and regulated. There is some nice opportunity there.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah, you got it. Those states in particular that you mention, Texas and Ohio, are outliers for
the reasons that we discuss.

getting, we have most of those increases in hand at this point.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. Also.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: And the magnitude is smaller too than it used to be. It used to be huge.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Yes. And then the – on Ohio customers switching, can you remind us at the end of the September
quarter, what the switching level was?

as you mentioned a couple of times off your original 2013 guidance, the fact that your original 2013 guidance has now
gone up, if you just focus on the midpoint, so when 2013 is an actual number, presumably higher than what it was
previously thought to be, would you stick to the guidance of the actual 2013 number or would you keep coming back to
the original guidance?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: We are going to keep coming back to the original guidance.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. So the implication would be, Nick, that if 2013 ends up higher, mathematically, the growth rate
slightly becomes lower than that? Is that the way to think about it?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, actually, it's the 4% to 6% from the original 2013 guidance and there's a bandwidth
there and we'll be operating within that bandwidth.
<Q - Ali Agha>: All right. Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes.

We do have a question from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hi. How're you? Can you hear me?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Oh, yes.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: I want to ask you about the Texas case and the write-off that we got there, is that – it sounds to
me that you guys were hoping to have that revised somewhat in your favor. Does the write-off reflect any change in
that or could you just elaborate a little bit on that?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, well, we got a little bit surprised because the Commission – during the entire case, we
had a cap put in place that was originally our estimate of the cost of construction but did not include AFUDC. And
during the whole pendency of that case, there was never an indication that the cost of financing or AFUDC would be
included in that cap.
And the Commission at the previous Commission hearing, they indicated that AFUDC was included in that, and that
sort of surprised us, surprised everyone, I think, and then they issued an order saying that it was included. And so the

write-off is commensurate with the – obviously recognition that if the cap is truly inclusive of that AFUDC cost, then
that precipitates a write-off from our perspective.
So we did that. We're going to ask – we're going to file for rehearing and show I think a pretty credible case, that it
never was discussed, and something that through the entire case, there is no record of our ability to respond to that kind
of component being included in the cost cap.
So I think it's a pretty serious issue for the Texas Commission to take up. Particularly when you have a power plant that
is the first of its kind, it's probably of the large projects that have occurred, it's been definitely the closest to budget. It's
been lower than what we anticipated from an efficiency standpoint, which inures to the benefit of customers from a fuel
cost perspective. And it's won two POWER Plant awards and we won the Edison Electric Award for that plant as well.
And so to have that kind of positive investment that's made, and it's found to be prudent, and to have a substantial
amount of the costs of the plant essentially be disallowed, is not a good message for those who are thinking about
building capacity in the State of Texas. So...
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Sure. I hear you on all of that. And it all makes sense. But I guess what I'm wondering is the
write-off though doesn't reflect any benefit from reconsideration or does it?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It does not.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No, it assumes...
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: We have an order from the Commission that does not allow for the recovery of the AFUDC
now, and we will go for re-hearing. If we get a positive outcome from re-hearing, then we will adjust accordingly. But
right now we can't assume anything.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: That's right.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: There is just no basis for that recognition.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And then for depreciation, the benefit that you guys got from that in the last couple of quarters,
can you remind me what that was?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: The benefit from.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: From lower depreciation. What's causing that, what's driving that?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It is the Ohio write-offs that we discussed earlier.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Thanks so much.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: And after this, I think we have time for one more question.

And now we do have a question from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hello Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hi, guys, congrats on a great quarter.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Thanks.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Brian, I want to make sure I understood your commentary about pension costs for the
income statement purposes. If I interpreted it correctly and I may have totally missed it, you're basically implying that
it's a $100 million tailwind for 2014 versus what you had expected for 2013?

<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Pension cost – pension expense will be about – it will be about a $50 million improvement
2013 to 2014.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. Meaning a reduction in the O&M expense that...
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Pension drives.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah. Now, let me be clear. That's total pension cost. That doesn't include the amount that's
allocated for CapEx versus O&M.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Understood. Completely understood. Also, I want to make sure we think about it on the
asset transfer dockets, both the Kentucky approval and West Virginia. Can you talk a little bit about the bottom line –
kind of what drops to the bottom line? I know you got the $44 million surcharge, but I'm just trying to think about what
the cost offsets to that would be and kind of trying to do the same thing on the West Virginia side.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, on West Virginia, we don't have an answer yet. But Off-System sales, obviously,
because that's not included, so that Off-System sale impact and, I guess.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: And then the capacity settlement.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: We get to keep, as we had previously. So the capacity payments that were in rates that
Kentucky used to make to Ohio Power remain in effect during the period of the freeze. So it's the plus $44 million,
keep the capacity payments and you keep the upside of Off-System sales until we go back in for the next rate case.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And how much is the capacity payment in Kentucky?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: About $20 million.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: $20 million.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And then when I think about the West Virginia request, just the request, I know you
don't have an answer, can you give kind of similar details about the bottom line impact on there, you know, kind of the
items which are a bottom line impact there?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes, it's a little complicated at this point, because of the Mitchell component that is up in the
air. But we would not anticipate a significant difference versus where we are today, but that will be the significant
component of what the settlements are, particularly in regards to how we handle the Mitchell assets in regard to the
Wheeling merger into APCo.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. I'll follow up offline on this one. Thanks, guys.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Thanks, Mike.
