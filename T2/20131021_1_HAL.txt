Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
David J. Lesar
Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Before I talk about another strong quarterly performance, I would
like to review the actions we've taken this year around our commitment to delivering shareholder returns to you. This
year, we have repurchased approximately $4.4 billion or 10% of our outstanding shares. Earlier this year, we
announced a 39% increase in our dividend. These actions reflect our continued confidence in the strength of our
business outlook. Going forward, we remain fully committed to increased shareholder returns. We are targeting a
dividend payout of at least 15% to 20% of net income, supplemented by additional systematic share buybacks, while
leaving room for any capital spending or acquisitions we may want to do. We have been and will continue to be
relentlessly focused on delivering best-in-class returns.
Now moving to the third quarter. Overall, I am pleased with our operational results. Total company revenue of $7.5
billion was a record quarter for Halliburton, while operating income was over $1.1 billion. We achieved record
revenues this quarter in our Boots & Coots, Cementing, Completion Tools, Drill Bits, Multi-Chem and Testing product
lines. From an operating income perspective, our Baroid, Completion Tools, Drill Bits and Testing product lines also
set new records.
Turning to the geographies. On a year-to-date basis, our Eastern Hemisphere growth continues to lead our peer group.
Compared to last year, third quarter year-over-year revenue and operating income grew 17% and 30% respectively.
Sequentially, the revenue improvement and 9% growth and operating income was driven by our Europe/Africa/CIS
region. In addition to record revenue in that region, we saw a strong sequential improvement in margins of 300 basis
points due to improved performance in our Russia, North Sea and Angola operations. Consistent with previous years,
we expect the fourth quarter in the Eastern Hemisphere to be our strongest quarter of the year due to seasonal year-end
software and equipment sales.
Moving to Latin America. This has been a tough year as customer activity did not meet our expectations, and Jeff will
talk more about our fourth quarter outlook. But as we look ahead to Latin America over the next few years, there are
several positive factors coming into play. First, Mexico activities are expected to pick up significantly as the
mega-tender projects ramp up in the first part of 2014. And although we do not expect a material impact next year, the
recent reform discussions signal a strong opportunity in Mexico's shale and deepwater markets.
In Brazil, we have a leading market share today in a number of long-term deepwater contracts including some that
could extend past 2020. Although activity levels are just treading water today, as deepwater activity level accelerates,
we see significant upside in Brazil. However, there could be some short-term bumps in the road, but in the long-term,
Latin America is expected to be an outstanding growth market for Halliburton.
In North America, we are expecting the typical seasonal decline in the fourth quarter that we have experienced in
previous years. However, there are some additional transitory issues we are currently facing. Due to the recent floods in
Colorado, logistical disruptions in the Niobrara, where we have a very high market share, are lingering into the fourth
quarter, which is continuing to impact our efficiency and cost structure in that basin. These cost inefficiencies should be
fixed by the end of the year.

In pricing, the North America market continues to have excess supply of pressure pumping equipment, and although
this is improving, we anticipate pricing pressure will continue as contracts review during the next quarter or so.
Accordingly, we are already working on adjusting our cost structure. Despite these transitory issues, we believe that we
will see margin improvement as we go through 2014 for a number of reasons.
First, the efficiency trend on land plays right to our strengths. We are not only leading the industry in execution and
surface efficiency, but we are now introducing new technologies which are changing the ways that customers approach
their subsurface and you will hear more about these at our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks.
In the Gulf of Mexico, activity levels are improving. Current rigs are shifting from drilling to completions where we
have a leading market position. There are a dozen or so deepwater rigs scheduled on the calendar to arrive in the Gulf
next year and on those we've secured a strong drilling and evaluation position.
And thirdly, our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives are being rolled out now. I have seen them start to operate
in the field, the benefits are real and we expect that they will be substantial. We have invested a significant amount of
money in our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives. As we told you on our last call, while we roll out these two
broad corporate initiatives, we are continuously looking for ways to use them to better manage our cost structure in the
organization.
During the third quarter based on the progress of these initiatives, we've made adjustments to head count and assets that
resulted in a charge. As we continue with the deployment of our Battle Red initiative over the next few quarters, we
expect for there to be additional head count reductions and related severance charges. However, again, as you will see
at our upcoming Analyst Day, we are expecting a large future payoff for these initiatives.
So overall, I am very optimistic about Halliburton's relative performance as we move into 2014. And based on early
conversations with our customers, we are anticipating overall spend levels to increase. Our strategy is working well and
we intend to stay the course. At our Analyst Day, we intend to provide you more detail about our outlook for the
coming years, our ability to outperform our peer group, how we will continue to balance our geographical portfolio and
describe our path toward normalized margins for both the Eastern and Western Hemisphere operations. We will
continue to drive toward expanding our global portfolio in the deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals.
Now, let me turn the call over to Jeff for some operational details.
Jeffrey Allen Miller
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our third quarter results. The Eastern
Hemisphere had record revenue in the third quarter with sequential operating income growth of 9% driven by record
quarterly revenue and improved profitability in our Europe, Africa and CIS region. Relative to the second quarter,
Europe/Africa/CIS grew both revenue and operating income by 3% and 29% respectively. The sequential improvement
was led by improved cementing, Boots & Coots activity in Russia, increased drilling and cementing activity in the
North Sea and higher drilling and completion tools sales in Angola.
In Norway, Statoil has awarded contracts to Halliburton that provide us with the leading market share in multiple
services including drilling and completion fluids, cementing, stimulation, special tools and waste management for both
onshore and offshore. The initial scope of this contract is for three years with up to six years in extensions. This award
represents a significant statement of confidence from our customer for the value-added technologies that we are
bringing to the` Norwegian market.
In addition, we are expanding our testing portfolio in the pre-salt deepwater market in Angola. In addition to discrete
testing awards for drill stem testing and our DynaLink service, Halliburton has recently been awarded contracts by
multiple customers to provide a full suite of testing and sub-sea services in their pre-salt operations. Activity on these
wins is expected to start throughout 2014 and will give Halliburton a significant position for testing and sub-sea
services in the Angola pre-salt market. In conjunction with our successes in testing offshore discovery wells elsewhere

in Africa and in Brazil, these wins demonstrate the strength of our deepwater testing and sub-sea business.
In the Middle East/Asia region compared to the prior quarter, revenue and operating income were lower by 2% and 5%
respectively. Higher activity in Saudi Arabia was partially offset by activity delays for stimulation activity in Australia.
Also contributing to the sequential decline was the prior quarter benefit from the conclusion of the Majnoon project in
Iraq and increased completions activity in Malaysia that did not repeat.
Let me speak specifically to the Kurdistan market for a moment. This is an area that until now has been primarily
focused on exploration but we're expecting development work will ramp up over the next few years following a series
of successful appraisal programs. Halliburton has completed construction of a large multi-product line facility in
Kurdistan and we're mobilizing for recent awards in cementing, Sperry, Baroid, among other product lines. We're still
in early days but we expect this to be a growth market for Halliburton.
In Saudi Arabia, Halliburton was awarded an important three-year contract to drill and complete new wells in an
existing field. Saudi Arabia is a core market for Halliburton and we believe this win demonstrates our customers'
confidence in Halliburton's ability to help plan and mobilize to execute a significant program award.
Turning to Latin America, we saw significant improvement compared to the second quarter as revenues increased 6%
sequentially and operating income improved by 57%. Mexico was the primary driver where recent contract approvals
resulted in an increase in the consulting and software revenue for the quarter. In the offshore market, stimulation vessel
utilization was improved relative to the first half of the year. Additionally, improved profitability in wireline and
cementing in Argentina contributed to the sequential growth. The improved results in Mexico and Argentina more than
offset the activity-related weakness in Brazil and Venezuela.
With respect to Brazil and Mexico, we believe that the fourth quarter activity levels may be significantly lower than
originally anticipated. There are two primary reasons for this decrease.
First, in Mexico, activity levels on our Southern Alliance II project are expected to decline meaningfully over the
remaining months of the year as Pemex ramps down the ongoing IPM work in preparation for the mega-tenders. We
averaged seven rigs in the Southern Alliance project during the third quarter and expect to exit the year at two rigs. This
lower level of activity is then expected to continue through early 2014 until the new mega-tender projects are expected
to ramp up.
Second, in Brazil, we've seen a significant reduction in drilling activity over the course of the year with a shift in focus
to completions. In addition, we're currently operating under a cost structure in line with the original scope of work,
which has not materialized. We're working with our customer to right-size our operational footprint, but we expect
reduced activity levels to extend through the fourth quarter and continue into the next year.
Ultimately, this does not change our long-term positive outlook for Latin America. The transition to the mega-tenders
in Mexico in conjunction with the startup of our incentivized Humapa contract and an improved deepwater rig count
give us confidence that the activity levels in Mexico will recover as each of these areas gets underway.
And in Brazil, our recent deepwater contracts have a potential term of up to eight years. So although drilling activity
may track sideways for several quarters, Brazil remains the largest and most active deepwater market in the world and
we believe higher drilling activity levels will resume. As a result, we expect both these countries to continue to be
strong contributors to our growth and profitability over time.
Now, switching to North America, despite a significant revenue and operating income disruption from the Colorado
floods, we delivered sequential revenue growth and higher operating income. Activity levels improved across the rest
of the U.S. land market with seasonal recovery in Canada and increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater
market.
U.S. land rig count remains sluggish and the focus from our customers continues to be on pad operations and on
drilling efficiency. As we discussed in our previous call, multi-well pads account for over half of our customers'
drilling activities in key North America basins including the Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Niobrara and we see
this percentage increasing.

But more importantly, we see increased service efficiency on horizontal drilling which is providing a mid-teens
percentage reduction in drilling days on a year-over-year basis. And together, these two efficiency factors are
contributing to a well count that has modestly improved even in a flat rig environment.
We're also seeing a trend towards increasing stage counts per well, and in certain basins, increased volumes pumped
per stage. Already, we have seen average stage count per well increased by 15% to 20% year-over-year in the Eagle
Ford and in the Marcellus.
We're still in an oversupplied market today with as much as 20% excess pressure pumping capacity. Nevertheless, we
believe that an increase in wells drilled per rig combined with greater service intensity driven by increased fluid and
profit volumes per well will ultimately help balance the market. We believe that these trends play to Halliburton's
strength as the leading service provider in North America. In the Gulf of Mexico, we saw sequential improvement,
tempered by some activity delays and extended dry dock maintenance on one of our large stimulation vessels.
In the fourth quarter, we expect revenue improvement in the Gulf, as that vessel returns to service as well as higher
completions activity and end-of-year sales. Looking ahead, we're excited about expanding our share position in this
growing market. In addition to our leading completions position, we recently deployed two new vessels focused on the
shelf, an intervention vessel and a fit-for-purpose stimulation vessel. Additionally, we believe we are well-positioned
with drilling and evaluation services on the next round of incoming deepwater rigs.
To recap North America, activity levels continue to improve across the U.S. landmark at this quarter despite the
disruption from the Colorado floods. Increased rig efficiency combined with greater service intensity continues to
benefit us even with the rig count that is flat. We are increasingly optimistic about 2014 based on early data points and
will continue to be very focused on our cost structure to enable margin growth in the coming year.
Internationally, we're very pleased with our year-over-year growth. In spite of short-term activity disruptions in Latin
America this year, we have led our peer group in year-to-date growth and plan to continue balancing our geographic
portfolio and growing our global business going forward.
And now, Mark will provide some additional financial commentary. Mark?
Mark A. McCollum
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Dave discussed, we're continuously evaluating our cost structure within
the organization as we deploy our corporate initiatives. The ongoing Frac of the Future build, as well as the final
deployment of our Battle Red program, is having a significant impact on the support and operational head count needs
of North America as well as equipment and inventory requirements. During the third quarter, as we began to roll out
these initiatives, we completed an initial evaluation of these areas and took our first action which resulted in severance
and other charges during the quarter of approximately $38 million after tax. As Dave said, based on the early impact of
these strategic initiatives, we believe that further rollout may result in some additional adjustments going forward.
Our corporate and other expense came in at $102 million this quarter, slightly lower than expected due to lower cost for
our strategic initiatives and to the lower legal expenses. Approximately, $27 million of our corporate costs were for
continued investment in Battle Red and other strategic initiatives. We anticipate the impact of these investments will be
approximately $0.03 per share after tax in the fourth quarter, as we begin the field deployment of the last phases of the
North America Battle Red initiative. In total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will be between $110 million and
$120 million for the fourth quarter.
Our effective tax rate this quarter came in at 29.5%, in line with our previous guidance. For the fourth quarter, we
anticipate that our tax rate will be approximately 29%. Our capital expenditure guidance of approximately $3 billion for
the full year remains unchanged.
Also during the quarter, we purchased 68 million shares of common stock at a price of $48.50 per share for an
aggregate cost of $3.3 billion excluding fees and expenses related to our tender offer. These shares represented

approximately 7.4% of our total number of outstanding shares. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 10%
of our outstanding common stock. We have approximately $1.7 billion remaining in board authorization for future
share repurchases. For the fourth quarter, our average share count is expected to be approximately 855 million shares
outstanding, which reflects the full benefit of our share buyback to date. Additionally, due to our recent $3 billion debt
offering, we expect interest expense to average approximately $100 million per quarter going forward.
Now, moving on to our near-term outlook. For our Eastern Hemisphere business, we currently expect fourth quarter
year-over-year revenue to increase by low double digits with a meaningful sequential improvement in margins into the
high-teens. As mentioned earlier, Latin America's sequential growth in margins are expected to be significantly
impacted by activity levels in Mexico. For the fourth quarter, we now anticipate Latin America revenue to be flat
sequentially and do not expect a material change in margins relative to the third quarter.
Finally, for North America, we anticipate the typical weather and holiday-related seasonal decline in revenue and
margins in the fourth quarter with the transitory issues Dave outlined earlier weighing on the number a little more than
usual. As a result, we believe North America will be down sequentially although we are not expecting as sharp of a
decline as we had in 2012.
As we move into 2014, we anticipate North America margins to recover as customer activity resumes and we see the
payoff of our strategic efficiency programs and recent cost optimization efforts.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments. Dave?
David J. Lesar
Okay, thanks, Mark. So just a quick summary. Eastern Hemisphere continues to deliver top-tier growth leading the
industry year-to-date and we expect a strong fourth quarter with margins in the high-teens. Latin America will be
flattish but expect strong growth in 2014. For North America, we anticipate typical seasonality in the fourth quarter
with some pricing pressure and lingering effects of the Colorado floods, but margin improvement as we go into 2014.
And finally, as demonstrated by our dividend increase earlier this year and the repurchase of 10% of our shares, we are
very confident in the strength of our business outlook and are focused on delivering leading shareholder returns.
So with that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Morning.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: And congratulations on continued strong growth in this semester, very impressive. Dave,
a question for you about the outlook for 2014 specifically on the international side. Your peers seem to be coalescing
around E&P spending growth somewhere in the 10% range with a higher technology content which, of course, plays
into your strength as well as theirs. Is that similar to your thinking initially?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yes, absolutely. I think based on discussions with customers sort of contract flow that we've got
in hand, I would be surprised if it isn't around that number for next year.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then perhaps a little bit of an unrelated follow-up for me
with the Colorado flooding, I know, Mark, you had mentioned at a presentation that you thought it was $0.02 to $0.03

in the third quarter but that was an initial assessment. Do you have an updated number or some type of sizing of that
impact that we could think about?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: James, this is Jeff. For competitive reasons, we are not going to give you the number just
because other than to say that it's certainly an important part of our business and I guess I would leave you with absent
that, it would have been enough to move our completion margins up for North America.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey of ISI Group. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hi, Jud.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: A question on your Latin America markets. Two biggest markets, Mexico and Brazil, have some
different issues going on. I was wondering if you could help us think about margins beyond the fourth quarter. What
has to happen in Brazil in 2014 and in Mexico to see a nice recovery in margins? Is it just a simple increase in activity
or there's some other things you guys can do to facilitate better margin growth for Latin America in 2014?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Hey, Jud, Jeff here. I would say that Brazil it's a combination of activity increase would
help as well as rightsizing our investment, which we're in the process of doing now. So there are some things that we
can do and others that we need the client to do. With respect to Mexico, I think we really need to see sort of a settling
down of all the moving pieces which right now we've got incentivized contracts get started which certainly helps us as
well as sort of the turnover in the contracting around these mega tenders also brings some stability. And so I think those
two things do as much as any to sort of improve margins into next year.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Okay. Would it be fair to say that the visibility in both those markets is fairly limited near-term
and if you do get some margin improvement, is it going to be more backend loaded for the year? Or is there some
reason we could see better improvement earlier in the year?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, I would say we typically see quite a bit of seasonality in Latin America and so all
the moving parts I don't think help in Q1. So I would say it would tend to be more backend weighted.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Okay.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Our general profitability in Mexico is very strong, and so when this activity does kick up
and kick back in, we expect a fairly good and solid snapback. As Jeff said, we're getting started in these new contracts
in Brazil. We need more activity but even starting those for there'll be a period of time when the Brazil margins may be
detrimental to our overall Latin America margins, but remember, these are very long-term contracts, eight years and
longer and they'll be significant up-sell opportunities as those contracts gain traction and we have the ability to
introduce new technologies into that marketplace.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Okay. That's good color. Thank you. And my second question just relates to the U.S. land
market. I know your customers are still going through the budgeting process, but maybe you could share with us
anything you're hearing from your customers in terms of giving us a little more color on your thoughts for 2014 in
terms of activity levels and what your customers are telling you for next year?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, for 2014, the outlook's fairly strong. I mean the discussions we're having now sees
confidence in the oil window and continuing to invest. So we certainly have a positive outlook for 2014.

efficiencies. Everybody is very, very focused on continuing to drive efficiencies in the marketplace.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. Back to North America and the Q4 seasonality. Dave, I think you
prophesied a typical seasonality in the Q4, and yet what unfolded in the third quarter was largely atypical with regard to
the flooding in Colorado. So wouldn't that mute the seasonality in the fourth quarter relative to the third?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Well, I guess if we were up and blowing and going in the Niobrara, it might, but as I said, that's
sort of lingering into Q4 and I think it's fair to say the visibility on Q4 right now is not as great as we'd like it to be
because based on conversations we're having with customers and the holiday work schedule is sort of one of the big
unknowns at this point in time with Christmas sort of falling in the middle of the week, and just sort of where various
customers are in terms of spending their budgets for the year, and those sorts of things. So I think we're just as we sit
here today, what we see is a typical Q4 unfolding in front of us, and if it changes from that, obviously, we'll have either
a positive or a negative impact from there.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Got it. And with regard to capital allocation, I know you guys are not done with your planning
process, but could you just give us some broad parameters with regard to capital spending for 2014? And then
moreover, the mechanics of the dividend implementation, 15% to 20% of net income, when does that get announced?
And what is that predicated on? Is that an internal view as to what you guys will be generating in terms of net income,
or what?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Okay. So on the capital side, it is still early in the planning process, but I think that right now as
we look ahead while we're pretty excited about the growth trajectory going into 2014, we're driving hard on efficiencies
and so that will probably continue to allow us to be more disciplined around how much capital we're putting into the
marketplace. So we don't sit here today expecting a significant increase in capital overall. There'll be some specific
projects, maybe some reorientation within the budget. We'll continue to roll out our Q-10s and the Frac of the Future
into the North America marketplace. And the question is how rapidly do we do that vis-à-vis the overall market
trajectory? But right now, I don't see significant changes in the capital overall.
The dividend policy, 15% to 20% of net income, it will always be sort of a moving target. The board has the discretion
to set that dividend target. They do so always and looking not just at the net income but also our cash flow and looking
at our relative investment opportunities that fall ahead of us. I guess the answer is stay-tuned and we'll be talking with
the board and making adjustments as necessary. But our cash flow continues to be very, very positive even with all the
actions that we took this quarter, we're very pleased with the cash flow in the quarter.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Thank you. My question relates to international service pricing. What are you seeing there?
And is it the same trends or are you seeing some better pricing now?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: This is Jeff. Yeah, as we look out into the Eastern Hemisphere, we continue to see steady
improvement, but no inflection point if that's where that question is leading. So there is a lot of visibility on the growth
in the Eastern Hemisphere or internationally and to a large degree, we're built into that.

<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah and, Waqar, I guess, this is Dave. I'd also add to that. Any tendering on large projects still
is tending to be very, very competitive.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: What will it take to change that kind of competitive pressure? What do you think the industry
needs to see?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: With the industry – it would be a dislocation sort of event where there's inadequate
capacity to meet demand. But I would say that, as Dave said, the majority of the contracts are fairly large and there is a
lot of visibility of those contracts. So I don't see kind of any surprises in the Eastern Hemisphere that would create that
sort of supply/demand dislocation.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: And then vis-à-vis Brazil, you mentioned about rightsizing and you also mentioned that you
need to get customer approval for that. By when do you think you'll know one way or the other whether you can
right-size there or not? What's kind of the timeline there?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, we expect to see some of those answers into Q1, I would expect. Okay. Okay, next?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Hey, Angie.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Hi. So we talked a little bit about on your last conference call. Can you give us your updated
thoughts on the U.S. pressure pumping markets and maybe you could reach equilibrium and in conjunction with that on
the Frac of the Future initiative given this competitive environment, is there value to rolling out the Frac of the Future
program at an accelerated pace? And as you're rolling out this program, are you retiring or relocating equipment?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, with respect to Frac of the Future, we are continuing to roll that out and as we've
rolled it out, we've retired equipment or moved that equipment overseas. So, yes, we see value in continuing that
program and getting the equipment into the market. With respect to attrition sort of on the back of current utilization in
North America as we said there's about a 20%, we believe, oversupply in the market now though we do see increasing
drilling efficiency sort of the rate that is greater than increasing completion efficiency. And because of that, we expect
to see attrition continue. At what point that is expect certainly out into next year, late next year or beyond though any
spike in gas activity would certainly take that out very quickly.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. So you're thinking at this point late this year, or late 2014 or potentially even early
2015?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: That's right.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. And then as an unrelated follow-up, can you give us an update on your efforts to enter
the artificial lift segment? I know you purchased a smaller artificial lift company some time ago. Are there other
acquisition opportunities out there or do you think you can grow this business internally? And if you do grow it
internally, how long do you think it will take to have critical mass in the segment?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Angie, this is Dave. Let me handle that one. Yeah, we talked over the last couple of calls about
the entry into artificial lift especially ESPs and I can tell you, it's a fantastic business. So it's one of our fastest-growing
businesses although it's not big enough to move the needle for us right now. But because we like it so much, we're
going to look at both driving organic growth as well as bolt-on acquisitions.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks. Good morning. On the Europe/Africa/CIS side, I noticed that the C&P margins really
spiked this quarter. I was just wondering is this from pulling forward product sales into the third quarter? And
therefore, should we expect those margins to kind of head back into the mid-teens in the fourth quarter?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: No. I mean this is just on the back of a strengthening business both completions and
stimulation, so, yeah.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. That's great. Okay. And I had one other question, it was completely unrelated here. Just
on your Battle Red and the Frac of the Future, I was just sort of wondering if you could just kind of help us
conceptualize how the impact is going to play out here? Can you just kind of tell us like what if you look and say one
of your frac fleet, say, two years ago versus one of the new fleets today, where is the biggest difference here in terms of
the cost and efficiency? You've talked about kind of reducing labor? I'm just wondering is it the size of the frac spread.
Is it the reduced maintenance spending? Now, you've been into this for at least a couple years now, where do you see
the biggest impact here?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Stay tuned for our Analyst Day, Dave. We're going to lay it all out here in a couple of weeks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Good morning, guys.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Jim.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Your CapEx is significantly above your DD&A and has been for a while, and it's
significantly higher on a ratio basis above your peers. Now, you're generating fabulous returns on capital, so I'm not
complaining but can you explain to us why your CapEx versus your DD&A is so much higher than your peers?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: I don't have enough insight into our peers to understand what they are doing on their
capital spending. I know what drives ours. We, for a long time, were spending a lot of maintenance costs on old fully
depreciated equipment. So when we evaluate what we're doing, we're looking at maintenance cost and depreciation and
sort of a combined hold and so, yes, our depreciation is going up as we have new equipment. We have relatively fast
depreciation rates relative to useful lives of that equipment.
In terms of what we can do with it long-term, and it's driving our maintenance cost down on a percentage of revenue
basis overall. So it's a zero-sum game. The other thing that we've, of course, had to do over the last several years is
make some fairly substantial investments in manufacturing, technology centers and fixed assets, basis and things
around the world to position ourselves for the growth in Eastern Hemisphere, Latin America that we're achieving. And
so it may not look as productive, but the fact is that's the ante for being able to be there and to serve those customers in
the places around the world. And so that's been a fairly large percentage of our overall CapEx and that will probably
continue as we continue to expand in particularly in the unconventional market around the world over the next several
years.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, Jim. This is Dave. Let me just give you a little perspective on what Mark's saying. If you
add up the amount that we've spent on manufacturing in our big new facility in Singapore, our big new technology
centers in Houston and in Saudi and Brazil, they are probably pushing $1 billion just for those plus you add up the
infrastructure we've built out in the U.S. to help our logistics, and those are sort of current cash flow, long-term
depreciation but I'm telling you, long-term payback things for Halliburton. So I think that we've had a spike in sort of
the fixed assets side of the business but they will pay off in the long run.

<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: No. Like I say, it's the returns you're generating, I'm not complaining, but I was curious. My
follow-up, if I could, Battle Red when we hear you have record revenues but that you're laying people off, people get
spooked. They think that's foreshadowing. Where is the Battle Red initiative? Where are the layoffs being done? Is this
only U.S. initiative so far? I realize they're initiatives but can you kind of tell us where the target or goal is in terms of
people, where it's occurring so we can have greater confidence that this isn't foreshadowing for some slowdown?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, Jim, the bulk of that was in North America. It was geared around our efficiency drive,
and it was taking out basically as we figure out how to do things more efficiently, we find that there are people that are
excess. We're able to effectively do more efficient work in the back-office and also even at the cold face, so our ability
to re-look at how efficiently we go to work. So I would say that's not foreshadowing. What that is, is really the coming
to fruition of sort of our confidence in the ability to execute the work either with fewer people or fewer people in the
back-office.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Brad.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Maybe I'll stick with the Western Hemisphere as well, please, and start with a question that may
feel a little bit more open-ended than I'd like, but let's see how you guys respond to it. I guess I'm curious as 2014 is
shaping up for you whether you see the relative opportunity? If looking at things like reduced cluster spacing, higher
sand per stage, some of the things you've mentioned, I guess I'm curious whether the opportunity seems more bent or
more shaped by more customers of yours adopting those kinds of measures more aggressively? Or in other words, sort
of almost raising the averages, if you will, across the landscape? Or if it is a little bit more sort of rig count and well
count driven?
<A - David J. Lesar>: That is more customer-driven than that is rig count driven, and I think this is really just a view
of how to get better frac propagation, what could be the technologies. And so I would say it is a technical view more so
than it is sort of the overall averages just moving up.
<Q - Brad Handler>: In other words – okay, but more of your customers applying some of those enhanced recovery,
if you will, or enhanced techniques?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yes, I guess, Brad, we've talked about in the past. It's really service intensity, and that's sort of
service intensity beyond just getting more fracs or more wells down per pad. It's actually now applying some of the
new technologies that we have to make better wells, lower cost of BOE and make our customers more money, but also
generate additional revenues for us. And then if the rig count kicks up on top of that, that would just be additional plus
to the upside.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Right. Okay. That's some food for thought. And unrelated follow-up, I would appreciate some
more clarity also on Mexico. If your current activity is declining at least onshore? First of all, is the jack-up market at
all an offset here, even as you hit early in 2014?
And then secondly, can you maybe just give us an update on the mega-tenders and if there's been any kind of delay in
terms of your expectations in terms of getting those awarded and again trying to place when some of that work might
kick in for everybody?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yes. I mean there are offsets. That's a big market in Mexico. So there are offsets. There's
offshore work that's being done; there's deepwater work that's being done. So there are and, for example, the
incentivized contracts. So there are offsets in that market. But with that said, the mega-tenders are important because
it's sort of refreshes budgets and resets the table in terms of work well into the future. As far as the timing of that goes,
no, I'm not surprised by where that stands. We knew that, that would be a large undertaking and take time for our

clients to get organized around how to put that out. So, again, our view is sort of early or excuse me, early Q2 as a
realistic sort of startup time for that activity if things proceed as planned.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Thanks. Jeff, you mentioned the completion efficiencies are increasing at a slower rate than
the drilling efficiencies. Just hoping to get some order of magnitude here, and what technologies should we be keeping
an eye on that could flip this? In other words, what technologies might make completion efficiencies outpace drilling
efficiencies going forward and just perpetuating the oversupply in frac?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. As we look at that, if we think that the drilling efficiencies up in the kind of 20%
range and we look at completion efficiency somewhat less than that, we see probably about a net 7%, 8% sort of
efficiency in drilling that sort of outpacing the efficiency and completions. I think one of the things that tempers
completion efficiency is going to be kind of the size of the jobs and the amount of activity requires completions
actually get in some cases bigger rather than smaller. Again, this is where the frac propagation happens. So, again, my
outlook is that we continue to attrit the equipment over time as opposed to the other.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Okay. And then, Mark, you mentioned that North American margins would be down in the
fourth quarter but not as bad as last year. Does this mean for margins we should be assuming kind of a normal seasonal
decline, 50 basis points, 100 basis points just on our numbers?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Yes. That's exactly what you should expect.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Morning.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Hi, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hi. Just curious you guys have addressed the excess capacity situation we continue to do this it
seems on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And just want to get an update from you as to whether – your latest thoughts as to
when you think the supply/demand curves may balance. Any guesses on that in 2014?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, this is Jeff. I would say that it's late 2014 or early 2015 by the time that we start to
see that tightening though as I've just described, I do think that we are down the path that consumes more equipment
rather than adding more equipment.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then you guys referenced some contract renewals and re-pricing and so on. In
general, what kind of magnitude of pricing pressures are you seeing at this point vis-à-vis your prior contracts?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Kurt, for competitive reasons, that's something we just can't give. Sorry.

<Q - James D. Crandell>: Good morning. You said in the, I think, your press release that you had lower profits from
Iraq. And then you stated on your call about the Majnoon contract ending. I thought you had written that down to
breakeven anyway. Could you reconcile that for me?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Jim, what happened in the second quarter, as we really made a hard push to get that
contract done at the end of the second quarter, it spilled over a little bit, but the reality of that push and kind of
increased our profitability on that contract as we kind of took it across the finish line. Now, it's over and while there's a
little bit of work left, sort of a very small phase two, we sort of finished that first phase of those big contracts, the initial
awarded contracts. And so it has an impact of reducing the overall profitability in Iraq overall. But that isn't to say that
we're losing money there, just the opposite. In fact, as we go forward on our new contracts, we're trying to be very, very
disciplined about the work that we take on and making sure that it continues to improve our profitability in that region
going forward. It's just sort of...
<Q - James D. Crandell>: How do you – how do you see...
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: ...the magnitude of the dollar, it's not the margins...
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Mark, how do you see the overall levels of activity trending for Halliburton in Iraq going
forward?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Go ahead, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, I've got a positive outlook on our activity as we go into 2014. So what I would say
is we are much more disciplined around the contracts that we pursue and the terms under which we'll accept them. So
it's returns and margins first as opposed to top line growth and we've been, as I said, very disciplined about that. And so
I'm confident that we will grow that business but again grow business that we can all be happy with.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. And just one quick follow-up. Did you say that the price deterioration that you're
seeing in the U.S. and that you expect in the U.S. is frac only? And are there any other product lines in the quarter
which experienced price deterioration in the U.S.?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Jim, this is Jeff. No, I would say that the pricing pressure we see is more widespread than
just fracturing.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: With Q4 a heavier time of the year for contract rollovers in the frac market and spot crews for the
industry generally just not making any money, I think it's obvious that contracts will be a bit more competitive. Or
could you just talk about how your strategy, as you go into these rollovers, how you seek to differentiate yourselves?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: From a differentiation standpoint, Jeff, we absolutely believe that in our ability to deliver
efficiency, we've got technology like – running through them with PermStim, but a whole range of chemistry
technologies and others that absolutely differentiate Halliburton in the market. And so as we look at contracts in any
sort of environment, those are the things that we turn to and then our clients count on how Halliburton to do.
<A - David J. Lesar>: The competition varies basin to basin. And so depending on the amount of capacity that's there
or the complexity of the reservoir, we can make a different value proposition with customers on differentiation. In some
cases where they've gone off and a customer has experienced what someone else has done, we've been able to take that
work back a little bit higher price.

<Q - Jeff Tillery>: And then around Battle Red, it's been focused, from my understanding, mostly in North America
with the successes you're having there any reason to think you won't continue this push globally?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: No.
<A - David J. Lesar>: No. We expect that as we go into 2014 and beyond, we'll be staging the rollout once we kind of
get all the kinks out in North America, the rest of the world is ready to go and so we'll be rolling those out over time
although probably at a slightly slower pace than we used for the North America rollout just given its size and
complexity.
<A - Kelly Youngblood>: Sam, we probably have time for one more caller.
Operator
Yes, sir. Our final question comes from Scott Gruber of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. So back on the domestic frac market, pricing continues to
decline, but it appears that the operating margins for the industry is actually up. Is it fair to say that the primary driver
of the pricing weakness today is a willingness by the pumpers to actually lower rates to improve asset turns via these
24-hour services? My question is, actually, would we still be seeing pricing declines if there wasn't a trend toward more
24-hour work?
<A - David J. Lesar>: The question was would we see a decline without the 24-hour work.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: It's an interesting question.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, I don't know for sure whether we would know that or not, because obviously you can't
ever exactly know what motivates our competitors to sort of come in with the pricing that they do, but I do think that
oftentimes what we're seeing is, gosh, really wanting to get equipment to work and willing to take a lower price, if
that's necessary to do that.
The question always is, okay, but are they really creating the value for the customer? In our sort of overall value
proposition, we're always focused on, it's not just the cost per stage to the customer, but what are they achieving on an
increased production, driving down the overall cost on a per BOE basis. When customers get focused on that, I think
that the results begin to change in our favor.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Well, are you still seeing declines and pricing for single spud wells? Or I mean can you
identify contracts, new incremental 24-hour work where the pricing pressure is a lot more severe as pumpers compete
for that work? The asset turn improvement is huge.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, I guess what I'd say, we don't pursue that one-off market that you just described, and
so I would just, from competitive standpoint, I wouldn't walk through our contracts and our pricing on those different
contracts. So suffice to say that we tend to work in a more contracted fashion over a longer period of time.
Operator
Thank you. And at this time, I turn the call back to management for any closing comments.
