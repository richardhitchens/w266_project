MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Accenture's first quarter fiscal 2014
(sic) [2015] earnings conference call. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity
for your questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. KC McClure. Please go
ahead.
KC McClure
Thank you, Tom, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings announcement. As
Tom just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre
Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Roland, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter.
Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides our business outlook for the
second quarter and full fiscal year 2015. We will then take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end
of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or
net revenue. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward looking, and as
such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to risk factors set forth in
today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other

call.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in
our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at Accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes
no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
We had an excellent first quarter, and I'm extremely pleased with our results. Our revenue growth was broad-based,
including strong growth in both consulting and outsourcing as well as double-digit local currency growth in four of our
five operating groups. We expanded operating margin, delivered double-digit EPS growth, and returned substantial
cash to our shareholders. Our very strong results demonstrate that we're executing a growth strategy that is both highly
relevant to our clients and highly differentiating for Accenture. David will provide more detail in a moment, but here
are a few highlights from the quarter.
We delivered new bookings of $7.7 billion, in line with our expectations. We grew revenues 10% in local currency,
gaining significant market share. We delivered outstanding earnings per share of $1.29, a 12% increase. We delivered
operating margin of 15%, a 20 basis point expansion. We generated very strong free cash flow of $821 million and
continued to have a rock solid balance sheet, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4.5 billion. And we returned
$1.3 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of our semiannual dividend of $1.02 per
share, a 10% increase over our previous payment.
So we are off to a very good start in fiscal year 2015, and we have raised our outlook for revenue growth for the full
fiscal year.
Now let me hand over to David, who will review the numbers in greater detail; David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre. Happy holidays to all of you and thank you for joining us on today's call.
As you heard in Pierre's comments, we delivered a very strong first quarter, building further on the momentum that we
established in the second half of last year. Just a few months ago at our investor Analyst Day, I outlined our focus on
three imperatives for delivering shareholder value. And certainly, our quarter one results and the updated guidance that
I will provide shortly illustrate our ability to manage and drive our business in a differentiated way.
So before I get into the details, let's look at our results in the context of the three imperatives. Starting with durable
revenue growth, we expanded our business by over $500 million in the quarter, with 10% growth in local currency. We
had positive growth across all operating groups, with four of the five achieving double-digit growth, strong balance
growth across all three geographic areas, and the highest growth rates in over two years in both consulting and
outsourcing.
With respect to sustainable margin expansion, we expanded operating margin by 20 basis points while at the same time
investing in our business. The actions that we put in place during the second half of last year are yielding results. And
while optimizing profitability requires an ongoing relentless focus, we're very encouraged by the progress we've made
in recent quarters. And finally, regarding strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, we generated over $800
million in free cash flow and delivered roughly $1.3 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.

With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings for the quarter were
$7.7 billion, with consulting bookings of $3.9 billion and a book-to-bill of 0.9, and outsourcing bookings of $3.8 billion
and a book-to-bill of 1.0. This level of new bookings is consistent with what we signaled on the September earnings
call that bookings would be lighter in quarter one and then build throughout the year. We're pleased with the
composition of our new bookings, specifically with the portion of new bookings which we expect to be recognized as
revenues this fiscal year, which improved our revenue visibility and supported increasing our revenue guidance for the
full year. We see positive trends in our overall pipeline and are well positioned to deliver a higher level of bookings in
the second quarter.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $7.9 billion, an increase of 7% in U.S. dollars and 10% in
local currency, reflecting a negative 3% FX impact compared to the negative 2% impact provided in our business
outlook last quarter. On both an FX-adjusted and unadjusted basis, we were well above the top end of our guided range.
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.1 billion, up 4% in USD and 7% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues
were $3.8 billion, up 11% in USD and 14% in local currency.
Before I cover the operating groups, let me provide some insight on the primary drivers of our growth in the quarter.
Digital-related services continue to be a growth engine and contributed very significantly to our overall growth, with
strong results across the board in Accenture Analytics, Accenture Mobility, and Accenture Interactive. Operations and
application services were also highlights in the quarter. Operations generated double-digit growth in both BPO and
infrastructure services, and we saw strong growth in application services as well.
Looking at the operating groups, we were very pleased with the 15% growth in Communications, Media &
Technology. Overall growth was broad-based, driven by strong double-digit growth in both consulting and outsourcing
across all three industries and in North America and the growth markets. Digital-related services, cost optimization, and
continued execution of large transformational projects were the primary drivers of growth.
In H&PS [Health & Public Service], the 13% growth in the quarter was led by very significant growth in our Health
business, particularly in the public sector, driven by our work with federal health clients, state health exchanges, and
Medicaid-related work. Digital-related services were also a strong growth driver across H&PS.
Financial Services grew 11%, led by banking and capital markets globally with particularly strong growth in Europe.
Clients continue to be focused on three main areas: risk and regulatory, cost optimization, and digital related services
especially in distribution and marketing.
Products, our largest operating group, delivered 10% growth driven by double-digit growth in both consulting and
outsourcing and another quarter of broad-based strength across all industries and geographic areas. Digital and cost
optimization were significant areas of focus for clients in this operating group as well. And application services was
also a driver with strength in ERP-related work.
Resources grew 2%, up from last quarter, as we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in positioning
for sustained positive growth this year. Ongoing challenges in natural resources continue to offset growth in the other
three industries, most notably chemicals, where we had significant double-digit growth. Cost optimization is a
dominant theme across resources, which has resulted in strong demand for operations and application services.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32.2% compared with 33.3% for the same period
last year, down 110 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.5% of net revenues compared
with 12.6% of net revenues for the first quarter last year, down 110 basis points. General and administrative expense
was 5.6% of net revenues compared with 6.1% of net revenues for the first quarter last year, down 50 basis points.
Operating income was $1.2 billion for the first quarter reflecting a 15% operating margin up 20 basis points compared
with quarter one of last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1% equal to the effective tax rate for the same
period last year. Net income was $892 million for the first quarter compared with $812 million for the same quarter last
year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.29 compared with EPS of $1.15 in the first quarter last year. This reflects a
12% year-over-year increase.

Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continue to be industry leading. There were 37 days, up from 36 days
last quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was $821 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of
$873 million, net of property and equipment additions of $52 million. Cash flows in the quarter were positively
impacted by a shift in the timing of a portion of compensation payments which were paid in quarter one in prior years,
and beginning this year, will be paid in quarter two with no impact to full-year cash flow.
Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at November 30 was $4.5 billion compared with $4.9 billion at August
31 and reflects our share repurchases this quarter in addition to higher dividends we paid in November.
Moving to some other key operational metrics, we ended the quarter with a global head count of about 319,000 people.
And we now have approximately 218,000 people in our global delivery network. In quarter one our utilization was
91%. We've updated the methodology we use to calculate our utilization metric to include all billable head count. This
change increased utilization by about 3% and accounts for the increase from quarter four. Attrition, which excludes
involuntary terminations, was 13% compared to 15% quarter four and 11% in the same period last year. Lastly, we now
expect at least 90,000 people will join our company in fiscal 2015.
Turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter we repurchased or redeemed
approximately 8.4 million shares for $670 million at an average price of $80.25 per share. At November 30, we had
approximately $4.1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
Also in November, we paid a semiannual cash dividend of $1.02 per share for a total of $679 million. This represented
a $0.09 or 10% increase over the dividend we paid in May.
So, in summary, we're off to an excellent start in fiscal 2015. That said, the environment continues to be challenging,
which requires that we manage our business with rigor and discipline each and every day, which we are committed to
doing.
Now let me turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David.
At our Investor and Analyst Conference in October, we provided an update on our growth strategy, including the
investments we've made and the actions we've taken to make Accenture even more relevant, differentiated, and
competitive in the marketplace. And our excellent results this quarter demonstrate the successful execution of our
strategy across the different dimensions of our business and that we are growing significantly ahead of the market.
Let me share with you a few example of the outcome-based work we are doing for our clients as well as some key
investments and initiatives we have announced recently. In Accenture Strategy, our unique approach combining
business strategy and technology strategy is resonating well with C-suite executives. A great example is the work we
are doing with one of the largest banks in Canada where our industry experts are designing and implementing a global
technology strategy to drive 20% ongoing annual savings by optimizing the bank's portfolio of applications.
In Accenture Digital, we continue to invest to expand our capabilities in Accenture Interactive to better serve chief
marketing officers. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Reactive Media, one of the Australia's leading
independent digital agencies. Reactive specializes in creating differentiated customer experiences through digital
channels such as apps and e-commerce websites.
And we are benefiting from the investment we have made to enhance our capabilities in Accenture Analytics. We are
working with a European auto company to include forecasting, pricing and promotion for thousands of parts across 18
countries. We are leveraging our expertise in supply chain analytics and the spare parts app from our recent i4C
acquisition to help our clients drive $65 million in new parts revenue.

In Accenture Technology, we just announced a major strategic initiative with Microsoft to drive enterprise cloud
adoptions. The Accenture Hybrid Cloud solution for Microsoft Azure will provide a new way for clients to transform to
a truly enterprise-wide hybrid cloud environment. This unique solution is being co-engineered across Accenture,
Microsoft and Avanade, our joint venture to bring new capabilities and innovations to our enterprise clients.
In Application Services, we continued to compete to win by providing our clients with the very best technology
services at the most competitive cost. We recently expanded our relationship with a long-standing client in resources to
drive an IT transformation to enable greater business agility. We are managing more than 200 ERP data and digital
applications across a wide range of platforms leveraging the capabilities of our global delivery network in India, the
United States, Spain, Brazil and Costa Rica.
And finally, in Accenture Operations, the capabilities we've built were key to a recent win with a global automotive
client. We are operating with end-to-end marketing service across multiple brands and markets. By combining our
industry expertise with our strategy, digital, analytics and operations capabilities, we are helping transform the
company's digital marketing and increase digital sales.
I'm also very pleased that in capital markets, we signed our second client for Accenture Post-Trade Processing, our
industry business service to manage securities operation for investment banks, which we created a year ago with
Société Générale as our first client.
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business, I'm very pleased with the balanced growth we delivered in the
first quarter across all three regions. In North America, we grew revenues 12% in local currency. Our business in the
United States continues to perform extremely well with strong double-digit revenue growth in the quarter.
In Europe, despite the continued challenging economic environment, we grew revenues 9% in local currencies, driven
by double-digit growth in Germany, Italy, France and Norway. And in our growth markets, we delivered revenue
growth of 9% in local currency. I'm very pleased that Brazil is back with strong double-digit growth and we continue to
perform very well in Japan with another quarter of double-digit growth. And I'm also pleased with our strong growth in
Australia. So we see very good momentum in our business and have delivered an excellent first quarter on top of a
strong second half of fiscal year 2014.
At the same time, we are monitoring carefully the macroeconomic environment. The significant fall in global oil prices
since last June could boost growth in the global economy, but also creates a more challenging environment for
companies in the LNG sector and certainly contributes to greater uncertainty and volatility in the marketplace.
We continue to operate in a fast-changing environment driven by so much disruption. And this context, we see
significant opportunity and demand for Accenture's highly relevant and differentiated services. To capture additional
market share and drive sustainable profitable growth, we will continue to leverage our strong client relationships, our
deep industry expertise, our unique position in the technology ecosystem, our broad global footprint, and even more
important, the passion of our 319,000 men and women of Accenture.
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our updated business outlook for fiscal year 2015; David, over to
you.
David P. Rowland
Thanks, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook.
For the second quarter fiscal 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.25 billion to $7.50 billion. This assumes
the impact of FX will be a negative 5% compared to second quarter of fiscal 2014. For the full fiscal year 2015, based
upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S.
dollars will be negative 5% compared to fiscal 2014. For the full fiscal 2015, we now expect our net revenues to be in
the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal 2014. For the full fiscal year 2015, we continue to expect
new bookings to be in the range of $34 billion to $36 billion.

For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year 2015 to be 14.4% to 14.6%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion
over fiscal 2014 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%.
For earnings per share, we now expect full-year diluted EPS for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $4.66 to $4.80, or 3%
to 6% growth over fiscal 2014 results. Absent the higher FX headwind, which impacts EPS by $0.14, our EPS range
would have increased by $0.06, driven by the higher revenue growth range.
Now turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal 2015 we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.95
billion to $4.25 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $450 million, and free cash flow to be in
the range of $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.8 billion through dividends
and share repurchases, and also expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2%,
as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions, KC.
KC McClure
Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as
possible to ask a question. Tom, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Tien-Tsin Huang, representing JPMorgan.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Great, thanks. Good morning.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Tien-Tsin.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Hey, good morning, Dave, good quarter here. I guess I was surprised to see you increase
your revenue growth guidance this early in the fiscal year. It seems a little uncharacteristic. It's good obviously, but it
sounds like it's due to faster booking conversion, if I heard that correctly. Is that a structural change that could persist
here for a few quarters, or is this more of a temporary phenomenon that we should consider?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Certainly, the composition of our bookings in the first quarter was an influencer of the 10%
growth. And as I commented, Tien-Tsin, you and others have heard me reference previously what I refer to as annual
contract value [ACV]. So it's the portion of our total bookings or the total contract value that converts to revenue in the
fiscal year. And we were very pleased with that number in the first quarter, and really that's been a trend that we've
seen really going even to the back half of last year as our growth went from 7%, as you know, in the third quarter, to
8% in the fourth quarter. And you've also heard me mention that, as important as the larger transformational projects
are to us, we also have been focusing our client teams more on thinking about the annual contract value of the work
that we sell and deliver to clients. And I think we see some of that reflected in the growth in the first quarter and also in
the second half of last year.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: All right, good, so high ACV, good. So as my follow-up then, I noticed you didn't update
your bookings forecast despite the big FX headwind. So I know it's a really wide range, but is that effectively a raise in
constant currency bookings? I'm just trying to better tie that to the constant currency revenue comments. Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: It is. Just mathematically, it's effectively a range for the reasons you're pointing out. On the
bookings front, we feel very good about our pipeline. We are only one quarter into the year. We still think that the $34
billion to $36 billion range is the right range for us to be focused on. And for that reason, we didn't change it even
though FX did change.

Operator
We'll go to the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Hi. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the impact of oil prices, both on
the positive side, where you think you would see it; and also on the negative side within your energy sector. And
maybe talk a little bit about what your clients – are you seeing them react at this point? Are they reacting already?
Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, this is Pierre. I will pick up that one. As we speak, and I would recommend, almost as of
today, we have not yet seen any form of significant impact in our business with what's happening. I believe that these
big organizations in energy, oil and gas are just watching the situation. It has been very volatile these last few weeks.
And I guess our clients and these companies are waiting a bit to understand whether there's going to be some form of
stabilization. And when you have some form of stabilization, you can start executing your strategy. But as we speak,
we've not seen any different pattern with our clients. And I would characterize my dialogue as being in a watching
mode, not panicking.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Now the energy vertical I believe is about 6%. Long term, can you give us a sense for what
the mix is, consulting versus outsourcing, and how quickly if your clients get more nervous it could get dialed back?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. If you look at it, I guess it's not going to be very different from the mix of Accenture
from a consulting and outsourcing standpoint. So indeed, a good portion of the business is going to be around
outsourcing contract with long-term commitment. As you know, we have even some clients where we are doing
business process outsourcing operations, a very large and important client where we are doing finance and accounting,
so it is a kind of operation which are contracted for long term and which are of course mission-critical for the clients.
So to answer your question, the level of vulnerability would be more around the short-term consulting projects and so
forth, which would be a part of the 6%. So I guess that would probably impact something like a portion of 3%, if you
will.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.

We'll go to the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Good morning and thank you for taking the question.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Brian.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Good morning. I was wondering if you'd circle back a little bit more to ACV. And tremendous
– unless I'm doing my math wrong, tremendous employee head count growth in the quarter. When I look at that,
relative to the softer bookings, although it's higher conversion rates, how much visibility do you have in the head
count? And maybe you can help give us a little bit of color in terms of where you're hiring and the mix of hiring, given
that revenue per head is coming down a little bit. What is the visibility that leads to that aggressive head count growth?

<A - David P. Rowland>: First of all, just in terms of visibility and how that influences our supply planning, I mean,
first of all, as you know, we are very effective at managing the supply side of the business. It's a core competency of
ours and we are managing, adjusting, and tuning the supply side including hiring daily, if not hourly. Now, in terms of
the growth in head count, certainly, and I think the tone of the comments hopefully indicated as much, we feel good
very good about our business. We exited last year with good momentum. That momentum translated into strong growth
in the first quarter. It translated into a lower dollar value of bookings but yet a high quality of bookings with respect to
how it will benefit revenue this year.
And if you reflect on the guidance that we gave for the second quarter, the upper end of that range is 10% growth in
local currency. So what all that points to is confidence in our business and that underpins what we're doing on the head
count front. Now, as it relates to head count, one of the many but important differentiating characteristics of Accenture
is GDN and we continue to invest heavily in GDN, including on the talent side. And so if you look at the recruiting that
we did in the first quarter, as you can see in the numbers, it's biased toward GDN but yet it's important to recognize that
we're hiring in just about every geography around the world. And we're hiring meaningful numbers of people in all of
our local markets. So I think the head count just reflects the confidence that we have in our business.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Okay. And is there any – just as a follow up, is there any geo, in particular, that you're
particularly excited about? I know, at the Analyst Day, Pierre was pretty confident about BPO in Europe. Is that
actually materializing now? And are you seeing greater traction in that geo, particularly, with regard to BPO, and
maybe impact to longer-term upside/downside to your full-year forecast?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Of course the country I'm most excited with will be France, by no doubt, where we had a
quarter I would characterize as fabulous. Based on fact. Nothing to do with my nationality, of course. But I'm pleased
with what's happening. I'm extremely pleased with the sustainability of our performance in the United States. It is very
important. It's the largest market of Accenture, and it is, I would say, the global market where things are happening in
our industry. This is where things are happening from a digital standpoint, from an innovation standpoint, as well from
a disruption standpoint, from an energy standpoint. We can comment all of this. And it's, for us, all goodness that we
are doing so well in the U.S. We are gaining market share and has been the case now for the last four years. So it's not
the story of a quarter.
I'm extraordinarily impressed with what we are doing in Europe. And I'm mentioning impressed because we all know
that the economic context and conditions in Europe are very different from the U.S. And driving 9% local currency
growth in the European market is very significant, including growth in our most mature market. I mean growing in
Italy, double-digit; growing in France, double digit; growing in Germany, double-digit. It's a big achievement for
Accenture. And why we've been able to do that – to get back to your first question – indeed, we have – these last
couple of years, we have traction in outsourcing, application outsourcing, that we've been able to evolve our portfolio
of business to BPO.
And we have some very landmark deals, especially in electronic and high tech in business process outsourcing but as
well as in banking in Italy, just to get to illustration explaining France and Italy. And the good news, I would say, of
this quarter, from a European standpoint, is consulting is back, which is demonstrating that our clients are starting to
reinvest in consulting, first in digital-related services, couldn't be more pleased with our Digital business at Accenture. I
would characterize on fire, not being emphatic, but as well we see good opportunities, again, back in big ERP.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Very helpful, thank you.

<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Hey. So can you describe in a little more detail? I know you watch the book-to-bill numbers pretty
closely. And now, two quarters in a row, like the consulting book-to-bill has been less than one. And I know that what
you're saying is that's because the mix to those services are such that they're rolling through quicker. Can you just talk
about that? Like what – is it the conversion time or what exactly is going on under the covers there?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I guess just a couple of thoughts. First of all, as you know, Lisa, watching our business, the
bookings as we've always said – probably said 1,000 times, that bookings can be lumpy across the quarters. And I think
some of what you see this quarter is lumpiness. I mean sometimes it's really an insignificant difference as to whether or
not we close, let's say, one or two larger deals the last week of the quarter or first week of next quarter. It's really just a
timing issue. I will say by the way, I'll just take this opportunity to point out, that in the quarter, we did have six clients
with bookings over $100 million. And that's a healthy number by anyone's standard. But for us, it's a little bit lighter
than what we've seen in some quarters in the last four to six and so that was an influencing factor in the first quarter.
Nonetheless, we were very pleased with the quality of what we sold, as I said. And so, we don't read anything through
in terms of the fact that we had several very strong quarters. Last quarter was a little bit lighter, this quarter is how as I
characterized it, but yet if you look at our guidance range for the full-year and if you just to the math, then that tells you
kind of what we're thinking about in terms of kind of, on average, what our bookings would be for the next three
quarters. And of course, that would put the bookings right back in the sweet spot of our book-to-bill.
So if I go to where you started, we still focus very much on the book-to-bill metric of 1.0 to 1.1 for consulting and at
least 1.2 for outsourcing, but that doesn't mean we hit it every quarter. And when we don't hit it every quarter, we're not
worried about that. We're really focused on how we performed against those metrics really over a kind of a
multi-quarter period. And I think for this fiscal year, you'll see it play out in a way that the book-to-bills will look
normal to you, if you will.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Perfect. Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Yeah, and then one real quick follow up, I know you always talk about don't focus – focus on the
operating margin number and not the distinction between gross margin versus net because of the expenses can kind of
fall into different buckets. But in an environment with an increasing mix of consulting, I was sort of surprised to see
that the mix – that the gross margins continued to decline. I would have, I guess, thought it was the other way around.
Can you talk a little bit about that dynamic?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Absolutely. And I would've been disappointed, Lisa, had you not asked that question. I
could have written it for you. Hey. It's a good question, and at the risk of being redundant, I am just going to anchor
back to some of the things I have said before, but I'll give you some nuggets for the quarter as well. And so just for the
benefit of everyone who is listening, we do really focus on operating margin. And at the end of the day, what we really
focus on at the highest level is driving a business so that our payroll cost and our non-payroll cost evolve in a way that
supports margins expansion. And so if you look at payroll as an example, we're much more concerned about the overall
efficiency of the payroll than we are the portion of the payroll that is reflected in sales and marketing versus cost of
services at any particular point in time.
I think without – maybe if I stay at the level that is appropriate, let me just point out a couple of things on gross margin.
The first thing is and this is a little bit of the dynamics that you have to understand is that our contract profitability
actually was up year-over-year. So this is not an issue of – it's not an issue. But this is not, in gross margin, driven by
contract profitability pressures in the quarter.
Now, so what is it then? Well, we have a lot of other costs that go into gross margin. We have recruiting costs. We're
hiring a lot of people in the first quarter. We have training costs. When we hire people, we train them. We have types of
our investments show up in gross margin. I characterized that what we're focused on is investing in our business, while
at the same time growing revenue and expanding profits.

You have other things like other components of payroll. Variable comp, as you know, shows up in gross margin. And
so there are many factors that show up in gross margin. To the root of your question, it was not contract profitability.
Contract profitability increased and operating margin increased overall at 20 basis points and that's what we're all
about.

And we will go to the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Thanks. I guess a couple of questions on revenues. One is with regards to the contribution
of acquisitions to this quarter. If you could talk about that? And then a related – not really a related question, but also a
revenue question, how do you get the FX headwind of 5%? And maybe, I mean, I'm getting 3.5%. You guys do a pretty
good job of telling us what the revenue mix is. So I'm wondering if we could maybe use FX as a part of being
conservative overall, given the uncertainty of rates.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. Yeah, so let me just start off with – on the inorganic piece. I think, last quarter, I said
that it would be around 1%, 1% to 1.5% for the year and quarter one was clearly in that zone. Which means the simple
extrapolation is that most of our growth was organically driven. So when you look at the 10% in the context of what I
just said, it's another indicator of the health of our business.
Ashwin, on the FX, we go through a process and it's been a process we've done for as long as I can remember, which is
probably back to the first quarter of being a public company. We do a process where we look at the rates on a daily
basis in the two to three weeks leading up to the earnings call. And we look at what the trends are in the most recent
two to three weeks. I mean there's no – it's really more, it's objectively driven. We don't try to speculate on what rates
might do going forward. And if you look at the objective analytics based on the distribution of our currencies and how
the rates have trended, then you come up with a solid 5%. And I'd just say it's a solid 5%.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Okay, maybe we could take that one up offline. But the second question I have is with
regards to margins. And you just went through on the previous question a pretty good description of the various costs
and such. But the margin improvement of 20 basis points, I'm curious as you look at it and look at your forward
bookings, what's in your pipeline. In other words, one of the factors that have got to be helping you on a
forward-looking basis is that your mix has gone from 46% consulting to 50% consulting. But also, you're hiring so
many people who have got to be GDN, which have presumably helped margins. My perception has also been based on
my checks that the strong Digital and Mobility type work that comes through is higher margin. So I'm really curious.
On the operating margin basis, what's the offset that gets you to 20 basis points? I would expect you guys do 30 – 40
basis points.
<A - David P. Rowland>: By the way, so that was a statement or a question at the end?
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: The last part was a question.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Again, we are managing our business to drive sustainable margin expansion in the 20 to 30
basis point range. And as part of that, critically important is we're committed to investing in our business which
includes investing in our people. We balance those things in the context of our results to deliver as predictably as we
can in that 10 to 30 basis point range and we landed at 20 basis points, and so that's it.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Okay. Any color on these startup cost things, some of the BPO things you just signed, any
other color?
<A - David P. Rowland>: No, not really, and nothing to add beyond what I said. There's...

Our next question is from Moshe Katri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Hey, thanks. Just not to beat a dead horse here, going back to the discussion on margins, I think it
attrition went up by a couple hundred basis points, I think to 300 basis points. Again, how does that reconcile with the
drop in gross margins? It's a pretty drastic expansion in the – sorry, the ED. I didn't say attrition. I meant to say
utilization rates, I think went up to 91%. How does it reconcile with the gross margin drop during the quarter? Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thanks for the question and that gives me the opportunity to reiterate something that I said
in the script because it's an important thing to understand. So you are aware that starting a few quarters ago with our
head count reporting, we now have billable head count as a line item. We have aligned the billable head count with the
utilization metric more directly. And as a result of that – so what does that mean? That means that we've now included
people in the utilization metric that are typically people who are working on outsourcing contracts that previously were
excluded. So they're now included in that metric, which the change increased our utilization to 91%, 3%. Absent that
change, the utilization effectively did not change at all. So the utilization is really just we redefined how we report
utilization to include all billable head count, which I think is going to be easier certainly for us and for the outside
world going forward.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: That does make sense. And then just briefly, we did a survey that looks at the trend. The survey
pointed to a weaker spending sentiment and overextended budget cycles in the financial services vertical. Does that
sound right? Is that something that you guys are doing out there? Can you give us any color on that?
<A - KC McClure>: Moshe, hi. This is KC. I'm sorry. We're having a tough time hearing you. You're breaking up a
little bit.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Okay, let's try again.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Which vertical where you are asking about?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: FS.
<A - KC McClure>: FS.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Financial Services.
<A - KC McClure>: Did you just want a little color on financial services?
<Q - Moshe Katri>: What I said was that our survey pointed to weaker spending sentiment and overextended budget
cycles in the financial services vertical and then I'm asking if you guys can comment on that. Are you seeing any of this
in your business? Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: On Financial Services, double-digit growth this quarter. When we look at the growth this
quarter, the growth was quite well balanced. So when I look at this, I would say things are going well. We had growth
in outsourcing, good growth in consulting back again in Financial Services, and growing pretty well across the board.
So I do not see anything specific in Financial Services. And these last two quarters, we've been driving good growth
with that vertical and we feel good about it, including, and I'm taking the opportunity, as I mentioned in my
presentation, we have our second client joining Accenture Post-Trade Servicing, the unique capability in BPO where
we are providing post-trade services. We had Société Générale last year. We have our second client. So I think our new

Our next question is from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: Thanks, good morning. So I have just a couple quick ones. Your business now is 20% or more
in digital and cloud-based solutions. And I'm just wondering more specifically, when we think about the types of
revenue that you're recognizing within that, is that really what's driving your visibility and improved trajectory and then
ultimately the margin trajectory that we're seeing at the operating line, or is there something else? And it also seems as
though that business is now bigger than your legacy ERP, and I'm wondering if that's giving you better visibility into
the future. Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: When you look at our drivers for growth and I – related to the presentation we made in the IA
day, we have two plus one. Clearly, digital-related services are a business where we invested significantly, as you saw,
seven years, and when we are getting a very significant return. As we mentioned, our digital-related services are in the
range of $5 billion and, indeed, are growing in excess of 20%. So, indeed, it is an engine for growth. This is what that
was supposed to be. We invested a lot organic or through some very targeted acquisitions, as you remember, the Fjord,
the Acquity, the avVenta, more recently, i4C, all these acquisition we made in Australia with Reactive Media, and we
will continue to do so. And indeed, it is, for us, very important investment, source of growth because this is where the
market is turning to.
I mean the second main engine for growth is what we characterize as everything related to rationalization of the
operation for our clients, which is resonating very well with our business in operations. And no surprise, our business in
operations, this business is growing double-digit growth so in excess of 10%. Here you have two clear engines for
growth, very sustainable, very strong. And again, when I look at operations, it's not by surprise we invested heavily in
some acquisition. If you take procurement, Ariba a few years ago, and more recently, Procurian.
And the third one, when I said two plus one, because this one is more lumpy, as David would say, is around the
large-scale transformation programs. Every year we have a number of large-scale transactions because this is the
specialty of Accenture. And we benefit from these three engines for growth. So we will continue moving forward to
invest both in digital and both in our rationalization capabilities, if you will, especially around application services
growing double-digit and operations growing double-digits, and we will continue having our large-scale transformation
programs.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: Okay. The other thing I just wanted to touch on, you mentioned that big ERP is kind of an
opportunity you're coming back, and I wanted to make sure that there was a kind of, I guess, clarification point on that.
Are you talking about your partnerships now with cloud-based ERP implementation or just legacy ERP? And then if
it's legacy, can you talk a little bit about what's the nature behind that now? Or you would think that, that would be
shifting away from that? Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Both. We are extremely pleased with the traction we're getting, and I forgot to mention one.
We are already leading on HANA implementation with SAP on a global basis. So the new ERP HANA-based solution
cloud enabled and we already their number one in implementing this solution in the marketplace. But we see as well
the more classic legacy ERP to support the global expansion on very large clients. And I have in mind two or three
recent situations where we've been winning some very significant ERP in finance and accounting, in supply chain to
support the transformation and the expansion of leading global groups.
And for these groups, you need the more classic, I would say, backbone that might be around Oracle, that might be
around SAP, or that might be around Microsoft. And we see a few coming yet back again. And as we speak, at least I

have three illustration in my mind coming in Europe for very large global group and very large ERP. So we're pleased
with that business. Of course the digital-related services are hyper growth, are driving the growth and this is where we

Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Good morning, guys. Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: So maybe just to finally put the gross margin questions to bed, because I think all that
extra color around the different buckets of cost on the COGS line was very helpful, but given that there are these other
buckets of costs outside of underlying core contract profitability, are you basically telling us that the trend of
year-over-year decline in gross margin will probably continue because of pressure from those other areas or do you
think that we're closer to sort of a stabilization point in terms of year-over-year trend in gross margin? And the reason I
ask and again, I appreciate the focus on operating margin, but just so that we get the models kind of tuned right and
may mitigate the need for other questions like this in the future.
<A - David P. Rowland>: I think, and by the way, I appreciate these questions because I know what you're trying to
do in connecting the dots. I mean what I would say is that – I'm not going to comment specifically on gross margin
guidance, because we really guide to operating margin. But what I'll say is that if you look at contract profitability as a
factor, we're forever focused on improving our contract profitability over time. And that will be an objective for the
remainder of this year just as it's an objective every year. And so, we're always focused in challenging our teams to
improve the profitability of the portfolio of contracts that we're doing in our business.
The other thing when you said, I think you said would be a headwind, or would be a drag. It's not – again, some of
these things are investments and we wouldn't view that as a negative thing if it's in the context of expanding operating
margin. And so I'm not suggesting that we just completely ignore, we do look at the functional areas within our GAAP
P&L but what we're really managing to is operating margin, and if we're expanding contract profitability, let's say
investing more or rewarding our people more or whatever, the element may be in gross margin and at the same time,
expanding operating margin, that's all about by design. We're not solving to expand gross margin, we're solving to
expand operating margin and, fundamentally, underneath that, we are focused on improving the profitability of the
work we do with clients and then we're also solving for investing more in our business. And in the context of those
things, driving operating margin expansion. If we do that, that's what's most important.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Okay, that all makes sense. And just to shift to the top line, which was obviously really
strong here and you did talk about the increased visibility leading to the uptick in the guidance range. So I know in the
past you had given some actual percentages in terms of the percent of your revenue target for the full-year that's
actually under contract and I was just wondering if you could give us where you stand on that percentage now versus
maybe where you were a year ago?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes, what I would say – we really got away from giving that number because it was one that
we found, it was creating more confusion than it was helpful. So I won't give a specific number but I'll just characterize
that we have a very good position with our contracted revenues and they are very well positioned relative to the
revenue guidance range, let me put it that way. And again, as we have been focused more and more around annual
contract value that certainly gives us better contracted revenue visibility in the fiscal year.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Okay, understood. Thank you.

<A - KC McClure>: Tom, we have time for one more question, then Pierre will wrap up the call.
Operator
All right. Our final question today will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. Thanks for getting me in. So in the quarter, the 10% constant-currency revenue
growth was a few points above the guided range and for the past few years we didn't see Accenture really beat its
current quarter range much so, I guess, what would you point to that caused the upside surprise in the given quarter?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Truthfully, it was broad-based. I think that it wasn't one thing, it was really better
performance across our five operating groups than what we had assumed – even what we had assumed when we
provided the guidance as we were working to be at the upper end. And I think as Pierre said, digital – the level of
growth in digital is just extremely strong. We had assumed it would be strong. It's very strong. Digital, Operations, App
Services, those are all drivers. And we saw elements of that across all five operating groups and really you could say
across all three areas, so it was broad-based.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: But if there is one to close that for me that is standing apart and which is probably
overachieving and even taking us by surprise and it's good news, is all about digital-related services. This is the way we
decided to ride, there's a strong demand. We want to take leadership position with Accenture Digital. We are now
evaluated by the Gartner as the largest and the number one organization providing digital related services and in excess
of 20% growth, it has probably taken us a little bit by surprise and this is the kind of surprise we love.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. And just on the pricing front, I think it was three quarters ago, you put a scare through
the market talking about pricing pressure in application work. It doesn't really seem to be – I can't see it in the numbers,
so can you just comment on that? And then just lastly, as a bonus question, since I'm last, resources, so what are you
expecting? Do you expect that vertical to get weaker in your guidance or do you expect it to maintain its growth?
Thanks so much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Let me just work backwards. On resources, our chief executive for resources is still very
much focused on driving growth for the year and we've made a lot of – and we should acknowledge that team's effort
and what they've done to position that business going forward. So that continues to be our goal but, yes, we have a
close eye, very close eye on energy, obviously. Back up, what was the other question?
<A - KC McClure>: Pricing.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Pricing. On pricing, pricing is stable. We've actually been pleased with – I think, I can say
we've been pleased with the pricing trends in the recent few quarters. I'm just going to characterize it as stable with
some strength in certain areas of our business, but overall stable, but obviously in an environment that continues to be
competitive.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, congrats on the strong quarter.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thanks a lot for the good questions, and thank you, David, as well.
Pierre Nanterme
So thanks again for joining us on today's call. With the first quarter behind us and given the very strong momentum in
