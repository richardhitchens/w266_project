Great, Trevor. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. You know what? GE had a good third quarter in an improving
environment. Our orders grew 19% with great balance. Our growth markets were up 22%; U.S. was up 18% and
Europe up 17%. Earnings per share was up 18% ex-unusual items, industrial earnings were up 11% with six of seven
segments growing, four by double-digits. Capital continues to execute on our strategic objectives. Earnings were up
13% while our financial position continued to strengthen and we had $0.04 of uncovered charges in the quarter and no
industrial gains.
Operations were very strong. Margins grew by 120 basis points behind strong value gap performance and
simplification. Our industrial cost out reached $1 billion dollars through the third quarter and we're significantly ahead
of our plan. And CFOA is up 5% operationally. This includes a $3.9 billion dividend from GE Capital year-to-date.
We returned about $14 billion to investors year-to-date, well on our way to our $18 billion goal. And at the same time
we continued to invest in strategic acquisitions like Avio and Lufkin. So overall this was a good quarter for the GE
team.
Orders were a highlight for the quarter, overall growth was up 19% with strength in Equipment & Services. Every
business grew and backlog reached $229 billion. Equipment orders grew 32% with strength across the board and orders
price was flat. The orders profile was very encouraging. Services was up 5% with real strength in Power Gen Services
and Aviation Commercial Spares. Total orders in the U.S. and Europe were both robust and seven growth regions had
double-digit orders growth.
These include Australia, Canada, Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey up 17%, Africa up 18%, Russia up 51%,
China up 18% and ASEAN up 100%. Power & Water had a solid orders performance with growth of 19% and note this
number did not include any orders from Algeria. Those will be booked in the fourth quarter and 2014. Orders growth
and backlog supports business expansion in the fourth quarter and through 2014.
We're making progress on our strategic growth initiatives. Growth market revenues were up 13% with six of nine
regions up double-digits. This remains a key strength for the company due to our geographic diversity and strong share
position. Services grew by 7% with margins up 60 basis points and Aviation Spare shipments grew by 25%. Last week
we had our second Mines & Machines Summit where we announced 14 new service offerings in analytics and
software. Our industrial internet orders should exceed $500 million for the year and we continue to drive our technical
advantage. We announced 8 gigawatt heavy-duty gas turbine win in Algeria. We'll launch 50 Healthcare NPIs for the
year and we're gaining share.
The LEAP engine is ahead of schedule and the GE9x recorded first order and is well positioned for the Boeing 777
launch. We have the only locomotive to meet the Tier 4 standard and we continue to launch new appliance products
with strong acceptance in retail and contract channels. So with a strong backlog and good growth initiatives I think
we're well positioned for solid organic growth in the fourth quarter and 2014.
On margins, look, we're encouraged about our progress. GE's margins grew by 120 basis points in the quarter and are
up 40 basis points year-to-date. Five of seven businesses grew margins in the quarter and all are flat or up for the year
excluding the impact of acquisitions. Our results are programmatic and sustainable. Our value gap is positive $660
million year-to-date and will continue to grow. We have achieved our $1 billion simplification goal in only three
quarters and we'll drive substantial upside for the year. And there will be no industrial gains in this quarter.
Power & Water had a solid quarter with improved mix, strong value gap and good simplification efforts and they
should sustain this momentum into the fourth quarter. So on track to achieve our 70 basis points goal. Our results in
service margins, value gap and simplification are accelerating and all businesses should have positive margin growth in
fourth quarter. And we still have a slight hedge in our plan.
And on cash we had a solid quarter for cash. Our industrial CFOA has grown by 5% year-to-date ex- the NBCU
deal-related taxes, which show up in CFOA. We're still targeting to receive up to $6.5 billion of GE Capital dividends
paid to the parent. We remain on track to achieve our $14 billion to $17 billion CFOA goal for the year. We have
significantly higher revenues in fourth quarter than third quarter, driving higher CFOA by year-end; and our balance
sheet remains extremely strong with $87 billion of consolidated cash.

Our capital allocation remains disciplined and balanced. Year-to-date we've returned $13.9 billion to investors in
dividends and buybacks. Meanwhile we've invested $8.6 billion in acquisitions that will improve our long-term growth
rate. We're on track to return $18 billion to investors in 2013.
And now over to Jeff to review operations.
Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with third quarter total results. Revenue from continuing operations of $35.7 billion was down
1% from last year. Industrial sales of $25.3 billion was up 2% driven principally by oil and gas and aviation, partly
offset by power and water as you can see on the right side of the page. GE Capital revenues were down 5% to $10.7
billion on much lower investment.
Operating earnings of $3.7 billion were down 3% and operating earnings per share were flat at $0.36. That includes
$0.02 cents for the Avio acquisition charges and $0.02 cents of restructuring in the quarter. We also no longer have
earnings from the NBCU JV, which was $0.02 in the third quarter of 2012. I'll cover these items on the next page.
Continuing EPS of $0.32 includes the impact of non-operating pension and net earnings per share includes
discontinued operations, which I'll also cover on the next page.
As Jeff said, CFOA year-to-date was $7.8 billion with solid industrial performance and $2 billion of GE Capital
dividends were paid in the quarter. The GE tax rate in the quarter was 20% and the GE Capital tax rate was zero. GE
Capital continued to have benefits associated with loss recapture in real estate and tax efficient asset reductions. In the
second quarter, we said that we expected GE Capital tax rate to be in mid-single digits for the year, but that could be
lower depending upon IRS resolutions that could happen in the fourth quarter as well as expected dispositions in the
fourth quarter which could impact tax rates.
On the right side of the page, segment results were positive. Industrial segment profit was up 11% with six of seven
industrial segments improving. GE Capital also had a positive quarter growing earnings 13% versus 2012. I'll cover all
the segments in more detail on the following pages.
So for one-time items, in total we had $0.04 of charges in the quarter, $0.02 cents related to Avio as we discussed in
September. Avio had a number of pre-existing contractual arrangements with GE Aviation and U.S. GAAP requires us
to record the fair value impact of effectively settling those pre-existing contracts. We also had an inventory fair value
adjustment in the quarter. These resulted in $0.02 charge. Going forward we'll benefit from the efficiencies that Avio
has achieved over time.
We also had $0.02 of restructuring and other charges as we continue to take actions to reduce our cost structure. This
was $0.01 higher than we had originally planned for the third quarter as we continue to identify attractive projects that
will lower our structural costs and rationalize our footprint.
On the right side of the page we included a walk from reported to adjusted operating results. In the third quarter of
2012, we earned $0.36, which included $0.02 of income related to NBC. In the third quarter of this year we earned
$0.36, but as discussed that included $0.02 of the Avio related charges and $0.02 of restructuring. If you adjusted those
items, operating EPS is $0.40 in third quarter of 2013 versus $0.34 in third quarter of 2012, up 18%.
For discontinued operations, we had an $82 million after tax impact in the quarter driven by GE Money Japan. We
booked $79 million of additional reserves to reflect ongoing claims in – related to Gray Zone. We ended the quarter
with $527 million in total reserves. There were really no material change in WMC in the quarter with a very slight
reserve adjustment.
On the bottom of the page is a summary of our operating EPS and the industrial NBC gains and restructuring with
$0.02 of restructuring charges in the third quarter. That brings our year-to-date to a net zero impact between the first
quarter gain and year-to-date restructuring.

So with that, I'll begin covering business results, and we'll start with Power & Water. Orders of $5.9 billion were up
19%. European orders were up 9%, led by renewables and water, however, PGS was down 18%. Equipment orders
were 37% higher at $3 billion. Thermal orders were $886 million, down 15%. The business had orders for 27
heavy-duty gas turbines in the quarter versus 29 a year ago. Renewable orders were strong, up over 100% to $1.2
billion with continuing strength in the U.S. Distributed power was also strong with orders of $700 million, up 62%
driven by aero demand. Service orders were up 4% to $2.9 billion, up 7% excluding Europe. Despite continuing
European softness, PGS orders were up 8% to $1.8 billion, and we booked 15 Advanced Gas Path upgrades versus four
a year ago.
Overall, orders pricing was down 80 basis points driven by equipment down 2.9%, partially offset by services up 1.4%.
Thermal OPI was down 1.4% and Wind was down 1.2%. Revenue of $6.5 billion was down 10% driven by lower
volume. Equipment revenue was down 13% on lower gas and wind volume. We shipped 22 gas turbines versus 35 in
the third quarter of 2012, and we shipped 407 fewer wind turbines, down 40%. This is partially offset by distributed
power strength, up 44% with 76 unit deliveries versus 48 a year ago.
Service revenue of $2.8 billion was down 5% driven by PGS down 6%. Higher AGP volume was offset by lower new
unit spares. Segment profit of $1.289 billion was up 9% in the quarter. The improvement was driven by positive value
gap and distributed power strength and better cost performance. SG&A was down 10% in the quarter and margins
improved 330 basis points.
Oil & Gas orders were $4.4 billion, up 4%. Equipment orders were $2.3 billion, up 3%. We saw strong turbo
machinery orders growth, up 17%, led by a large midstream LNG order in Russia and Lufkin orders of $243 million
partially offset by subsea down 41%. Subsea orders tend to be very lumpy and are up 17% over the last 12 months.
Service orders grew 6% in the quarter, drilling and surface was up 21%, subsea up 27% partially offset by
measurement and control, down 8%.
Total backlog was up 35% versus prior year and orders pricing was down 20 basis points with year-to-date remaining
positive at up 70 basis points. Revenue of $4.3 billion was up 18%, up 9% ex-acquisitions. Equipment was up 19%
driven by subsea up 16% and drilling and service up 13% offset by measurement and control down 3% in the quarter.
Measurement and control was a disappointment in the quarter as we saw a continued softness in the market. Service
revenues grew 18% with strength in global services up 13%, subsea up 43%, and drilling and surface up 23%.
Segment profit of $519 million was up 11%. That's up 7% ex-acquisitions primarily driven by higher volume and a
strong value gap. Margins were down 90 basis points on a reported basis, down 30 basis points excluding the impact of
Lufkin in the quarter. This is lower than expected primarily driven by a softer measurement and control market and
there were some project delays.
So with that, we'll talk about aviation and healthcare. First aviation. Aviation had another really strong quarter. Orders
of $7.8 billion were up 51% with equipment orders up 92%. Commercial engine orders were $3.8 billion, up four
times, led by $1.6 billion of CFM orders, up nine times including 1.4 billion of LEAP orders. GE90 orders were $1.2
billion, also up four times.
Military orders continued their expected weakness down 30%. Service orders of $2.7 billion were up 9%. Commercial
service orders were up 15%. The average daily order rate for commercial spares was $24 million, up 9% in the quarter.
Our fleet utilization year-to-date is up 3.1% and overhauls in the quarter were up 23%. Military service orders fell 6%
as flight hours continued to decline and destocking continues across the military.
Orders pricing in the quarter was up 1.9% with improvements in both equipment and service. Revenue of $5.4 billion
was up 12%, up 10% excluding Avio. Equipment revenue was 10% higher. We shipped 273 military engines, up 12%.
We also shipped 559 commercial engines in the quarter, up 8%, including 26 GEnx engines. Service revenues were
14% higher driven by strong spare parts sales of $25.9 million a day, which was up 25%. Military service revenue was
down 17%. Segment profit of $1.1 billion was up 18% driven by strong volume and value gap with sales price up 3%.
Margin rates improved 100 basis points versus last year and were up 70 basis points excluding Avio. Just as a note,
Avio helped margins and Lufkin was a hurt on margins in the quarter, so overall acquisitions were about a 10 basis

points drag in the quarter on segment margins.
Next is Healthcare. Orders in healthcare of $4.7 billion were up 2%. Equipment orders were up 6% to $2.7 billion.
Developed markets were up 1% driven by strong U.S. equipment orders up 8%. Europe was flat. Japan was down 24%,
down 6% excluding the effect of FX. Emerging markets were up 14% driven by China up 33%, Latin America up 28%,
partially offset by Asia Pacific down 16%.
Just a little bit on modality. HCS was up 5%. MR was up 13%, CT down 8%, and ultrasound was very strong up 14%,
Life sciences was up 10%, diagnostic guidance up 5%, so pretty good strength across the modalities.
Service orders of $1.9 billion were down 4%. Revenue of $4.3 billion was flat driven by growth markets up 5% led by
China up 13%, offset by developed markets down 2%. Both the U.S. and Europe were up 2% offset by Japan. Segment
profit of $665 million was higher by 7% as cost productivity from our restructuring efforts more than offset lower
price. Margin rates expanded in the quarter 110 basis points.
Moving on to Transportation, orders of $1.6 billion were up 34%. Equipment orders were up 65% driven by a large
North American locomotive order for 275 units deliverable in 2014, and mining really continues to be soft. Service
orders were 8% higher driven by solid growth in locomotive services partly offset by very weak demand for mining
parts. Revenues of $1.4 billion were flat year-over-year the strong service growth of 17% was offset by equipment
revenue down 14%. Locomotive shipments were approximately flat with the third quarter, deliveries of 147 compared
to 146 a year ago. Operating profit of $306 million was up 15% with margins better by 300 basis points. The
improvement was principally driven by positive value gap and services growth.
Energy management, orders of $2 billion were up 16% with strength in power conversion up 19%, digital energy up
23% and intelligent platforms up 16%. Backlog of $4.6 billion is up 29% versus prior year. Despite the order strength,
operations were disappointing in the third gather. Revenues were down 3% driven by digital energy down 27% on
weak meter demand and some project execution. As a result, op profit was down 57% to $18 million. Positive value
gap was more than offset by the negative volume leverage.
And Home & Business Solutions had a very strong quarter driven by appliances. Housing starts were up 19% with
single family better by 16%, multifamily up 27%. Revenues of $2.1 billion were higher by 7% led by an 11% increase
in appliances partly offset with a 1% decrease in lighting. Segment profit of $77 million was up 28%, appliances op
profit was up 73% driven by positive value gap and productivity partly offset by lighting. Margins improved 60 basis
points in the quarter.
Next I'll cover GE Capital. GE Capital revenue was $10.7 billion, down 5% driven by lower assets. Assets were down
7% or $40 billion year-over-year. Net income of $1.9 billion was up 13% from prior year primarily driven by lower
losses, better portfolio performance, and higher tax benefits, which more than offset lower assets and gains. We ended
the quarter with $385 billion of ending net investment down $39 billion from last year and down $7 billion
sequentially. Our net interest margin increased 22 basis points versus the third quarter of 2012 to 5% and was flat with
the second quarter. Volume was up 6% in the quarter with new business ROI over 2%, and our Tier 1 common on a
Basel I basis improved to 11.3% driven by a reduction in assets, and that's after paying $2 billion of dividends in the
quarter.
On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be strong with delinquency rates stable to improving
across the portfolio. In addition, non-earning assets totaled $6.4 billion, down $1.9 billion versus third quarter of 2012.
We have substantially completed all our debt issuance for 2013 of $32 billion, and we've reduced our CP balance of
$33 billion, ahead of the plan to bring down CP by $35 billion by year-end. Liquidity was very strong, ending the
quarter at $76 billion, up $7 billion from the second quarter.
Now to walk through our segment performance, CLL, the Commercial Lending and Leasing business, ended the third
quarter with $170 billion of assets, down 5% from last year, driven by a reduction of non-core assets of $5 billion as
well as $4 billion in our core book primarily from asset sales, including the Fleet Canada and franchise real estate
transactions we spoke about. Our book core volume in the Americas was up, was 2% higher than the third quarter of

2012, and new business returns remain attractive at about 2% returns on investment despite continued excess liquidity
in the market. Earnings of $479 million were down 15% driven by lower assets and impairments in our corporate
aircraft portfolio in the Americas business. Asset quality was stable.
Consumer segment ended the quarter with $136 billion of assets, flat with last year. Net income of $889 million was up
19%, primarily driven by lower losses as a result of not repeating the reserve modeling changes that we implemented
last year in this quarter and in the first quarter of this year. Lower losses were partially offset by no repeat of the $80
million gain on a partial sale of our interest in the Thai Bank in the third quarter of 2012.
The U.S. Retail business earned $665 million in the third quarter, up 50% from last year, again largely driven by not
repeating the reserving change and on strong asset growth of 11% in the quarter. Our current European business earned
$111 million in the quarter.
The real estate team had another very solid quarter. Assets ended the quarter at $40 billion, down 28%, and down $2
billion sequentially. The equity book is down 27% from a year ago to $16 billion. Net income of $464 million was up
more than two times versus 2012, and that was driven by lower losses and marks as well as impairments as well as
higher tax benefits. The businesses sold – the business sold 77 properties with a book value of $2.1 billion for about
$100 million of gains in the quarter. That's down slightly year-over-year. The business originated $1.8 billion of debt
volume in the quarter with an average ROI of 2.3% and asset quality continues to improve with 30-day delinquencies at
141 basis points, 68 basis points lower sequentially.
In the verticals GECAS earned $173 million. That's down 31% driven by higher impairments as part of our annual
impairment review. Impairments were $55 million higher in 2013 at $190 million. The impairments were principally
driven by valuations on cargo aircraft, specifically MD-11s. Overall the portfolio is in great shape with only 10 MD-11
freighters remaining in our fleet with a value of about $150 million. And we ended the quarter with zero delinquency
and no aircraft on the ground. EFS earnings were up 14% to $150 million driven by higher operating income.
So overall GE Capital continues to perform well. Its results were in line with our strategy, and as we look ahead to the
fourth quarter in terms of run rate, I expect the business to earn around $2 billion plus or minus, in line with the third
quarter and adjusting for impairments in GECAS which should not repeat and some tax benefits. We're currently on an
– we're working on a number of transactions in the fourth quarter, most notably the sale of our remaining interest in
BAY, the Thai bank, and the IPO of our Swiss Consumer business. At this point we expect that any benefits from these
transactions will largely offset with continued portfolio repositioning, but they could impact the tax rate in the quarter
and the year.
With that, let me turn it back Jeff.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Great, Jeff. Thanks. We really have no material changes to the 2013 operating objective framework. Our industrial
earnings will expand by double digits in the second half, and we're on track for solid growth in the year. We have no
change to our expectations in GE Capital. We continue to originate business at high returns while repositioning our
capital portfolio. And earnings growth remained solid in GE Capital.
Corporate costs reflect our Avio adjustment that Jeff described earlier and we continue to see good opportunity for
restructuring and positioning these efforts to continue. Cash from revenues remain on track. We should see earnings
growth accelerate in the fourth quarter with more volume and lower cost and with the large backlog and improving
margins we feel good about 2014.
We'll have several communication sessions with investors in the fourth quarter. In November, Keith and Jeff will
update our portfolio and business strategy at GE Capital and give you a sense for our long-term goals and
simplification across the company. And in December I'll give you a strategic update for GE and our outlook for 2014.
So we look forward to those sessions.

So in summary, we're making progress on our investor objectives for the year. Our industrial earnings grew by
double-digits in third quarter and we expect a stronger fourth quarter. Strength is broad based and we expect Power &
Water to be a key contributor going forward in the fourth quarter and into 2014. We grew margins by 120 basis points
in the quarter and we expect to hit 70 basis points for the year. In the event we have any gains in the fourth quarter, we
expect them to be applied to restructuring.
GE Capital continues to strengthen and we're on track for up to $6.5 billion of cash to be returned to the parent. We
expect organic growth of at least 5% in the fourth quarter for the industrial segments and we have solid momentum in
growth markets, Services, and NPI. And we have more favorable comparisons in Power & Water. So we're on track
and we're on track to return substantial cash to investors this year. So the team executed well in the quarter and with a
strong backlog and expanding margins investors should be confident in GE's future.
So, Trevor, with that, let's turn it over to you and take some questions.
Trevor A. Schauenberg
Great. Thanks, Jeff. I know there's another earnings call coming up so, Shaquana, let's open the phone lines.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Inch representing Deutsche Bank. Please
proceed.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Morning, guys. So the fact that we did $100 million more restructuring this quarter, do you
anticipate more restructuring in the fourth quarter? I realize, Jeff, you just said if there were gains you would offset
that. But how does that pertain to your plan and how are you thinking about the restructuring opportunity?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Well, maybe why don't I start and then, Jeff, I'll turn it to you. But we continue to have good
opportunities for restructuring throughout the company. And I would expect us to do some in the fourth quarter. But
again I think if we have gains, we expect those to be offset with restructuring.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I don't have a lot to add to that. I think that's right. I think the more we get deeper into the
simplification effort, we see just increasing numbers of opportunities to take cost out of the company and make the
company faster and more customer-centric. So I think we will do restructuring in the fourth quarter and as Jeff said,
more likely than not will reflect the gains in the quarter we expect as well.
<Q - John G. Inch>: And, Jeff Bornstein, you've been at this for a little bit of time now. As you said, are you finding
more opportunity? Or is it still a little early in the process before you would care to comment? In terms of the cost out –
sorry.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, so I would say around the simplification effort, I think every day we identify more
opportunities to do what we do smarter, more shared services, a smaller manufacturing footprint, rationalizing capacity,
executing our functions in a more consolidated way. So I would say the list is growing with time and we are in the early
innings of the simplification effort in this company. So I am quite emboldened with what we can accomplish over the
next few years.

<Q - John G. Inch>: And just I want to go back to the fourth quarter. It's still, I mean, you guys had great results this
quarter. It's still is a pretty big V though in terms of – and I think the delta is really the expectations around Power
shipments. Is that, I mean, is that really still on track? Or it just looks like it's a very high contributive quarter versus
even historical years, although you did put up the big margins this quarter. Just is there anything you can say to us
about the fourth quarter? I don't know progress-to-date? Or what you're seeing? Or anything like that?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, I think Power was obviously a big contributor in the third quarter. We're ahead a
little bit on Aeroderivatives and we – the fourth quarter ramp for Power & Water I think we feel very good about. I
mean, when we think about units for the fourth quarter, the large units, gas turbines, et cetera, most of that is in
backlog, better than 95% of it. So I think we feel very good about how we feel Power is moving into the fourth quarter.
And we've de-risked the fourth quarter a little bit with the outperformance here in the third quarter.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: John, so we've got – I think you start at 40, instead of – not 36. So you go from 40 and
march from there. We typically get a lot more revenue in Q4 than Q3. It's typical for us to get 300 basis points on
margin Q4 versus Q3 and Power & Water is very back-end loaded, as we have always said. So you've got a bunch of
stuff that really I think a little bit better in GE Capital. I think you've got a lot of stuff that says we're kind of ready for a
very strong fourth quarter.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Perfect. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis representing Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hi, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Wanted to get a sense when I look at the results, one of the things that really stands out to me
was the Power & Water orders, particularly excluding Algeria, up 37%. I really wasn't aware that anybody in the world
was buying a gas turbine right now or distributed power, for that matter. So can you give us a little granularity to help
us understand where geographically these orders are coming from and just a little help here?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, so when you look at orders in the quarter geographically for – we'll start with gas
turbines. In the resource rich regions, we were 18 units in the quarter versus 22, so down four there. Middle East we
were down 10 units from 11 to 21. A little bit better in Asia. We were flat five units versus five units year-over-year.
Most of the order strength really for Power & Water has been around our aeroderivatives units have been very strong,
and our wind units have been incredibly strong. So in the third quarter, we had 477 orders in developed markets on
wind. That's up 390 units. And that explains most of the strength around wind. And the balance is really aero.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I'd say, Scott, if you look at Q4, we expect Power & Water orders to be at the high end of
the range of what we talked about. So my hunch is that the orders will be closer to the 115 than the 100, and a lot of
that is Middle East. So we'll book some of the Algerian orders in Q4. We've got some big orders in Saudi, some nice
orders in Russia, a couple in Africa, a couple in Brazil. And on the aeroderivative market, we're seeing pretty good
growth in places like Canada, Middle East. So you've just got to be – I think it's – the GGO and the investment we have
made in emerging markets I think has really helped us collect the orders.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. That's very helpful. And lastly, guys, Jeff, the big theme of the year really for
communications has been simplification. You put a couple sentences on that in the Annual Report last year and you
were able to sell the other half of NBC, which I think helps a lot. But we haven't seen a lot of other portfolio actions.
What's holding you back? The Wall Street Journal reported that there's chatter around spinning off the credit card
business, but we haven't seen any announcements there. Is this stuff all just being vetted at present and we're likely to
see some announcements in the next couple months? Or is there – maybe you can just help us understand what's
happening.

of the value maximizing platforms of GE Capital. We've got a big meeting set November 15 with Keith and Jeff. I
think there will be more clarity at that time on the Capital side. And we continue, and the rest of the company continues

Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Hi. Just going back to Power & Water, that was obviously the big driver of upside this quarter and
congratulations on the margins there. But $100 million of EBIT growth year-over-year with sales down $700 million, I
understand price gap was a big benefit as well as simplification. But just want to confirm that, with service down 5%,
that's a negative mix, and big volume deleverage on gas and wind, I just want to confirm that 3Q was a good run rate
for 4Q and beyond?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Well, Nigel, what I'd say is I'd say the third quarter was slightly better than even what I had
thought just by a little bit, but a little bit better. We had better mix, so when you have more aeroderivatives and less
wind, that's a mix adder. And then we've got the simplification efforts, which Jeff said with margins or with value gap
and with SG&A down 10%, that really – it's a much leaner organization. And then when you look at Q4, you're going
to get kind of a bow wave of more wind business, aeroderivatives are still pretty strong, heavy duty gas turbines are
still pretty strong. And I think what you're going to see in Q4 is revenue growth, op profit growth and margin growth.
So what you're going to see in Q4 in Power & Water, I think is pretty typical of what you're going to see I think going
forward in the business into 2014.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, understood. And just, obviously you broke apart the old energy business into I guess two and
a half segments, Power & Water, Energy Management, and Oil & Gas. Are we seeing this benefit of that simplification
through here, or is it more the restructuring actions you have taken year to date?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Gosh, I would say Nigel, as we took out the layer, we got hundreds of millions of dollars of
benefits as we did that. So I think that was just a starting point. And then inside each business, we're – look, we're
committed to getting SG&A as a percentage of revenue down to a world class, best-in-class level, and we're on our
way. We made good progress. But we're not where we want to be yet. So you're seeing some of that benefits for sure
show up in the businesses, but we've got a ways to go yet.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And just finally going back to the Jeff Bornstein's comments on BAY, if that creeps into 4Q,
obviously the intention is to offset that with restructuring. That could be a pretty meaningful gain. So I'm just
wondering do you have a couple of opportunities already set to absorb that kind of gain and maybe any color in terms
of the focus areas from here for that kind of restructuring action?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah. I mean, we're constantly in flight on the value maximizing and the red book and GE
Capital, non-core book that we've talked about. So the gain could be sizable. We expect that it'll be quite profitable for
us. And we're working a list of items to position the portfolio for how we want to take it forward. So I think the team
has got a pipeline of stuff they're working.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. So just on the margin performance again, I mean, the overall industrial margin was
up as you say 120 bps, services was up 60 bps, so that means equipment was up 160 bps, 170 bps off flat revenues.
When you're thinking about the mix going forwards or, well the mix in your equipment backlog today and what that
means to revenue going forwards, do you think that kind of equipment margin growth is sustainable? Because
obviously you'll have a lot of mix hit coming into that equipment margin from wind and so on in the next sort of six
months.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, I think – what I would say right now is that we are running ahead of the game on
value gap. We're – through three quarters of the year, we're almost $700 million of value gap. We expect that to
continue to accelerate into the fourth quarter. On simplification and restructuring, Jeff talked about the fact that we're at
the $1 billion goal through the third quarter. We expect that to continue and accelerate into fourth quarter. So I think on
the cost side of the equation, we've got enough levers that we're working very dramatically to deal with the fact that
we're going to have more equipment shipments as we move into the fourth quarter. And I think those cost opportunities
are going to accelerate into 2014.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Got it. Thanks. And then within Oil & Gas, 18% revenue growth much more subdued
profit growth and obviously the margins were down, I guess what's behind the confidence that the margins in Oil &
Gas year on year will be up in Q4, because you had a pretty good margin in Q4 last year, and you're coming off a Q3
where the margin was down year on year?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Again, I would say we did have some execution issues in the third quarter getting the
backlog out and getting it out at the cost structure it was supposed to go out. We expect that we're going to improve on
that in the fourth quarter. We got a volume lift in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. We expect with all the cost
actions and the value gap we've created in the business in the first three quarters, we expect to get some leverage on
that in the fourth quarter. So I think we feel pretty good about the fact that we'll grow margin rates in the fourth quarter
in Oil & Gas.
They will not grow to the levels we thought they would for the year, and that's really mostly about the M&C business.
You know, we came into the year thinking the business was going to grow something like 16%. We're in low single
digits. And that's a real mix challenge for us, but we're trying to get it done with better execution in the shop and better
execution on the cost structure.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Got it. Thanks. And lastly very quickly just U.S., your gas turbine aftermarket business,
you know, gasified power gen consumption's down either 9% or 10% year-to-date. What are you thinking about your
U.S. Gas Services business sort of looking out from here?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: The orders were pretty good. We can probably get back to you with that. But...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I could tell you.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Do you have it, Jeff?

<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, just give me one second.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Also while Jeff's getting it, the quoting activity in North America is actually higher now in
gas turbines than we've seen in a while, so I think we're kind of guardedly optimistic at least on the unit side for 2014.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I think in the U.S. we've been pretty strong. I think we're up 8% PGS in the U.S. in the
third quarter. So there's still some strength in the U.S. As we said, Europe was tough, down 18% on services related to
heavy-duty gas turbine. But sequentially that's a bit of an improvement from where we were in the first and second
quarter. I think really what's driving us here in the third and fourth quarter in North America around PGS growth is our
Advanced Gas Path upgrades. We did 15 in the third quarter versus 4 a year ago. We expect to do more than that in the
fourth quarter. And that's very good business for us at very high margins. So I think we see a way forward here around
services

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: So I just wanted to just tackle this margin question a little differently. As you look out to 4Q,
you've got to have – in order to hit your 70 basis point target, margins have to expand by about 170 basis points and the
comp is a little bit tougher. It did about 17.3 last year. And so can you help me understand across each of these different
industrial segments which segments you think are going to be above or below that 170 number? And is it going to be
disproportionately skewed towards Power & Water getting much better?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Joe, I can start, and then maybe Jeff...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yep.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Jeff kicks in. But I think we see pretty broad-based – you know, pretty broad-based
expansion in Q4. Power & Water expands, but it's not the biggest driver. And we've got every business up by – up a bit.
And a couple, maybe three or four businesses up a hundred basis points plus. I don't know, Jeff, if you want to...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, let me go back to the framework we set for people. So we described the businesses
in one of three ways. We said the businesses we thought would grow margins for the year better than 70 basis points,
those that would grow 0 to 70, and those that we expected to be flat. And I think if we relook that framework today,
we'd say Oil & Gas is clearly going to grow margins less than the 70 – less than 70 basis points, we thought they would
do better than that. And Energy Management I would say is on a trend today to grow margins between 0 and 70 basis
points, not the greater than 70 basis points we thought.
In contrast to that, I think Transportation is going to be much stronger than what we originally said. We originally
thought they'd be flat, but we think they're going to grow margins pretty substantially for the year. And then we have a
shot here, we'll see how Appliance strength looks in the fourth quarter, but the Appliance business actually may push
through the 0 to 70 category to better than 70. So I think when you – and Aviation, Healthcare as well as Power &
Water are going be right about where we said they would be. So I think those are really the changes which is better than
– yeah, a 0 to 70 improvement.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. No, that's helpful color. And I guess a follow up to that is I know that you booked a
big Algeria order, and there's some short cycle...

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, we didn't book the Algeria order in the quarter.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Right. It's going to book. It's going to come through orders in 4Q. But it's also book and ship
on the aeroderivatives. I think there were 26 aeroderivatives that were going to book and ship in 4Q. My question is
based on what you either already have in backlog today or what you know is going into backlog in 4Q, how much more
do you have to do to get to the margin targets that you've set out?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think the Power & Water is almost all in backlog.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, so what I'd say is on the unit side, gas turbines, wind turbines, more than 95% of
what we'll do in the fourth quarter is in backlog today. Our Service business runs 50% to 60% backlog and that's kind
of where we sit today. I think we have within that we have very good line of sight to what we're going to do on the
AGPs in the quarter. So I think we're largely in pretty good shape. We'll probably do about 70 distributed power units
in the quarter and we're in reasonable shape on those two. They tend to be a little bit shorter cycle. So I think we have
pretty good visibility.

Please proceed.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, "Winbauer."
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. I've been called worse.

<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: That would be me, right? As I said, I've been called worse and not only by you guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Never by us.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: So two things I'd love to dig into. First one just pricing versus cost value gap. What was
the shipping price index, the industrial price index for shipments overall in the quarter?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Do you have that handy?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, give me one second, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Yeah, while you're doing that, my real, my question here is this has been such a
tremendous tailwind across the businesses. And as we look out and we look at the sustainability based on the order
pricing over time and I start staring into next year and relative to commodities, just the question is I know you guys say
you feel good about it. But maybe give us a little more confidence about what drives your conviction that you can
continue to create a value gap, a positive value gap there as we look out longer term past the fourth quarter?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Well, we still, Steve, we've got to do detailed business plans. I think the – for 2014. But
we've been running positive OPI on pricing on orders. I think we expect across most of the businesses that's going to
continue. And the early reads I've gotten on direct material deflation for next year and material productivity but direct
material deflation for next year is still pretty favorable to us. So I think this year, I don't know, last year we were $350
million bucks, something like that on value gap. This year we're at $660 million...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Just under $700 million through three quarters.

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Just under $700 million on the way to a higher number than that. I think, Steve, we're going
to be positive again next year. And that'll be something I'll give you more flavor for in the outlook meeting in
December.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Okay the selling price index in the quarter was 70 basis points positive.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, great. And then another question, so when you think about Avio and some of the
capital deployment and I guess the pricing and the $0.02 charges you sort of fair market valued the pricing on GAAP, I
mean, how does that – did that change your view of the financial metrics for the deal originally? And how do you think
about that? Maybe also broader context on Oil & Gas and some of those M&A that you now have got a lot more track
record now behind you, how are you thinking about that, Jeff, in terms of performance relative to your original
expectations?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Well, let me give Jeff the Avio question.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So what I'd say, Steve, on Avio is I think part of those, part of those fair value adjustments
tell you is the business was actually more profitable than what we thought we were buying. When we finally got in
there to see a lot of the detail, because of antitrust constraints we couldn't see a lot of detail around parts of their
Aviation business. So the adjustments were larger than we expected initially, but they're larger for all the right reasons.
Meaning the margins on the parts particularly GE90, they've gotten a ton of productivity over the last number of years
since they've been in the GE90 program. So that'll work well with us or for us going forward.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think, Steve, the Avio is kind of a unique accounting convention given their supplier
relationship with us. I think that's all goodness that's going to come back to us. So this is actually, this is actually, I
think, good, helpful. And on the Oil & Gas stuff, look, we like the places that we're in and the deals we've done. So –
but I think they're two different things. Go ahead, Steve. I'm sorry.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: I just was trying to get a sense of the financial metrics also as you look back on the track
record for the Oil & Gas deals a couple years ago.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Look, I think when we do reviews with our board, if you look at the deals we've done in
starting in 2011, 2012, and 2013 versus deal case, we're still running ahead on those.

<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hi, Deane.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Can we go back to get some color on the order pricing on Power & Water equipment
coming in negative in the quarter and also slightly negative in Oil & Gas? Just put this in context. Is there any change
in the competitive environment? Is there some FX impact? Because it does break a streak of some of the positive
pricing that you've had.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, I don't think – I don't know as it relates to Power & Water, I don't think there's a
huge trend change here. I think thermal pricing on units was just under 7% down. I think it's an extraordinarily
competitive market globally. I don't think anything has really changed there. Those dynamics haven't changed. On
wind, it really is a bifurcated world. In the U.S., we've gotten really good price over the first six months of the year.
And we feel good about where we're going with our U.S. wind business. Internationally, it's more competitive around
price, and wind in the quarter on OPI was down 130 basis points. PGS was – services was better. It was up 1.4% on

thermal.
And then Oil & Gas, we've got two specific dynamics going on. We had a really profitable order that we took in the
third quarter of 2012 in the U.S. around an LNG facility that we didn't repeat. And we had the big Russian Yamal order
here in this quarter that was not nearly as profitable as that as well. And that really drove Oil & Gas OPI down in the
quarter. We expect Oil & Gas OPI in the fourth quarter to get back to a positive, and we expect it to be positive for the
year on a year-to-date basis.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. I like that last point you made. And then just thinking about the fourth quarter,
Jeff, you said that you're tracking well for solid organic revenue growth. The slide says you're biased towards the low
end of the range, but clearly you've got more momentum here and I like your comment that you've got a slight hedge in
the plan, so more contingency. How has that contingency changed let's say versus the first quarter? Because you
certainly look like you've got a lot more buffer in hitting these margin targets today versus where we were in the first
quarter.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think, Deane, it's about the same hedge we had had at the end of the second quarter. And
then, for us on the revenue side, basically you've got the whole – the company ex- Power & Water, which has operated
pretty well all year, and what you're going to see in fourth quarter is just a more normal run rate for Power & Water. So
that's really – if you think about the range we had on the page and how I talk about the business going forward, really
the only difference is Power & Water. And so you're going to see a more normal quarter for Power & Water from a
revenue standpoint, and that should carry forward into next year.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Great.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hi. Good morning
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve. How you doing?
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Not too bad. So I think you said 5% industrial revenue growth as you were exiting the slide deck
before Q&A for the fourth quarter?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Is that – that's organic?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah, that's the expectation, around 5% for Q4.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So for the year, you guys are going to end up around flat for the year to up one, zero to
one type of thing?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: We think we'll be at the low end of the range in there, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Okay. And then I'm just curious as to ultimately, there were some moving parts here with
the slide you gave in the first quarter on Power & Water. I think it was Slide 5 where you guys laid out the first to the
second half and you kind of under-performed a bit in the second quarter on pure profit, $1.1 billion versus $1.3 billion.
You had $2.9 billion for the second half. Maybe could you just tell us where you're going to be relative to that $2.9
billion for profit for Power & Water?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, Steve, I don't know. I don't think we're going to guide on that.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: I mean, you're obviously going – you are going to be above it, though, right? I would assume?

<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, I don't think I can give you an answer on that. I don't think – we don't provide
guidance. I don't think I can give you that number. Here's what I'd say about third quarter to fourth quarter is the way I
would think about it: Power is a piece of this construct, is we'll end the third quarter here on an adjusted basis of $0.40
a share. We typically get a big volume ramp from third quarter to fourth quarter.
Last year that was $0.08. This year we've got a bigger ramp, volume-wise going from third quarter to fourth quarter.
We're going to do that with a much better cost structure than what we did last year third quarter to fourth quarter. More
value gap, we're ahead of the curve on SG&A and cost savings. That's going to give us additional incrementals,
additional volume leverage as we move from third to fourth quarter. So Power & Water is a piece of that framework.
They're a big piece of it because they have a very large volume ramp from third to fourth quarter. And I think we feel
very good about the construct that we have around that and all of that should help us achieve the 70 basis points for the
year.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, Power & Water is going to have positive revenue, positive op profit and positive
margins in Q4.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Yeah, right. Right.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: It's going to perform well.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Steve, the last thing I would add is if you go back the last seven years, five of the last
seven years we've grown margins from third to fourth quarter better than 250 basis points. In four of the last seven
years we've grown them more than 310 basis points from third quarter to fourth quarter. So...
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Yeah, clearly. And then just on the Distributed Power stuff, I didn't quite – again kind of going
back to that slide where you had Aero of 100 units. It sounds like you're dramatically kind of outperforming. Was the
Distributed Power – first of all could you just maybe talk about where the Distributed Power stuff came from this
quarter? And is this a timing issue for this year. Or is that pure upside this year relative to what you expected in the
fourth quarter? Because I know there was a big bunch of, big group of Distributed Power stuff coming in the fourth
quarter. It seemed to come a bit early.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Again, Steve, a lot of this, it's a pretty global business. I'd say there's more opportunities in
the Middle East and Asia and places like that. I would say, there was some more in the third quarter than what we
expected. And but I still expect them to have good solid growth in Q4 as well. But I would say we had, we probably at
the end of the day had a few more aeroderivatives in Q3 than we originally expected.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Okay, Steve. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan representing Nomura. Please proceed.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey. So just in terms of the restructuring and gains in the fourth quarter it sounds like
you might go ahead and do some restructuring. If you do, you'll have some gains in Industrial. But as it plays into the
70 basis points, right, the restructuring is in corporate, the gains are in the segments. Is that all gravy on top of that?
There's none of that sort of baked into getting to the 70 basis points?

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So, Shannon, the way that I talked about it today and the way we're planning is the 70 basis
points is without gains. So basically the intent is to use the gains we have to do additional restructuring.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. But like I said, restructuring will be below the line. I know there weren't any in
the quarter but there's none in the fourth?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: If we have them, right?
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Yeah, okay. And then just on the framework, the high single-digit to low double-digit
to operating earnings, back at EPG, you also used to show that, that translated to double-digit EPS growth. And now no
one is sort of there in terms of consensus. I mean is there, is this double-digit part of the equation sort of not on the
table anymore? I mean I know it's still high single-digits to double-digit operating earnings but doesn't seem like we're
getting there on the EPS basis. Is that kind of off the table at this point?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I mean, look we don't give guidance anymore, okay? So let's start with that. And again I
think you've got some stuff in Avio and stuff in corporate. But I would, when you look at Industrial and Capital, I
actually view those exactly the same way we've looked at them when I was at EPG.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.
<A - Trevor A. Schauenberg>: Shaquana, we're running up against another earnings call. So why don't we take one
more question here?
Operator
Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn representing Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Hi. Thanks for fitting me in.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Hey. So last year late in the year things got a little variable out there in the economy,
customers taking deliveries. So if we look at your backlog, wondering what the key variables are in terms of how
backlog execution could play out? And just for example, I think from Healthcare orders it would seem we'd be seeing
positive growth there by now?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah, look, I – Chris, I'd give you a view. I actually think the backlog is pretty firm. I don't
think, I don't think there's commercial issues really. I think what Jeff talked about like in Oil & Gas is stuff that we
could have executed – we could have executed better on. So I kind of – we're not seeing a lot of – we're not seeing
really any kind of variability in the marketplace in terms of customers pushing back on deliveries.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Great, thanks.
Trevor A. Schauenberg
