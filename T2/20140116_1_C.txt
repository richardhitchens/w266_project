Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements,
which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Actual results in capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of
factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC
filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
Mike L. Corbat
Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone.
Earlier today we reported earnings of $2.7 billion for the fourth quarter. Excluding CVA and DVA and impact of the
Credicard divestiture, net income was $2.6 billion or $0.82 a share. In our Institutional business, our fourth quarter
markets performance reflected an ongoing challenging environment. Sequentially, while our rates and currencies
revenues were relatively stable, our credit and securitized products revenues were lower due to reduced client activity.
And while in equities, client flows were relatively stable, we underperformed in trading. In contrast, Investment
Banking showed positive momentum during the quarter, driven by strong M&A and equity underwriting. And we
increased our overall wallet share for the year.
Transaction Services products demonstrated resilience in the low interest rate environment and regained positive
operating leverage for the second half of the year. Importantly, we continued to grow both our client volumes and
market share while demonstrating strong fee revenue growth on a year-on-year basis.
Our Consumer Bank performed well internationally, with Latin America showing continued revenue growth. The
ongoing efforts to reposition our franchise in Korea continue to impact our Asian results, but the region had good
performance otherwise. Our U.S. business saw a revenue boost from the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio. We saw
positive drivers in our Citi branded Cards business, and mortgage revenues broadly stabilized during the quarter.
For the full year, 2013 was every bit as challenging as we thought it would be when we entered the year. Low interest
rates, changing expectations regarding the tapering of quantitative easing, the increasing cost of legal settlements all
had significant impacts on our bottom line. However, while we didn't finish 2013 as strongly as I would have liked, I'm
very pleased with the progress we made over the course of the year, especially in regard to several critical areas I
highlighted in my first earnings call with you last January.
As a company, we improved our efficiency, completing the repositioning effort we announced last December. We
reduced our operating expenses by 2% and our head count by 3% in 2013 while exiting segments that didn't fit our
strategy. Key metrics such as ROTCE and ROA also improved as we made progress towards the targets we announced
in March. We also began to tap into our deferred tax asset, with $600 million of DTA utilized in the fourth quarter,
which brought the total amount utilized to $2.4 billion for the year.
Turning to Citi Holdings, with a $39 billion reduction in assets, we shrunk its size by 25% in 2013. We narrowed its
annual loss by half when compared to 2012, making good progress for getting to breakeven. We also managed to put
several legacy issues behind us through settlements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
By focusing intently on our clients, we grew loans in Citicorp by 7% over 2012 and improved our market share across
our Institutional businesses. And our net income of $13.8 billion was 15% above 2012 and the highest since before the
financial crisis.
Higher net income helped to accelerate the growth of capital during the year, and we exceeded our goal of ending 2013
with an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 10% by 50 basis points. We also received no objection to the capital
plan we submitted to our regulators in early 2013. In addition, our supplementary leverage ratio increased to an
estimated 5.4%, exceeding the regulatory requirement.

But being pleased with our progress doesn't make us satisfied, and I know our shareholders aren't either. We still have
work to do to generate the results that our shareholders expect and deserve.
Looking to 2014, we expect to be tested again as we believe the environment, while improving, will remain
challenging. We believe short-term interest rates will remain low for the foreseeable future. And although we're
working hard to put the remaining legacy issues behind us, legal headwinds will remain with us and the industry. And
while we do see an improving economic environment, growth won't be robust really by any means. We believe the
deceleration of growth in Asia has bottomed out and the Eurozone is continuing to recover, but albeit slowly.
Our projections for key markets such as Mexico, India, and Korea call for improvements over 2013 levels. In the U.S.,
we believe our mortgage revenues have stabilized. And we're working to reduce the costs associated with legacy assets
in Citi Holdings, as the recently announced sale of certain mortgage servicing rights shows.
We've entered 2014 as a strong and stable institution, as we work to leverage our unparalleled global network to the
benefit of our clients. We're completely focused on executing our strategy, and remain committed to the targets we
announced last year as well as our objective of returning capital to our shareholders.
With that, I'll now turn it over to John and he can go through the deck, and then we'd be happy to answer your
questions. John?
John C. Gerspach
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. To start, I'd like to highlight significant items affecting our results this
quarter.
First, CVA and DVA were negative $164 million pre-tax and $100 million after tax in the fourth quarter, for a negative
impact on EPS of $0.03 per share. We also recorded an after-tax benefit of $189 million related to the Credicard
divestiture this quarter, for a positive impact on EPS of $0.06 per share. For comparison purposes, in the fourth quarter
of 2012 CVA and DVA were negative $485 million pre-tax or $301 million after tax, for a negative impact of $0.10 per
share.
In addition, last year we recorded a large repositioning charge of over $1 billion pre-tax or $653 million after tax,
which had a negative impact on EPS of $0.21 per share. Given the size of the repositioning charge in the fourth quarter
of 2012, I will be discussing our results today excluding this item. However, we have continued to incur smaller
repositioning charges as part of our ongoing expense initiatives, and these charges are included in our expense numbers
for 2013.
Adjusting for CVA/DVA and the impact of the Credicard divestiture and the fourth quarter 2012 repositioning charges,
we earned $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013 or $0.82 per share, as compared to $0.69 per share in the fourth
quarter of 2012.
On slide four we show total Citigroup results. We earned $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, up over 20% from last year,
as lower operating expenses and lower credit costs were partially offset by a decline in revenues and a higher effective
tax rate. The effective tax rate was 32% for the fourth quarter of 2013, somewhat above the prior quarter and full-year
tax rate, primarily due to the amount of legal accruals estimated to be non-deductible.
On a full-year basis, revenues grew 1% while operating expenses were 2% lower. And credit costs also declined by
over $2.8 billion, driving earnings growth of 15%. Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 2% year over year to $668
billion, as 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings. And deposits grew to
$968 billion.
On slide five, we provide more detail on fourth quarter revenues in constant dollars. In Consumer Banking, revenues
grew by over $200 million sequentially, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition and continued growth in Latin
America. And year over year, the decline mostly reflected lower U.S. mortgage refinancing activity. Securities &
Banking revenues declined by over $450 million sequentially, reflecting lower markets revenues, partially offset by

growth in Investment Banking. And year over year, fixed income revenues were down. However, both equities and
Investment Banking showed improvement.
In Transaction Services, revenues have been fairly stable, as growth in volumes and fees continued to be offset by
lower spreads. Citi Holdings revenues improved year over year, mostly reflecting the absence of rep and warranty
reserve builds. Finally, foreign currency translation accounted for roughly $260 million of the reported revenue decline
year over year.
On slide six, we show more expense details. Core operating expenses of $10.9 billion in the fourth quarter declined by
roughly $340 million year over year in constant dollars, driven by efficiency savings and the decline in Citi Holdings
assets, partially offset by volume-related expenses. Sequentially, costs were down by roughly $50 million, reflecting
additional repositioning savings, partially offset by seasonal marketing expenses, deal-related costs in Securities &
Banking, and higher than anticipated expenses in Retail Services this quarter related to the integration of the Best Buy
portfolio.
Legal and related costs were just over $800 million in the fourth quarter. And as we had disclosed previously,
repositioning costs were somewhat higher than recent quarters at $234 million. In addition, we incurred an incremental
$33 million of compensatory fees to Fannie Mae related to the sale of servicing rights out of Citi Holdings we
announced yesterday.
On a full-year basis, core operating expenses of $44.3 billion in 2013 declined by nearly $900 million, driven by
firm-wide efficiency savings and asset reductions in Citi Holdings, partially offset by volume-related growth and
investments in Citicorp as well as higher regulatory-related expenses. However, legal and related expenses continued to
be elevated at roughly $3 billion.
On slide seven, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. In Citicorp, pre-tax earnings grew 4% year over
year in the fourth quarter, as the decline in revenues was more than offset by lower operating expenses and an
improvement in credit. And on a full-year basis, pre-tax earnings improved by 5%, with revenues roughly flat and
expenses down by 4%, partially offset by lower loan loss reserve releases versus the prior year.
Turning to Citi Holdings, revenues were $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, and the net loss was roughly $400 million.
For the full year, Citi Holdings losses declined by nearly half, from $3.7 billion last year to $1.9 billion in 2013, driven
by a significant improvement in credit and declining assets, partially offset by higher legal and related costs. Citi
Holdings assets declined by 25% during the year to $117 billion or 6% of total Citigroup assets.
Turning to Citicorp on slide eight, we show results for international Consumer Banking, again in constant dollars. On
this basis, revenues grew 2% year over year in the fourth quarter while expenses increased by 3%, driven entirely by
repositioning charges of roughly $80 million. International Consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression
as well as the impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of our franchise in certain markets, particularly Korea.
However, most key drivers remain positive, with both average loans and card purchase sales up 6% from last year. On
a full-year basis, revenues increased by 3%, driven by Latin America; while expenses grew 1%, resulting in positive
operating leverage.
Credit costs increased in 2013. However, the NCL rate remained stable, and loan loss reserve builds were mostly
driven by portfolio growth as well as specific builds for Mexico homebuilders during the year, as we have previously
discussed.
On slide nine, we show revenue details for Asia Consumer. Lower Retail Banking revenues in the fourth quarter
reflected the continued impact of regulatory changes, spread compression, and the repositioning of our franchise in
Korea. Investment sales revenues remained muted in the fourth quarter in line with investor sentiment. And Cards
revenues improved slightly both year over year and sequentially, with continued growth in purchase sales across the
region.
Korea remains a headwind. However, we continue to believe revenues in Korea should begin to stabilize in early 2014.
Importantly, credit trends have remained stable in Korea. And Korea's drag on year over year loan growth for total Asia

has diminished in recent quarters. Over time, Korea should better reflect our Consumer franchise elsewhere around the
world, with a footprint more concentrated in the major cities, a focus on high-quality consumer segments, and
improved returns.
Slide 10 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues were down 8% year over year and
grew 3% sequentially. Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion declined by 35% from last year, mostly reflecting the
lower mortgage refinancing activity. Sequentially, mortgage revenues have begun to stabilize, but will continue to
present a drag on year-over-year comparisons through at least the first half of 2014.
Branded Cards revenues of $2.1 billion were flat versus last year and up 2% from last quarter, driven by continued
improvement in net interest spreads and growth in purchase sales, offsetting the impact of lower average loans.
Retail Services grew 9% versus the prior quarter and prior year, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. Average
loans grew 18% year over year. However, spreads declined as promotional balances increased. Total operating
expenses of $2.4 billion were down 6% year over year, reflecting lower legal and related costs, ongoing efficiency
savings, and the resizing of the Mortgage business, partially offset by the impact of the Best Buy acquisition. Credit
costs declined modestly year over year but grew 19% sequentially, driven by lower reserve releases in Branded Cards
and the impact of Best Buy.
Overall, our North America business executed well in 2013 in the face of many significant changes, from the resizing
of our mortgage business to the continued revitalization of the Branded Cards franchise and the Best Buy portfolio
acquisition; and we continue to see momentum in the fourth quarter. Average deposits were up 5%. Commercial
market loans grew by 10%. And purchase sale growth improved in Branded Cards, reflecting the impact of investments
in that business as well as an acceleration of growth in the American Airlines portfolio since the merger with US
Airways was approved. We are pleased that we were recently awarded exclusive rights to issue new credit card
accounts in support of American Airlines following the planned merger of the American and US Airways frequent flier
programs by mid-2015.
Slide 11 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained favorable in North America in the
fourth quarter, with the decline in the NCL rate reflecting both underlying improvement as well as the impact of the
Best Buy portfolio, which was acquired late in the third quarter. Looking forward, we currently anticipate the NCL rate
in North America to be in the range of 3% for full-year 2014, as new loans continue to season in the Best Buy portfolio.
In Asia, credit trends remained stable in the fourth quarter. And in Latin America, we saw an uptick in both NCL and
delinquency rates. The higher NCL rate in the fourth quarter primarily reflected the impact of portfolio seasoning in
Mexico.
Looking to full-year 2014, we currently expect this portfolio seasoning to continue, with the NCL rate in Latin America
being broadly in the range of the levels we saw in the second half of 2013. However, the NCL rate may be somewhat
higher in the first quarter, as we typically see a seasonal decline in card loan balances.
In addition, as we've said previously, we took loan loss reserves in 2013 related to our exposure to Mexican
homebuilders as well as the hurricanes in Mexico in the third quarter. Any losses from the homebuilders or the impact
from the hurricanes may increase our NCL rate in the current quarters. However, we would expect these losses to be
charged against the reserve, and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit. The increase in the
delinquency rate in the fourth quarter was mostly driven by our exposure to homebuilders in Mexico.
Slide 12 shows our Securities & Banking business. Revenues of $4.6 billion declined 5% from last year and 9%
sequentially. Investment Banking revenues of $1 billion were up 3% from the prior year and 23% from last quarter,
driven by M&A and equity underwriting, partially offset by lower debt underwriting revenues. Full-year Investment
Banking revenues of $4 billion grew by 8%, as we continued to gain overall wallet share.
Equity market revenues of $539 million in the fourth quarter were up 16% from last year, reflecting improved client
activity in both cash and derivatives. Sequentially, equity market revenues declined 24%, as trading performance was
weaker and client activity slowed somewhat in December. However, we still made significant progress on a full-year

basis, with equity market revenues up 22%, reflecting market share gains, improvements in derivatives execution, and a
more favorable environment.
Fixed income market revenues of $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter declined 15% from last year and 16% sequentially.
Overall trading conditions remain muted for fixed income, as the government shutdown in the early weeks of the
quarter as well as continued speculation around the timing of Fed tapering resulted in an environment similar to the
third quarter, where it was more difficult to generate incremental trading revenues on client flows.
In addition, both the year-over-year and sequential decline reflected the absence of any significant revenues from our
Citi Capital Advisors business, which we continue to wind down. This business was not a material revenue contributor
historically, but did have a strong fourth quarter in 2012.
And finally, while our rates and currencies business showed resilience in the fourth quarter, with revenues down only
slightly from the third quarter, we did see a decline in spread products, particularly in securitized products. For the full
year, fixed income market revenues of $13 billion declined by 7%. Our full-year results reflected market share gains
across most products, including strong performance in credit and securitized products. However, we saw fewer market
opportunities in rates and currencies.
Private Bank revenues of $599 million were up slightly from last year and down 2% sequentially, driven by lower
capital markets activity. Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans,
were $393 million in the fourth quarter, up from prior periods, as higher volumes and lower losses from loan sale
activity were partially offset by lower spreads.
Total operating expenses of $3.4 billion were down versus the prior year, driven by lower compensation expenses,
partially offset by higher legal and related costs and repositioning charges in the recent quarter. On a sequential basis,
expenses were flat, as lower compensation expenses were offset by higher deal-related and legal and related costs as
well as the impact of foreign exchange. On a full-year basis, the franchise continued to show momentum, with revenues
up 4% driven by equities, Investment Banking, and our Private Bank, while expenses declined by 3%, resulting in 16%
growth in pre-tax earnings.
Moving to Transaction Services on slide 13, revenues of $2.6 billion were up 1% from last year in constant dollars, as
strong fee income growth more than offset a decline in net interest revenues. Treasury & Trade Solutions was flat year
over year, as volume and fee growth was offset by the continued impact of spread compression globally. And Securities
& Fund Services revenues were up 5%, as higher settlement volumes and fees more than offset lower spreads.
Client activity grew across the franchise. Trade loan originations were up 12% year over year. Average deposits grew
9%. Assets under custody were up 10%. And SFS settlement volumes grew by 15%. Despite these volume gains,
expenses of $1.4 billion declined 3% year over year in constant dollars, driven by efficiency savings as well as lower
legal and related costs. Given the modest revenue growth and expense decline in the fourth quarter, Transaction
Services achieved positive operating leverage for the second half of 2013.
On slide 14, we show expense and efficiency trends for the total institutional franchise. On a trailing 12-month basis,
we have lowered our operating expenses every quarter for the past two years, driving the total efficiency ratio from
67% in 2011 to 58% in 2013. Compensation has been a significant contributor, with the comp ratio for the total
institutional franchise improving to 29% in 2013.
In Securities & Banking, we have reduced the annual cost base by $1 billion since 2011. And while we have additional
work to do, on a full-year basis for 2013, our efficiency ratio in Securities & Banking was 59%, within our 2015 target
range of 55% to 60%. And in Transaction Services, the efficiency ratio was 54%, somewhat above our 48% to 52%
target. However, as you can see here, we have been able to keep expenses flat at $5.7 billion, even as we have gained
market share and built significant volumes. This should position us well for margin expansion in the future, as we look
to continue increasing the fee component of our revenues, as spreads stabilize, and we begin to see the cost savings
from repositioning actions taken in 2013.

Slide 15 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were up versus the prior year, mainly driven by hedging
activities, partially offset by lower AFS sales; while expenses declined, mostly reflecting lower legal and related costs.
Assets of $314 billion included approximately $116 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $141 billion of liquid
available-for-sale securities.
Slide 16 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with assets of $117 billion in Citi Holdings or 6% of total
Citigroup assets. The $5 billion reduction in the fourth quarter reflected $4 billion of net paydowns and $1 billion of
asset sales. These sales included roughly $400 million of North America mortgages, most of which were
non-performing.
On slide 17 we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.3 billion were up year over
year, primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve build this quarter. Citi Holdings' expenses decreased
4% year over year to $1.5 billion, driven by the decline in assets, partially offset by higher legal and related costs.
Excluding legal costs, operating expenses declined 16% to roughly $825 million, with North America mortgages
comprising over a third of these operating expenses.
As I mentioned earlier, yesterday we announced the sale of mortgage servicing rights for loans with a balance of
roughly $10 billion. While this is only about 10% of our third-party servicing portfolio in Citi Holdings, the sale
includes the majority of the delinquent loans we serviced for Fannie Mae. And it represents nearly 20% of the total
loans currently serviced by Citi Mortgage that are 60 days or more past due. This sale should benefit our mortgage
expenses in Citi Holdings beginning in the second quarter.
Net credit losses continued to improve year over year. And we released $540 million of loan loss reserves, substantially
all of which was related to North America mortgages. Mortgage net credit losses in the fourth quarter included $184
million of incremental charge-offs related to three items: first, a change in charge-off policy for mortgages originated in
Citi Financial to more closely align to policies used in the Citi Mortgage business; second, the acceleration of
accounting losses associated with modified home equity loans determined to be collateral-dependent; and third, a
change in the estimate of net credit losses related to collateral-dependent loans to borrowers that have gone through
Chapter 7 bankruptcy. These incremental charge-offs were almost fully offset by related loan loss reserve releases
during the quarter.
Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 18, excluding legal and related expenses, the
operating margin in Citi Holdings was positive again this quarter while credit cost continued to improve. The pre-tax
loss in Citi Holdings was roughly $500 million, driven by $647 million of legal and related expenses. Legal and related
costs remained elevated during 2013, driven largely by legacy private label securitization and other mortgage-related
issues. It remains difficult for us to determine the ultimate timing and cost of resolving these issues. However, as we've
said previously, we are hopeful we will have better clarity by sometime this year.
On slide 19, we show North America mortgage trends in Citi Holdings. We ended the quarter with $73 billion of North
America mortgages, down 20% from a year ago, while net credit losses declined by 50% and the loss rate improved by
roughly 120 basis points.
Here we show the breakdown of residential first mortgages originated in Citi Mortgage versus the legacy Citi Financial
business. As you can see, while loan balances and net credit losses are declining in both portfolios, the loans originated
in Citi Financial are becoming a larger proportion of the total. Given the borrower profile in Citi Financial, these loans
tend to have higher loss rates at around 5% versus a loss rate of around 1% for Citi Mortgage first mortgages.
We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgages in Citi Holdings or
39 months of NCL coverage. Looking at 2014, assuming the U.S. economic environment remains favorable, we
continue to expect to utilize loan loss reserves to offset a substantial portion of our mortgage net credit losses.
On slide 20, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenue grew to $12 billion in the
fourth quarter, driven by growth in average interest earning assets and a sequential improvement in margin. Our net
interest margin grew by seven basis points in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower funding costs as well as stable loan
and investment yields. We currently expect our net interest margin in 2014 should be at or around the 285 basis points

we achieved in 2013, with fluctuations quarter to quarter.
On slide 21, we show our key capital metrics. Quarter over quarter, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio
remained roughly flat at 10.5%, as our Tier 1 common capital continued to grow, driven by retained earnings and DTA
utilization, but our risk-weighted assets also increased by approximately $40 billion. Our DTA utilization this quarter
was roughly $600 million, bringing our total utilization for the year to roughly $2.4 billion, approximately $2 billion of
which was comprised of foreign tax credit carry-forwards.
The increase in risk-weighted assets quarter over quarter is entirely driven by an increase in our estimated
risk-weighted assets associated with operational risk. We continue to further refine and enhance our models under
Basel III. And given the evolving regulatory and litigation environment, we felt it prudent to increase our operational
risk RWA during the quarter.
Any changes to operational risk RWA, however, do not have an impact when calculating our estimated Basel III
supplementary leverage ratio, which increased to 5.4% in the fourth quarter. As we continue to move towards full Basel
III implementation, we expect there could be additional refinements or required enhancements to our Basel III models
as well as further regulatory implementation guidance. In addition, our Basel III models remain subject to regulatory
review and approval. Any such changes or requirements could result in additional increases in our risk-weighted assets
or changes to other elements involved in the calculation of our Basel III ratios.
In summary, we clearly faced a difficult environment in the fourth quarter, with continued challenging trading
conditions and low interest rates. However, against this backdrop, we did make progress on several fronts. Investment
Banking revenues were strong, driven by M&A and equity underwriting. Our Consumer business returned to growth
quarter over quarter, driven by Latin America and the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. In Citi Holdings, we continued to
drive towards breakeven. And we ended the year with a strong capital position at an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common
ratio of 10.5% and a supplementary leverage ratio of 5.4%. On a full-year basis, we improved on each of our key
financial targets, with better operating efficiency in Citicorp and higher Citigroup returns on both assets and tangible
common equity.
Looking forward to 2014, in Consumer, we expect the low interest rate environment to continue. However, some of the
headwinds that affected us in 2013 should abate as we go through the year. In the U.S., we believe that mortgage
revenues have broadly stabilized, while the impact of capacity reductions will result in lower expenses. Branded Cards
is beginning to show visible improvement, and we will benefit from a full year of Best Buy revenues. And for
international, we believe revenues in Korea should begin to stabilize early this year, alleviating the drag on Asia while
Latin America should continue to grow.
Our Securities and Banking results will likely continue to reflect the overall market environment, with a goal of
steadily gaining wallet share over time with our target clients. And in Transaction Services, we expect continued
volume and fee growth to help offset the ongoing pressure of the low rate environment.
Turning to expenses, core operating expenses, excluding legal and related as well as repositioning costs, were roughly
$44.3 billion for full-year 2013. Looking forward, our goal is to continue improving Citicorp efficiency while winding
down the assets and expenses in Citi Holdings. Our core operating expenses will vary with the revenue environment.
But as an example, looking at a low single-digit revenue growth scenario in Citicorp, we would expect our core
operating expenses in 2014 to come in at or somewhat below the level of 2013, as continued productivity efforts offset
by volume related growth investments and a continued increase in regulatory related expenses. And of course, there
would be variability quarter to quarter, particularly driven by our markets businesses.
Repositioning expenses are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2014, roughly in line with the levels we
incurred in the fourth quarter. Finally, legal expenses, which totaled approximately $3 billion for full-year 2013, are
expected to remain elevated into 2014.
In this environment, we remain focused on execution, gaining share with our clients, improving our efficiency,
maintaining our credit discipline, and winding down Citi Holdings in an economically rational manner.

And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. I was wondering about if you could discuss the roadmaps to the 2015 financial
targets. On the efficiency side of the targets, can you remind us of the levers that you can pull to get Citicorp to the
mid-50& efficiency ratio? Because when we include the repositioning expenses, it just doesn't feel like we're
experiencing major progress on the core expenses. So you mentioned ICG [Institutional Clients Group]. As long as
you're there, John, maybe you could talk about that. What can you do to get to these efficiency targets in 2015?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We did make progress on those efficiency targets in 2013. As I said, when you take a look
at the overall efficiency target that we said was going be in the mid-50%, we came down to 58% for Citicorp during
2013. And as I said, I didn't say that ICG is largely there, John. I meant to say if I didn't say it that Securities &
Banking is at least within the range right now, but we do still have more work to do.
In Transaction Services, we have been investing in that business. And we haven't had as much repositioning effort
necessarily in Transaction Services as we did in Securities & Banking during 2013, so I still think that there are things
that we can do there. There are levers that we can pull, as you put it, going into 2014.
And finally on Consumer, Consumer is the one where we didn't make – at least from the reported numbers, we didn't
necessarily make progress during 2013. Consumer is at about a 54% efficiency ratio for both 2013 and 2012. There, we
think that as we begin to get more of a rollout of our drive to common efforts, rolling out Rainbow and standardizing
the platforms for the Retail Banking and Cards businesses, we think then that that's where you're going begin to see
some more efficiency improvements in Consumer. So that is something that you should continue to see – you should
start to see in 2014 and then continue into 2015.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Could you remind us on these repositioning expenses? What are the nature of
these and why are they persisting at such a high rate? I think you indicated they might stay in the $250 million range
for the first half of the year and then you expect them to come down.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, let's just focus – the first half of the year we still think is going be elevated. And when
you take a look at what we anticipate and we're still needing to do in the first half of the year, we still are looking to
reduce our global real estate footprint. We still have facilities that are just larger than we currently need based upon
how we've been able to reduce head count. And there are still facilities; there are leases that we need to exit.
Part of the issue when it comes to real estate, John, is you can't just book reserves in advance of exiting the premises.
Your reserve has to be taken after or in the same period that you've actually left the building. And so there will be more
of that. We're still in the process of rationalizing our branch network in the U.S. You've seen some of the
announcements that we've made regarding branches in Texas and elsewhere. Again, we can make announcements that
we're closing down the branches, but the repositioning expenses to get out of those branches only happen when we've
actually left the premises.
And as I mentioned, as we roll out Rainbow and we move towards standard platforms in Consumer, certainly
throughout 2014 there are going be repositioning costs that we take as we continue to streamline the operations. It's not
just about moving onto standard platforms. Now once you move onto standard platforms, you want to standardize your
processes across the globe. And so that is going to incur some level of repositioning as we move forward. And then
we'll continue to look at delayering and rationalization of management structure throughout our businesses.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: When you talk about getting to the efficiency targets in 2015, that includes
repositioning expenses, right?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, when we've given you the targets for 2015, they've been all-inclusive.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: On the ROA and ROE side of the targets, the 1% ROA average and the ROE of 10%,
those goals for 2015, what are the drivers there? Are you relying on a hope that the legal costs come down to get you
there, or what else can help you get to those profitability goals?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Don't forget, as we continue to improve the efficiency, that should improve results in
Citicorp. And the biggest driving or one of the big driving factors that I think we've mentioned because don't forget
those goals that we've laid out for ROA and ROTCE were at the Citigroup level. And so we continued to look to drive
Citi Holdings close to breakeven.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, and one other question, John. On net interest income, you mentioned that the
margin outlook for the year flattish at 285 basis points of 2013. But you ended the year higher than that and you added
Best Buy in the fourth quarter. Just thinking about net interest income dollars, was there anything one-time-ish about
that strong $12 billion NII number that you're exiting the year at, and is there any reason that's not a good starting point
to try to grow off of this year?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, John. I'm a little cautious always when it comes to trying to forecast out NIM. There is
a component of NIM that gets impacted by our trading business, and that can have some variability in it. So I think by –
if you think about where we started this year, my guidance coming into this year was that I expected NIM to be at or
around the 282 basis points that we had for overall 2012. And we actually finished a little higher at 285 basis points. I
feel pretty comfortable just then establishing the fact that we will try to keep it constant going into next year. But
obviously, if loan yields can improve a bit and if we can continue to lower the cost of our funding profile, there could
be some upside to that number. But let's leave it at our expectations being at or around the 285 basis points for now.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: I was really thinking about the dollars, John. Your full-year NII dollars were $46.8
billion, but you ended the year with a $12 billion quarter and you have Best Buy now. So is there a reason on a dollar
basis that NII wouldn't be higher in 2014 versus 2013 with the Best Buy portfolio?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, you're absolutely right. The NII dollars should continue to be there. But again, when it
looks at NIM, you have to take that over your average earning assets.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yes.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And so right now we're saying NIM would stay about flat. But the NII should be – there's no
reason to think that it's going to decline from where we were in 2013.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Right. The $12 billion you did this quarter is a good starting off point on dollars, it
seems like.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's a good starting off point, John, but there's always likely to be some variability. And don't
forget; when you get into things like NII, you get impacted by day count and everything else. So certainly as you look
towards the first quarter, just the way the calendar works, there happened to be two less days in the first quarter
compared to the fourth quarter. So you can look at the fourth quarter of $12 billion, but that's 92 days and there aren't
92 days in the first quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it, thanks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Thanks. So I want to ask a big picture question about Securities & Banking, and it goes
towards John's question towards building towards those 2015 targets. And I guess the first part of it is, if you think
there's seasonality component that's heavily weighted in the first half because if you look at your progression, it's there.
So when you look at fourth quarter, it looks like you underperformed peer group. When you look at the full year, your
revenues are in line, your expenses are down, and you should be happy. But the problem is getting from current
earnings to what people need to see to hit your targets in 2015. This is my words. I think the Investment Bank is a huge
contributor of whether or not you get there. So I'm curious to see if, A), you think there's big seasonality that we should
be expecting. And B), what specifically at the IB is going help us drive towards those targets now that you're doing
your job on the expense side, or so it seems?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm going to turn it over to Mike. But when you talk about seasonality, there is certainly
some seasonality involved, but I think you have to take a look at the big change in environment that happened first half
versus second half this year. We started out with a much more positive environment. And then the second half as we
got into the whole concept of Fed tapering, government slowdown, that changed the environment and made it a much
more cautious environment in the second half of the year and certainly beginning in the third quarter. And that certainly
contributed I think a lot to what we saw as far as revenue production in the third and the fourth quarter. Mike, I don't
know...
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: I agree with that. I think, Glenn, when you look at the year and as we go through our numbers,
I think you've got to look that you can't just take a quarter like the fourth quarter, you can't take a quarter like the first
quarter and simply annualize them. I think you've got to look at the environment. And I think as we looked at the
second half of the year, probably really starting in some ways with Bernanke's May 22 talk and then through the
summer on EM [Emerging Markets] concerns and then as we entered the end of the third quarter and went into the
fourth quarter in terms of government shutdown, we had a number of factors that we had to deal with in there.
As I look at our S&B franchise and in particular as I look at our fixed income businesses, there's nothing in here that
causes me concern in terms of our positioning. I think that we're going to – through a transitioning policy environment
and through a transitioning rate environment, my guess is we'll have better quarters. We'll have less good quarters. But
our goal over the longer term is to continue to take market share. And again, I think when you look at our full year,
we've done that. Clearly, we didn't do that when we isolate the fourth quarter.
I think when you look at our path to the targets that, in spite of the environment we're in, we did grow revenues 4%
across S&B. And I think that while you could have more challenging parts of the fixed income environment, I think
you've seen the work and the investment that we've put in the Investment Bank starting to pay. I think that you can see
that some of the work we've done around equities starting to pay. But I think in each of those, we've got more to do.
But I think from that, through being focused on market share gains, expense disciplines, I think we've got the ability to
continue to grow bottom line in that business.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I have just one follow up on S&B. You had mentioned the 4% revenue growth in that
environment, Mike, and I hear you on change in environment. Can you talk about comp specifically? Because it's big
piece of expenses and you guys disclose differently, or should I say don't disclose comp ratio and comp dollars. Just
given the improvement in efficiency, I was just curious on how people should be thinking about, if the environment
does get a little bit better, the operating leverage in S&B.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Glenn, let me pipe in for a second. The efficiency ratio in ICG, as we've said, has been
steadily coming down. And what I thought I mentioned during my running through the slides is that compensation
definitely played a role there. And when you take a look at ICG, we actually had a comp ratio of 29% for 2013.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: And what was that last year, just in 2012, just so we have the comparisons?

<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's down from last year. Again, this is the first time we've disclosed it, so let's just establish
the fact that it's at 29%.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, I appreciate that. The comment on Korea caught my attention. Correct me if I'm wrong;
it sounded like a little bit better timing-wise in terms of when that might flatten out and improve. Is that correct? And
does that make much of a difference on the P&L because it's obviously been weighing down the rest of Asia, which has
been fine?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'd say it's more of a firming of the timeline. When we mentioned at the end, back in
October, that it should stabilize sometime in early 2014, it sounds like it's six months way. I think now when you hear it
and you're sitting in January, it's something that could happen within the next three months. So it certainly – we have
reaffirmed I think the guidance that we gave you last year as far as our belief that those Korean revenues should
stabilize. And we think that's going to have impact on the overall growth trend in Asia.
If you go back, Glenn, to the beginning of 2012, at that point in time consumer loans in Korea represented 34% or so of
the loans that we have in the Asia consumer franchise. Since that time, we've been reducing the loans in Korea. Korea
loans have come down about $5 billion during those ensuing eight quarters, while you've seen the loan growth that
we've had in Asia. That's now because of the loan growth we're getting out of Hong Kong, out of Singapore, out of
India. So we're getting loan growth. And so now Korea loans represent something like 27% of the loans that we have in
our Asia Consumer franchise. And the reductions – the sequential reductions in the Korea loan book have begun to
slow. And so we see the revenue stabilizing early in 2014, and then you should get a much better view then as far as the
underlying growth that we're actually generating in some of those other geographies, those other countries in Asia.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, last one. I appreciate that, John. The Springleaf IPO, that's similar to something you've
got inside Holdings. And I know you've been asked questions on this in the past. But now that it's public, now that the
stock has done well, does that mean there's a potentially better funding environment to do something strategic there,
whether it be sale, partnership, or IPO in a similar manner?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Glenn, as you may know, we've been pretty closely involved with Springleaf in terms of
helping them go out and raise funding as well as being a lead in terms of the IPO, so I think we've got a pretty good
sense of that. And I think it goes back to what we've talked about; that when we think the environment is right such that
we can be paid value for that business, it's a business that is a terrific business but is a business that's non-core to really
what Citi is. So we're continuing to explore options with that business. And when the time is right, we're certainly
going be prepared to move on it.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. I appreciate the answers, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Hi, guys.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Just drilling down on the expense outlook of flat to down, can you give us a sense of how
much savings are still to come from the various repositioning that you've done and how much might be natural expense
creep and if there's a component that's discretionary in terms of investment spend? Or if that's not the right way to think
about it, how should we think about the components?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The only savings that we've actually talked about, that we've talked publicly about that's
specifically linked to the repositioning was the $1 billion charge that we took in the fourth quarter of last year. And we
said that the anticipation was that that would generate savings of about $1.2 billion annually, $900 million or so in 2013
with an annual run rate of $1.2 billion, and we've hit that. So you've got that in the numbers.

The rest of the repositioning actions that we've taken, and we've showed you at least the amounts that we've done,
they've been much smaller actions as we've gone through the year, other than the fourth quarter where we went up to
$234 million. I think the average run rate for the other three quarters was something in the $100 million to $115 million
range. But it's all these types of actions that I laid out as far as the types of things that we would be looking to do in
2014. It's delayering; it's taking out management layers. It's repositioning the branch footprint, et cetera, et cetera. And
all of those things are contributing to the expense base, the overall expense base.
We have had some, as you've put it, expense creep. I wouldn't necessarily refer to it as creep, but we do continue to
invest in expanding our marketing programs, of expenses associated with new product launches and development. So
all of that we would think about as being investment spending as far as going into – which will eventually yield to
growth in revenues. So I think on a going-forward basis, the expectation would be that as long as we're in, as we would
say, a low single-digit revenue growth environment, we're going to continue to make some investments to achieve that
revenue growth. But overall, the impact of the repositioning actions should offset the cost of those investments.
On top of that, we haven't really spelled this out in any great degree of specificity, but we have had and we have been
absorbing higher amounts of regulatory related expenses. I think I mentioned that during the script. But if you take a
look at our regulatory expense build, year over year I think we grew our regulatory related expenses, expenses
associated with everything from AML to compliance, et cetera, et cetera, by about $300 million, so that's expense
growth that we've got this year. That has been more than offset by some of the efficiency programs. Over two years, it's
probably – there was probably an additional $200 million to $300 million that we had in expense growth in 2012 over
2011 levels. And just based upon the way we're looking at 2014, we're likely to have an additional $200 million to $300
million of incremental regulatory expense in 2014, all of which we expect to be able to cover. So when I say expenses
flat to down, it means covering the incremental regulatory expenses. It means covering the incremental investment
spend all with repositioning actions.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And obviously, if the environment changes, if we end up with an environment that doesn't
look like we're going get any revenue growth, then we'll take other actions.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, that's helpful color. And then just separately, within equity trading, you have been
gaining a lot of momentum there the last few quarters. I can appreciate in any one given quarter there can be some
noise. But just – is it just a blip you think in terms of the progress that you have made there, especially on the equity
driven side, or is there something else that we should be thinking about?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Matt, you're referring to the quarter-over-quarter performance? I think as we look, I think on a
relative basis as you look across, and we'll see where everybody finishes, I think we're appearing to be roughly in line
in terms of our equity performance, albeit coming from a lower base. But from our perspective, as John described, I
don't think on the derivatives side yet we've got trading where we'd like it to be. And so I think that, unfortunately,
none of this is linear, but I think we're making progress. And I think in 2014 we'll continue to make progress on that.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay, Matt.

<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Hey, just maybe a quick question maybe following up on a prior question on fixed income in a
couple of ways. If we look at the last couple of quarters, ex-Citi Holdings, your balance sheet really has been pretty
flat. Given your capital strength – and I think trading assets were down. Given your capital strength and the potential
that some of your peers overseas are deleveraging, why shouldn't we start seeing that part – that grow? What needs to
get – what needs to happen for you to get more comfortable in growing your balance sheet given your capital strength?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: I think as you look at a couple pieces, I think one is I think that some of the transition or
uncertainty coming through the summer months around some of the transition of rates in the EM and whether it's
against the bits economy and some of those that came under pressure. I think that we've had some of our trading desks
probably trading closer to home and probably for parts of the second and the half of the year have been more risk off.
But again, I think as our trading desks see opportunities, they're free to go after them. So I'd say there's nothing
prescribed here, but I think our trading desk in parts of the world decided to take some risk off as we got into the
second half of the year.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: That makes sense. Just maybe as a follow-up to that, we have had the Fed decide to taper. We
do have a budget deal. Do you think that has changed at all the tone when you talk to your trading desks of things
feeling a little bit better as we go into 2014, or no?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Yes, I think so. I think you have conversations probably, Jim, that range from things feel less
bad to conversations that actually things are feeling better. And I think when you look around the world, I think in
some ways 2013 probably surprised itself in terms of what happened from growth. We had a number of revisions out of
some of the big countries, big regions down. And I think as you look across the globe in 2014, you've got most of those
areas at a minimum stabilized and in many areas coming back up. So I think that people feel, and you can look at the
way on the fixed income side they're trading. I think people certainly feel much more comfortable with the taper, the
$10 billion a month taper today versus where we were five or six months ago. So the answer I think is yes. I think the
environment is better.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay, great. That's helpful, and just one last question on Transaction Services. I appreciate the
challenging rate environment, but I guess I'm just struggling with big volume growth but flat revenues across the board.
It seems like your NIM overall has been pretty stable. What is unique to that business that you're still seeing big
compression in spreads?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: I wouldn't say it's anything unique to that business. When you take a look at our Transaction
Services business, it really is dissimilar to any other deposit business where you've seen the impact of spread
compression. And it's just – one of the ways that we get paid for doing cash management work is through balances that
people leave with us.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: No, fair, but I think it seems like if we look at your competitors and disclosures, deposit
spreads have been pretty stable the last one or two quarters. Just wondering why we're not starting to see a little bit
more impact on revenues from volume growth?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Actually, all I can tell you is that we're continuing to see the volume growth just able to offset
the spread compression.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay, fair enough. Thanks.
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: All right.

<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Hi, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: I guess probably by now good afternoon. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the decline in
FICC. You talked about spread products in particular, securitized, but I guess also credit. And I just wanted to get some
clarity on how much of that decline was emerging markets as opposed to more domestic stuff?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Guy, when you mean talk about the decline, I just want to make sure that I answer your
question. Are you talking about the sequential decline?
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Actually both, the sequential and the year-over-year.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All right. Then from a sequential – I'll be very specific. On a sequential basis, as I said,
when we take a look at rates and currencies and the environment in which it was operating in, in the fourth quarter,
very similar to the third quarter, low single-digit reduction in revenues and no real noticeable fall-off with anything to
do with the emerging markets because the environment was the same. When you take a look at year over year, we did
have a bit more of a drop-off in rates and currencies on a year-over-year basis. And the bulk of that drop-off would
have been seen in the emerging markets. It's just a change in sentiment from where we were at the tail end of last year
to where we were the end of 2013 regarding emerging markets, and that has been reflected in our year-over-year rates
and currency.
And I think if you go back and if you remember when I said it, I was probably a year ago and probably in the first
quarter pretty complimentary of our trading desks saying I felt our trading desks in particular in the EM, had done an
exceptional job in terms of trading QE, of the intermediation between central banks, financial institutions, corporate
users, et cetera. And I think clearly, really from midyear on, we've seen a slowing of that QE related activity.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it, that's helpful. And I think I heard John say that the linked-quarter increase in RWA
density and I guess just RWA was pretty much all driven by operational risk. In turn would that just be the higher
litigation costs over the last year?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, that's right. And, Guy, you did hear that correctly. And it's driven by the higher level of
litigation-related activity throughout the industry. It's much more of an assessment of what's going on in the industry.
When we take a look at operational risk in our various businesses, we have to look both at ourselves but also at the
industry as far as measuring the type of operational risk that our businesses face. So it's very much our view as to
what's happening not just with us, but with some of the other things that you've seen hit the press as far as the industry.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. So if a couple of your very large competitors have some outsized issues, ultimately
that does impact to some extent your own operational risk?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That is correct, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that helps too. As we think about those litigation costs, I think I heard you hinting that
going forward into 2014, we should probably keep something like the same run rate. Is that all the way through the
year?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm just going to leave it that we think that, given the current environment, you should
anticipate legal and related expenses staying at elevated levels.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And how does that intersect with the baseline $44.2 billion or $44.3 billion of operating
expense? That should come above and beyond that as we think about that? I just want to make sure I'm clear on what
you're telling us.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, Guy, that would be above the $43 billion number that I talked about.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And reposition ongoing low level but persistent repositioning charges, those are outside of
that number too or in it?

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Those are outside of that number that I was specifically talking about, but they are in when
we talk about achieving the efficiency ratios for 2015.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it, by which time, of course as you pointed out, you should be getting some of the
benefit of the earlier ones?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Correct, correct.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And then a final one for me. The runoff in Holdings slowed – continued, but it did slow in
the quarter quite a bit. Any sense that you can share with us as to why that happened?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Yes, I think it's – again, we're opportunistic in terms of what the market offers us. And in this
case, again, we'll take advantage of any prices out there where we think that the sale of that and the combination of
reduced expenses, derisking, give-up in terms of revenue where those tradeoffs make sense. I think in the fourth
quarter, there was probably less of those. But again, I think as we think about the Holdings portfolio, I would say from
a primary objective it is to drive Holdings to breakeven as soon as practically possible. And again, at this point we've
got Holdings assets below 6% of GAAP assets for the firm. It's not a meaningful number in terms of the overall area of
the firm. And again, it's the optimization of how we continue to wind that down with an emphasis on getting it to
breakeven.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, fair enough, so you're still obviously exploring opportunities as they make sense to
sell chunks?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Absolutely.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thanks. I wanted to ask you a little bit about just an accounting technical question. Is
there any way that you could have, since Citi Holdings is getting smaller, take that and almost put into discontinued
operations as you're really looking to make it be breakeven and then it just comes off the income statement?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Marty, no. The answer to that is no.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: So there's no way that you can envision being able to ring fence it enough to separate it
out?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, no.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: There isn't.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: The other thing was, as we saw some of the securities and capital markets revenues come
in, we haven't seen the expenses come down as quickly. Does that reflect more of a fixed base there a little bit more
than the variable base? And as you see the pop back up in revenues, will expenses stay relatively flat and not offset a
lot of that rebound you might see in the first half of the year?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Marty, when we tend to look at these things, we tend to look at full-year efficiency ratios.
And again, I think if you take a look of what we've done with Securities & Banking over the course of the full year, we
have taken expenses down. Expenses have come down, as we said, by 3% as we've actually grown revenues 4%. And
when you take a look at the efficiency ratios that we now have in Securities & Banking, we've gone from something

north of 60% to where this year, for 2013, we've now reduced the efficiency – or improved the efficiency ratio to 59%.
So we're very conscious of taking expenses out. You may not see the variability quarter to quarter, but you should
certainly see it year over year. And we think that we've been able to make fairly steady progress on that front in
Securities & Banking.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: I think we can see that efficiency coming through the numbers. I was just wondering on
the variability, tying one to the other versus setting a base that then [ph] you build in (1:15:11) efficiencies given what
you think you're going to produce, and then you get the positive variability and upticks that you might get in revenue.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, and again, when you take a look at ICG overall, as we said, our comp ratio, and that
certainly is a lot when it comes to the extent that you've got variability, you might think of it at least traditionally in
terms of comp. Our comp ratio right now in our Institutional business is at 29%. And of course, embedded in that
would be the truly variable aspect of it, which would be incentive compensation, which is obviously lower than 29%.
So you have to think in terms of variability with some of those constraints.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then just lastly, the steepening of the yield curve, what kind of things are you seeing
that might help get the net interest margin to be able to remain with some of the gains that you've seen here recently?
Are there some favorable either spreads on the trading account or just reinvestment yields being higher that might, if
we can keep the yield curve at this level, be positive going into 2014?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Obviously, as far as we're concerned, the biggest help would be some movement on the
short end of the curve.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Sure.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We've begun to see some movement in the five-year to ten-year, maybe as low as the
three-year, but the short end of the curve has been pretty flat. And we are positioned to benefit from a rise in rates, but
it's really going to have to come more on the short end to really get the lion's share of the benefit.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thanks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay, Marty. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. How are you?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So a couple of questions. One, you indicated earlier the mortgage MSR sale that you are just
beginning to do. Can you just give us some color on how you're thinking about how that's going be impacting
expenses? I know you indicated it was predominantly delinquency related. So if you could help us out there, that would
be helpful. Plus RWA reduction in Holdings, is it going to have some noticeable impact there?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Let me take the second one first, no.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: You're not going to see – because it's mortgage servicing. These aren't on-balance sheet
assets, so you're really not going to see a change in the Holdings RWA.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sure. No, I was just hopeful on operational risk or something like that, but I guess not, okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: When you think in terms of operational risk, I wish it was simply as easy as you take an
action and you see a result. What happens with operational risk is someone else takes an action and that causes you to

really need to add to your operational risk. And then it takes three, five years for that operational risk to eventually
wash out. So unfortunately, operational risk has a long half-life.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And it's just going to be with us for a while.
But getting back to your original question, Betsy, as far as the mortgage sale, I think the biggest benefit you're going to
see there would be from an expense point of view. When it comes to processing or servicing delinquent loans, other
than foreclosed loans, that's the most expensive loan processing that we have. And just to give you a frame of
reference, a non-performing loan, you can have annual servicing fees of 15, 20, 25 times the size of the annual
servicing fee for a performing loan. So it may sound like it's a small sale. But again, it's 20% of the 60-plus day
delinquent loan book in Citi Mortgage, and so that's pretty important.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Then on repositioning charges that you indicated the first half of 2014 could be
running similar to 4Q 2013, are those repositioning charges for first half 2014 related to things you've already
announced like the Texas sale and the Philadelphia exit, or does that also include things you haven't yet announced?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It would include things that we have not yet announced.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then lastly just on – I want to make sure I understood what you were saying about
the American Airlines credit card. Are you saying that you won that going forward for American and US airlines
merger?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: What we have right now is an agreement with our partner, American Airlines, that when
they merge the two frequent flier programs, and they anticipate doing that around mid-2015, at that point in time we
will have exclusive rights to issue cards.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, so did you have to pay anything to get those rights?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We're not releasing terms of the agreement at this point in time, okay?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, but anything that was is in this quarter's run rate?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Exactly.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. Just to confirm, John, so are you committing for Citi to show positive operating leverage in
2014? I know you said expenses should be flat to lower, but is that assuming revenues will be higher?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I didn't say anything about committing Citi to positive operating leverage for 2014. That's
not something that I'm going to talk about right now, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. Is that because you aren't sure if you'll get it or don't give that sort of forecast?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Mike, that's rather a long-range forecast. We don't do things like try to guide you quarter by
quarter on earnings. So I'll give you general expense guidance as far as what we're trying to do with expenses. And
expenses again, and I couched it assuming there was going be a low single-digit revenue growth rate in Citicorp that we
would expect that operating expense to be at or below. But there's a whole other slew of items such as things that we
don't know about and we're not going to talk about as far as the legal environment. Right now, we would anticipate that

being continued elevated. But I'm certainly not going to forecast where legal expenses are going to be for the year, and
that would certainly drive into a lot as to whether or not we're going to have positive operating leverage going into next
year.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay, maybe my follow-up is for Mike. I think your message has resonated with a good group
of people in terms of managing Citigroup more as a portfolio of businesses where you have optionality. You have that
chart with resource allocation with your four buckets: optimize and grow, invest to grow, optimize/restructure, stay the
course. So I'm just wondering when you're going to take another move. As you say, it's uncertain and challenging
environment and it's tough to make too strong a forecast. Citigroup has missed earnings expectations two quarters in a
row. Citigroup is the only big bank that trades below tangible book value, and it's been not quite a year since your
March 5 presentation. So as an analyst, I feel as though I've been watching this movie. And personally, I've liked what
I've seen for the first year, but I feel like I'm at intermission now on the second box of popcorn waiting for your next
act. And when do we get to see more about the restructuring at Citigroup?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: I think when you look, Mike, if you look at 2013 and you look at what we managed to
accomplish in essence in the first half of your movie or in your first box of popcorn, we had revenues up. We had
expenses down. We grew EBIT by 28%, net income by 15%. We grew loans. We grew deposits. We shrunk Holdings
by 25%. We significantly increased our capital. We used DTA. We explicitly used foreign tax credits that are on the
clock. And so when we look at, and as we've described for 2014, as John has used the words, we're going continue to
be focused on our execution. And we think the environment economically, while getting better, remains challenging,
low single-digit revenue growth. We've got to be mindful of expenses. And I think when you look at the drivers in our
business, we are making progress against it. And whether that's deposit growth, loan growth, purchase card sales, you
go through the checklist of those things and the fundamentals are there. And for 2014, we're going to stay focused on
doing that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: John mentioned that some of the repositioning charges ahead are for some actions not yet taken.
Can you give us any preview of where you're looking?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: The way I would describe it, Mike, and we've talked about it before, is that what we're really
trying to do is drive the mentality into the business of our businesses making decisions of how and where and with
whom they should be doing their business. And rather than having these series of one-offs, I want them to come to
work towards in essence, as you've described it, this portfolio of businesses that we need to make sure we're optimizing
and running in the right way. And I think in there, what you would see is a continued series of business moves. I don't
think I would sweep it all together and ascribe a big fundamental change to the company or to the strategy.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, but it builds on the optimization bucket. A lot of the actions, Mike, that we're talking
about doing early in 2014 would fall into that bucket of optimize. We've got countries where we can still rationalize our
branch footprint and take out expenses. And so it really is just continuing the execution on the strategy that Mike talked
about last March.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Maybe as a follow-up and more specifically, page five of your March 5 presentation from last
year, Mike, you talked about the execution priorities. And Citi Holdings wind-down, you made great progress year over
year. It's kind of like if I look at the year, it seems like big progress but the quarter wasn't great progress. The question
is, are you temporarily stalled, or should we see a resumption of greater DTA utilization in the quarters ahead, greater
Citi Holdings wind-down ahead, and greater expense reductions ahead?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Again, I think that we've got to look what's obviously in the best interest of our stakeholders
and shareholders. And when you look what would the world like, would our shareholders want us to destroy value
simply to get a headline gap reduction in Citi Holdings? As John said, I think we've made real progress in terms of
reducing that drag. And today largely what we're faced with is the legal build around legacy issues. We can't control
those. So we're not going to make silly choices to simply sell assets to get a reduction in assets as opposed to really
trying to manage in the round risk reduction, expense reduction, against give-up of income and net income against that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And lastly...

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Mike, when you talk about the DTA, this is building on what Mike just said. When you look
at our DTA utilization for the year, and I mentioned the number of $2.4 billion, that basically all came out of earnings.
When you take a look at the impact on DTA utilization through other comprehensive income, it was basically nothing.
It was just flat. But if you break the earnings component down, we had our Citicorp businesses utilize $3.3 billion of
DTA. And the losses that we continue to have in Holdings actually created $900 million. That's one of the reasons why
driving Holdings down to breakeven is so important because we think again that will allow our investors to see the full
capacity that our franchise has for utilizing that DTA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then last follow-up, you, Mike, have said this before. To the extent that housing has
improved, liquidity has improved, stock market has improved, that should improve your optionality to take more
aggressive action. So that better environment combined again with the stock trading below tangible book value, doesn't
that want to make you be a lot more aggressive or at least a little bit more aggressive?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Again, I think that we've got a footprint, as I've spoken about, that is unique, and it's up to us
to get the most out of it. You saw us during the course of the year, Turkey, Paraguay, Uruguay continuing to rationalize
the consumer footprint. And again, I think we'll continue to look at those things on the edges. But I don't want to
mislead you, Mike. We're not looking for any big move here in terms of the strategy of the firm.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Good morning.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: John, in your comments about your FICC trading numbers on a full year this year versus
last year, you mentioned that there was a change in sentiment in the emerging markets, which caused the trading to be
weaker. Was that due to the U.S. government shutdown in the middle of the year? What do you think caused the
change in the sentiment in the emerging markets?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: John, it's Mike. I think we pointed to a couple things. I think, one, I think clearly there was a
concern or a sentiment shift for a period of time after Chairman Bernanke's comments on May 22. I think that for a
period of time, people were uncertain as to how they were thinking about that. I think we then went into a period of
time where people were worried about this rate transition, in particular, in essence those budget deficit economies. We
had the evolution of the bits or the five that came out of that, and some concerns reemerged around the emerging
economies. I think as we then went into September and October, we started to really enter into some of the Washington
impasse around budget, et cetera. And I think it was a combination of those things really throughout the latter half of
the second into the third and fourth quarter that I think weighed on people.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. In regards to your comments on the operational risk, how it's increased the
denominator in the equation, can you guys quantify for us the basis points, how much it's costing you in the ratio from
a basis point perspective? Is it 30 basis points?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, when you work it all the way through, it's somewhere in the vicinity of 50 basis points.

mortgages, I believe, inside of Citi Holdings. What did you receive in term of price versus your carrying value?

LQIF, so that's our ownership interest in Banco de Chile. That is still there. The other one of size would be our

your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Hey, guys, a couple of maybe ticky-tack questions. In terms of the regulatory costs that
you mentioned in terms of being embedded in that $44-plus billion core run rate, each year $200 million – $300 million
incrementally, this year as well, are those costs that are permanent each year, or are we coming to an end in terms of
this year, at least as far as you can tell that might be the last of it? And are those permanent, or will those then reverse at
some point?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I would say very, very few of them will reverse. I think that those are just the incremental
costs of doing business now for banks, and I don't think we're the only bank that's going through that. So those are just
costs that are going be embedded in our expense base going forward as we need to meet new requirements. And there
still is some expense build. I don't want to categorically say that 2014 is the last build in that expense base, but I guess
we're all hopeful that certainly in the near term you'll start to see some of those incremental expenses, the growth rate
abate.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it, that's helpful. So it sounds like those are in response to new evolving regulatory
burdens rather than catch-up, and so they may be related to the changed guidelines on CCAR, CLAR, counterparty
credit risk, et cetera. Is that fair versus a catch-up?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'd say it's a combination of – it depends on how you think about the catch-up. But it's in the
areas that you noted, but it's also in other important areas as far as anti-money laundering and KYC [Know Your
Customer] and some of the mortgage-related expenses where we've got enhanced requirements. So I'd say it's a
combination of new things as well as I guess what you could say are enhanced expectations on the part of various

regulatory bodies as to how you're going to comply with various regulations.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Thanks, and then I'll try another way at it in terms of the expense base on a core basis.
You mentioned that on a low revenue-type backdrop. If the revenue environment ends up being ultimately worse than
that, if it's flat or down, could it be down even more, or are there additional levers in the drawer to pull if that were to
play out?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, I would say that certainly the first thing that you would do if the environment looked
like it was going to be even more challenging than we think it was going be, the first thing you would stop is you'd stop
a certain amount of investment spending. And so that would be an immediate lever that you could pull. If you thought
it was going to go deeper than that, you would re-pace other things. We might re-pace some of the other systems work
that we're doing. You would then also take a look at various – the capacity that you've got in different businesses. So
there are many levers that you can pull depending upon your view of the economy and the degree to which you think
that the economy will differ from what you've got baked into your base plan.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Thanks. And then separately, around the operational risk factor going out for you and
others this last quarter in the capital calculation, I hear you on legal factors for all. Is it also related potentially to
counterparty credit risk that was a new factor thrown in for the CCAR this upcoming process in terms of top 20, top 50
in terms of monitoring that on a pretty regular basis? And how do you think that that may or may not impact the CCAR
process generally? And maybe for you maybe, just as a reminder that it seems like you'd probably be in a better
position, especially now that you have the government out of your house on the FDIC TruPS as well for the first time?
Thanks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Just to start with one of the questions that you posed, the new requirement that got baked
into this year's CCAR, that didn't contribute anything towards our reassessment of our operational risk-weighted assets.
That didn't play a role in that at all. That was really just taking a look at the legal and regulatory environment that we
currently see.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: As far as how that particular requirement, that particular added requirement impacted the
CCAR test, we factored it in and we didn't see that it posed any significant constraint on us. But it was just another one
of these interesting twists that we're going to have to deal with I think in each CCAR. I think it's good on the part of the
Fed that they're constantly changing things up and making you think about new, different risks. And so I'd actually
think that putting in new requirements like that benefits the industry.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: All right, thanks. And then just lastly on S&B, you mentioned how the environment you
did in the fourth quarter and maybe third quarter as well last year. Maybe I missed it. Have you commented in terms of
has that turned early this year so far? And how does that – does maybe specifically the FICC business get impacted
from QE tapering near term, long term? Is it net positive, net negative? How should we think about it?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's a little difficult to judge a quarter or a year based upon the first ten or so trading days.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Yes.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: But I don't want to go too far out there. But I would say certainly the first ten days of
January look a lot better than what we saw in December and November, so I'll go that far.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: And QE tapering, does that have an impact in a meaningful way one or the other or higher
loan rates?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The difficult – again, rates shot up for a while. Just when everybody got comfortable with
say the ten-year being something at around 3% or higher, you had the jobs report come in last Friday. And suddenly the
ten-year rate drops down to something with a 2.8% handle. So I think that we'd all would like to see a rate view that
settles out. And it's better when everyone has a view towards rates gradually increasing or gradually decreasing,
whichever you can deal with. The problem is we're still dancing around things, and so there's a little bit more volatility

Your next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Great, thanks. I just had a follow-up on some of the DTA comments. I guess one broad
one is the DTA was down $2.4 billion, as you suggested. It's still above year-end 2011 levels. And I was wondering if
we could see an acceleration of the utilization next year. And in line with that, one of the things Mike had said was that
you did make progress against the foreign tax credit portion of the DTA that does start to run out meaningfully in 2017
– or excuse me, 2016 and 2017. And I was wondering if you could give us some numbers behind that, how much of
that was foreign tax credit utilization.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, sure, Fred. Let's start with the last one. As far as the foreign tax credit utilization, as
Mike and I said, we utilized about, during the year, $2 billion of the FTC carry-forward. And all you have to do is just
open up last year's 10-K, and it's $2 billion off of the schedule based upon when they run out. So I think there was $400
million or so that was due to expire in 2015. That would now go away.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And then there was $6.6 billion I believe that was due to expire in 2016. So then that now
would be reduced by $1.6 billion, so we'd be down to $5 billion there, so it pretty much just follows the schedule.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Okay, great. That's helpful.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All right? And then as far as what can we do next year on DTA and some of your other
comments, again, I'd point you to some of the comments I made earlier. When you take a look at the $2.4 billion that
we utilized this year, $3.3 billion of that came from Citicorp earnings and then we had the Citi Holdings losses actually
work against us to the tune of about $900 million. So what we can certainly do to continue to increase the utilization of
DTA is really get those Holdings losses closer to breakeven, and that would allow more of that $3.3 billion of Citicorp
utilization then to drop through to the bottom line.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: And I think just as a follow-up, you have talked in the past about needing North
American earnings to utilize the DTA. Is that more related to getting Citi Holdings down, or is it other activity in North
America?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's also growing North America earnings. So certainly as we begin to see our Branded
Cards business revitalize, as we hopefully get some earnings out of the Best Buy acquisition, all of those things should
be positive towards our North America earnings as well.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: All right, thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Thanks, it's Derek here, a couple questions. Just coming back to Securities & Banking and
the glide path to your 2015 targets, you're at 75 basis points ROA in the division for the full year, and I'm just
wondering. Where does that number have to be to get you with the business mix and everything to your 90 to 110 basis

points? Does it have to be at 90 basis points or is it 75 basis points or 100 basis points? Where does that have to be?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Derek, we didn't give specific targets business by business because again, we wanted to
make sure that people understood that what we were focused on was improving the ROA for Citigroup as a whole. But
you're quite right. We would need to do some incremental ROA improvement out of Securities & Banking, but quite
frankly it isn't significant. Don't forget, our target overall for the firm is 90 to 110 basis points by 2015. You've got
Securities & Banking at 75 basis points. It quite frankly doesn't take – you don't need to get Securities & Banking up
into that 90 to 110 basis point range in order for the full firm to produce the 90 basis points.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Yes, and that was my question there. And just to follow on that, I guess the 75 basis points
is being impacted by some litigation expense and some things that probably fall out at some point, maybe not 2015. But
can you just give a broad sense as to how much falls out of that 2013 number, if you will? What's the non-core
operating expenses that's in there for this year?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't want to tell you that legal and related expenses are non-core.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: I know what you mean.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: You're always going to have some level. And we really haven't specified business by
business what we would consider to be normal legal and related expenses, so I'd just prefer not to go into that. There
are some repositioning expenses that we've taken in that business that are probably higher this year. But I think you're
talking about $50 million-plus in 2013 expenses that you might look at and say that gee, they're related to repositioning
and they could go away. But we still think that there are ways of improving the overall efficiency of Securities &
Banking, of ICG, and we still intend to hit those targets in 2015.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay, and then just the last question on this area. The assets, the average assets in the
business were at $917 million in Q4 of last year and ended the year at $883 million. And is that just a reflection of
when and where you see opportunities, your thinking we'll be somewhere around the $900 million level, or is that a
thought process on evolution of business mix?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: I think it's probably a combination of a couple things. One, as I've said, I think that again our
desks decided in parts of the latter year to derisk the positions. And again, they're free to put those back on as they see
fit, obviously, within our risk parameters. But I also think that one of the things we've tried, and I think the ROA
mentality or the ROA target has helped, is we want to become more efficient in the usage of our balance sheet. So I
think we certainly had, at least in my opinion, some lazy assets that were on the balance sheet that just don't make sense
there. And I'd like to in essence reuse that capacity for better earning usage of the balance sheet around client flows,
and I think we're probably going through a bit of that recycling now.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay, that's fine. And then just totally changing gears on you, but the delinquencies in the
North American Consumer business ticked up in Q4, which I guess surprised me a little bit. How should we think about
that going forward? Is the message look, it got as good as it gets and we probably just tick very slowly up from here, or
is it like you're one quarter, don't read too much into it, we could tick back down again next quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I would say it's somewhere around that – look, it's one quarter, don't read too much into it.
But obviously, we've had a real good performance when it comes to delinquencies and credit in North America. At
some point in time, you're going to get some increase in delinquencies in that book. We don't think that that lends itself
to dramatic increases in NCL rates. We gave you some guidance as far as where we see the NCL rate somewhat
stabilizing for North America. And so I wouldn't read too much into it, but you're going to get some natural creep. The
important thing is that the overall dynamics of the business, we're still focused on maintaining credit discipline there.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay, that's helpful. Appreciate it.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thanks, good morning. John, just following on the credit side, obviously there have been
continued really strong results that have led you to release reserves a little bit above and beyond just four charge-offs.
Can you talk about how we can think about the direction of reserve release, and do you think it's possible that the
overall Citigroup provision could be still down next year over this year?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Let me separate that into two different answers, actually three. When you look at the
provision, I think we've already seen in our international Consumer business that we're not releasing reserves anymore.
As a matter of fact, as our portfolios build because we've got the loan growth, the 8% growth in revenues in Latin
America, continued growth elsewhere in Asia besides Korea, you're going to see loan loss reserve builds, and we
actually had a build of something like $75 million I think in the fourth quarter. So the international Consumer has
already made that turn.
When you look at the U.S. Consumer, there's probably still some level of reserve release to go through in some of our
Cards business, but that is drawing to a close. And we'll probably see the end of that sometime in 2014.
And then the third piece would be in Holdings. What I would say in Holdings is we anticipate being able to offset the
U.S. mortgage NCL, substantially offset the U.S. mortgage NCLs with continued reserve releases. But I don't see
reserve releases over and above the NCLs that we have in the business. As a matter of fact, our reserve releases will
probably on an ongoing basis be just slightly less than the NCLs that we're seeing in that U.S. mortgage business and
Holdings.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And the second question just relates to the top line. If we're in a low single-digit revenue
growth environment, it does seem like there's a better trajectory to be able to grow NII on a year-over-year basis. So I
just wanted to ask you if you can help us separate – can you get growth in both NII and on the fee side, or what do you
think will contribute a greater amount to the overall top line performance?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I do think that you can – especially if the economy continues to improve and it doesn't have
another one of these growth and back off and then growth and then back off and everybody gets concerned again, even
if we can just get the economy moving in a steady direction, I do think that you can get growth in both NII as well as
fee. I don't think – I'm trying in my mind to figure out whether or not you can actually do a percentage where you get
50% of your growth here and 50% there, but I'll just leave it with the fact that you can grow both.
When it looks something like our Transaction Services fees business and our cash business in Transaction Services,
we're actually focused on moving more of that business away from an NII business and onto a fee-based business. And
that's going be important for us because, again, we're continuing to capture market share in our cash management
business. And there's just a limit to how much more deposits that we can attract while still trying to keep our overall
balance sheet somewhat flat at that $1.9 trillion range or thereabouts. And so it's important then as we attract new
clients and we grow the volumes with existing clients, that we move some of that business into fee-based business as
opposed to just being paid for it with increasing levels of deposits.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: And the last thing then for 2014 though, you think that even with the year-over-year tough comp
in Mortgage Banking and whatever we'll end up getting out of trading that that's a reasonable expectation, that there's
still a good chance that we could see some fee growth?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. Again, I'm thinking about fee growth in Transaction Services and fee growth in things
other than mortgage. Obviously, the mortgage comp in the first half of the year will be a challenge because, as I said,
the mortgage revenues certainly have stabilized. So if you think in terms from a sequential basis, on a sequential basis I
do believe that you can see growth in both NII and fees. You're going to be challenged year on year with that
comparison, certainly in the first half of the year.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay, got it. Thanks very much, John.

Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: I've really only got two things, given that I think we're in our second movie, forget second
box of popcorn at this point. You talked a lot about the legal costs. Given that you've settled some things that a number
of your peers haven't yet, could you talk where these costs are arising from?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Certainly when you take a look at Holdings, and we've talked about this, still the single
largest piece there would be legacy issues related to private label securitizations and mortgages. And that seems to still
– that certainly is an area that is still out there and there are a lot of issues surrounding that.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Okay. Just last thing is that you've talked a lot about trying to get Holdings down to
breakeven. What about – if you could structure a transaction with one name that would separate earnings out but would
actually create book value, would that be of interest, or is that not of interest to Citigroup?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: I think, Moshe, we look at it in a few ways. One is what's the value, the residual value, or the
present value of the earnings of that business and can we get paid for that. Second thing is that if somebody's not
willing to pay for that, we've obviously got a good use of that around DTA utilization, and again in that path of getting
in essence that one-for-one benefit of Holdings from doing that. We've looked at a number of different structures that
could be accomplished there. I think we're open to those. But what we don't want to find ourselves in a position is
where we're in essence giving away earnings, being forced to finance it for a period of time, and giving away the upside
and the oversight of the business. So if we could accomplish the things we want to accomplish, we'd be open to it but
we haven't seen that structure yet.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got it. Just as a comment, not a question, I would just say that selling at a discount to
tangible book reflects some concern about the book value of that, and there's an asset that's clearly undervalued. So
thanks very much.

business that we had. And as you've seen in various press stories, we're in the process of winding down our Citi Capital
Advisors business, which is where we would have most of our private equity funds, so we've got both those actions
well in hand.
As far as your comment as far as are some of those costs related to Volcker, yes, there are some. Volcker, there's a data
requirement, a metrics requirement that one would look at and say it's – I've heard some people describe it as
burdensome. I would never use a word like that. But there certainly is a data requirement that we're going to have to
gear up for and that we are in the process of gearing up for.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Okay, thank you. And any sense of timing on when you might achieve break even for Citi
Holdings?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: I think that a lot of that – again, we've talked about Citi Holdings. The big drag there is around
legal. And as we've said, unfortunately, we can't control our timing in that. We'd love to continue to get these legacy
legal issues behind us as quickly and as practically and as reasonably as possible.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Thanks for taking my question. I've got a few other follow-ups that I'll work on offline. But
the bigger picture question I want to ask is in terms of the emerging markets trends. It sounds from your
characterization, John, that you're a bit more positive about the future trends of economic growth across your emerging
markets countries. That's in line with GDP expectations that are more positive for 2014 and 2015 than they were for the
past couple of years. And yet investors continue to be concerned about the growth trajectory in the emerging markets. I
guess I'm just trying to get a sense as to am I hearing you correctly about Citigroup being more optimistic about the
growth trends within the emerging markets and what benefit that might have for potential revenue opportunities within
Transaction Services outside of just short rates going up?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Matt, it's Mike. I think you've described our economic outlook correctly that I think we see a
better world in terms of 2014 than 2013. I think the overhang or the challenge to that is when you go back and you
look, so we're in a tapering phase and ultimately we'll be in a policy transition phase around interest rates. Those
transitions, at least in my history, have never happened smoothly.
I think the world is in a better place today in terms of the probability of that happening at least smoother around
floating rate exchange regimes, around bigger foreign currency reserves, around better markets, around better external
access that these countries have. And so I think as we look at that, I think we probably think from a historic basis, this
transition is probably smoother, growth looks better, the economies continue to heal, a number of countries from the
ways I've just described things. In fact, you saw this summer really five singled out in terms of concern. And again, the
big concern or the theme around those five was current account deficit. And further away from that, I think people felt
the transition of the rest of the economies was probably going to be pretty reasonable. So again, I think we're cautiously
optimistic on it and, again, think that our businesses are well positioned in that transition to take advantage of that
growth, both from a fundamental basis as well as hopefully from an interest rate basis as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi, how are you? I'll try to keep it tight. At this point, you're somewhat ahead of the curve
with respect to your peer group in terms of Basel III compliance and SLR compliance on both a holding company and
bank level. So I'm wondering at this point. As you look across the international capital liquidity regimes, where are
your biggest concerns at this stage? And what would you consider to be the binding operational constraint for you?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: I think that, Eric, as we look, some things, and you can imagine with our business model, some
things that we're focused on is around the concept of a level playing field, around harmonization. And what makes it
difficult for us is when you operate in multiple jurisdictions, geographies, countries where you've just got an almost
unlimited number of things you're trying to solve for. And so again, I think that as we look at our metrics, we think not
just in the U.S. but globally, we're at standards that serve us well. But again, it's around trying to get some of these
things lined up so that there's a level playing field around the world and that there's actually a level playing field within
those jurisdictions and countries between domestic and international institutions.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And is there any particular piece of proposed regulation or legislation that is concerning to
you with respect to your current capital liquidity position?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think the – and we've commented on this in the past. It really is – it's not any individual
piece. It's how all the individual pieces actually fit together. And again, to Mike's comments that he made earlier as far
as harmonization, you can take a look at harmonization in one case and say you'd like all the different regulatory bodies
around the world to view things the same way. But in the same fashion, amongst all the different rules, you'd like to see
harmonization as well. You'd like to see a little bit perhaps a better interaction between the SLR ratio with the
standardized approach, with advanced approach, with OLA requirements. There's just a bunch of these things out there.
And I think they do get harmonized over time. But until that happens, it makes things a bit challenging.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And so then operationally, is CCAR your binding constraint, or is it something else?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: CCAR is certainly a consideration. CCAR becomes a piece of it. But still you run your
business based upon risk returns and your ability to monitor risk through some of the other things that I talked about. I
wouldn't say that CCAR is the ultimate, but it becomes the year-end pass/fail test on a few things.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And just one quick cleanup question. Citi Holdings is 6% of GAAP assets. But at what
percent of risk-weighted assets does it represent at this stage?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's about 19% of our risk-weighted assets.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: 19%, great. Thanks very much.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem.
