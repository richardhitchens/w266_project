MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the 4Q 2013 and FY 2013 General Dynamics Earnings Conference
Call. My name is Whitley, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.
Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded
for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Erin Linnihan. Please proceed ma'am.
Erin Linnihan
Thank you, Whitley, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter Conference Call.
As always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These
estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the
company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic
Thank you, Erin. Earlier today we reported fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations of $1.76 per fully
diluted share on a revenue of $8.1 billion, and earnings of $624 million. It was a good quarter consistent with our
previous guidance and analysts' expectations. For the year, we had fully diluted earnings per share of $7.03 on revenue

of $31.2 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.5 billion, a return on sales of 8%. It was a very solid
year from an operating perspective. EPS after a charge in discontinued operations related exclusively to the settlement
of the A-12 litigation is $1.40 for the quarter and $6.67 for the year. This settlement represents significant risk
mitigation for the company and ends more than two decades of litigation with the government on favorable terms.
We had a tremendous quarter from a cash generation perspective. Free cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion or
222% of earnings from continuing operations. For the year, we had free cash flow from operations of $2.7 billion or
107% of earnings from continuing operations. This outpaced 2012 by $429 million and demonstrated our commitment
to the efficient conversion of earnings into cash.
Let me give you some details on the quarter and the year in each of the business groups. First Aerospace; sales are up
over Q4 2012 by $274 million, 14.7% and essentially flat sequentially. Earnings significantly outpaced the year ago
quarter due to the write-off at Jet Aviation in that quarter. Without regard to the write-off on a non-GAAP basis,
earnings still outpaced a year ago by $88 million or 34%. By the way, the basis for all non-GAAP comparisons can be
found on exhibits K, L and M in the press release.
Compared to Q3, operating earnings are down as anticipated by $21 million, principally due to mixed shift. For
example, lower margin, mid-size green aircraft revenue, essentially doubled in the quarter, while G550 and G450 green
revenue declined. As a result, margins decreased by about 80 basis points as we had predicted on last quarter's call.
G&A expenses are also somewhat higher at Gulfstream as a result of commissions on strong sales activity. Net R&D
was similar to the prior quarter. There was also a modest loss on pre-owned sales as well in the quarter. Jet remained
nicely profitable in the quarter but the contribution was not as good as it was in Q3. Never the less, margins at 16.3%
were slightly ahead of our guidance and analyst expectations. I was particularly pleased with the order book in the
quarter. Orders at a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 or greater as occurred here, not only increased backlog but add backlog where
it is needed in the G550 and G450 programs.
To help you understand this, let me say that while we continue to sign up G650 buyers, it is nowhere near the rate of
deliveries given the duration of this backlog. For the last year, book-to-bill on this product has averaged 0.4 to 1. Given
this fact, an aggregate book-to-bill of 0.7 or 0.8 to 1 in a quarter is very strong for us. This will, of course, change as the
weight between order and entry into service for the G650 moves closer to 24 months when the standard should once
again return to 1 to 1.
On occasion, it is useful to reflect on the guidance given last year at this time and compare it with the actual outcome.
In the Aerospace group, we guided to revenue growth of 16% and operating margins in the mid 15% range. Our actual
performance reflects a revenue increase of 17.4%, and operating margins of 17.4%, almost 200 basis points better than
guidance. This very good result was attributable to a better than expected recovery at Jet Aviation, a very successful
execution of G650 deliveries, and better than expected performance in Gulfstream's large service business. All in all, a
very good year at Aerospace.
At Combat Systems it is a story of disappointing revenue and outstanding cost and margin performance. In the quarter,
sales were down $325 million or 16.4%. But earnings were materially better because of the large write-off at ELS in
Q4 of last year. Even if we disregard those write-offs, earnings are only down 8.2% on the strength of improved
margins across the board. The story is much the same for the full year. Sales are down $1.9 billion or 23.4% but
earnings are up $241 million or 36.3%. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings are down $164 million or 15.4% once again
demonstrating positive operating leverage with improved margins year-over-year in each business.
As you all know, we had extreme difficulty predicting revenue in this group throughout the year. Our initial guidance
was to expect revenue to be down 6% for the year. We retreated from that initial forecast quarter-over-quarter but never
did catch up with reality, which was a revenue of decline of 23.4%. What made us so long? The difference between the
initial guidance and the final revenue result is $1.4 billion. Of that, about $500 million is attributable to the impact of
sequestration and the shutdown.
This was the only group to be affected materially. In no small measure because of the Army's response to both the
shutdown and sequestration. Army spending slowed during the year, which hit us hard in the fourth quarter as they

worried about the potential shortage of funds and its impact on their ability to take care of the war effort. A service set
war will react very cautiously to disruptions in their funding stream.
Another roughly $500 million was attributed to a large international order expected early in the year that kept slipping
to the right in very protracted negotiations. The balance was from various programs where funds were appropriated but
not obligated by the customer or obligated in smaller amounts as well as several additional international orders.
Fortunately this revenue shortfall was offset in part by dramatically improved operating performance resulting in higher
than anticipated margin rates.
Marine Systems revenue was off 2%, $34 million compared to the year-ago quarter and down $67 million to 3.9%
sequentially. However, revenue was up almost 2% for the year, about $120 million. Operating earnings were down $37
million, 18.9% against the year-ago quarter and down $11 million, 6.5% sequentially. For the full year, earnings were
down $84 million or 11.2%.
The earnings decline against last year and last year's fourth quarter is due entirely to the end of the profitable T-AKE
Program. This group was highly consistent in both revenue and earnings throughout the year with a 9.9% margin rate
for the year. All of the shipyards performed well in the quarter and for the year. In the Marine group we guided you to a
revenue increase of 2%. We were very close with an actual increase of 1.8%. We forecasted margins in the low to mid
9% range and wound up at 9.9% on the strength of very good operating performance in each of our shipyards. All in
all, a very good year for the Marine group.
IS&T is a business group that held up well in a difficult environment. Revenue in the quarter was up $114 million or
4.4% against the year-ago quarter. It was up a similar amount, 4.3% sequentially and up $251 million or 2.5% for the
year. Really quite good for a short cycle business in last year's turbulence. Operating earnings of $196 million in the
quarter were materially better than the fourth quarter a year ago because as you will recall significant charges were
incurred in that quarter. However, even on a non-GAAP basis, in other words without regard to the write-offs,
operating earnings improved quarter-over-quarter by $68 million or 53.1%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings
were off by $20 million. For the year on a non-GAAP basis, earnings were within $3 million, so essentially flat.
On this call a year ago I gave you guidance for this group that forecasted the decline in revenue of 5% and operating
margins in the low 8% range. It turned out that revenue was up 2.5% and margins were 7.7%. Margins were pressured
in two of the business units by severance and other restructuring costs as well as the failure of the business in the U.K.
to meet its plan. All in all, the end result was consistent with guidance but achieved in a different way. On a company
wide basis, we provided EPS guidance of $6.60 to $6.70. We wound up at $7.03. About $0.09 of that improvement
came from share repurchase, another $0.09 from a slightly lower than planned tax rate and the balance from operating
performance.
So let me give you a few thoughts about 2014 initially by business group. In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be about
$9 billion, up around 11%. Margin rates should be around 17%, somewhat down from 2013 on continuing mix shift.
However, operating earnings will be up 7.3% to 7.5%. I should add that margin rates will be lower in the first three
quarters with a dramatic increase in the fourth.
In Combat Systems, we expect a more modest revenue decline of about 4% to 4.5%. Embedded in this plan is about
$1.2 billion of revenue for the same international program that slipped to the right last year. We anticipate a first
quarter order. If not received on that schedule, we will have further erosion of revenue from this guidance and we will
address its impact directly with you in the second quarter. The majority of next year's domestic revenue is in our
backlog and has been de-rated. So absent more delays on the international front, we should be pretty close to our
estimate of revenue. Margins are expected to be around 14%, still very respectable.
The Marine group is expected to have revenue growth of 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range, resulting in a very
modest slip in operating earnings entirely the result of mix shift. Finally, in IS&T, we expect a revenue decline of
almost 20%. But an improved margin rate of 8.2%, 50 basis points better than last year. Almost all of the anticipated
revenue is in backlog. And our plan shows this year is the low water mark for revenue.

All of this rolls up to an operating plan of about $30 billion of revenue, EBIT rate around 12%, and a return on sales of
roughly 8%. This plan is purely from operations, assumes a 31% tax rate and assumes we buy enough shares to hold
the share count steady with year-end figures so as not to permit dilution from option exercises. This rolls up to an EPS
guidance of $6.80 to $6.85 per fully diluted share. This compares with last year's guidance of $6.60 to $6.70. At the
same time on the same basis. So much like last year, beating our guidance must come from outperforming the plan and
the use of capital to repurchase shares.
With respect to share repurchase, as is obvious, we did not return all of our free cash flow in 2013 to our shareholders
despite our intention to do so. This was because we were constrained by a pension funding rule that our CFO, Jason
Aiken, will explain to you shortly. It is our intention to make up for last year in the first quarter. With that in mind, we
are establishing imminently an accelerated share repurchase plan for the repurchase of 11.4 million shares, the
remainder of our current authorization. We will seek additional share authority at our February Board of Directors
meeting for a share repurchase plan throughout the year.
I would now like to turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken.
Jason W. Aiken
Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I want to review a few financial items with you before the question-and-answer
period. Starting with interest expense.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $23 million versus $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The full year's
interest expense in 2013 was $86 million which was in line with our guidance. This was down $70 million from 2012,
reflecting the impact of our $2.4 billion debt refinancing completed in December 2012 that lowered the weighted
average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 2.2%.
For 2014, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $90 million. At the end of the year our balance sheet
reflects a net cash position and by that I mean cash in excess of debt of approximately $1.4 billion, an improvement of
more than $2 billion over our net debt position last year.
Moving on to taxes. Our effective tax rate was 30.7% for the quarter and 31.1% for the full year. The fourth quarter and
full year rates were slightly lower than anticipated due to a tax benefit associated with the shutdown of a product line in
one of our IS&T businesses. That said, we expect an effective tax rate in 2014 and for the foreseeable future in the
range of 30.5% to 31%. So you can consider a rate in this range to be the new normal.
This is driven by a variety of puts and takes, but primarily by higher expected foreign earnings. In the quarter, as Phebe
noted, we recorded a charge in discontinued operations for the settlement of the long standing dispute with the U.S.
Navy regarding the termination of the A-12 program. This charge reflects our agreement with the Navy to provide a
$198 million credit towards the design and construction activities on the DDG 1000 program. We expect that this
amount will be expended through 2017 as the program progresses. This agreement puts behind us litigation that's been
outstanding for over 20 years. And recall that following the Supreme Court's ruling a few years ago, we faced the
prospect of years of more costly litigation without the possibility of any upside beyond the walk away. The charge is
shown net of the related tax benefit of $69 million for a net loss in discontinued operations of $129 million.
A quick point on pensions. During 2013 we contributed approximately $600 million in cash to our pension plans. And
for 2014, our funding expectation is about the same. Just slightly lower, with most of that funding expected to occur
during the third quarter. And finally, as Phebe alluded to, I'd like to address capital deployment in the fourth quarter. As
you'll recall our intent in 2013 was to deploy essentially all of our free cash flow in a shareholder friendly manner while
maintaining a strong balance sheet. Through the first three quarters of the year we were headed down that path. And up
to that point we had refunded 87% of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
As we entered the fourth quarter, we got tripped up by a pension funding rule that constrained our ability to deploy any
more capital through the end of the year. Under the funding rules of the Pension Protection Act, the substantial charges
we took in the fourth quarter of 2012 placed limits on the amount of capital that we could deploy to shareholders. Once

we hit the cap, any additional share repurchases or dividend payments would have to have been matched dollar for
dollar with over and above contributions to our pension plans. This would have made any additional share repurchases
highly inefficient given our planned pension funding profile and the timing of our recovery of pension contributions
under our contracts.
As a result, we refrained from executing any additional share repurchases in the fourth quarter after we hit the cap. At
the end of the year, we sit with $5.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, and anticipate another year of strong cash
generation in 2014. That leaves us well positioned to embark on the capital deployment strategy for 2014 that Phebe
outlined for you just a few minutes ago.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning. Hi. Phebe, I had a question about the capital deployment that you just
outlined, and I know it's a little bit more than one question because it's a little bit multi-part. But if you're going to have
an accelerated share repurchase program of 11.4 million shares in the first quarter, won't that reduce the number of
shares for the full year right away? And so, why would you guide to a flat with the fourth quarter number? And then
just in general, can you talk about your thoughts about $5 billion on the balance sheet and what the right number for
you to carry in terms of cash is?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we have built our plan like we did initially last year, and that is assuming we cover
dilution. We don't know the full effect of the costs or the timing of that once we put in place the accelerated share
repurchase. So as we go forward, we will clearly adjust the guidance to reflect the impact of that plus additional share
repurchases. So with respect to the balance sheet, we have accumulated a fair amount of cash, a lot of cash on that
balance sheet, and we're very comfortable with seeking additional authority from our board, both with respect to
dividends and share repurchases. So we are mindful of that cash on the balance sheet. We fully recognize that that is
not the best use of cash. And you'll see us very actively this year returning a lot of that cash to our shareholders,
keeping in mind that we covet and protect our debt rating. So I hope that gives you some color.

<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Hi, Phebe. Could you give a little more color on demand at Gulfstream? Sounds like you were
pleased with the order intake in the G450 and G550 in the quarter. But maybe just give us a sense as to how far your
backlog extends, and how many deliveries you're planning on this year?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Okay. We're expecting 118 large cabin deliveries and 40 mid-cabin; that's up from for
next year. Our fourth quarter, which you know at Gulfstream was our strongest quarter in the past two years across all
of our product lines and was particularly strong on the G450, G550 and G280. Going forward, our pipeline is robust,
which augers well, I think, for our performance going forward. I think you can also – to think a little bit about where
we are in our backlog. I think it helps to understand that the next available slot for the G280 is in the 9 month to 12
month range for the G450 and G550 in the 12 month to 15 month range and G650 in the 45 month range. So, I think
that gives you a little additional calibration and you may have also noticed that we had a significant number of options
in the quarter across all of our portfolio products. Consistent with our past accounting treatment, we do not treat those
as orders and let me tell you how it works. When you exercise the option, then you get a slot and then we book the
order with sufficient down payments, but we are confident in the reliability of these options but we're booking them
according to our previous practices.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning, Phebe and Jason.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: With the latest budget deal, Phebe, I think we have a little better visibility at least into the
total DoD authority on the topline which seems to be flattish I guess through fiscal 2015. So based on your comments
or in concert with your comments on Combat and on IS&T, should we look at calendar 2014 as the bottom for those
businesses? And if you don't get the international order, then how do we look at Combat?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, okay. Let me take that into two parts. The – it's really quite a blessing and a definite
upside both for our customer and for us to have some stability in program funding. Reducing the uncertainty which is
very, very difficult to manage to. So that is the Congress are very grateful for their attempt to get back to regular order.
Our program on the Marine group were fully funded in anticipation of what we anticipated. Combat Systems, we
received funding again in line with our expectations. And the same is true in IS&T. So all in all I think we've got a
pretty solid funding base.
Now let's talk a little bit about the bottom. Okay? That's kind of where you're – and I'll take that also in two parts. Let's
talk about Combat. We believe we're almost there and that the major slide is behind us. But let me give you a sense of
the internal dynamics of that group. Two of our three businesses have Army exposure, OTS and Land Systems. OTS
has maintained very stable and consistent revenues. Land Systems, with its exposure to Army demand and combat
vehicles have seen their revenue decline substantially. On the other hand, we see increasing orders in Canada and the
U.K. on the SV program. So the Army is becoming a smaller source of revenue for us. And as I noted we have
significantly de-risked our Army's revenue for this year based on the experience we had with the Army last year and
how they responded to the needs of the war and the available funding.
So one of the things I think that's important to understand is these businesses are earnings and cash powerhouses. So
that gives me a lot of confidence that we'll continue to manage through whatever changes we have in revenue. But I
think we're getting close to the bottom. Now, let me give you a little bit of context. I gave you the estimate for our
international order of about $1.2 billion. And I'll address that with you if that doesn't come in, in the fourth or in the
second quarter. But let me tell you, I wouldn't have – based on last years' experience, I wouldn't have put it in this year

if I weren't very confident that that is imminent on the horizon.
And I think finally, just to add a little bit of textual context for you, if you think about GD writ large, our Army
exposure declined significantly during the course of 2013 which shouldn't surprise you given what happened on the
Combat Systems side in revenue. From about 16% and going forward for this year, across all of GD, the Army is now
down to 10% which I see is another risk mitigation factor in thinking through our revenue. So IS&T, C4 is the primary
business in IS&T that is affected by the exposure to the Army and we have again de-risked that plan and that's in part
what's driving some of the revenue decline. So I think I've given you sort of a multifaceted answer.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Oh so, it sounds like it's this year; the timing could vary between the segments but...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: That's my view. And look, we learned – and this is new territory for both our customer
and us in understanding how they were going react to their funding pressure. So we've taken that learning and
incorporated it into our thinking about sales going forward. And that's why we have de-risked those plans.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: And you feel pretty good about tactical coms and the IT services area as compared to the
ISR.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so let me give you a little bit of color. Because implied in your question drives us to
a related issue of the decline in revenue at IS&T.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Right.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So first let me say that last year was better than expected revenue year, right? We had
predicted we'd be down about 5%, instead, we're up 2.5%. So some of the decline we anticipated last year is showing
up this year. Second, as I noted we built an IS&T plan in which the majority of our revenues in the backlog and have
been de-risked. So there's very little additional risk on the downside.
Let me give you to your question a little bit of color by business unit. So you can understand some of the changes.
GDIT last year had a particularly great year in revenue as a result of their increases in the commercial wireless demand
business and their call center operations in healthcare. So in 2014, we're seeing their revenue decline about 10%, some
from the slowing in the call center revenue but a considerable slowing in commercial wireless. And I would remind you
that our wireless business tends to be pretty lumpy.
On Intel, for our Intel business, they're looking about a 10% revenue decline. Which is largely driven by mix across
their lines of business that have more to do with the anticipated start times of new contracts. So where does that leave
us? The real story here is in C4 where revenues are declining by about a third. So, let me help you think about this
business to put this in some context. Think about it in four buckets. U.S. Army, Canada, U.K., and U.K. based
international. We held up pretty well in 2013 in C4 Systems because the majority of our sales were in our backlog. But
the challenges that the U.S. Army faced last year showed up in considerably lower volume in 2014 across our product
lines networking, communication and encryption. And it is in those lines of business that we have significantly
de-risked our plan going forward. Hence, part of the drive of the primary determinant of the 33% reduction in sales. So
all right, that's that one bucket.
As for Canada, our business is strong and I'm very optimistic about the future of the MHP program. We're very pleased
the Crown has agreed to go forward with that program and we have a very strong and cooperative working relationship
with our customer, Sikorsky. I also like how our Canadian commercial business looks.
Finally, U.K. and international. You'll recall last year that we were pretty disappointed with the poor performance of
GD U.K. And as a result, we moved all the non-vehicle business under C4. Remember that Combat Systems, Land
Systems, in particular, picked up the SV program which is where it belongs. And C4 has done a great job with taking
costs out and stabilizing that business. So I think, to be just real clear here, there is considerably more upside here than
downside on revenues. But I would ask you not to get too far ahead of me.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Right. Well, that was tremendous color. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Phebe, I wanted to go back to capital deployment for just a second.
In particular, the 2014 cash flow that you'll generate, if you can give us some color on net income to free cash flow
conversion? I know you tempered that expectation a bit for 2013. You over achieved it to the full 100% plus. Just
curious your outlook for 2014? And then to 2013 you'd committed to returning it to shareholders the vast majority and
you're fulfilling that here in the first quarter. Is it the same commitment for the cash generated in 2014?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes. So look, I don't want to give you an exact cash number but I can tell you this, we
anticipate cash for 2014 in line with our previous history. We may see some puts and takes on timing with respect to
payments but we are – you'll see our consistent – you'll see cash conversion that's very similar to our prior experience
and it is our full intention to deploy almost all of that, if not all of that free cash flow to our shareholders. Okay?
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: That's perfect. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning. Welcome, Jason.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: Thank you. Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Following up on Myles' question, Phebe, could you maybe just address working capital and
how you view that? I mean over the past couple years, inventory's been a significant drag. I think receivables have been
a drag as well. Just how you see the opportunity there to generate some cash out of working capital? And then on M&A
I know you took a break here in 2013 on the M&A side. But just how you're thinking about that relative to what you're
committing to in terms of cash return to shareholders. Thanks.?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure. So you may recall at the beginning of last year I told you we were returning back to
basics, focusing on operations. A key part of that focus on operations is a wholesome cash generation capability. And I
think we've demonstrated that. And you do that by working our working capital hard. And we've done that. We also
had a great collection year. So you'll continue to see us work our working capital. Each one of our business units is
focused on that like a laser. So I'm confident that we'll do well on that regard. So M&A look I'm going tell you exactly
what I told you last year. I don't have anything on my horizon at present. And so I don't anticipate our behavior with
respect to M&A to be any different this year than it was last. Okay?

Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning or I guess, I should say good afternoon at this point. Phebe, I wondered
if you might address just sort of the general commentary. I mean a year ago at this time you said you were very
internally focused on the business. You did a good bit of restructuring, you moved some talent around, you made some
organizational changes. I guess from a high level, how did things play out in 2013 relative to your plan? And how are
you thinking about 2014 and how might that be different? I mean I can appreciate you're never really finished driving
improvements in the business but what sort of opportunities do you think will be created this year from the
improvements you tried to undertake last year?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Let me take that in a couple of parts. Referring back to my answer in the last question. We
had our back to basics, which focused on margin expansion, ROIC and good cash conversion. And I think with respect
to each one of those metrics, we performed very, very well. We had 11.8% operating margins, 107% free cash flow,
return on sales of 8% and then ROIC at 16.6%. So, wholesome, directionally correct. And that doesn't happen without
the blocking and tackling on operations every single day. So the team did a fantastic job living up to their opportunities.
And we're going to do the exact same thing again this year. We've talked to the management team about the need to
continue to focus on doing well by our shareholders and creating value. So we're – I'm very comfortable that you're
going to see more of the same. To give you kind of a sense of where we are and I think embedded in your question is so
– kind of how do we see GD right?
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Yeah.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, let me give you what I think about the value proposition for us. And let me explain
it to you in this way. For me and my mind, Gulfstream is the primary growth engine for both earnings and revenue.
Marine is a steady producer of earnings and cash with growing revenue at about 5% over the next two years. So pretty
good and pretty solid. Combat is a strong operating business as is C4, but in both instances they're exposed to the U.S.
Army. The rest of IS&T remains stable. So think about this. Let me give you a little bit of granularity on this one
aspect. Only two of our 11 businesses are in a significant down cycle, Land Systems and C4 from Army exposure. So
our imperative there as well as in the rest of our business is to expand our margins. We're going to reduce our PP&E
and working capital to the minimum required to support our revenue and manage for cash. So that is – and I think when
you think about the composition of the businesses within GD, I think that gives you sort of an overview of how I'm
looking at it and how I bound the risks.
Finally, I would add that international's revenue are increasing from 25% in 2013 if you include, which I do, free FMS
to 30% in 2014. So that again is another driver of the value proposition in GD. We don't make a lot of noise about our
international sales, but we have year-over-year improved that percentage. So I think, I hope that gives you a little bit of
the color at 50,000 feet.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: No, it does. I just wondered if there was anything a sort of lesson learned as you sit down and
craft a set of plans again a year on in this year's plan and say, what do I wish I would have known or implemented last
year that I didn't?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, so I think one is obvious. We were wrong about when our fairly large international
order was going to happen. So as I said, I wouldn't be forecasting that for this year if I weren't particularly certain that it
was coming in light of the wire brushing I got in some places on this subject. But I think the most profound lesson
learned here is that we had unprecedented and unforeseen behavior by our Army customer all for good and valid
reasons. But their reaction to the changes in their funding stream were not anticipated by us. So we've got a year of
learning of that under our belts and that is why we have de-risked our U.S. domestic Army exposure in all of our
businesses that have that exposure. Does that help?
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed sir.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good afternoon.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Hi. I wanted to ask a question about the G650, because I assume you just had a great year
of margins at Gulfstream. And when you go forward here, I'm assuming you still expect the G650 to be a strong
contributor to margin improvement over time. But I'm interested in the timing when you expect that to be additive to
margins? Can that happen in 2014? And how should we think about the margin trajectory for that program?

Page 10 of 14
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, it's additive now. So in terms of clearly earnings, it's slightly dilutive to overall
margins simply because we continued down our learning curve. And you remember last year we had a fairly lumpy
learning curve on green deliveries because of the disequilibrium that I explained to you last year at this time on the
G650 retrofit. But we're through that and we're continuing to see learning improvements on G650 green and on
completions. So the margins are going to get better on G650, and I suspect throughout this year and into next. I'm not
going to give you a real good sense of what the terminal value may be of our margins on that. We don't know yet.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Yeah.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So what we've guided you to is what we see, what we anticipate, in our G650 margin
performance. And it's wholesome and it's improving as we would hope and expect.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And as you move down that learning curve, you said earlier that the first slots are
available, that 45 months from now. Presumably if you took rate up, you would move down even faster. And you'd
have more operating leverage. I mean how are you thinking about that? 45 months is a long time to not add to
production rate.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we, as you all know on us, we set our production rates at the beginning of every year
based on what we believe the supply chain can handle and what our manufacturing – the optimization of our
manufacturing efficiency. So as we have factored all of that into setting the G650 production rate, and to the extent that
we have any – if that time compresses between order and delivery, we'll notify our customers first of earlier
opportunities. But I don't anticipate any significant time compression at least in the near term.
And look, what we want to be able to do is plan our manufacturing green and deliveries that are consistent and
improvable and repeatable every single year. So we could pull through assuming the supply chain could handle it.
Make that assumption. We could pull forward additional slots in production slots. But that is not necessarily good for
the long-term. I think it gives us a pop and a pop that's not necessarily repeated in the next year.
So when you're manufacturing complex platforms with a robust and diversified supply chain, you want to be very
mindful of what your supply chain can handle without driving up their costs which then will reflect in your price. So
look, this is a – there is not a year that goes by or even on a quarterly basis that we don't look at, have we set the right
production rates? And we're very comfortable where we are now.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Is this the limiting factor here confidence in the longer term demand trajectory? Or is it
getting part of your supply chain fully up to speed? And so that you're comfortable with them being able to go to a
higher rate?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We are very confident in the long-term prospects for this product. I think it's proven itself
and we've seen increasing demand over time. Because of all the niches that that product serves. You've got to be careful
when you start up a new line. Both that you stress your – and this is a primary consideration that you stress your supply
chain. And you can't – the perturbation from a break in your supply chain is very, very difficult to recover from. So
that's why we have the thoughtful, predictable, managed production rate on the G650. But we're very confident in the
demand profile for that airplane.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Hi, yes. Good afternoon, Phebe and Jason. Phebe, I guess I just wanted to follow-up on kind
of Doug's question a little bit. First I guess maybe a clarification. I thought you mentioned that the G650 green
deliveries essentially doubled year-over-year. Was that – that was for the full year? Or for the fourth quarter?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I think what I said was that we had a mixed shift from – at least what I said in my remarks
– is a mixed shift from the mid-size deliveries. That was really one of the key factors. And then
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. And then – go ahead I'm sorry.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We had some increase in our – considerable increase in our, in our G650 green deliveries.
But it was a little slower you might recall than we'd anticipated. So next year – because of that, retrofit issue we have –
so next year going forward, we see G650 production ramping up slightly. And that hit – that's one of the reasons for the
margin performance in the fourth quarter. Is we've got a whole – we have a number of deliveries across the board,
across our portfolio in the fourth quarter really driven by, by the way, customer demands and preferences and then
additional G650 green deliveries.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. And if I could just squeeze in that related to that, was just the question that I was trying
to get out was the – it sounds like the disconnect has been eliminated essentially between green completions that you
talked about or essentially worked down quite a bit.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: And then going forward, that G650 sounds like it's back on what was its original plan, where
we saw green deliveries would be modestly increasing by I think back in 2011 it was talked about as every 10, 10 to 15
aircraft a year. Is it fair to assume that kind of we're on that, back on that pace?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We are but look we're going to set our expectations based less on the past and more of our
assessment of the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hello, there. Jason, welcome to the earnings call.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: Thanks very much.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Just one quick clarification question and then one on Combat Systems. Phebe, you
mentioned that the G450, G550 deliveries were down in the fourth quarter. Does that mean you were carrying some
inventory into the New Year that's going get worked down? So that's the clarification question.
And then I would like for you to spend if you would, just a couple of extra minutes on the outlook for Combat Systems.
First, what's changed, what gives you more comfort now on this international deal? So if you could just kind of
qualitatively speak about why we're so close now? And then maybe a little bit of commentary about the opportunities
and risks in other areas of Combat Systems that you see over the next couple of years. We've got some debate going on
about the Ground Combat Vehicle. There's chatter about the potential cancellation of a program up in Canada. Those
would be risks and I'd be curious if there are any other opportunities out there.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: All right. Let me take, try to get them in order. And if I forget one of your sub questions
you can remind me. Inventory we don't have any on the G450, G550 we don't have any buildup that we're carrying into
next year. So let me give you a little bit of color on this international order. We are essentially done with the
negotiations. And we believe that we are going to move forward pretty quickly. But I am not about to get ahead of our
customer here. But I can again reassure you that there is no way I would have put this into the plan had I not been
confident that we wouldn't be repeating last year.
So look, with respect to opportunities and risks, let's think about that. Land Systems and again this is largely we're
talking about Land Systems. Land Systems has opportunities both in Canada, across a whole variety of programs that
we were not even materially affected by Canada's – are affected at all by Canada's cancellation of that program. They

also have increased revenue opportunities and earnings opportunities on the SV program in the U.K. Both of, we're
very comfortable with our performance on that program.
GCV we've factored hardly at all into our plan. We've got Strykers factored into our plan at a de-risked basis, reflecting
how the Army executed the funding. Take for example, what we used as our predicate is the funding profile for the
third Stryker brigade. It kind of came in lumps. Little lumps. As funding became available. The Army is dedicated to
modernizing its Stryker fleet with these double-V hull that are an enormous advantage in survivability of our troops in
the event of attack. So it's a lifesaver for them literally. And they are committed to making that happen. They are just
going have to execute funds as they become available. So we have assumed going forward that we're going get lumpy
orders. I think that's appropriate.
Tanks, for our Abrams tank program, we got about $100 million in this last bill that we're going to continue to work on
U.S. and international orders. To bridge that – bridge Lima until – which is where, as you well know, we do the tank
manufacturing. Until the 2018 timeframe when the Army begins to or expects to begin their modernization efforts. And
by the way, with respect to that, I think that the loss of critical skills and the very high costs associated with the
production break at Lima are very well understood. I personally am very appreciative for the leadership and support
that we've received this last year from the Congress. So I think that we have taken a very candid, realistic look at each
one of our programs. And the ones that we think are vulnerable we have had a very, very, very small portion in our
sales estimate represent a small portion. And we have adjusted our expectations on our more mature programs in line
with our experience over how the Army is executing its funds. Okay?

Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Hi. Looks like I can get two like everyone else so I'll see what I can do.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Go, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thanks, Phebe. You have down revenues but you have up head count. How do we square
that?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so here's the thing. Our head count went up and let me parse that for you. Our head
count went up primarily because in the last few months, GDIT hired about 8,000 new employees to cover the ramp-up
of the demand in the call center in their healthcare portfolio. This was also – and by the way, those are cost plus
contracts, so people equals revenue. Right?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Yes.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So offset by that, and what that does is sort of camouflage the fact that we've had a 30%
decline in our employment at those two businesses where we are across – actually across Combat and within C4 of
their employment. So, part of it is that we've got smaller businesses but one of our businesses is adding a lot of
employees to it. Okay. Does that make sense to you?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Yeah, totally. And the other thing is, when we do – when you sort of gave us this outlook for
the world or for your business, you didn't include the benefit from either the ASR if I'm correct. And also whatever else
you might do. So how do you put sort of your EPS growth as part of the overall operating metric that you'd like either
your business units? or in fact the board sort of asks of the officers of the company?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we've
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I'm sorry. And then just balance that against ROIC both of which are very important?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so we are – we built our plan and I gave you the original initial guidance on what
our EPS is based on, what we almost always do and that is anticipate a share repurchase sufficient to cover the dilution.
We didn't anticipate or we didn't put into our EPS estimate at this juncture what the results of the share repurchase are
going to be in part, because we have to work out some of the cost structure and timing around that. So I think you can
rest assured that going forward I think probably even in second quarter we'll give you an update of what was that
looking like to us.
So with respect to ROIC as you know, we drive that. There are two components. The numerator and the denominator.
Our business units are responsible for the numerator and in no small measure, our corporate headquarters is responsible
for the denominator. So we anticipate in ROIC improvement as against our plan for the remainder of the year. But there
are an awful lot of moving parts here. I would tell you that we significantly outperformed our ROIC against our internal
targets for last year. So I anticipate that the guys will get at it working hard, bring down working capital and increase
their [ph] note pack (57:06). Okay?

Our final question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed, sir.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thanks so much. I'll try for Howard's two. Quick one on Gulfstream. You're going be up
eight large aircraft. I assume that's got to be G650s and that looks like it's at least 60% of the revenue growth. And it
has above average margins today and the margins are improving. And I assume the mid-size aircraft, the margins also
are improving. How come overall margins are down?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, largely a question of the mixed shift between the G450, G550 and new G650 and
G280 and we're making a calculation about what we see and learning and margin expansion in those two new lines.
Also offset in part by a – as we talked about before, the significant increases in G450 costs. As a result of some of our
supplier, renegotiation of supplier contracts for major parts of that airplane. So I think that Gulfstream has the
opportunity to outperform, but we're going take that one step at a time. I would also note that while Jet continues to be
profitable in 2014, the contribution is likely to be less as they ramp up on some of their new revenues that they have in
house. So all up, I think we're looking at some margin compression, but we'll work hard to outperform that.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you, and a quick one on pensions. How did you do last year in terms of investment
performance and the discount rate? Because I would assume given your heavy asset focus on equities you would have
had terrific performance. And given all of that, how come you still have to put $600 million into the plan?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Cai, let me ask Jason to address that, but we're going put about $550 million in. But,
Jason why don't you give some color on that?
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: Sure. Your presumption is correct. We did perform well in our returns last year. It was
somewhere in the ballpark, I think, of 16.9% returns. So we're very pleased with that. As you also alluded to, discount
rates did edge up. So our funding status saw some significant improvement. The amount of contributions for the
coming year are based strictly on the Pension Protection Act minimum funding requirements, and that's what we'll stick
to is funding at those minimum levels for the foreseeable future.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you.
