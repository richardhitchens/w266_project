MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the
question-and-answer portion. Today's conference is also being recorded. If you have any objections you may
disconnect. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO, of Kinder Morgan. You may begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Great. Thank you, Holly and welcome to everybody to our earnings call. As usual we'll be making statements within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I'll make some introductory
remarks then I'm going to turn it over to Steve Kean, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will talk about
operations and our project backlog. And then we'll go to Kim Dang, who will take you through the numbers. And I
want you to treat her respectively because we just named her as a member of Office of the Chairman today. So I know
you'll keep that in mind.
Let me talk about third quarter performance. There's really not a lot to report on the quarter or on our projections for the
balance of the year. Steve and Kim will take you through in more detail, except that we do now expect to exceed our
$1.72 budget target for dividends at KMI and we expect to meet our targets at KMP, KMR, and EPB.

Our natural gas pipeline, particularly the interstate portion of our group, leading the way with strong performance
throughout the year. As an indication of the increased demand for transportation on our natural gas pipelines, we now
have new signed and pending long-term contracts since December of last year, December 2013, of 6.4 Bcf a day. Now
to put that in perspective, that's about 9% of the total U.S. gas demand. And that number, that 6.4 Bcf a day number is
up from 5.3 Bcf a day at the end of the second quarter. So we continue to make real progress in attaching new
throughput agreements to our system. Steve will go into more detail on the operating performance across all of our
segments.
More significant to the future, probably, is the size of our backlog of new projects. We went from $17 billion in
backlog at the beginning of the quarter to $17.9 billion at the end of the quarter even after deducting about $1.1 billion
of projects that were completed and placed into service during the quarter and thus removed from the backlog. The
third quarter additions include some sizable projects that Steve will discuss in detail.
To me, this growth demonstrates once again the demand for midstream energy infrastructure in North America, and the
size of our backlog together with the enormous footprint of our pipeline and terminal assets is the best predictor of
future growth at KM in my judgment.
Now, let me also update you on the transaction in which KMI is proposing to buy the outstanding units and shares of
KMP, KMR, and EPB. We have now received all necessary regulatory approvals, except our registration statement has
not yet been declared effective by the SEC. We expect to announce the date of our shareholders and unitholder
meetings in the near future and we're hopeful we will be able to close by Thanksgiving. To remind you, we expect the
resulting consolidated KMI to pay a dividend of $2 in 2015, that's an increase of 16% over the $1.72 in budget target
for 2014, to increase that dividend by 10% a year through 2020 and to generate coverage in excess of $2 billion above
these increased dividend payments.
And with that I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
All right. Good afternoon. So I'm going to review the business segments, focusing on year-over-year performance, Q3
of last year to Q3 of this year for each one and the key developments in each segment.
Starting off with Gas, very good year, KMP, the earnings before DD&A is up $53 million or 9% year-over-year. And
we continue to see strong performance at TGP and EPNG as well as the assets that we picked up in the Copano
acquisition. Transport volume on the KMP assets is up 10% year-over-year. At EPB the DCF is up $23 million or 8%
year-over-year really due to the drop-downs of our interests in Gulf and Ruby that were announced in April of this
year. The Gas group added on a net basis $100 million to the project backlog. That's after putting into service about
$270 million, the biggest piece of that was the expansion of our Houston Central plant and some associated pipe
expansions around that asset for about $250 million. We had a net add at TGP of about $175 million, about the same
number at the midstream assets and those were really both associated with LNG markets as well as Mexico. So a net
add of $100 million to the backlog in the Gas Group.
We continue to see strong demand for natural gas infrastructure as Rich mentioned. We're seeing it in the shales, LNG
exports in Mexico. Our assets are well positioned for all of that as evidenced by the 6.4 Bcf a day of sign-up that we've
had. So the trends that we've been talking about for a long time are now turning themselves into firm transport,
long-term firm transport commitments. And that's just mostly the supply side and some LNG in Mexico exports. That's
before we've really seen the demand side of this picture with power conversion in the U.S. and industrial and petchem
on U.S. Gulf Coast.
And to illustrate that point, if you look at our backlog you don't see anything in there for those developments yet to
come just yet, but we can see them over the horizon. If you break our backlog out in the Gas Group, call it
producer-push projects, are about $800 million out of the shales; what I'll call first-party LNG, which is really the Elba
Island and related transportation expansions, about $1.6 billion; what I'll call second-party LNG, which is where we're

investing in infrastructure to serve other people's LNG facilities, is another $750 million; Mexico is over $900 million;
and processing and gathering, primarily in the Eagle Ford, is about $300 million. So that's about 4.4% or so of the total
backlog and you can see we've still got more to come with these other developments. Still haven't seen the full effect of
power and industrial petchem on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And I think we'll also see some additional LNG, and all of those
things are things that we are well positioned for.
You would also think with all of this demand-side growth and what's happening on the supply side that we're going to
see an enhanced value on our storage assets, as well, and that is, I think, also still to come. And also a reminder, the
backlog that we have in the Gas group does not yet include Northeast Direct or Gulf LNG projects which we continue
to actively work. So, again, more to come on our well positioned gas network.
Turning to CO2, earnings before DD&A is up $14 million or 4% year-over-year. On the volume side, SACROC is up
12%, a huge performer. NGLs are also up 7% year-over-year. Yates is down a little bit, 3.4%. Katz volumes are up
27.3%. And Goldsmith is basically flat. Overall, volumes on a net basis are up 9% year-over-year, and really great
performance at SACROC with nearly every program that we've put in place there for 2014 exceeding our expectations.
The disappointment from a production standpoint is Goldsmith, which is essentially flat year-over-year. I would
characterize this, the issues here, as being less about geology than they are about operations. The oil is there. It's now in
the wellbore. But we've had outages at the wells and outages associated with our pumps there. These are similar but not
identical problems that we've solved in other places, including SACROC, so we've got a full-court press to turn things
around here.
The other even bigger disappointment in the CO2 group is net oil prices taking the Midland-Cushing differential into
account. That differential alone more than explains CO2's entire shortfall to its plan this year. So very strong volume
performance at SACROC and the NGLs, year-over-year upticks at Katz, work to be done at Goldsmith in particular.
Turning to the backlog, it's evenly split now in CO2 between the S&T and EOR parts of our business with about $2.1
billion each. We added disproportionately to the S&T portion of the backlog in the quarter-over-quarter change that we
had. Looking ahead, we're going to be focusing attention on Goldsmith and we've begun hedging and looking at other
physical sales strategies that we can use to manage the Midland-Cushing spread issue.
On the Products side, earnings before DD&A up $20 million or 10% year-over-year. The increase came from
year-over-year earnings growth on our [ph] less (10:02) refined products lines. KMCC had a big uptick year-over-year.
Southeast terminals in Cochin. And those positives more than offset declines at West Coast terminals and transmix.
Interestingly, refined products volumes here were up 6.8% year-over-year and up 4.1% if you exclude Parkway, which
we put into service late in Q3 of last year. Contrast that with the EIA where nationwide the increase in refined products
was only 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. Plantation volumes really led the way here as demand to move U.S. Gulf
Coast refined products to our markets remains very strong.
In addition to the nice increase we saw in refined products volumes, the backlog shows strong demand for additional
NGL condensate and crude infrastructure. If you look at the composition of the backlog here, there's a little over $0.5
billion that's associated with UTOPIA and Cochin, those projects; another $550 million associated with the crude and
condensate at KMCC including our splitter project there; and another $20 million or so on miscellaneous refined
products and blending operations. So a good chunk of demand for crude and condensate, and NGLs in particular.
The Products group also increased their backlog over $100 million while placing into service over $400 million worth
of projects during the quarter. The two big ones being Cochin and the completion of a number of KMCC-related
expansions; and the big addition being the UTOPIA project moving ethane and ethane-propane mix for NOVA as well
as potentially some other customers up to Cochin and then into the Windsor-Sarnia area. We also had another $50
million-plus of additions to KMCC related expansion projects.
And I have to say, overall, both in Gas and especially in Products, the project – the execution on the project in this
segment remains very good. They've hit their numbers or better, with a notable exception schedule-wise of a delay in
the first phase of the splitter project in the Houston Ship Channel. But from a cost standpoint, they're hitting their

numbers or better. And a reminder here, too, that the backlog does not yet include the Y-grade project, UMTP, or
Palmetto. We continue to work on those prospects. Palmetto is in the middle of an open season right now, until the end
of this month. And on a combined basis, these projects, if they come to fruition, would add another $4 billion to the
backlog.
Terminals – turning to Terminals. Earnings before DD&A year-over-year up $48 million or 25%; that is the biggest, I
believe, the biggest ever year-over-year uptick in performance for the Terminals segment. About 70% of that is
organic, placing a number of projects into service, versus 30% on the acquisition side, which is primarily the APT
acquisition. We did experience weakness in our coal export volumes, though we do have some protection in our
contracts with minimum payments, but we continue to see on the plus side, very strong demand for liquids
infrastructure, and that's evidenced by a net increase to the backlog of about $300 million even while putting $200
million worth of projects into service. The current backlog is predominantly liquids related. It breaks – there's about
$600 million worth of crude by rail projects that are in the backlog; about $400 million associated with building out the
tankers, the APT tankers; another $1.4 billion that's other liquids, tankage and dock and piping infrastructure; and bulk
is only about $80 million of our backlog currently.
Looking ahead here, we expect to continue to see growth in demand for the liquids infrastructure. I think that demand
extends also to our existing assets in Houston and Edmonton where we continue to see nice renewal rates on that, but
also extends to expansions. On the downside, we expect to see continued weakness in coal volumes into next year.
Lastly, Kinder Morgan Canada, and the big story here continues to be the Trans Mountain expansion. Just a reminder
here, this is fully under contract. We've got NEB approval of the commercial and economic terms of those contracts.
Our development costs are almost entirely covered on this project and we do have good cost protection on the most
difficult parts of the build.
Last quarter, when we had this call we had just received word of a six-month, three-week delay in the deadline for an
NEB decision. So they moved it from July of 2015 to January of 2016. But at that time we had not yet assessed the full
impact of that to the schedule other than to note that we would be moving from late 2017 to a 2018 in-service date.
We've spent the intervening time assessing the routes, alternatives in Burnaby. We've looked at our construction
schedule very closely and can tell you that we expect now a Q3 and frankly a late Q3 of 2018 in-service for Trans
Mountain now.
The main thing that's going on there is a separate proceeding for the NEB to assess the alternative routes between
Burnaby Mountain and the dock, where our terminal facility is down to the dock. We are in the middle of that process –
in the middle of a dispute with Burnaby over how to assess that. We had to examine our construction schedule closely,
looking at things like the effect on clearing schedules, fish and wildlife considerations, et cetera. And that pushed us to
a Q3 2018 in-service.
Notwithstanding the local disputes, we continue to make good progress to the application process and we still expect to
get our permit on this project and build this expansion. So that's the rundown on the business units and the major
projects.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim for a more detailed look at the numbers.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay. Thanks, Steve. So starting with KMP, in the GAAP income statement you can see there today the KMP board
declared a distribution per unit of $1.40. That's a $0.05 increase or 4% from the three months in 2013. As a result, we
will declare distribution for the nine months of $4.17 or an increase of 5%.
Now you can see on income from continuing operations that we're up 40%. If you want to look at it on a per share
number, we're up 78%. We don't think that these are the right numbers to focus on because we don't think it gives you
an accurate picture of what's going on at KMP.

So if you turn to the second page of numbers, you can see that we, our DCF per unit for the quarter is $1.31. That
compares to the declared distribution of $1.40, so we have about 0.94 times coverage or about $42 million short of
coverage. As we told you last quarter and we've told you almost every quarter, we expect negative coverage in the
second quarter and the third quarter, positive coverage in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, and for the year to
have positive coverage.
Now in terms of net income per unit, when you strip out the certain items we are at $0.57. I've seen a couple of notes
out there that said we've missed the consensus earnings. Let me point out that even though we don't think earnings is
the right thing, earnings per unit is the right thing to focus on, we do give you a budget every year of earnings per unit.
We also provide a distribution of how that number breaks out across the year. If you take our number of $2.57 and
multiply it by the percentage, you would get $0.57 per unit. So we are right on top of our budget at KMP.
And if you look at the other two companies, [ph] both (18:54) which I saw notes, we've missed the consensus, EPB is a
penny short of that calculation of our published numbers, published budget numbers and KMI is a penny above. So I
can't really comment on where the consensus earnings are coming from but they're obviously not consistent with the
budget that we've put out, which we have been very consistent in achieving over time.
DCF in total for KMP is $607 million, up $53 million or 10% in the quarter, so nice growth in total DCF in the quarter.
For the nine months, $1.861 billion, up $252 million or 16%. And so let me reconcile for you the $53 million that were
up for the quarter and the $252 million that were up for the nine months. If you look at segment earnings before
DD&A, we're up $141 million or 10%. About 72% of that is coming from two segments: Natural Gas and Terminals.
But we also had nice increases coming out of CO2 and Products. Our Natural Gas is up about $53 million and
Terminals is up about $48 million. Steve took you through all the reasons for that, so I won't reiterate that, but nice
growth coming out of the segments.
Then you focus on the expense side of the equation, G&A is actually – it was an expense of $129 million in the quarter.
That's a reduction, so G&A expense is lower than it was in the third quarter of 2013 by about $8 million. And that's a
result of higher capitalized overhead as a result of our capital expansion program.
Interest was an expense of $238 million in the quarter. That's about an increase of $17 million over the third quarter of
2013, and that is a result of higher average balances as a result of acquisitions and expansion capital slightly offset by
some lower rates. Then sustaining CapEx was an increase of $29 million in the third quarter of this year versus the third
quarter of 2013. That's within about 2% of our budget. It's actually about $3 million higher than our budget, but as I'll
tell you in a minute, year-to-date we're slightly behind our budget, so it's largely timing. So if you take the segments up
$141 million, G&A is a positive $8 million, interest expense, negative $17 million; sustaining CapEx $29 million, the
GP incentive is up $37 million as a result of higher distributions per unit and [ph] more (21:54) units outstanding. And
then we have some other items that are a negative $13 million, and that's largely just in our calculation at DCF, we
make some adjustments for things that are not cash that are in earnings, and so $13 million there. That gets you to the
$53 million.
If you look at the nine months, the $252 million, our segments are up $575 million or 14%. 83% of that growth, again,
is coming out of Natural Gas and Terminals, with Gas being up $355 million, Terminals being up $125 million, but we
also saw nice growth coming out of CO2 and Products. On the expense side of the equation, G&A is an increased
expense versus the nine months last year of about $20 million. Interest is up about $74 million, again, higher balance
slightly offset by a lower rate. The sustaining CapEx is up $82 million. For year-to-date we're about $23 million lower
than our plan on sustaining CapEx. So we budgeted for sustaining CapEx to increase, but some of that is timing.
Actually for the year, we're going to be about $16 million positive to our plan. Some of that, about half of that, is just a
reclassification to OpEx, so OpEx is higher than we would have expected, sustaining CapEx is a little bit lower than we
would have expected. That explains about a half of the $16 million variance.
But back to the nine months, $82 million in increased sustaining CapEx. The GP incentive's up $137 million for the
same reasons – higher distribution per unit, higher units outstanding, and then other items of about $10 million gets you
to the $252 million. So versus our budget, where we currently expect to end up the year, we currently expect to end up
on budget in terms of DCF and DCF per unit. But let me give you a little more insight into that. The segments are going

to be very, very close on a percentage basis. On an absolute dollar basis, they're going to be slightly below. And that's a
result of nice increases in gas versus our budget, primarily as a result of new contracts and increased transport revenue
on TGP and EPNG. It's a result of contributions in Terminals, from the APT acquisition. And then these positives are
more than offset by negative impacts of the Midland-Cushing differential as Steve mentioned, weaker coal volumes
than we would've expected, some project delays and lower condensate volumes. The slightly below on the absolute
dollars from the segment is being offset by positive variances on G&A, interest, GP incentive and sustaining CapEx to
leave us on budget overall for the year.
Now, in terms of KMP's balance sheet, we ended the quarter at $21.5 billion in debt. That results in a debt-to-EBITDA
of about 3.8 times. Debt increased in the quarter $817 million, and it increased almost $2 billion, $1.99 billion for the
nine months. So I'll take you through the change in debt, the drivers of the change in debt. On the quarter, we spent
about $1.16 billion in terms of acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We raised about
$328 million in equity and then we had a contract buyout that was about $200 million positive. And that was the main
certain item back on the income statement was the benefit, the earnings benefit, of that buyout, but we also received
cash for that.
And then we have working capital and other items that were a use of capital of about $181 million. Now, let me say,
there are tons of moving parts under here given the size of company that we are. But they net out, and so what you're
left with is primarily a use of working capital associated with accrued interest because we make our interest payments
on our debt primarily in the first quarter and the third quarter. Accrued interest was a use of working capital of about
$186 million in the quarter.
Year-to-date $1.99 billion increase on the debt balance. We spent about $3.7 billion in terms of acquisitions, expansion
CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We had $1.1 billion of acquisitions with the largest one being the APT
acquisition of $961 million that we did in the first quarter. Expansion CapEx was $2.3 billion and then we had about
$300 million of contributions to equity investments.
We raised $1.7 billion in equity. We had a little under a $200 million receipt of cash from the contract buyout. And
then we had a use of working capital and other items of $178 million. Again a lot of moving pieces but the primary use
of working capital was accrued interest.
So that's it for KMP. Looking at EPB, EPB for the quarter is declaring a distribution of $0.65. That is flat with the third
quarter of 2013. That results in a declared distribution of $1.95 for the nine months, which is a 3% increase versus the
nine months of 2013. When you look at EPB's DCF in the quarter, its DCF was $0.65 versus the declared distribution
of $0.65, so right at one times coverage.
The DCF per unit is up 12% versus the third quarter of last year, so very nice growth in DCF per unit. Year-to-date
DCF per unit is $2.02 versus a distribution of $1.95, and so about $15 million of positive coverage for the nine months
on EPB. The $2.02 is up about 3% from the nine months in 2013. DCF in total $150 million was up $23 million or 18%
for the three months. For the nine months, $454 million, up $29 million or 7%.
So let me reconcile for you the $23 million increase in DCF for the quarter and the $29 million increase in DCF for the
nine months. The top line of the page you can see earnings before DD&A of $3 million. That generally is where you
expect to see the increase in cash flow coming from our assets, but because the drop-downs that we did were both joint
ventures, as you know, we adjust our DCF calculation to add back JV DD&A and subtract our share of sustaining
CapEx. And the reason we do that is to more closely reflect the cash distributions that we receive from these
investments. So if you add back the JV DD&A, the change in JV DD&A from the quarter in 2013 to the third quarter
of – in 2014, that's a $31 million increase. And then we have a $3 million adjustment down in our DCF calculation to
adjust out some of the noncash items primarily deferred revenues and AFUDC. That's about a $3 million negative in
the quarter.
So really the assets contribution is up about $31 million. The [ph] May (30:44) drop-down contributed about $46
million. And then we have some degradation in SNG and WIC associated with the rate cases and also at WIC
associated with lower rates on contract renewals.

On the expense side of the equation, G&A, interest, sustaining CapEx, G&A is actually down $1 million versus the
third quarter of 2013. Interest is up, so increased expense about $3 million associated with interest expense from
financing the [ph] drops (31:20). Sustaining CapEx is up about $3 million. And that gets you to about $26 million of
improved cash flow. The GP incentive is up $3 million because of more units outstanding. That gets you to $23 million
increase in DCF in the quarter.
Year-to-date, the $29 million earnings before DD&A, again, up $6 million; similar story here. You also have to add
back the change in the JV DD&A, it's about $52 million; and then take out the items that we adjust that are noncash to
get to DCF, which is a negative $9 million. That gets you to about $49 million increase coming from the assets. The
[indiscernible] (32:07) is about $77 million benefit in the quarter, and then again in the year-to-date, and then again
similar story on WIC and SNG, down versus the nine months of 2013 on the rate cases and on the case of WIC, the
lower contract renewal.
You look at G&A interest and sustaining CapEx, the change in those is about a $2 million increase in total combined
for the nine months. Take that off of the $49 million from the assets that gets you to $47 million increase. The GP
incentive was up about $18 million on more units and a higher distribution to get you to the $29 million.
EPB is having a good year. EPB, we expect to meet our budget right now. On a DCF, we're running slightly ahead of
our budget, and that's coming from basically a little bit better performance across the board, better performance from
the assets a little bit, lower G&A, lower interest, and lower sustaining CapEx.
Looking at EPB's balance sheet, EPB ended the quarter with total debt of $3.642 billion. That is a debt-to-EBITDA of
about four times, and so up from the end of the year, but consistent with EPB's budget. The change in debt in the
quarter is a reduction of $99 million. For the year, it's an increase of $464 million. In the quarter, we spent about $23
million in terms of expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We issued about $76 million in equity,
and then working capital and other items were a source of cash of $46 million, which is primarily accrued interest and
accrued taxes.
Year-to-date, acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments was a use of cash of $1.028
billion, with the biggest component of that being the $972 million for the drop-down. We issued a little under $500
million of equity, $498 million, and then we have a little over – a $66 million source of working capital and other, the
same factors as on the quarter, primarily accrued interest, and accrued taxes.
Returning to KMI, at KMI, we are declaring – the board declared a dividend today of $0.44 per share. That is a little bit
– that is a penny above where we would have expected to be for the third quarter, and that is why you see our guidance
that we expect to exceed our $1.72 budget. That result in a declared distribution for the nine months of $1.29, which is
an 8% increase over the nine months in 2013. The $0.44 compares to cash available of $0.42, so we're slightly negative
on coverage, as we would've expected, similar to KMP, and as we tell you almost every quarter we expect negative
coverage in the second quarter and the third quarter, positive coverage in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, and to
be approximately one time for the full year.
For the nine months, the cash available of $1.29 is equivalent to the declared distribution of $1.29, so right at one times
coverage. Cash available to pay dividends, $435 million in the quarter, up $11 million or 3%; for the nine months $1.34
billion, up $109 million or 9%. So let me reconcile the $11 million increase in the quarter and the $109 million increase
for the nine months. In the quarter, the cash coming from KMI's investments in the MLPs, so from its GP and LP
interest, was up $48 million or 8%. The cash generated from other assets was down $47 million as a result of the
drop-downs. And then the combination of interest, G&A and taxes was a benefit of about $10 million, meaning we had
less expense in the third quarter of this year than we did in the third quarter of last year, and that leaves you up about
$11 million.
On the nine months, the cash coming from the MLPs up $182 million or 10%. The cash generated from other assets
down $76 million. Again, this is a function of dropping down assets to EPB and to KMP. And then interest, G&A and
taxes, the expense items are a benefit of $3 million. That's lower G&A and interest more than offsetting higher taxes,
leaving you up $109 million in the quarter. Versus our budget, we are slightly ahead of our budget in terms of cash

available to pay dividends, and as we said, we expect to exceed the dividends per share of $1.72.
Looking at KMI's balance sheet, we ended the quarter at $9.3 billion in debt. If you look at the fully consolidated
number of $35.5 billion, that is 4.9 times on a fully consolidated basis debt to last 12 months EBITDA. And we are on
target when we closed the transaction to be at about 5.6 times, as we laid out in the Investor Presentation.
The change in debt in the quarter is up $54 million. It's down a little under $500 million – $493 million year-to-date.
On the $54 million, we posted margin of about $60 million, and then we had a whole host of other items that comprise
the difference to get you to $54 million increase in debt. Those include the fact that at KMR that we include in the
metric is cash. We did not choose to sell those shares, and so that's a $23 million use of cash. We have a $63 million
benefit from the fact that we actually pay lower cash taxes that's less than the metric because we straight-lined, if you
will, the NOL that we got in the El Paso acquisition versus on a true cash tax – for purposes of the metric, versus on a
true cash tax basis, we're using that up as quickly as we can.
We had about $18 million in one-time items, primarily the legacy El Paso environmental and marketing. And then we
had some transaction costs associated with putting the bridge in place and with the SEC filings and banking fees.
For the year-to-date $493 million, we received $875 million in drop-down proceeds. Year-to-date, we've repurchased
[ph] $192 million (40:00) between warrants and shares. We had about $60 million margin call. This is where we posted
cash instead of LCs because there was a benefit, it was cheaper to post the cash, and so we converted it from an LC to
cash.
We made a pension contribution of $50 million. And then we had about $83 million in working capital and other items.
Again, KMR was about $69 million. The difference between the cash taxes and the metric was $189 million. [ph] Of
course (40:37) the one-time items were $89 million use [indiscernible] (40:43) on distributions we received and
dividends we paid, about $72 million use. And then we had about $39 million in terms of transaction costs, debt issue
costs associated with refinancing our revolver earlier in the year, and then the financing on the bridge and the revolver
for the transaction.
So with that, I'm done.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Kim. And I might add that this will get a lot simpler, hopefully by the next time we talk we'll be one
company instead of three. And with that, Holly, we'll open the floor for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And the first comes from Carl Kirst with BMO. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Carl, how are you doing?
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Hi. Thanks. Good, Rich. A couple of questions, if I could, on the backlog. And the first really is
to maybe just get a little bit more of a refined sense of UMTP. I guess the shipper paying sort of ended at the end of
August. To the extent that's still in negotiations, is that something you're looking to just negotiate through this winter to
see how NGL basis does and whether you might get more people to sign on at that point? How long do you let it go
before you start looking at a Tennessee Gas backhaul project again?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. I think we continue to pursue this project because we continue to see very strong interest
in it. And each period that we go out to survey the field and survey the market, it seems like we generate more interest
from the period prior. But we haven't been able to turn that into sufficient credit-worthy counterparty commitments to
carry the project through and allow us to put it on the backlog and actively pursue its development. Well, we are

actively pursuing its development. So kind of the reset that we've done, Carl, is to say, what is the market really need
out there? We think the market really needs about a 2018 in-service date. There have been a lot of talks for a while
about 2017. There doesn't seem to be much harm in a 2018 in-service date. And so we've adjusted our spend and our
development work that moves us to a 2018 in-service, but allows us to continue the development of the project at a
lower cost as we pursue abandonment on the Tennessee Gas Pipeline system.
So I think the short answer is it still looks like a very viable project. We're still working it very hard. We've found a
way to continue to develop the project as the market matures into it, and that's what we expect to happen. We do, as
you pointed out, always have the option of going to a southbound Tennessee haul. It's not a large amount of capacity
that this line represents, and so I think it's a much more attractive opportunity for us as a company to pursue the
Y-grade line, and so we'll continue to do that until it's apparent that there's not going to be sufficient commitments
coming forward. We think it's the best, long-term, most efficient solution for the customers up there, and we're
counting on them realizing it at some point here.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. And I appreciate the color. And maybe just one other question. Looking at New England
NED, obviously a very big potential project. Correct me if I am wrong, my recollection is that at least on the market
piece, the LDCs have signed up for roughly a 0.5 Bcf a day and you all were just in filing for Maine, and I guess
depending on if they bite, that might be something that could potentially push you over the commercial transom. And
my question is, how long do you think that process takes for the state of Maine to evaluate that situation? Is this a first
quarter, second quarter 2015? Just any kind of ZIP code you might have.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, Carl, this is Rich. It's complicated a bit by the fact that the Chairman is leaving at the
end of the year. That said there seems to be a great deal of interest by the state of Maine in pursuing this project and
we're working with them and pushing them to get a decision just as quickly as we can. We're working there toward
critical mass. We haven't put it in the backlog yet and won't until we get that critical mass.
We're working with a number of customers for additional capacity, and that project again looks certainly something
that's needed for New England. And we're also looking very seriously at our ability to re-route certain parts of that to
obviate some of the uproar we've had in the [indiscernible] (45:51) about where our pipeline is running. We think we've
found solutions to route the great bulk of it along right of way, which would not be as disturbing as the original plan
was.
We think the original plan took into account the needs and issues with the potential neighbors but we're going back to
the drawing board a bit on that and we'll be looking. We haven't filed a final route yet. We'll be looking to do that as we
move forward. So that's a project that again we continue to move forward on but we obviously have to see the critical
mass before we put that into backlog and announce it as a definite go project.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Understood. Those are my questions and meant to pass on my congrats to Kim as well, I'll do that
now.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Thanks Carl.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Thanks, Carl.

Thank you. And the next question is from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Ted. How are you?
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Hey, Rich. I'm doing well. Thanks. Maybe just start with the move in oil prices here and can
you give us an update on where your hedge percentages are as we look out for the next one to three years? And maybe
also a sensitivity analysis on say a dollar move in oil prices, what that would, how that would impact DCF for 2015?

<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Okay. So for 2015 right now we have about 64% hedged at a price of $90.53, 2016
we're 46% hedged at a price of $85.86, for 2017, we're 33% hedged at a price of $83.14, and for 2017 we're 17%
hedged at $83.80. By the time we get to the end of this year, the beginning of next year we would expect to be about
80% hedged on 2015, which would leave our sensitivity similar to what it has been in prior years of about $7 million in
DCF per dollar change in the barrel, per dollar change in a barrel of oil.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Great. That's very helpful, thanks. Next question is just on the shareholder vote here. Maybe, it
sounds like it's been delayed a little bit more than what we had thought it was going to be, anything there. And then as
you talk to the KMP unitholders in particular, what's your level of confidence in terms of getting that majority vote you
need?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, let me say first of all it's not delayed. We said sometime late in the fourth quarter we
would be happy if we can – as I said, we're hopeful. We're moving it forward to get it [ph] before (48:26)
Thanksgiving. And I'm going to turn to David Michels. David, do you want to take them through the analysis of the
KMP unitholders?
<A - David Patrick Michels>: Great, Ted. The way to remind you the way that the [indiscernible] (48:37) voters,
shareholders, will be able to direct their [ph] I (48:45) units to vote in the KMP unitholder vote, so that represents about
28% of the total KMP unitholder base. And if you break it down and use some reasonable estimates on how
institutional KMR-holders will vote and how KMR retail holders will vote, we think that that'll represent about 22% of
KMP's vote.
If you add on top of that KMP insider votes and KMI's ownership of KMP that gets you to about 30% of the total votes
that we think is reasonably assured to vote for the transaction. That would leave us with about 97 million units needed
to get us to the 51% level, and that 97 million units out of about 300 million units remaining outside of those
contingencies that we just walked through.
So we think – and of the 297 million that remain, that we need 97 million out of 90 million of those are institutional
owners, and we think that those are going to turn out overwhelmingly in favor of the transaction. We feel pretty
comfortable that we're going to be able to get there. But we're not taking it for granted. We're going through a very
thorough proxy solicitation process once the S4 is deemed effective.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Very, very helpful. Thank you for the detail. And then if I can get one more in. Obviously you
had sort of a big sell-off in kind of the market here, including some of the midstream assets. I'm just wondering if
you're seeing any even better opportunities potentially out there now, given some of the asset volumes may be a little
lower than where they were before.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think in the long run if that there's a potential [ph] part (50:32) to be beneficial in exactly
that way, but it's certainly too early to predict [ph] exactly (50:37) where this thing settles out. And of course, the
midstream sector rallied pretty nicely this afternoon. KMI was up about, I guess, close to 3% or 2.5%, as were a
number of other energy. So we'll just have to see where it is, but certainly I think in the long run the outcome of this
will be asset values that might change a bit that would give an opportunity for a company like Kinder Morgan to make
more acquisitions.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. Thank you very much. I'll leave it at that.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you, Ted.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.

<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations, Kim. Rich, I was just wondering if we
can sort of take a step back from specifically talking about [indiscernible] (51:29) issues with KMI. Ted just mentioned
the market's been challenging in the last few weeks. We've had this big decline in oil and just we've seen these steep
declines in the past. I was wondering if you can sort of walk us through the discussion process that you have with
producers before you start an open season process, talk us through maybe how they think about short-term pricing
trends versus long-term pricing trends as they establish their CapEx and how they come to you in terms of how you
provide solutions in terms of resolving bottlenecks and so forth. And how we should be thinking about CapEx, given
the short-term volatility that we've seen?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, first of all of course we're talking about a broad range of projects here ranging from
CO2 supply contracts on the one hand to Natural Gas and Products Pipeline projects on the other. With regard to most
of our midstream pipeline issues, we don't see much change as a result of lower prices. In fact you can make a
contrarian argument that a lower deck of prices on crude and NGLs will have a positive effect on people ramping up
petrochemical usage in the months and years to come. So I don't think that's a negative on our ability to, as you put it,
get around these bottlenecks, and resolve issues. And clearly so much of it now as Steve pointed out is returning to
demand pull for this, the LNG users, the petrochemical users and other demand, others users from the demand side.
Now I think it's a different issue on the CO2 side, and there we've looked very carefully at what we think are sort of
clearing prices. And this is going to vary widely with who the producer is and what needs they have. But let me start by
saying that we have [ph] floors (53:32) on the great bulk of our contract. So while there is some movement up and
down with the oil and that's part of the $7 million per dollar that Kim was referring to, we do have floors across the
board on that.
If you then look at, well, what does it really take in the Permian Basin for people to want to drill, we think from the
standpoint of a flood that's already going, just incremental CO2 to expand the flood is probably in the $40 to $45 range.
We think for instituting a new flood in the Permian Basin, and this is based on our own experience at SACROC, we
think it's probably closer to $60.
Now let me say again, that's going to vary with the acreage. That's going to vary with the producer. But what it says to
us is that CO2 floods are certainly economic at prices well below where the current price of oil is. And so that's I think
certainly something that we will watch very carefully on a going-forward basis, both on the S&T side of our CO2
operations, and obviously on the EOR side. But so far, this is not a big issue for us in terms of moving forward with our
projects in our view at this time.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. Thank you, Rich, for that perspective. Just two quick follow-up questions. You sort
of talked about the conversion of your shadow backlog to backlog in the prepared remarks. I was wondering if you can
sort of give us a sense of where the shadow backlog sits today? Were incremental projects added to the shadow
backlog? Or did it just by what's moved across?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. Steve?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, yeah, I mean, if you look at the projects that I mentioned as I went through each of the
business units and just added all those up, on an eight-eighths basis, that's about $15 billion to $16 billion – actually
probably $15 billion to $17 billion when you take the ranges into account, and that included Palmetto, the Y-grade line,
NED, one other one – what's that?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Gulf.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, Gulf LNG. So I mean, that's a substantial part of it. Some of this will have some overlap,
but I think in the Gas group, we have about an $18 billion shadow backlog. That will double up on NED and Gulf LNG
in that respect. So there are a lot of projects out there that we're pursuing and they have some reasonable probability
associated with them. It's just that they're not high enough probability for us to call them sort of near, sure things. But
that's order of magnitude, and we continue to – those are some of the big ones. The four that I called out are some of
the big ones. There's a lot of smaller projects in the Terminals sector, things in CO2 that we're looking at. Products
Pipelines there continues to be a number of projects for build-out there. So, again, I think the environment is just very

good for us, and I think we were very close to turning a couple more of those into – on the backlog, moving them from
one to the other, but just didn't quite get there this quarter, but I think may make some progress here in the coming
quarter.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. And one last final question, if I may. You sort of talked about contracting [ph] rules
(57:00) at the beginning on the Gas side. Have you seen any trends towards producers willing to take longer-term
contracting [ph] rules (57:10) versus what they typically would do on a renewal? Is there sort of any lengthening that's
going on as well as from how you think about from a pricing perspective?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. I'll turn to Tom Martin for that.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah we definitely are. I mean I think you have to look at it on a regional basis, but clearly
the activity that we're seeing out West on EPNG we're seeing both producers and end-users stepping in to longer-term
agreements on existing capacity and also sponsoring expansion projects. Certainly Tennessee Gas we're seeing much of
that driver to this point being producer-orientated both on existing capacity and on expansion capacity.
But I think really the – not to say that, that's part of the expansion and growth we've seen is ending. But we're certainly
seeing a shift towards more on the market side now going forward than what we had seen over say the last year to
year-and-a-half, and I think evidenced by really the last two quarters of [ph] our (58:13) projects being sponsored
predominantly more on the market side being LNG as well as Mexico exports. And I think we'll start to see power and
industrial expansion related projects in the coming quarter.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. Shneur the symbolic of that is what we announced yesterday afternoon. We have two
new projects on the Gas group side, 500,000 dekatherms a day going to – I still want to call it MGI. It's MexGas now.
Long-term contract, that's on top of, in excess of 500,000 dekatherms a day that we signed up several months ago. So
it's a little over 1 billion dekatherms a day going into Mexico on long-term contract just across our system.
And then we also announced yesterday associated with that on the Lone Star Project another 300,000 dekatherms a day,
which we have an end-user signed up for that capacity. And in fact that may even be enlarged as we go through the
open season. But what we announced yesterday was just that we would proceed with the 300,000 dekatherms a day.
We have enough to make it a valid project.
So that's the kind of end-user demand we're seeing. It's definitely lengthening the terms. I think we're even seeing
people as capacity comes up, and an open, on a bid situation where they have a [ph] roper (59:37) they now have to bid
longer-term in order to protect that capacity. People are seeing, I think, that this capacity in general is only going to get
more valuable as time goes on as all these demand-side projects come online.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. Thank you very much for that perspective, guys. And have a great day.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Reichman with Simmons & Company. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Mark. How are you?
<Q - Mark L. Reichman>: Good, good. Thank you. See, with respect to the announced expansions at Pasadena and
Galena Park, I was just wondering how you think about export opportunities in general, whether it'd be LPGs, refined
products, and even processed condensate. So as you survey existing storage and loading capacity, where do you think
opportunities remain unfulfilled? And also in light of a number of international refinery additions that are designed to
yield ultra-low sulfur diesel for export, how deep is the market, do you think, to accept growing refined product exports
from the U.S.?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: We're right in the middle of all of that, and what we announced yesterday certainly
involves that area. Steve?

<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. So what we announced yesterday is significant tank expansion underwritten with some
newly executed contracts from one shipper in particular we had some previously executed contract, and also includes
an expansion of a ship dock to get at exactly what you're talking about. I'm not sure that I can give you better numbers
than what you can read other places in terms of what the demand is going to be for additional export capacity, but what
I can tell you is that we're seeing people increasingly interested in capacity that they can get to a dock line, and we have
perhaps the biggest refined products storage position on the Houston Ship Channel and the combination of our
Pasadena and Galena Park facilities and with some expansion at BOSTCO, as well.
And we're expanding ship docks and we're expanding barge docks throughout that complex, so there is a lot of demand
for that. We've got, on a smaller scale, a project that we're looking at, at our Fairless Hills terminals in the Philadelphia
area that would involve LPG export. And I think those are the two big locations that you're going to see the demand.
You're going to see it in the Houston Ship Channel where we've got all the refined product capacity, and a little bit on
the northeast where people are looking for ways to get the liquids product out of the Marcellus and Utica to overseas
markets.
So what that aggregate number turns out to be, I don't know. But we didn't use to charge for or be able to charge for
access to our docks, and now, we are charging for access to our docks. I mean it is an extremely valuable bridge
between the interior of the United States and the world market for refined products. So demand is going up. How far up
it goes? Who knows, but we base our judgments on what shippers are willing to commit to and we're seeing an uptick
in those commitments.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And I think right now, frankly, I haven't run these – updated these numbers this quarter, but
I think we believe we're handling something between a quarter and a third of all the refined products exported across
the Houston/Beaumont area. And then, I think it's also instructive that this storage is just so important and growing so
dramatically. And to put some numbers to that, I believe with this project that we announced yesterday on the
Terminals, I think that will, when completed, will take the Galena Park project, the combined Pasadena-Galena Park
project over 30 million barrels of storage.
And if you add up everything we've got on the Houston Ship Channel, I think, when that's completed, we'll be slightly
over 40 million barrels of storage. So that's a really tremendous position to be in when you have the kind of need for
export, the need for avoiding volatility in pricing. We think this storage is just going to become more and more
valuable, and we're seeing that in the market.
<Q - Mark L. Reichman>: Great. Thank you very much.

Next question from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Darren. How are you?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Hey, fine. Thanks, Rich. Hope you're doing well. And Kim, congratulations on the
appointment to the office of the Chairman. Just a couple of quick questions. The first, on TGP, when I'm thinking about
Broad Run and the associated expansions you laid out, post Antero's anchor commitment, if I start thinking about Rose
Lake and Connecticut and the other initiatives that you're working, is it fair to assume that there's going to be at least
[ph] a B (64:33), if not 1.2 Bcf a day that could be hitting that West Virginia receipt point, and moving down to those
delivery points in Mississippi and Louisiana? Because, in looking at basis, specifically TETCO-M2 and Dominion
South [indiscernible] (64:46), it would look like that's probably one of the biggest areas for you guys to invest
incremental capital.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah, I mean, I think we're certainly taking a look at what our next big project would be. I
think it really boils down to what is the clearing price in the market for incremental expansion.

But I think, there's more volume that wants to move southbound. We are seeing some customer interests and diversify
some into Canada [indiscernible] (65:17) saw one other project announced yesterday into Chicago.
So I think there's – customers are looking at a portfolio approach. But I think, as I've said in other quarters, I think from
our perspective, we're needing a market clearing price north of $1 I think to do incremental projects in the Gulf Coast.
At least the initial feedback we're getting at this point is – that's probably still a little bit on the high side.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. And then, Rich, if I could go back to an earlier comment that you made regarding
the Northeast Energy Direct Project and re-routing that or moving along the existing rights-of-way, is that the variance
between the original cost estimate that you outlined of $6 billion, and the new forecast of $4.5 billion to $5 billion? Or
has there been any change to the scale or the scope of either phase one or the second phase initiative into
Massachusetts?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, there really hasn't, we've just kind of refined the costs and got it to a more likely area
of what we think the spend would actually be, and the $4.5 billion to $5 billion is a result of that, kind of pinning down
where we think the real construction will come out. Actually, the re-routing would be an increased cost as part of that,
something in that same range, but would be a net increase, because we have a few more miles of pipe. But on the other
hand, we would avoid most of the section 97 land in Massachusetts, and just be largely along utility right-of-way. But
we're still looking at that, but we're in the midst of doing that.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. And then last question from me, Steve, regarding CO2, if you could, could you
quantify what that current Midland to Cushing differential could have on annual cash flow if it stayed at this level? I'm
just trying to get an idea for the sensitivity for every dollar per barrel move in that spread?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I don't really have a sensitivity for you for that. We are, I can tell you that, we've been
putting – actively putting hedges on for 2015 at levels that are, call it, $4 better than what you're seeing in the current
market right now.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you, Darren.

Thank you. Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers, your line is open.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, how are you doing?
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Very good. Thanks, Rich, and congrats, Kim.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Thanks.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: A couple of quick ones here, does the $2 billion effective quarterly increase in your gross
backlog favorably impact, I believe, you're just over 9% combined enterprise EBITDA, five-year CAGR through 2020
that was noted in your S-1; I'm just trying to see what's baked in that, and where do we start getting incremental?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Kim?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: No. I think that, that backlog is – we actually have, still have some unidentified in that
five-year plan. Obviously, this eats away at that, but it's not going to be incremental at this point to the 9% growth.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. Once we start getting through the backlog that was included in that guidance, if you
guys can give us a heads up that anything new is incremental, that'd be great.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: We'll do that.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: And can you provide some more color around the continued growth in SACROC? You kind of
referred to it, but not much detail. And also the Yates NGL flooding concept and the latest ROZ updates?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I'll turn it over to Jim Wuerth who runs our CO2 operation. Jim?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yes, SACROC, I guess three main areas. We've had real [ph] big (69:03) success with the
horizontal wells that we're using as the injectors of CO2, we're getting good response from those, so the bypass wells
that we've talked about in the past look like that's going to be a real good outcome for SACROC. So that's one.
Two, with the seismic we had, initially, I think we said we'd have about five or six pinch-out wells that we'd be able to
identify and infills and drill. We've drilled 22 of those now. I think those are running about 1,100 barrels a day higher
than we anticipated. We have several more of those identified as the seismic processing continues to get better.
The other area I think – just conventional infills, we've done a couple of those. We've been very encouraged with that,
with one of them starting out close to 700 barrels a day. Back early in the year, still producing 400 barrels a day.
Second one coming on at over 400 barrels a day, so a lot of opportunities there.
We continue to look at fringe areas. We know we've got few more programs out there, that in the flat – out in the flat
formal we'll add on some there, and around some of the fringes around the, both the East and the West side of
SACROC. So just continue that opportunities at SACROC that we're finding there, and I think, we'll continue to find
more as we go forward.
At Yates, on the hydrocarbon miscible, we had a good and a bad news there is, we thought we'd have a test via putting
some NGL down into the gas cap in the third quarter. The problem we had was, we needed a baseline and we've got the
first well we've picked, the first oil there, we're producing – that currently still producing about 350 barrels a day on it.
So what that has done is, it's opened up another opportunity for us to look at this first oil, and we are doing that. We're
taking some wells in there and actually [ph] permitting (71:11) and picking up some of those first oil. Again, there's a
great opportunity there. I think now we have identified a couple of wells where the wellbore integrity is real good. We
think we can get to baseline fairly quickly. We hope to do the injection of the NGLs in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: We'll see some results coming in...
<A - James P. Wuerth>: On the ROZ – just to continue on the ROZ, Craig, we've got quite few wells drilled at this
point in time. Facilities are going in. We would still expect bringing the actual injection a little bit forward. We're
hoping to start injecting by November 15, and we'd have all our production facilities up and raring to go by late
December. They will handle any gas or [ph] gas explored (72:00) fluids that come out the other side, so we would
expect to see some results on this by the end of first quarter 2015.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. And the final results are, yay or nay on the NGL flooding; is that a first half event?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: We have not even – on the NGL flooding, we have not even had a chance to flood it yet.
That's why I said, that will be fourth quarter initiative.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

John Edwards with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, John. How're you doing?
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Good afternoon, Rich. Doing well. And I also want to say congrats to Kim as well. So just –
maybe I missed it, but the – what's your sort of range of total shadow backlog right now?

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think Steve said, the shadow backlog, John, it's very difficult to identify. But I think, the
number he said was $15 billion to $17 billion.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, that was just the projects that I mentioned. A different way of looking at it is, if you look
in the Gas group alone, it's $18 billion. I don't think we've calculated or identified a specific one for each of the other
business units though, John. So I mean – it's got to be $20 billion plus, but we haven't articulated that.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. So the $18 billion in the Gas group alone, but the $15 billion to $17 billion?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: That included some of the gas projects, John. So – I mean if you wanted to look at $18 billion
in gas, and then look at the non-gas projects, that'd be another $1.1 billion or so [ph] eight-eighths (73:34) on the
Palmetto Project. And then the Y-grade Project is, call it little over $3 billion, and again, those are [ph] eight-eighths
(73:43) numbers. Don't take into account, if we ended up – we don't have one today – but if we ended up with JV
partners on those.
But so, that's another $4 billion plus on top of Tom's $18 billion, and that's just in the Products group. And we haven't,
again, we have not gone out and calculated and compiled a shadow backlog for Terminals, for example, or even fully
done one for Products. So we kind of sum it up, prospects are very good, and we'll go knock these things down when
they get in front of us, and go from there.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: So if I add that up, so I should – I could characterize it in round numbers, something like,
call it $20 billion to $24 billion of shadow?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I'd say north of $20 billion. I don't know how far north.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay?
<Q - John D. Edwards>: This kind of helps us think about that. And then, I just – so I mean you sort of answered this
earlier, but – so in light of all the volatility in the market, you're not really seeing anybody, you're not really seeing this
impact to your discussions on potential projects or impact interest in terms of future going forward. You're not really
seeing any delays or deferrals or anything like that given the market volatility?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: We are not seeing that thus far.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: And to Rich's point earlier, it doesn't mean that you won't see some of that on the producer side,
some harder hit producers maybe. But lower prices are going to be very bullish for the demand side, which is where we
still have yet to see the full needs come to market to sign up for the firm, transport and storage commitments that
they're going to need to serve it.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, so and as far as, when you consolidate, close and
everything, the guidance that you've put out there is basically 16% dividend growth in 2015, 10% thereafter. And I
think you promise that on just – roughly $3.5 billion spend per year. So assuming some of these shadow projects
become a reality, so that effectively you're saying there's potentially upside to those numbers. Is that a fair
characterization?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Just one, the $3.6 billion per year did not include Trans Mountain. You've got to add that
on to it to get to your total.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: But I think, you can see from all these projects, John, that's why we're comfortable with the
thinking that, that level of capital expenditure, which is pretty consistent with what we've been doing, it's certainly
attainable. And if anything, as I said at the beginning in my remarks, it seems that the opportunities for midstream
infrastructure are better than they – they keep getting better.

Now, I'm not – I think Steve and Tom, and I have all said, we can't predict the future, and there may be some impact
on, particularly some of the smaller producers. We have not seen that yet, but certainly we think the demand is going to
be the big driver in the future, and that may actually improve as a result of lower prices, if indeed the prices stay lower.
That's certainly what we saw on the natural gas side.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. And then, just lastly, so and you're still thinking sort of 5 times to 5.5 times leverage
for the consolidated entity? I mean at least through 2020 or so, that's still the plan?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yes.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. Good. That's all I had. Thank you very much.

Next question is from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Becca. How are you?
<Q - Becca Followill>: I'm good. Thank you. Better this afternoon than I've been the last couple of days. Can you talk
about just on, back on Trans Mountain the Burnaby issues and the latest route to tunnel under the mountain, and the
delays, does it have any impact on the cost estimate at this point?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Ian Anderson, President of Kinder Morgan Canada is sitting right in the room. Ian?
<A - Ian D. Anderson>: Yeah. No, Becca, it's not going to have a material cost impact on the overall project,
whatsoever. A little bit more spending up front to do the assessment of the geology of the mountain, but it's not
significant.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Great. Thank you. And then there's been an amazing number of new pipeline announcements
just in the last six months, and when we look at the last build-out cycle we had in 2008 or 2009 there was a lot of cost
overruns. How are you guys planning differently in this cycle, given kind of what we went through the last time and the
number of announcements?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. No, that's a very good question, Becca. I think first of all, we are looking very, very
carefully at our costs in terms of escalation, both of materials but more importantly, putting into our estimate, adequate
cost escalation on the labor side. I think that's extremely important. If you look across our business units right now on
all projects we're working on, Steve, kind of alluded to this, actually products on all the projects that they're working on
is actually running about 1.5% below the original estimates. Natural gas is right on. CO2 is right on. And the only place
we've had overruns is on terminals, primarily some of our Canada projects. And that's between 6% and 7% overruns.
So we have not seen any dramatic issues thus far.
The second thing that's important above just really watching, getting your estimates right is trying to get a sharing
mechanism with your shippers on some of the more inflation prone areas. For example on Trans Mountain, we have
some sharing arrangements on construction costs in the lower mainland, this Burnaby would be an example of that. We
have some sharing costs on the cost of First Nation's involvement. And that's what we're trying to build in, in various
projects. You know there's nothing perfect here, and it's something that, I think is going to be a challenge for the
industry, and the industry's going to have to watch it very, very careful.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Can you say what escalators you have built in?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: It varies with the project, and specifically with the geographic location. Obviously, you
build in higher escalators in geographic areas where you don't have access to as many competitive – competitors in a
particular subcontracting area. So it varies all over the waterfront, but we think we're building in adequate incremental

numbers as we go forward.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thanks. And then the last question is just on this SFPP settlement, does this finally put to bed
all of this long-standing litigation?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: It does, we think. It has to be approved by the CPUC. They fast-tracked it, and we expect it
will be approved, but obviously it has to be approved by the commission. Yes, it does, and in fact, we have a three-year
moratorium on rates on the SFPP system on the CPUC portion of it, the intrastate portion. So yes, we think that does
put it to bed, and as we've said in the press release, I think we detailed the details of it really.

<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Fine. Great. And my congratulations as well to you, Kim.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Thanks, Jeremy.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: At the risk of getting ahead of myself a bit here, I was just wondering if you could provide us
kind of an M&A wish list in terms of what areas of midstream you'd like to expand into? Well, I guess the question is,
it seems on the nat gas pipeline side, imagine you might run up into antitrust considerations. I'm just wondering what
other parts of midstream you might want to expand in more. Just any color that you'd be willing to share would be
great.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think the color we'd be willing to share is, we're looking at all realistic opportunities
across the spectrum in all the businesses that we're in.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: That makes sense. Fair enough. [ph] Figure I'd (82:21) try. Thanks.
