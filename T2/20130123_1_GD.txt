I'm not going to spend a lot of time on the fourth quarter which is dominated by the charges. You're going to hear more
about that from Hugh Redd. I do intend to spend time – some time giving you a sense of my thinking about 2012 and
then spend a bit more time on 2013. I'll try to keep my remarks somewhat brief to provide sufficient time to address
your questions.
With respect to the fourth quarter, I would focus you on the revenue drop versus the same quarter a year ago, the single
largest cause of which is the revenue decline at European Land Systems. This is the salient fourth quarter impact that
carries over into 2013 which we'll talk about a bit more detail.
For the full year 2012, let's first talk about Aerospace. The group had notable growth. Sales and earnings increased by
double digits. At Gulfstream, both revenue and earnings were strong with revenue up over $800 million and earnings
up $110 million. There was some decrease in margin as a result of a mix shift toward early production G650 and 280.
Of course, we had higher default penalties in the prior year that somewhat inflated the 2011 margin. Gulfstream also
brought to market two clean sheet aircraft that entered into service pretty much on schedule we first announced back to
you in 2008.
Jet Aviation performed better in 2011 with revenues up almost 10% and earnings better than last year without regard to
charges. Management team at Jet has addressed the underlying operational performance issues in completion, and their
processes are dependable going forward. In all, Aerospace had a good year and delivered on its promises.
Combat Systems; sales as reported were lower by over $800 million in earnings before non-recurring charges were
down $215 million compared to the prior year. 75% of the sales decrease and 75% of the earnings decline were
attributable to European Land Systems. In the North American based businesses, sales were down somewhat at our
shorter cycle businesses but land systems sales, earnings and margins were higher. And each of our U.S. businesses
maintained double-digit margin. So what do we deduce from this? First, in recognition of European fiscal realities, we
are restructuring our European business and taking cost out to position us for the future. Second, our North American
based businesses performed extremely well given the current budget environment, particularly the biggest business,
Land Systems.
Let's move on to the Marine group. Sales were down less than 1% on timing of submarine and surface-ship programs.
Earnings were up 8.5% on good performance across all three of our shipyards. I particularly liked the story of Electric
Boat, the largest business. Revenue was down very modestly, and we had a 50-basis-point margin improvement.
NASSCO had outstanding performance and superb profit contribution on the T-AKE program.
IS&T. As reported, the group lost $1.2 billion of sales year-over-year, and approximately $400 million of earnings
before non-recurring charges. C4 Systems sales decline was about 75% of the group's total decline. Earnings declined
at – the earnings decline at C4 was about two-thirds of the group's earnings decline, driven by lower revenue in general
and a volume reduction in some of their higher-margin products, in particular.
Our GD U.K. business accounted for approximately 20% of the sales decline as reported, and 20% of the earnings
decline before charges, in part from reduced volume and in part from some performance issues.
Clearly, we are not pleased with the considerable decline in margins in this group – about 270 basis points without
regard to charges. In addition, the impact of dramatic sales in earnings decline in C4 and GD U.K. created a mix shift in
the group toward lower-margin IT services. Conversely, strong second-half orders – including orders of C4 for WIN-T,
HMS, Rifleman and Manpack radios – helped stabilize C4 moving forward.
Think about it this way. C4 had a book-to-bill for 2012 greater than one. The margin decline in this group is explicable,
but the performance was disappointing at best and will be addressed.
In summary, for the entire entity, cash performance was strong. I like Aerospace's excellent growth in both revenue and
earnings. Combat Systems, North American businesses performed well in the middle of tough budget environment. The
European combat vehicle business was a negative, but as you can see from the charges, we are addressing their cost
structure this year. Marine remains steady with good operating performance. IS&T did not perform as anticipated, and
we're going to work that hard in 2013.

Our large, powerful, core-platform businesses – electric, Gulfstream and land systems – continue to perform at very
high levels, generating EBIT, EBIT margins and cash.
So let's turn to 2013. With respect to revenue, our plan rolls up to somewhat less than a 1% sales increase over 2012,
led by 16% growth at Aerospace, offset in part by a 3% to 4% decline in our Defense business. Combat and IS&T are
each contributing about 50% of the decline, with Marine growth offsetting the decline somewhat. A reasonable range
for sales this year is flat to up 1.5%.
Operating earnings should be essentially flat when compared to 2012 results before non-recurring items. The plan
contemplates an overall operating margin in the mid-11% range, reflecting a slight compression compared to 2012
before non-recurring items. Aerospace and IS&T margins are planned to be better than 2012 margins before
non-recurring charges, offset by a decline in the Marine group margins and a slight drop at Combat Systems.
Here's how we plan to perform across our groups in greater detail. First, Aerospace. Our plan reflects a 16% sales
growth led by Aerospace. Operating earnings are planned to increase 19% when compared with 2012 results before
non-recurring items. This represents increased margins of 40 basis points compared to 2012.
Aerospace has additional revenue and earnings potential beyond the plan. Debt has stabilized its operations. Additional
revenue opportunities in completion if realized would provide some improvement in profitability, though we remain
properly cautious about this market.
At Gulfstream, margin improvement over plan is dependent on 650 performance. There is upside if we can beat
planned cost performance on G650 manufacturing and completion.
Combat. Revenue is planned to be down approximately 6% when compared with 2012 group revenues as reported. The
decline is attributable to a reduction in combat theater-related services and in our shorter-cycle U.S. businesses. The
group's operating margin is anticipated to be in the mid 13%.
Marine group. Sales in the group are highly predictable and are planned up almost 2% from 2012. Earnings, however,
are down on margin compression as a result of mix shift at NASSCO caused entirely by the end of the highly
successful T-AKE program in 2012. Plan anticipates the Marine group operating margin of approximately 9.4%. This
is still industry-leading performance by no small measure. That said, we will seek to improve these anticipated margins
as we go forward through the year.
IS&T. Revenue is planned to be down against 2012 by almost 5%. Margins, however, are up 20 basis points against
last year's performance before non-recurring item. The margin increase is the result of improved performance primarily
at C4 Systems and at AIS as their plans have stabilized and may drive cost out of their business.
In summary, as COO, I worked with our business units to develop realistic operating plans based on a comprehensive
analysis program by program and our best assessment of risk and opportunity. We only recently finalized our operating
plan to capture the current outlook as best we could. The plan contemplates a full year's continuing resolution and is
reasonable subject to some risk on the sell-side in the event of sequestration and more Draconian budget cuts than
currently contemplated. Due to its short cycle businesses and O&M exposure, the IS&T outlook will remain most
sensitive to any additional budget cuts that may occur.
Our margins have been good apart from recent IS&T performance but there's plenty of room for improvement. We will
be working cost-cutting initiatives across all of our lines of business. I'll have more to say about that later in the year.
The opportunities for upside, and they are significant, are margin improvement, cash generation and driving
performance side of the equation. We will focus this year on operations, drive cost out of our businesses and improve
performance. But I do not intend to guide you to higher operating margins than are currently embedded in our plan
because we have yet to earn them.
I'll now turn over the mic to Hugh Redd to provide you detail on the charges and other items.

L. Hugh Redd
Thank you, Phebe, and good morning.
I intend to discuss in detail the charges in the quarter including goodwill impairment and a few other miscellaneous
financial items before the question-and-answer period. Before I discuss the goodwill impairment, I would like to
address other discrete charges which impact the fourth quarter by segment.
First impacting the Aerospace group, we recorded a $191 million impairment of intangible assets associated with Jet
Aviation's maintenance business. Jet's business, particularly in Europe, has been impacted negatively by recent
economic conditions and an increasingly competitive marketplace where we were seeing OEMs perform maintenance
work that was previously performed by third parties like Jet. As a result of these market trends, in the fourth quarter, we
reviewed the long-lived assets associated with Jet's maintenance business and eliminated the remaining value of the
intangible assets. We've repositioned Jet's maintenance business to match anticipated future demand and as a result
expect it to remain profitable in the future.
Next impacting the Combat group; we recorded a charge of $405 million related to our European Land Systems
business. Included in this amount is $292 million for accruals for contract disputes, primarily related to our contract
with the government of Portugal for 260 Pandur vehicles.
During the quarter, we were notified by the Portuguese Minister of National Defense that the contract was terminated
for an alleged breach of contract. Subsequent to that notification, the customer has drawn $73 million on bank
guarantees related to the contract. While we have asserted that we are not in breach of the contract and that the
termination of the contract was invalid, we reserve the receivables and inventory on our books and accrued an estimate
to satisfy remaining obligations to close out the contract. We filed the demand for arbitration to protect our rights, but
the outcome is difficult to predict given the customer's behavior to date.
The other significant items in the charge for our European Land Systems business are $98 million of
restructuring-related costs and $50 million of inventory write-downs. Late in the fourth quarter, we committed to a
restructuring plan to eliminate excess capacity and align the size of our European business with future demand. This
amount consists primarily of severance costs which are expected to be paid in 2013.
The next two discrete charges in the quarter impacted the Information Systems and Technology group. In the quarter,
we recorded a $110 million impairment of intangible assets associated with the prior acquisition in the optical products
area of the business. As a result of competitive losses and award delays in the fourth quarter, we reviewed the live long
– long-lived assets of this business for impairment and eliminated much of the remaining value.
Also in the quarter, we recorded $38 million to write off obsolete inventory primarily ruggedized computers and
associated parts inventory as projected sales are not likely to materialize. Goodwill impairment also impacted the IS&T
segment. During the fourth quarter, we conducted the required goodwill impairment test just as we do every year. For
three of our segments, step one of the test resulted in estimated fair values far in excess of book values as of
12/31/2012. For IS&T, however, the book value exceeded the estimated value. Accordingly, we performed a very
detailed step two of the test for the IS&T segment, which resulted in a $2 billion impairment loss which has been
recorded in the fourth quarter results.
Some further background on this non-cash charge. Since its formation in 1997, our IS&T segment has completed 38
acquisitions. The goodwill associated with these 38 acquisitions totaled $8.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of
2012 and represented 58% of the total company goodwill. As we've been discussing for several quarters, and as Phebe
outlined, IS&T has experienced continued top-line pressure resulted from slow defense spending in their markets and
margin compression due to mix shift and cost performance. In fact, from its high point in 2010, revenues in IS&T are
down almost 14% and margins have declined 270 basis points. Accordingly, our projection of future cash flow from
IS&T has been impacted, leading to a lower estimated fair value than we have calculated in prior years. The
impairment charges reduced the carrying value of IS&T goodwill by 25%.

Leaving the segment charges behind, net interest expense was $41 million for the quarter versus $38 million in 2011.
For 2012, our interest expense for the full year was $156 million right in line with our prior estimates. For 2013, we
expect net interest expense to decline to approximately $90 million, reflecting the full year impact of our $2.4 billion
debt refinancing which we completed in December of 2012. As you know, debt refinancing lowered our weighted
average interest rate on our outstanding debt to 2.2% and extended our average maturities by seven years. There was a
charge – excuse me, there was a charge of $123 million included in other expense in the quarter related to the bond
redemption premium for the refinancing.
At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects approximately $600 million of net debt, a reduction of $400 million
from the prior year.
The reported effective tax rates are somewhat meaningless for the – for comparative purposes and with that in mind, I'll
address them. The effective tax rate was negative 2.8% for the quarter and a positive 161.4% for the full year. The
fourth quarter rate and the full year rate were impacted significantly by the fact that the discrete charges had either
reduced or no tax benefit. For 2013, we expect an effective tax rate around 32% taking into consideration the
retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit, the impact for 2012 and 2013 being recognized in the 2013 rate.
The operating costs attributable to corporate were 69 – excuse me, $69 million for the full year 2012 versus $77 million
for 2011. The amount for 2013 will be closer to $90 million. During 2012, we contributed approximately $530 million
in cash to our pension plans. For 2013, our funding expectation is approximately $600 million, with 60% of that
funding occurring during the third quarter.
Finally, we ended the year with $3.3 billion in cash, and as I said, net debt of $600 million. We remain committed to
maintaining a strong balance sheet and strong credit ratings. Our commitment will be evidenced by a disciplined capital
deployment strategy throughout 2013.
That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Erin for the Q&A.

<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Welcome. I'm sure this is not the rollout you're always envisioning but nonetheless, welcome.
The question I have is on IS&T margins. And you talked about up 20 basis points on a clean compare in 2012. I just
want to make sure that's 8.2%. Is that roughly the range?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes.

long-term margin opportunity? And maybe for Hugh, was there an amortize – or is there an amortization benefit that's

coming in 2013 to IS&T that's in that 8.2%?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Let me give you a little bit and then we'll let Hugh answer. Let me give you a little bit of
color on 2012 margins and then 2013 margins, all right? We had, as I mentioned, about a 20 – 270 basis point
compression in 2012 margins. And the way I think about the margins is, is here's what's going on. We talked about C4
in 2012 and we are confident that their reset plan reflects their market reality and shows considerable improvement
year-over-year. The IS&T services have become an increasingly large segment in IS&T, the IT services. And GDIT is
a lower margin business than the other IT businesses.
Going forward, there are two main drivers for 2013. C4 sales and earnings and margins are up in 2013 as against 2012
before non-recurring charges. And the margin expansion is around 80 basis points. We've also addressed the
operational problems at GD U.K. and we have some stabilization there as well. Offsetting that margin improvement is
IT services has about a $350 million lower revenue target and margin compression of about 50 basis points. So net-net,
that's how we're rolling up to about an 8.2% margin. Hugh, you want to address the amortization?
<A - L. Hugh Redd>: Yeah, Myles, there will be less amortization in 2013. I think the number's probably $25 million,
maybe slightly more. That has been reflected in the projections that Phebe has and the guidance she's given you.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: I'll stick to one, but, Phebe, is there a longer term margin expansion story for IS&T? Or is
this kind of what we should think about of the business?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: There is a longer term and let me take this opportunity to explain that. One of the things
that ought to be clear is that we have reset the IS&T plan across each one of the businesses and we haven't done a very,
very realistic program-by-program analysis that drove our revenue estimate by about 5% lower. And to fire test those
assumptions is part of our planning purpose, we used a parametric analysis based on several benchmarks including
book-to-bill, established budgets and backlog. So the result of where we're guiding you to in IS&T seems reasonable to
me in both program assumptions and by application of the benchmarks that history tells us are reasonable parametric
tests of our assumptions. When I think about IS&T and let's talk about C4 in particular. This is a superb management
team that given a realistic and reset plan and given their order book has margin potential, I'm just not going to lead you
there, margin expansion potential I'm just not going to lead you there yet and that goes into – that's relevant for 2013
and 2014. What we see over our long range plans for IS&T is margin expansion across the board, but it's going to be
slow and deliberative.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. Thanks again.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, Phebe. Welcome.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So Gulfstream, could you give us some color on how many 650s did you deliver in the year?
How many completions? And give us some color on the delivery assumptions behind your comments on Aerospace for
2013?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, look, we – as I highlighted and we highlighted in our press release, we delivered 37
aircrafts to customers in the quarter, including 31 large cabins, and we're not going to break out aircraft deliveries by
model type, and I certainly don't intend to going forward. I can tell you that based on what we reported before we had
six G650s enter into service in the fourth quarter.
Let me give you a little bit of background on margins. Let's take 2012, okay? Starting in the third and fourth quarter,
margins were impacted by higher cost of goods sold in connection with the completions and retrofit work for the G650.
As a result, we had a temporary disequilibrium between green production and completions as we accommodate some

retrofit work out of cycle. We've got to work our way through that over the year. And so let me – that leads me into
2013, and I talked to you about margins in 2013. There are two things driving; one of them, mix shift, with a larger
proportion of 650 and 280s with lower margins at the moment compared with 450s and 550s. It's also about 650
production which I alluded to and we have factored the green and completion production rate to account for the
imbalance – this imbalance in production flow from green completions that will take a duration of a year to resolve.
Let me give you – I think it might be helpful for you to understand where we are and I'll give you some color. I think
some real detail on how we're seeing our rates and our margins. So let's talk about 650 manufacturing. Over the –
overall, the manufacturing of these aircraft is going well. However, not surprisingly, due to the prolonged FAA
certification process and our decision to continue manufacturing G650s during that process, there is currently
disequilibrium between initial and final phase manufacturing and that disequilibrium is the result of retrofit work
mandated by changes to the configuration of initial G650 green aircraft after they were manufactured to conform with
FAA-approved configuration. So as I say, we've got through – the margin guidance we've got in 2013, anticipate taking
the majority of the year to rebalance our initial phase and final phase production. We have some opportunity there but
I'm not willing to call it yet.

And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning and welcome, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thank you.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Want to talk about cash. Cash relative to adjusted earnings for the full year came in below
100%. Can you talk about couple of things? Cash conversion in 2013?
And then how you plan on – your plan in terms of deploying the cash? Obviously, relative to some of your peers, your
dividend yield is little bit lower, share repurchase you haven't been as aggressive focusing more on acquisitions. So just
wanted to hear what you're thinking in terms of deploying that cash. And it looks like your guidance for the year
doesn't assume anything for share repurchase, if I'm correct?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: That's correct.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So let me give you a little bit on cash. And you've seen this in 2012, and you're going to
see it again in 2013. Our cash generation in the underlying business continues to be superb.
We have considerable CapEx in 2012 and again in 2013. In 2013, we have planned at about $618 million – that's
primarily at Gulfstream – and I can tell you we're going to work that number very, very hard. We also have some
headwinds in cash with respect to pension, and as I mentioned, higher CapEx.
But let me talk to you a minute about a subject that's near and dear to my heart, and that's capital deployment. I think it
should be clear from what I've told you is that I'm going to remain, and as is our management team, focused on
operations in 2013. I can tell you there is almost no acquisition candidates in the current pipeline.
I also believe that the acquisition process at GD is somewhat broken, and I will not venture back into that market until
we have reestablished the discipline in this process. And I can give you a little bit more color on this. If you consider
the acquisitions that were made in combat – force protection, in particular, and the repair businesses in Marine – they
were excellent. Recent IS&T acquisitions haven't been so far.

conducted a very broad business review here. And I wondered if you might discuss the scale and the scope of those
actions? And anything it may have revealed broadly about the business, its structure, its competitiveness, outside of the
weakness that you've obviously called out in AIS and C4 Systems and ELS? Anything you sort of learned that you
intend to apply to how you want to run the company in 2013 and beyond?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, that's a very good question.
It ought to be clear from the charges that in some respects, we took our eye off the ball. Some of our business units
performed superbly, but that benefit hasn't accrued to the benefit – or that value hasn't accrued to the benefit of our
shareholders. And you can better believe that we're going to be focused like a laser beam on that.
I can tell you that I have – I'm very close to our business-unit presidents. I know their business. They know their
business. And we are completely aligned with the prime directive, and that prime directive is drive cost out of our
business, generate earnings in cash, expand our margins, and reassure our shareholders that we're wise stewards of their
capital. So we are going to be focused on operations, and you're going to see that across every single one of our
businesses.
And let me tell you something else too as I think about our business. One of our key jobs is to manage and mitigate
risk, and classical risk theory argues for diversification. And one of the things that I think we need to understand about
GD is we have diversification in two respects. First and clearly, we have diversification in counter-cyclicality with
Aerospace and defense businesses, right? [ph] Pretty act they matter. (32:11)
Second, however, within our defense businesses, we are somewhat countercyclical with the Navy and the Army – our
exposure to the Army and the offsetting exposure to the Navy portfolio. So while I see some contraction in our Army
market, the Navy tends to be – as a result of tactical changes in the budget, the Navy tends to be more strategically
driven, and vary depending on whether we are in a hot war – that balance between the Navy and the Army.
So when you look at that, even within the defense portfolio, I like our balance.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: That's great. And just as a follow-up to that, Phebe, as you think about the portfolio, you
made the comments around M&A and the deal process being broken in some fashions. As you look back over some of
the deals that were done, is there the scope for portfolio transformation and divestiture at some point? Or is it too early
to say at this point?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I'm not looking at reshaping our portfolio at the moment. I don't see any compelling
reason to do that.
We've reset our businesses. Some of the acquisitions that we've made I'm not a particular fan of, and had I been
consulted, wouldn't have done. But that said, the teams that we've got around each of these acquisitions are well poised
to perform well. They're poised to perform well. And I've got a lot of confidence in these guys, I've got to tell you.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thank you, Phebe.

And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please proceed.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Hi, Phebe. How are you?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I want to follow a little bit on Carter, but turn the twist a little bit. How are you thinking
about – well, kind of bidding and approaching market opportunities?
Because the defense budget, while it's north of $500 billion, in many cases, there's great opportunities to take advantage
of things you know well. And electric boat for underseas. UAVs, as an example. Or we saw the other day, you're
looking at teaming with an aerospace company to go after a trainer. And then I have a follow-up to that.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so look, let's take that in several parts.
What you're going to see us do is pursue – I can't say this enough – pursue margin expansion, and generate cash and
earnings. We are not going to chase revenue. We're going to stick to our knitting and do what we know how to do. This
company has a long history of operating excellence, and it's perform, perform, perform.
Now that said, we've got – if you look across the portfolio, we've got some real opportunities for organic growth. And I
would point you to the Marine Group. When you look at the two-per-year Virginia-class as well as the Ohio
Replacement Program, we've got, frankly, unprecedented growth in the modern era in Marine. And that to me is, again,
all about performance.
I like where we are on Combat Systems. It's interesting that nobody's asked me this question, but I'm going to answer it
anyway because I'm itching to. The story in Combat Systems over the last few years has really been about Europe. It's
not about the domestic – it's not about our domestic companies. They're pretty stable. And Land Systems, the big
gorilla there, is extremely stable on its vehicle orders and on its vehicle backlog, and they know how to do what they
do.
So I like where Combat is. I like where Marine is. Aerospace, we've got to take advantage of the growth in Aerospace.
And IS&T, we've repositioned, we've reset their plans. Their backlog is stable. And those guys know how to do what
they're going to do.
So I think we're very well positioned to deal with any changes that we see in defense budget. Because let me tell you
something. That all comes down to agility, right? What I want to know is give us the balls and the strikes and we're
going react. Tell us what the spending is going be, allocate any cuts across the various portfolios, and then it's our job
to right-size our businesses, drive costs out, and perform for our customers and our shareholders and our people.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And I mean I think that goes to sort of being careful about contracting. I mean that's –
performance is part of it, but -
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hey, you've got that right. Hey, listen. If you think about GD, one of the things that we do
very, very well – it's all about contracts. If you get bad T's and C's in a contract, you are so far behind the power curve
that it takes you a long time to dig your way out of that hole.
We are absolutely ruthless in our attention to our contracting. And we have got some terrific estimators and some very,
very good contract people. And that is – by the way, that is the foundation that we built this business on.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I see it, and the development programs for the Zumwalt I guess really speak to that, as a
good -

<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thanks, Phebe -
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: That is – that program is doing better than anyone could have expected.

profound impact. I'm out of my lane when I talk about that, but you know what? It's just my intuition.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good afternoon, and welcome, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thank you.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: You talked earlier in your opening a bit about the defense cuts embedded in your guidance.
Perhaps you could give us a little bit more specificity there?
And then I'm wondering if you could apply your expectations maybe a little longer-term, Phebe, to the segments –
particularly to Combat and IS&T – and where you think the trough is in those businesses, at least from a revenue
standpoint, whether it is 2013, 2014, 2015. How you think about that.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: As I see the defense market at the moment, I think IS&T has gone through its trough. I
don't see anything in my current projections that would suggest that we've got considerable revenue decline in that
business.
That said, as I mentioned earlier, because it's a shorter-cycle business and we've got a fair amount of O&M exposure
there, they are more vulnerable and more susceptible to dramatic changes in the defense budget. But as of now, and
even if I look at – you can make some estimates about planned cuts – I think we've seen the trough.
Let me move to Combat for a minute, because I think understanding our order book will help you a little bit. We have
anticipated a number of significant international opportunities that we are very well positioned for. But that's really all
I'm going to say about that at the moment. You should see some of those opportunities drop into our backlog in the first
quarter.
But let's think about Combat's backlog more broadly. It's about 1.2 times sales at year end. And if I look at the
book-to-bill for the entire group, it's been largely increasing quarter-over-quarter in 2012, and Land Systems
book-to-bill has increased significantly, and in the fourth quarter approached one-to-one.
To give you a touch more color on that, what I'm looking at for 2013 is sales growth in the international realm of about
44%.
So when I step back and say, okay, if I look at my order book, I look at my book-to-bill, I look at how I'm positioned,
how our company is positioned in Land Systems as well as some of our shorter-cycle businesses – we ought to be able
to do extremely well here. And we're reflecting that in our plan.
And by the way, when I say plan, I've got a 2013 plan, but I see possibility for margin expansion and earnings and cash
generation well into 2013, 2014 and 2015. We've got a nice balance here.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: So given the book to bill in 2012 in Combat, and the sales guidance you have got there, at
what point in the year will we need to see these international orders, before you would find that solidify?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: [ph] Untied (41:33) I think you ought to see them drop into our backlog in the first
quarter.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay. And then just lastly on this -
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: By the way, I would not be leading you implicit in the guidance that I have given without
a fair amount of confidence in these various orders.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Well, and that brings me to just the final part of the question, which is the guidance range is
fairly narrow at a dime. And just given the last couple of years, why not a slightly wider range?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Look, the way I think about this – here's kind of what we have done. We've cleaned up
our business. 2013 is our reset year. And I'm going be pretty conservative here. Don't get out ahead of me but I'm going
be pretty conservative here and I think that's prudent. We've got some potential budget cuts coming our way. I've got
the business unit presidents and I are aligned in taking costs out. But I'm going to stay in a fairly narrow band here and
a range that I feel comfortable in guiding you to at the moment. If I see some upside in the year I'm going to come back
at you.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Fair enough. Thank you very much.

And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Hi. Just a quick follow-up on that is in the past there's been a target for International Combat
being about 40% of the total Combat Systems revenues. Do you still see that as a target?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I think we're going be slightly in – look, I don't have a target. I'm just telling you what I'm
seeing in our pipeline and in our book-to-bill, in our backlog. But I'm not – I think it's in the – getting – approaching the
mid-40s.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay, and then I guess the bigger question is just in thinking about the different things you
have said and the acquisition discipline, etcetera, is there any change in any of the incentives? And I guess the focus
historically has been earnings, free cash and ROIC. With respect to the charges and everything that went into 2012,
how do you see the real drivers and key things that you and your management team need to focus on for incentive
compensation changing?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, now listen, the issues with respect to what I consider to be a somewhat broken
internal process, we will address. And you can bet your bottom dollar we're going to address it. But I want to incent this
management team to do what we're telling you we're going to do. And the value proposition for GD, margin expansion,
earnings and cash. Focus on the basics. Perform, perform, perform. Meet our plans and deliver that value to our
shareholders and our customers. It can't be any more simple than that.

<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: So when you think about – this is kind of maybe a big strategy question here – about how –
where the budget is going, how your portfolio is positioned, you yourself having been in OMB and knowing how
downturns go, I mean how is that flavoring, if you will, or coloring how you think about the portfolio, how you think
about the business? And when I think about General Dynamics three years from now, four years from now, when you
have been in that seat for a while – I mean, what do I have to look forward to? I mean what's – can you give me some
color on that? Kind of think strategy.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Look I'm going to focus on operations in 2013, and we're going to continue to do what we
are capable of doing on the operation side. And I think you couple that, that discipline that we've had and we're capable
of, with very prudent and shareholder-friendly capital deployment. Hey, listen, one of the things we need to do is
reassure our investors that we are wise stewards of their capital. We will intend to do that.
So I will be very cautious going forward, shareholder friendly, continue to perform, focus on our customers and our
people. And lead this – it's interesting, you both lead and serve the management team and the company. And I've got to
tell you, we are a very, very tight, cohesive management team. I've got an awful lot of confidence in them.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Can I ask one follow-on as a part of that? Besides the operations, that is kind of clear and
you've talked a lot about that. But strategically what do you see as your biggest challenge ahead of you?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Look. Strategically, what we need to do is manage Defense, the Defense businesses, in a
slightly – in a down market, or in a declining market. And in my mind, we ought to be able to make money. In fact, we
should make money as a good cyclical in a down market. And what does that mean? It means that you stay focused on
the things that I've talked about. And that you perform agilely. You've got be agile. You've got be able to react quickly
to the balls and strikes that come your way. It's all about agility. That's what a good cyclical does. It's what we're going
to do. So I look at that as a challenge and opportunity is to take advantage of the growth where we've got it, and that's
clear at Gulfstream and in parts of our other businesses, where we're going to have organic growth.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay. Great.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Does that answer your question?
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yeah, yeah, I think so. I mean I guess the question is how about parts of the business where
you don't have growth? What do you do with those?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, then you're going to drive earnings and cash, aren't you? I mean there is no point
chasing revenue or pretending that one is in a growth market when you're not. I think what you want from us is realism,
putting the mirror up to our face and saying here's what we see, and based on what we see, delivering on our promises.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yeah, okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne Agee. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Good afternoon, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: A question regarding Combat Systems again back – but in particular in the backlog you saw a
10% drop in kind of the funded backlog. Maybe you could just give us a little color, exactly what the moving pieces
were there. And back focusing on I guess the international piece, at the end of 3Q, 42% of the mix was tied to the
wheeled vehicle area in terms of the portfolio. What gives you kind of the confidence that – is it the indigenous
manufacturing aspect of kind of where these operations are that you are going to continue to sustain that or we're not
going to be hit with what I think could be some choppiness as you have kind of indicated?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Look. The vehicle – let's talk about Land Systems. The vehicle market is year-over-year
from 2012 to 2013, our vehicle line of business, that's both track and wheeled, is essentially flat. And it's a mix of
domestic production and international. And I think we have, in fact, we have reflected declines in our decreases and our
domestic Army customer's requirements and we're balancing those with international orders. This – it's just that simple.
And that business – so given that balance, and given what they've got in their backlog and given what you're likely to
see in the first quarter in terms of additional backlog, I like that balance. I think that's a diversified and frankly risk
adjusted portfolio.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. And just – I guess what I was alluding to was more the timing aspect. So you – so the
order is coming through for the first quarter that you kind of – it basically sounds like you can already see kind of
offsets that, the pressure that we kind of already understood on the domestic side?

And your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Yes. I think you mentioned earlier that the defense outlook you have is based on the full-year CR.
Now it looks as though the budget for 2013 could be a bit smaller than the CR. How should we think about what
happens if that budget does get passed? And then also it does seem as though the potential of sequestration could hit
may be increasing. How are you thinking about that today? Thank you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: The budget that we see for 2013 we have factored into our plan, and we can sustain that
within the current planning cuts across the portfolio. If they get at the level of sequestration or some of sequestration
and I take a look at 2013 and 2014 and then need to come back and rebalance and reassess our guidance, I will. But I've
got to tell you, even if we've got pretty significant cuts in 2013, we see very, very little impact as y walk through each
of my businesses on the defense side. So absent some, as I mentioned earlier, draconian cuts, we're going to be all right
in 2013.

And your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citigroup. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: I wanted to just focus on Gulfstream for a minute and get a sense of the current demand in
the marketplace both on what you would describe as your lower end as well as the higher end. And maybe just walk us
around the world on how demand is shaping up. And really specifically maybe give us a sense of where we are from a
backlog perspective in number of months, particularly for your large cabin aircraft ex-G650?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Let me preface my answer with giving you some details about our production rates. We're
planning 139 green deliveries, 113 large cabin and 26 mid cabin. And to my point earlier, about the re-base lining of
completions and manufacturing, we're going to – our rates reflect about a 50% increase in outfitted deliveries. So look,
what does that tell you? If you know us, what you know is that we have historically used our production rates to adjust
with respect to our – reflecting our backlog. And that's exactly what we've done here.

Everything that I see in the backlog as well as in our current pipeline makes me very comfortable with those production
rates. We still have demand for our 450, 550, 650. The 280 is coming on strong. And we are well positioned this year.
As I told you, the big issue here is at this moment not about our production rates. And look, if you know us and you
know us over time, and you have watched us over time, if we see a – if something happens and some exogenous factor
happens in the overall economy, we will adjust our production rates and we'll come back at you. But I'm not seeing that
at the moment. This is very realistic and doable.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. And then just specifically on kind of regional demand and how it's shaping up?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so interestingly the largest demand we saw was in our – was in the Fortune 500 as
they're replenishing their fleet. And then I think if you think about the demographics across our portfolio, Asia was
down, not surprisingly. And regarding the details about who makes up what percentage, approximately 30% were from
individuals, 30% from private and 40% from public companies. But one of the things again I like about that backlog
and our order book is that it's balanced. We've got North America. We've got Europe. We've got Middle East, Asia.
And they tend to ebb and flow somewhat counter-cyclically. So one of the very good things that I see is that the
Fortune 500s are back into the market.
