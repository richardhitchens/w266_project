Ursula M. Burns
Good morning and thanks for joining us today. During the second quarter, we delivered results that reflect consistent
progress on our strategy and we improved on the key metrics that shape the future of success of our business. First, our
shift to a services-led growth portfolio is paying off. Services revenue represents 55% of our total revenue, that's up
three points from the end of 2012. It's a grow – it's growing at a steady pace, contributing to an annuities revenue
stream that represent 84% of our total business and grew 1% this quarter. We're taking a disciplined approach to

improving operating margins so that our bottom-line benefits more from top-line growth in services.
In Document Technology, we are effectively managing the business as a profitable, cash-generating operation. We're
maintaining our leadership in Document Technology by holding and growing share. Since the launch of our
ConnectKey platform earlier this year and by offering more advanced color digital presses, we're maximizing our
strength across the business. We're also maximizing our profit by lowering the cost base. Margins trended better this
quarter compared to Q1. All up and all in, we exceeded our EPS guidance for the second quarter and generated strong
cash flow. We're making the decisions to invest in growth and in building shareholder value. I feel good about our
progress through the first half of this year, and I'm confident that we're positioned very well to deliver on our full year
expectations.
Here's a closer look at Q2 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.27. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was
$0.23, which includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles, and as I mentioned, exceeded our guidance.
Revenue of $5.4 billion was up 1%. During the first half of this year, we announced the sale of our North American and
European Paper businesses. So we've moved financial results from these businesses to discontinued operations. Total
revenue growth came from our Services business, which was up 5% in the quarter. Services operating margin improved
sequentially and is in our range of 10% to 12%. Our clients are increasingly expanding their relations – their
partnerships with us to improve the effectiveness of their operations. As a result, we had one of our strongest
year-over-year growth rates in signings and in the absolute TCV of deals. Renewal rate in BPO and ITO was an
impressive 95% and the pipeline is up double digits. So in Services, a solid across the board results.
Revenue from Document Technology came in where we expected, which was down 5%. It's a significant sequential
improvement and reflects a benefit from the full rollout of our ConnectKey platform of printers and multi-function
devices. We also signed and began installing our largest order ever for a fleet of Xerox iGen color presses. It was a
huge win for our graphic communications business and an indicator of the continued strength of our leadership in this
market. Segment margins also improved sequentially in Document Technology coming in at the high-end of our target
range of 9% to 11%. In total, margin came in as expected, up two points sequentially. It's good progress but we have
much more work to do, and we have several initiatives underway that will deliver margin improvement.
Cash from operations was quite strong this quarter, and we are on track to deliver $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in full year
operating cash flow. It was a quarter of steady progress, all the performance improvements aligned very closely with
our growth strategy and resulted in EPS expansion. During quarter two, we also welcomed Kathy Mikells as our new
CFO. She's [ph] a quick study (5:18) and already a strong contributor to our business.
So let me turn it over to Kathy. Then, I'll wrap up and we'll open the call to your questions. Kathy?
Kathryn A. Mikells
Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everybody. I'd characterize Q2 as a very solid performance. Overall, Services
performed in line with our expectation and Document Technology came in a bit better. Our leading indicators were
positive and cash flow was strong. Let's start with a look at overall earnings.
Revenue was up 1% with growth driven by services, which was up 5% or 6% at constant currency. We also had a
positive contribution from equipment sale revenue, which was up 1%, our highest growth since Q3 2011. Our gross
margin of 31.4% was down 120 basis points, driven mainly by mix. The relative growth of our Services segment
naturally dilutes gross margin. We also had some negative impact from business line mix within services and
equipment versus supplies and financing mix within Document Technology. I'll cover this a little bit more when we hit
the segment slides. RD&E and SAG were both lower year-over-year benefiting from productivity initiative as well as
the greater mix of services.
Operating margin trends improved, up 200 basis points sequentially with year-over-year margin contraction slowing to
down 50 basis points versus down 110 basis points in Q1. Margin benefited from greater leverage on higher revenues
as well as productivity improvement. There's clearly more work to do, but we were pleased with the progress that we

made this quarter and we understand what's needed in order to keep up the positive trend.
Adjusted other net of $98 million and equity income of $36 million were both modest contributors year-over-year.
Within adjusted other net, there's $33 million of restructuring, which is in line with our guidance and up slightly
year-over-year. As part of our ongoing productivity action, we anticipate a similar level of restructuring in Q3, which is
fully incorporated into our adjusted earnings guidance. Our tax rate came in at 24%, which is two percentage points
higher year-over-year and below our guidance of 28%. Adjusted EPS of $0.27 was up $0.01 from 2012 and above our
guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25. Relative to guidance, the over-achievement was driven by better operating results as
well as the $0.01 benefit from tax rate below our guidance. So in summary, a relatively clean quarter with good top and
bottom-line results.
Turning now to Services; Services revenue was up 6% overall with BPO up 4%, document outsourcing up 6% and ITO
up 13%. BPO growth of 4% reflects strong growth in healthcare payer and pharma and state government, partially
offset by the elimination and runoff of our government and commercial student loan businesses. Document outsourcing
growth of 6% was above expectations supported by a very strong equipment sales growth as well as partner print
services. Finally, ITO continues to grow at an accelerated rate, driven by the ramp of a couple of mega deals that we
had in 2011. We expect ITO growth to taper off and return to low single digits by the fourth quarter.
Segment margin was 10.2% in Q2, up 90 basis points sequentially and down 40 basis points year-over-year. Margin
was essentially in line with our expectations, reflecting the benefits of productivity initiatives partially offset by the
impact of less rich mix. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, we expect the pressure from weaker mix to
continue with the largest year-over-year impact from the government student loan runoff occurring in the fourth
quarter. Long-term, we're taking a number of actions to improve the mix of our portfolio. We're accelerating
investments to build more scale in competitively advantaged businesses with good secular and macro trends. We're
adding to our suite of capabilities to create more value for our customers, thereby enabling higher margin, and we're
de-emphasizing lower margin and low return niche and non-core businesses.
Turning to our key performance metrics, signings were up 40% year-over-year, and on a trailing 12-month basis, turned
positive for the first time in five quarters. We continue to have shortening contract length and smaller average deal
sizes with no mega deals this quarter. New business ARR and NRR was up 5% year-over-year and we had good
signings contribution across the line of businesses. Our renewal rate was high at 95% and our pipeline grew 10%, all
positive indicators for our future services performance. So solid results from Services, which we expect to continue into
Q3 with revenue growth in the mid-single digit and modest segment margin improvement year-over-year to roughly
10%.
Moving on to Document Technology, our revenue was down 5% this quarter, improving as anticipated from the 9%
decline in Q1. We saw really good pickup in equipment sale revenue year-over-year, which was up 1% for the total
company and down only 2% within Document Technology. This compares favorably to down 11% and 12%
respectively in Q1. The equipment improvement was driven by the success of our recently launched products in
mid-range and high-end and the related strong backlog we had entering Q2. Within mid-range, our recently launched
ConnectKey platform has been very well-received and resulted in 16% growth in installs of mid-range color MFPs.
ConnectKey refers to a software system that's embedded in 16 new multi-functional printers. It provides
industry-leading security, more features for mobile users, as well as the ability to customize the MSP to link into
business processes. High-end also experienced strong growth in both entry and production color, driven by recently
launched products. We feel good about the improving trends in this segment as color continues to become a larger part
of the business and begins to offset the declines in black and white.
Finally, in entry, we continue to see good growth in color A4 MFPs. But in total, this segment was down driven by
weaker results in developing markets as well as OEM sales. Overall, Document Technology margins showed a really
nice recovery from Q1 up 200 basis points, and at 10.8%, it was at the high end of our target range. The year-over-year
decline of 50 basis point was driven by lower supplies and financing mix with price pressure largely offset by cost and
efficiency savings and the modest currency benefit from the weak yen. Looking toward Q3, we're exiting Q2 with a
strong backlog, albeit not as high as Q1, and we expect revenue growth to be down mid-single digits with margins

seasonally lower. So overall, good performance from both Services and Document Technology, which we hope to build
on next quarter.
With that, let's turn to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter. The $533 million in Q2 and
$446 million for the first half compares to $228 million and $213 million respectively for 2012. Free cash flow was
similarly strong at $426 million in Q2 and $232 million for the first half, which compares to a use of $30 million in the
first half of 2012. The Q2 improvement in operating cash flow year-over-year was driven by the following: $105
million was from lower defined benefit pension contribution. For the year, we expect cash pension funding to be about
$170 million lower. So we saw the large part of that benefit in Q2. Working capital was also better this year, driven
largely by accounts payable, which is basically inter-year timing differences. We also saw improvement in other asset
and liability line, which reflects some inter-year timing as well as lower required services investment. Partially
offsetting those positives was a lower source of cash from finance receivables, which was expected given the $600
million of finance receivables that we sold last year.
Moving down to the cash flow report, investing from cash flows was a use of $167 million in the quarter. We spent
$107 million on CapEx and $81 million on acquisition. Cash from financing was a use of $427 million and included the
retirement of our $400 million senior note in May as well as $72 million of common dividends, which reflects the 35%
increase in the dividend earlier this year. Given the timing of cash flows and the note repayment, we didn't repurchase
shares during the quarter. However, we continue to plan on repurchasing at least $400 million worth for the year. Given
our first half cash flow and the historical cash flow seasonality of the business, we're very well-positioned to hit our full
year operating cash flow guidance range of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion.
Moving to the next slide, I'll walk through our capital structure and capital allocation plan. With the $400 million May
senior note repayment, we ended the quarter with $8.1 billion of debt, which is down $400 million from the beginning
of the year. Applying the 7 to 1 leverage on financing asset, our allocated financing debt is $4.9 billion leaving core
debt of $3.2 billion. This debt reduction satisfies our minimum target for the year. We continue to expect $1.6 billion to
$1.9 billion of free cash flow and our capital allocation plan, including the debt reduction that I just talked about,
remain the same as follows.
Share repurchases. We continue to view Xerox's shares as an attractive investment, and we plan to repurchase at least
$400 million worth of shares this year.
Acquisition. Through the first half, we spent $134 million on acquisition, and we anticipate doing between $300
million and $500 million. Our pace of services acquisitions has been slower than planned, which puts a bit of a damper
on services revenue. So this continues to be an area that we're focused on. I feel good about the quality of deals in our
pipeline, but I believe it's really important that we remain disciplined in targeting businesses that are a really good fit
and at reasonable valuation.
And finally, dividends will be a use of about $300 million of cash, which factors in the Q1 quarterly dividend increase
to $0.0575 per share.
You can see our capital allocation plans are on track and we remain committed to using our strong free cash flow to
deliver value to our shareholders.
So before I hand it back to Ursula, I just thought I take a minute to give you my perspective on the business with three
months now under my belt. One of the reasons that I took this job was my perception of the tremendous opportunity
that Xerox has in front of it.
In Document Technology, we face a growth-pressured competitive industry. That said, the industry is very profitable
and we have a good track record of maintaining our advantage position and maximizing returns.
In Services, there's been significant work done to address cost and execution issues as well as evaluating our portfolio
of businesses to shape our business for the future. So I feel like we're in a reasonably good place today. We understand
our strength and our weaknesses and the work in front of us to further transform Xerox. I'm really happy to be on board
and you can count on me playing an active role to ensure Xerox is a success.

And with that, back over to you, Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks, Kathy, and here's a quick wrap-up. We saw a good improvement in Q2 and I am very pleased with how the
fundamentals of our business are performing. We delivered steady Services growth, improving trends in Document
Technology, margins in line with expectations, and strong cash flow.
That said, our business is still transforming, and we are planning for additional restructuring during the balance of the
year to create a leaner, more effectible business model. At the same time, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to
our capital allocation, investing in future growth and continuing our share repurchase program; high priorities as we
build a sustainably successful business.
Concerning our first half results, there may have been an expectation that we'd raise our full year guidance. However,
as I mentioned, we're planning for additional restructuring in the second half of this year. We believe that we'll face
other headwinds, including a higher tax rate. So we are taking a prudent approach to 2013 guidance. For third quarter,
we expect adjusted EPS of $0.24 to $0.26 per share. This includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring. And we
continue to expect full year adjusted EPS in the range of $1.09 to $1.15. By growing revenue, improving margins, and
controlling costs, we're confident that we'll consistently expand earnings per share and generate strong cash.
That's a good place for me to end. But before we open it up for questions, let me turn it over to Jim Lesko, who is the
Head of our Investor Relations.
James H. Lesko
Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today are Lynn Blodgett, Head of Xerox Services; and Armando Zagalo de
Lima, Head of our Document Technology business. Also let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at
the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared
remarks. In the Q&A, I ask participants to limit yourselves to one follow-on question, so we can get to everyone. At the
end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.
Operator, please open the lines for questions now.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Barclays.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yeah, thanks a lot. I think you said that for the year you're thinking Services margins of 10%,
and I think that's at the low-end of your range. And if you can just confirm that for the year that you think Services
margins will be in that range? And when do you think you can at least get to a 11% and maybe the higher end of the
range now based on these new restructuring actions? Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure, this is Kathy. So when we look at Services margin, if you look through the first half
of the year, year-over-year, we're down about 20 basis points. And so as we look at back half of the year, clearly, we're
targeting to make that up. On a year-over-year basis, I'd say, we're still thriving – striving to try and be up a little bit
year-over-year. Clearly, in the third quarter, we have an easier compare and we will be up year-over-year and we're
looking to maximize that benefit. But overall, if you look at the range for this year of 10% to 12%, we'll be at the
low-end of the range still targeting to try and get a little bit of improvement year-over-year.

And as you look forward to the different things that we're doing to really try and improve overall margin performance, I
talked a little bit about the fact that we're focused overall on our portfolio and making sure that we're putting resources
where we have advantaged businesses with good tailwinds and we bring good competitive advantage to the table.
We're building additional capabilities, so pointing to things like the acquisition of WDS. We did a couple small
acquisitions this quarter, Customer Value Group as well as an e-learning based acquisition. Those things are both in
areas where we have good margins and we're building capabilities to add additional value that we bring to our
customers. We've also talked a little bit about the fact that we're continuing to look at offshoring and I'll call it
right-shoring even within here in the U.S. where we do work to get a better balance and a little bit lower cost of labor
overall, and that work continues. So we have a number of different things underway. Clearly, those things aren't going
to take us to the higher end of the range overnight, it's going to take us a couple of years to get there, but we're very
confident that we're on the right path and we're confident with our overall guidance for the year.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Okay. So you said it's – that was my follow-up, is it – it's take – it's a couple of years to get to
the higher end of the range or the middle of the range? I mean you don't give guidance for next year, but I think
everybody on the call would probably like to see it at least go up a point next year?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. We will give next year's guidance at our Investor Conference in November. So I
think I gave you a little bit of color about what we're working on and we'll give you more about 2014 when we get to
November.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Ben. If we can have the next question, please?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Can you talk a little bit about the technology business in terms of the
strength in equipment sales? Obviously, you had the backlog going into the quarter, I'm curious as to sort of linearity
during the quarter, and then if you can talk at all about sort of geographic areas of strength and weakness?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, we saw the improvement in Document Technology throughout the quarter. As you
recall, we exited Q1 with a strong backlog and we started to benefit from that backlog immediately throughout the
quarter, even at the tail-end of quarter one. And we're pleased with that. We expected that to happen and it actually
delivered as we expected. From a geographic perspective, I would say, you should expect – you should – we can
characterize it as pretty much the same. So we continue to see a weak but steady U.S. environment. We see Europe
weak but not weakening, and our developing economies are pretty much – they slowed a bit, but they're the strongest of
the three. We did see a bit of a slowdown in Russia. We started to see that in Q1 and it continued in Q2, but we're
managing that. So geographies are like that. The high-end of our business, particularly in U.S. but – even in Europe, the
high-end of our business is doing very well. So we're seeing that strength with new products and just good focus on the
business and good competitive win. So...
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: ...from a line of business, that's where we see the improvement.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. And then, I was curious, Kathy, when you think about mix of revenue, how are
you thinking about balancing it from a margin perspective, especially in services, because obviously, ITO is a lower
margin sale? I mean are you putting in place, I don't know, programs with the sales force to, what have you, to make
sure that if you sign a BPO program, then you can maybe do a little more ITO, or how can we kind of stabilize some of
the margin there and maybe just even in the overall portfolio?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. So I'm going to take that a little bit in two chunks. I am a big believer that at the end
of the day, we create mix; mix doesn't just happen to us. Obviously, changing mix kind of takes a little bit of time. If
you look overall at ITO, yes, the growth has been a little bit higher there. That's coming from things that we signed in

2011 that we've just continued to implement and as a result, we've seen that pick up. ITO is a place where we're not a
huge player in the market. We really participate there, I think, very selectively and we're pretty disciplined in terms of
what we go after. So as we look at the overall portfolio of business, we're really focused on putting our resources and
energy most in the areas where we bring competitive advantage to the table, we bring scale to the table, we bring
capability to the table. We can move up the margin chain by penetrating and radiating at customers and that's where
we're really focused over the long-term.
I'd also tell you tactically, right; we're doing better blocking and tackling. I think when we talk about our confidence in
terms of overall services revenues – I'm sorry, margins, we're really seeing that and that's work that's got to continue.
And so day-in and day-out, making sure that we're doing everything we can both to reduce costs and to execute well
because we know, especially on these larger contracts, if it takes us too long to stand them up, then we see margin
pressure. So those are all the different things we're working on.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. Thank you.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. On BPO specifically, what factors should we think about to potentially see
some acceleration in growth here over time? Is it simply a matter of getting past this student loan program running off
at – by 4Q? Is it highly dependent on your picking up the pace of acquisitions? I mean how should we think about some
of those factors?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Good question, Bill. I think that there are two things, I'll start and then I'll have Kathy or
Lynn comment. Clearly, we have to pick up the pace of acquisitions. Without those acquisitions, we'll probably hover
in the mid-range of the guidance that we give, the low mid-single-digit revenue growth So we are focused on
acquisitions. We haven't not been looking. The good news is that we have been looking, but we are being very
disciplined on both capabilities that we get but also price that we're willing to pay, particularly in this kind of turbulent
environment. So we'll get them. Kathy's focused on it; Lynn is focused on it; we'll get them.
The second thing which you mentioned which is important is this student loan runoff. It is a big piece of the portfolio.
We – by the way, it's not new news; we knew it was coming. It's a hurdle that we have to overcome. It's very profitable.
At the tail end of this deal, the profitability is very high. And so we're going to have to manage our way over that,
through that hurdle and after we get through the compares on that, clearly, we'll see a growth in revenue and in
profitability just because we won't have the negative on a sequential basis – sorry, on a year-over-year basis, because
we won't have that negative compare to headwind for us. So those two things are important. But why don't Lynn
actually say a little bit more?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah, I think, as Ursula said, the acquisitions are really important to us. We're looking at – as
we determine whether or not to do an acquisition, we're evaluating its benefit from a geographic standpoint; so does it
expand, does it further our global strategy, does it meet our requirement in terms of higher margin services like data
analytics. And so we're being careful and making sure that the acquisitions move us forward in those areas. And in
terms of other growth and margin expansion, healthcare is an area of focus for us. It typically – after we get deals up
and running, those, they tend to be healthy margin businesses; transportation, we had good activity in state and local
last quarter, and those are all areas that, over the long-haul, will increase margins.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: And then just as a follow-up on the student loan issue, I want to make sure I fully understood
this. I believe you said that the pressure on the margins is most intense in the fourth quarter. So is that the case? And
could you clarify how material that is and how we should factor that into how we think about the margin path from the
third to the fourth quarter?

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Sure. So, yeah, you heard us right. Overall, the margin impact has more year-over-year
impact in the fourth quarter. But overall, for the full year, let's call it, 35 basis points to 40 basis points in negative
margin impact with that being a little bit heavier in the fourth quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, guys. Thank you. Could you talk – you mentioned bookings and pipeline. Could you
talk a little bit about how you're thinking about bookings growth in the second half of the year?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah. We expect that we had a good – we felt good about the bookings in the second quarter.
We think third quarter are going to be strong. They'll probably not be – we expect them to not be quite as strong as they
were in the second quarter, but we expect healthy bookings to continue. Renewal rates were very high and that was –
that effectively has the same kind of impact as a good booking quarter, and the fact that renewals were high, we'd
expect that to return back more into the normal range of our 85% to 90% for the second half. So...
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Lynn, would you expect bookings to be up 5%, 10% any kind of – I'm not expecting, I don't
think any investors are expecting a sustained 40% year-over-year growth, but will they have 5%, 10% kind of
year-over-year growth as we look at the second half? Any kind of calibration?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: I think that's a reasonable range.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. And then, Kathy, maybe for you, on the Technology margins, could you give a little
color there? I would have expected technology margins to be a little bit stronger than I think you characterized, given
the yen, number one. And then number two, I would assume that mix tilts a little bit more in your favor. You had a lot
of equipment that you did this quarter. I would assume that supplies and other kicks up a little bit in the second half of
the year. But maybe just kind of revisit why Technology margins – what you think the puts and takes there, and what
investors should expect in the second half of the calendar year. Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. So I would actually start by saying, I was pretty pleased with where the technology
margins came out, I mean 200 basis point sequential improvement. So overall relative to what our expectations were, I
feel like the technology segment performed quite well in the quarter. So as I look towards the back half of the year,
clearly on a full-year basis, in 2012, we beat the range that we provide for Technology. So we have tough
year-over-year compares. We didn't have the kind of product introductions last year that we had this year. Obviously,
that takes a fair amount of investment on our part, and kind of priming the pump as we're launching those things. So we
have tougher compares. I expect seasonally to be a little bit lower kind of Q3 relative to Q2, but overall, I was pretty
pleased with the performance.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: But how should we be thinking about the change though, Kathy, year-over-year just if we
look at calendar year 2012?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: If you look, we have exactly the same compare in Technology as we produced in 2Q, and
so I'd say, we expect to be seasonally a little bit weaker, which is what we would typically see.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Keith. If we can have our next question, please?

<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hey. Thanks, guys, for taking the question and congrats on a really solid quarter across the
board.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Yeah, hey, Ursula and Kathy, should we think of the core business operations tracking a
little ahead of the original guidance at this point? I can appreciate kind of the restructuring remarks for the second half
of the year and not sort of – as a reason not to raise the overall guidance. But it seems like you're tracking ahead from
cooperations offset a little bit. From the restructuring, there's numerous operational positives and not many operational
headwinds, and you get some [indiscernible] (36:09) benefits second half. And then I guess – and then I have a
follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, I think that you should look at the quarter not for the quarter but combine it with the
first quarter and look at the half. And I think that we would – I would not characterize that as operating ahead. I think
we're kind of operating on where we expected to be when you average the half. We caught up in Document
Technology. We actually expanded our margins in Services. We stabilized revenue, and revenue came in on average
basis where we would have expected it to, which is in our range of flat to 2% up.
So I think that you can look at it as the first half being kind of what we would've liked to have happened. We did a little
bit more in the second quarter than we did in the first to average out well. For the rest of the year, I think you should
look at us continuing that disciplined pace. Quarter three will be weaker in margin, it generally is. Quarter four will be
a little bit weaker in revenue because we have some compares to come over in Services. But I think on average, the
second half will come out pretty much like the first half, and it's easier and better to look at it on a half basis than it is
on a quarter basis. Anything else, Kathy?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. All I'd add to that is, we feel really good about the middle of the range of the EPS
guidance that we provided. Obviously, we'd like to come in better than that. We've only got six months under our belt. I
think when I look at all that gives and takes, we're being very prudent.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Great. Thanks. That's really helpful. And then my follow-up is just on share repurchase
potential for the second half of the year. The guidance – you have a greater sign in front of the $400 million, but it
seems like you could have significant upside potential, depending on how the second half of the year comes in. So I
just wanted to get a sense of how aggressive you might be willing to get if you don't get the acquisitions come in at the
lower end of the $300 million to $500 million. Yeah, I think you had a couple hundred millions of unallocated dollars
entering the year as well. Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. So, yeah, I think everything that you said was correct, right? You started within if
the second half of the year comes in because we are a second half of the year cash flow producer. We clearly started out
by saying we expected to do at least $400 million worth of share repurchases for the year. Cash flow comes in better
than that we would certainly be looking to do more. We continue to look at our overall share price and feel like that's a
good place for us to put capital, clearly looking to drive value for shareholders. But at the end of the day, we are a back
half of the year cash flow producer. But at this point, I feel really good about our overall cash flow guidance for the
year.

capital allocation and the focus on acquisitions. So, Kathy, how should we think about, over the next year or so – you

try to focus on the better performing assets. And I guess the question is really around the cost savings. How will they be

redeployed and if you kind of give us a sense in terms of apportionments toward acquisitions versus increased stock
buyback versus growing the dividend versus just dropping to the bottom-line?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. So that was a lot. I'll try and piece that apart a little bit. I'm going to start with
acquisitions. Look, we said we desire to do kind of $300 million to $500 million clearly through the first half, we're
tracking at the low-end of that. We'd like to see more, but they have to be good deals, right? I mean we're disciplined.
They've got to stick with our portfolio. They've got to be strategically aligned, places where we think we're going to get
good synergies. So at the end of the day, valuation also matters and this is a little bit hard for us to predict.
When you take that into consideration and look overall in terms of our cash flow production so far, and we're very
comfortable with the guidance that we've provided, cash flow comes in well. We're very happy to do more than the
$400 million worth of share repurchases. If you – we talked a little bit then about restructuring. I think clearly, we
pointed to both within the technology business and within the services business the need for us to continue to work on
productivity and efficiencies. That's what the restructuring dollars are targeted toward. I talked a little bit about what
we referred to as Project Compete and making sure that in the services business, we've got kind of people where they're
optimized from a labor cost perspective, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. We did a little bit of restructuring this
quarter. I'd certainly like to see us do and expect that we will do more during the remainder of the year. So I look at that
as really looking at kind of our overall income statement kind of core operating results and wanting to reinvest a
portion of that to make sure that we're continuing to get the restructuring we need, to get the productivity that we need.
And certainly, that's absolutely the case on the technology side of the business and expect it will continue to be that
case over time.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: And just a follow-up for Lynn. Lynn, can you talk about the conversion rate? Obviously,
the signings are starting to show some signs of life again. But just kind of curious if you can give us your kind of view
in what you're seeing with respect to re-scoping or focusing back to kind of negotiate the cost takedowns with deals
that were signed previously. Are you seeing any sort of headwind there? Or is it we're actually seeing better
improvement in terms of full conversion?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: I think that the phenomena that we saw year and a half, two years ago where people were
coming back and renegotiating out of cycle. We haven't – that – there's always some level of that, but I would say not
as much as we saw a couple of years ago. The ramp, as far as – the ramp-up proportions are pretty typical. And we're
seeing the first year contribution from bookings is pretty consistent. One of the things that should actually work in our
favor is that in the bookings, we haven't seen – haven't signed any big Medicaid deals, and Medicaid deals typically
ramp slower. So those were things that negatively impact. So I would say to that extent, we're going to see a little better
ramp-up.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you, Lynn.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Mark. If we can have the next question, please?

<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Good morning. Great job on the quarter and welcome to Xerox, Kathy.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Thanks so much.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: So Services signings this quarter were up an impressive 40% after being up 64% in the first
quarter. How do you see this translating into revenue performance in the second half of the year, especially factoring in
the expected deceleration in ITO growth and student loan run-off?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Well, as Kathy said, the headwinds that we're facing, as she just pointed out, in ITO, we're
lapping the ramp-up of those mega deals that we signed in 2011. They're performing very well. So we're really happy
with it. But as we said on the last call, we have not seen the kind of mega deals that we would like to see whereas

bookings are positive with that, but we're seeing a smaller deal that tend to ramp quicker. So those things are positive. I
think the other headwind, as Ursula pointed out, was the student loan run-off. And so those things are not trivial. And
we're in this – those run-offs tend to be more light-switch. When you lap a contract, it's a – you see that impact
immediately. And the student loan thing that will be a bit of a light-switch that we'll see at the end of the year. So the
ramp-up of the new bookings will feather in whereas those are things that tend to drop off more quickly. So that's why
we're being careful in terms of our revenue guidance for the second half. Even though bookings are strong, we're
pleased with that.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: That's helpful. And as a follow-up, can you give us a bridge of what actions will drive
additional sequential margin expansion in the Services business this year, particularly given the negative impact from
mix that you're seeing?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Look, I think we talked a little bit about those already. So we're acknowledging the
negative impact of mix. We obviously knew about that at the beginning of the year. So while we're pointing it out, just
so you understand the year-over-year compares, we're not suggesting, as a result of that, that we're not confident in
getting to our full year guidance in terms of overall margins there. We had an easier year-over-year compare there for
the third quarter and so we talked about the fact that we obviously have an expectation, given that easy compare that
we're going to see favorable year-over-year there. And really, I'd say, execution and continuing to really work at getting
costs down, getting G&A costs in the near-term are things we're very focused on in ensuring that we're going to hit the
guidance that we just talked about.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So there's some tactics which we are well into. You've heard about us talk about Project
Compete, it's all about cost management tactically. And then more strategically, it is about driving advantaged positions
in places in the portfolio and being a little bit more directive or selective about where we want to grow our revenue. So
that – and that takes a little bit longer to do. You can do that incrementally. So that gives us – the short-term gives us
confidence that we'll get in the 10% to 12% range at the lower end, and the longer term gives us a little bit more
confidence that we'll be able to get to the higher end of the range, and that's how we're managing the business.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: I think, too, Ursula, if I can add, the – we've done a lot of work over the last 18 months or
year to 18 months on the portfolio in terms of areas that we should exit, businesses that we should look at that don't fit
our long-term growth profiles or margin profiles. And so over time, as Ursula said, you'll see us doing some work in
that area, which will help as far as margin.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, George. If we can have the next question, please?

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. Just a couple of questions. First of all, just any comments you have maybe on
the technology side and the pricing environment and where we are on supplies and channel inventories would be
helpful. And then maybe a broad question for Lynn and Ursula. It's been a few years now since ACS and, I guess, can
you speak about the tangible revenue synergies that exists between technology and Services? Maybe if you can give
some examples of wins you've had over the last year where it's really coming together. Is there more that you can do
here so that in aggregate, you could get both businesses growing one day? Or is that just not the way you see it? Many
thanks.
<A - Armando Zagalo de Lima>: Okay. So this is Armando. So on the pricing side, we don't see a consistent
degradation of pricing in the marketplace in this moment. You always see the odd case particularly in mega deals
where competitors can become very aggressive but generically speaking, we don't see any consistent degradation there.
So in terms of inventory in the channel, there is no benefit that we have had in quarter two from an increase of channel
inventory. In fact, we are managing to reduce the level of inventories in the channel just as a way to manage our
relationship with the channel in a more healthy way.

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And as far as revenue synergies go, some of the tangible examples, I won't give any customer
names. I'll give more segments that we've seen this. Most of the synergies that are clear come in our Document
Outsourcing-ITO combination space, which is a space that we're trying to leverage even more as we go forward in both
office equipment distribution market, in the personal care company market and in the telecom space are places that we
are seeing the most leverage from the relationship between Xerox and the old ACS and in ITO and Document
Outsourcing. That leveraged together is helping us – our position. The other place that we're seeing it is literally in just
our brand carrying forward – our brand and technology carrying forward the ACS offers. This is a big deal and it's kind
of sprinkled everywhere. Our engagement with the C-suite is fuller and more impactful across the board when we go
together with our full suite of offers. We see that in the United States, and we're clearly seeing that in our expansion
outside of the U.S., in Europe as well. We're using our infrastructure, using our reach from a client perspective, and our
brand name is helping this expansion.
So if you look at our revenue growth in Services, you'll see that prior to the AC – on average, prior to the acquisition,
they were operating in a certain space, not immediately prior to the acquisition, but on average, prior to it. And we've
stepped it up by at least two points. So I think that it's clear that we're seeing that in our – the – our Document
Outsourcing business is also doing better across the board. So I think that that's where we see the synergies coming
through – the revenue synergies coming through. We're not at the end of this at all, by the way. The place that we're
focusing a lot, I think both Kathy and Lynn spoke about it is, we have a particular focus on geographic expansion. And
that geographic expansion would be almost impossible without the background on the backbone of our Xerox
Corporation infrastructure, so that's helping us as well.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: I think that if you look at ITO, that continues to have such good growth. The main driver of
the growth in ITO are the mega deals that we've referenced multiple times. And those are deals that have occurred
precisely for the reason that Ursula described. And I think we would – I'm thinking of the two biggest deals, we just
would not have played in those deals prior to the – having the Xerox brand and Xerox footprint globally. So it's helped
us in ITO, areas like finance and accounting, we don't, you know, we don't talk a lot about finance and accounting. It's
just one of those businesses that runs, has strong growth. And most of the deals that we sign in that area are possible
because of the relationship that the Xerox brand and the footprint and the infrastructure there.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I'd say finance and accounting and HR are the two places – are additional two places besides
ITO.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about R&D. If I look at first half R&D, it looks like it
was about 9% versus last year. And if you compare versus 2010, looks like your R&D budget will be down about 20%
to 25%. Couple questions on the back of that. First, are you investing enough to maintain your competitiveness from an
R&D standpoint in the core technology business? And secondly, are you effectively becoming more dependent on
acquisitions for the development of your IP base in your Services offerings on a go-forward basis?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So the answer to the – so let me answer the questions into two pieces. From a R&D
perspective in the technology space, I think you have to look at it in the aggregate of what we invest in R&D here, what
we invest in R&D in our – with our partner in Japan, Fuji Xerox, and the acquisition that remain of the liquid ink
company, Impika. And that a lot – so that shows up not as R&D, it shows up as an acquisition which will augment with
our R&D. So you put those three things together, I would actually say we're not under-spending at all in R&D from the
technology perspective. We're doing it a little differently. So we took a point in time to actually augment with Impika,
but we're actually now pouring forward the appropriate level of research and development to be sure that we can

continue to expand the capabilities that we have in the markets that are growing. So that's one point.
From a Services perspective, the R&D is just different. It's not that – it requires less – some of the R&D that we would
normally see in a – from a technology company gets into deal – buildup in the deal structure, and we then platform that
and start to work on that platform from an R&D perspective. So it doesn't show up the same way. I do not believe at all
that we are under spending in R&D. We're continuing to be more effective, more efficient, all that stuff. And I keep a
really keen eye to assure that we have the right level of investment in this space. It's not something I take lightly at all.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Okay. Thanks for that. And to follow up, I wanted to get a sense on the bookings trend.
The bookings – reported bookings number was quite strong. Can you delineate the trend of new business contracts or
new wins or incremental business versus renewals for first half? And how is that – and where have you been seeing
success in terms of new customers and new wins? Thanks a lot.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I'll start with the overall, and then I'll get to whoever, Kathy or Lynn, both of you can talk a
little bit on. New business signings were strong. New business – so we saw total signings up 40%, new business
signings were up as well. We don't give you the exact number, but they were strong. 6%, I gave you the number just
now, so we can get 6%. And our ARR and NRR from deals is also up. So across the board, we're seeing stock – future
revenue participation from all of the areas that it should from renewals, from new business, from NRR deals. So across
the board we're seeing strength.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah. And when you look at the – when we report NRR and ARR, those are all – that's all
new business. And then when we talk about renewals, that's the renewal business. So let's – so we try to give you color
in both those areas.
<A - James H. Lesko>: We have time for one last question.
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you very much. And I'll squeeze in the last question here, which is kind of a bigger strategy
question down the road. When we have the Obama healthcare item kind of on the horizon, Ursula, can you let us know
how you and your team are approaching that? What are the opportunities there? What are the costs? I assume that could
result in tremendous more processing. So I don't know as far as pricing and opportunity, does this disrupt other things.
Is it all incremental? Do you have to start reinvesting early ahead of it? Can you just kind of help us, as CEO, how
you're viewing the Obamacare and the impact potential for Xerox?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah. I think that healthcare in general, payer, provider, government, infrastructure is an
opportunity, almost across the board in just about every way you can think about it. And very specifically, Obamacare
is one – it's definitely going to be an opportunity, primarily because it get – it's forcing state governments to actually
pay attention to this line item, to this portion of their budget. And they have to actually step back and think about what
path forward they want to have. It turns out that not every state is going to – is going for the same way, and that's one
of the things that we learn is that we have to actually manage it state-by-state. Some people stand – some states are
standing back and just waiting and doing nothing but having lost conversations with us about what other states are
doing and how we can help them. Some states are going really fast, and when they're going really fast, we engage in
just about every piece of that infrastructure in looking at what they did in the past and providing data analytics, and
we're actually standing up with solutions for them. So across the board, it's an opportunity. We have to be careful
because I think what most people would've expected then on Obamacare passes that everyone's going to be running
towards a fixed solution. We're not finding that at all. Lynn, put more color on it.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah. I think that, of course, MMIS, the Medicaid systems are still fundamental to the
healthcare system, exchanges we play in the insurance exchanges, and that's an area, as Ursula said, we're seeing the
different states take. Some are standing pat, some are moving forward. But that's an area – a very important area and
we play there. We're seeing the transition from fee-for-service to managed care, and that is a very important change

because it affects the payers, Medicaid and the private payers, and it also affects the providers significantly. We're
seeing a real – an interesting sort of melding of both the private payer and the government payers where the big private
payers are playing now and part of playing with the government and Medicaid contract. Fraud and abuse is a huge area.
It's – we love it because we are the – we have so much transactional data. We're the holders of that transactional data
and adding analytics to that data to determine fraud and abuse, for example, is a tremendous value to the – to our
customers and it's an opportunity for us to capitalize on high-margin work. So an awful lot going on there and, as
Ursula said, some of it's easy to see and some of it, we're having to just be careful and be conservative a little bit in
what we do.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And we're definitely doubling down in this area. I mean it's no – it's not an area that we can
invest in that we have any capability and that we're pulling back. This is a space that we're going after pretty
aggressively. We – as Lynn said, it's fraught with risk but that's what we do for a living. We try to manage that well and
we've got the abilities to do well. We are across the board payers, providers and lots of information. So we're using that
as a leverage point for us. Thanks for the question.
James H. Lesko
Okay. That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for interest and, Ursula, anything more to wrap up,
please?
Ursula M. Burns
Yeah. We covered a lot of ground today, so let me bring it up several levels. Q2 results and our continued focus are
creating – are centered on effectively implementing a sound and consistent strategy. So let me remind you what that is.
First, it's Services-led growth: BPO, ITO, Document Outsourcing. Profitable leadership with – from Document
Technology, investing where the markets have investment growth potential; cash generating annuity-based business
model; consistent EPS expansion; and financial strength to invest in building value for Xerox and in building value for
you.
James H. Lesko
Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. If you have further questions, please contact me or any member of our
Investor Relations team. Thank you. Have a good day.
