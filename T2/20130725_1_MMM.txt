MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the 3M second quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is
being recorded, Thursday, July 25, 2013. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of
Investor Relations at 3M.
Matthew Ginter
Thank you and good morning. With me here today are Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief
Executive Officer; and David Meline, our Chief Financial Officer. Welcome to our second quarter business review.
Note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on our Investor Relations
website at 3m.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.
Before we begin I'd like to mention a few calendar items. We will announce our third quarter earnings on Thursday,
October 24, and our fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, January 30. In addition, we'll host an investor meeting on the
afternoon of Tuesday, December 17, at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in midtown Manhattan. And for calendar purposes please
plan on 1 to 5 p.m. on that day.
If you turn to slide number 2, during today's conference call we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our
current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions
and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists
some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.

Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for today's call.
Second quarter was another good one for 3M. We continued to grow our sales, profits and free cash flow in the face of
a continued slow growth economy and a strong U.S. dollar. Sales grew 3% year-on-year to $7.8 billion, an all-time
record for any quarter in 3M's history. Organic local currency growth was 2.3% in the quarter with Health Care leading
the way at 6%. Industrial and Consumer each grew 3% and Safety & Graphics grew 2%. In Electronics & Energy sales
declined 2% on an organic local currency basis.
As I told you in each of the last two quarters we expected a challenging Consumer electronics market in the first half of
2013 and our prediction was correct. We continue to anticipate some recovery in the second half of 2013 in this
business.
Geographically, Latin America-Canada led the way with organic growth of 9%. Asia-Pacific and Europe-Middle
East-Africa each grew 2% and the United States was up 1%. Currency impacts reduced worldwide sales by 1.3%
impacted by the weak Japanese yen. Acquisitions added nearly two points to second quarter growth.
Second quarter operating margins were strong at 22% on a GAAP basis or 22.4% adjusted for recent acquisitions.
Earnings was $1.71 per share, up 3% versus second quarter of 2012. Free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion, a
second quarter record for 3M and we converted 107% of net income to cash.
Finally, in the quarter we returned $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, a step up
versus recent quarters. David will have more to say on this in the moment.
Entering 2013, we anticipated slow market growth in the first half of the year and that is how it played out. I am
pleased with our performance especially given this backdrop. We also expected a second half recovery based on
improving macroeconomic trends and a recovery in the Consumer electronics. This remains our view today.
Please turn the slide number 4. Looking at full year guidance we are maintaining our previous expected earnings range
of $6.60 to $6.85 per share and organic local currency sales growth of 2% to 5%. We now expect the currency impacts
will reduce sales for the year by 2% versus our prior expected reduction of 1.5%. Acquisitions should add about 1.5%
to sales for the year.
As for the 2013 tax rate we now anticipate the range of 29% to 29.5% versus the previous range of 29.5% to 30%. And
we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100% for 2013.
Now I turn the call over to David for details on the quarter.
David W. Meline
Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with slide number 5 where I will break down the second quarter change in sales.
We generated organic local currency growth of 2.3% amidst a continuing challenging economy. Volumes contributed
1.7% to our growth and selling prices increased 0.6%. Acquisitions added 1.9 points to sales growth in the quarter, the
majority of which came from Ceradyne which was acquired by our Industrial business in last year's fourth quarter.
Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 1.3 percentage points in the second quarter largely due to a 20%
year-on-year decline in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. In dollar terms worldwide sales grew 3% versus the
second quarter of 2012.
On a geographic basis, Latin America-Canada led the way again this quarter with organic local currency growth of
8.5%. All five of our businesses posted positive growth in this region led by a double digit result in Health Care.
Organic local currency growth in Asia-Pacific was 2.2% in the second quarter with Health Care again up double digits.
Safety and graphics also had a nice growth in the quarter. China-Hong Kong grew 3.4% organically in Q2 and Japan
declined 2.3% year-on-year.

In EMEA, or the combined Europe, Middle East, and Africa second quarter sales increased 1.9% on an organic local
currency basis. Four of five businesses posted positive growth led by Health Care and Industrial. On a sub EMEA level
we achieved double digit organic growth in Middle East-Africa and single digit growth in Central East Europe. And
organic growth turned positive in West Europe in the second quarter which was encouraging to see after several down
quarters.
In the United States, organic local currency growth was 0.8%. Growth was positive in our Health Care, Industrial and
Consumer businesses and declined in Electronics & Energy and in Safety & Graphics.
Let's move to the income statement. Please turn the slide number 6. Second quarter sales were $7.8 billion, up 3% in
dollar terms. Our gross profit percentage was 48.3%, down 30 basis points versus the second quarter of 2012.
Investments in SG&A and R&D both increased 5% year-on-year. Operating income was $1.7 billion, down 1.5%.
Operating margins were 22%, down 90 basis points versus last year's strong Q2 result. Included new this quarter's
results was a 40 basis point headwind from acquisition therefore underlying Q2 margins were 22.4%. Profit leverage on
organic volume growth added 20 basis points to second quarter operating margins and the combination of lower raw
material costs and higher selling prices added 80 basis points. In addition, lower year-on-year pension and OPEB
expense added 10 basis points to second quarter margins.
Factory utilization reduce margins by 50 basis points, an improvement versus the first quarter and largely in line with
our expectations. Strategic investments impacted margins by 40 basis points. This represents our ERP and business
transformation effort along with more R&D aimed at disruptive innovation. Both will strengthen 3M for the future.
Finally, the combination of foreign-exchange impacts, the recently enacted Medical Device Tax in the U.S. and other
factors reduce margins by 70 basis points year-on-year.
Second quarter earnings were $1.71 per share, up 3% versus the second quarter of 2012. The second quarter tax rate
improved to 27.4% versus 30.1% last year which added $0.06 to earnings and foreign-exchange impacts reduced
second quarter earnings by $0.02 per share.
Now let's turn to cash flow. Turn to slide number 7. Second quarter operating cash flow rose by $290 million
year-on-year or 21% to $1.7 billion. The increase was due primarily to lower pension and OPEB contributions along
with improved working capital. We invested $394 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter, up $36
million versus the second quarter of last year. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range
of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Free cash flow rose by $254 million or 25% to $1.3 billion. Free cash flow conversion
was 107% in Q2, a 19 point improvement versus the second quarter of 2012 and we continue to expect conversion of
90% to 100% for the full year.
Cash dividends paid were $436 million in the second quarter, up $26 million year-on-year. As reminder, we increased
the per share dividend by 8% this past February. This marks 55 consecutive years of dividend increases and the
company has now paid a cash dividend for 96 consecutive years.
Gross share repurchases were $1.2 billion in the quarter, up $551 million compared to Q2 of 2012 and as Inge
mentioned, a step up versus recent quarters. We now anticipate a range of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion of gross
repurchases for the full year 2013 versus a prior expectation of $2 billion to $3 billion.
We are increasing this range for a few reasons: one, our business is operating well and generating substantial free cash
flow, which we expect will continue. Two, rising interest rates are positively impacting our already well-funded
pension status. Three, we did not close any new acquisitions in the first half of 2013. And finally, our capital structure
is already strong today and we do not intend to strengthen it further.
Let's review in more depth our second quarter performance on a business by business basis starting with Industrial.
Please go to slide number 8. Second quarter sales were $2.7 billion in Industrial, up 3.3% on an organic local currency
basis. Growth was strongest in the aerospace and automotive aftermarket businesses followed by liquid filtration,
industrial adhesives and tapes and automotive OEM.

Sales in Industrial grew organically in all major geographic regions with Latin America-Canada up 9%, the U.S. and
EMEA up 3% and APAC up 2%.
In November of 2012 we acquired Ceradyne Inc., one of the leading ceramics companies in the world. Ceradyne sales
were $116 million in the second quarter which added 4.6% to Industrial's growth and the business was profitable on a
GAAP basis. We are pleased thus far with the integration effort and look forward to continue to success in this
business. Second quarter operating income was $599 million and reported margins were 22.5%. Ex-acquisitions,
Industrial operating margins were 23.2%.
Now let's move to Safety & Graphics. Turn to slide 9. Second quarter sales were $1.5 billion, up 2% on organic local
currency basis. We generated positive organic growth in commercial graphics, personal safety products, architectural
markets and building and commercial services. Sales declined organically in the roofing granules business and in traffic
safety and security systems.
On a geographic basis organic local currency sales rose 9% in Latin America-Canada, 7% in Asia-Pacific and 1% and
EMEA. The U.S. declined 3% in the quarter.
The FSTech acquisition added 1.9% to growth in the quarter and the business is on track to meet its top and bottom line
targets in 2013. We are aggressively integrating this business to capture significant cost and sales synergies. FSTech
increases our relevance in the large highway infrastructure market and is a natural growth adjacency for our reflective
sheeting and pavement marking business.
Operating income in Safety & Graphics was $333 million and operating margins were a strong 22.9% against a very
tough comp of 25.9% in the prior year. Excluding acquisitions second quarter 2000 (sic) [2012] (16:06) operating
margins were 23.8% and we're investing to accelerate growth in this business particularly in personal safety in our
recently formed mining, oil and gas business.
Next up is Electronics & Energy found on slide 10. In Electronics & Energy, sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter,
down 2% in organic local currency terms. Operating income was $237 million and margins were 17.7%. As we
anticipated, margins were down year-on-year but importantly showed nice improvement versus the 15.3% margin that
we posted in the first quarter. Organic local currency sales declined slightly on the electronics side. Consumer
electronics end market demand has been fairly tepid throughout the first half of the year but by and large the market
seems to have stabilized and third quarter sales should show recovery. End market inventories were heavy at year end
and have improved as the first half has progressed with some modest overhang still remaining in the handheld space.
In Energy sales declined 4% in the second quarter. Our heartland electrical markets business had positive organic
growth and continued to perform very well in Q2. This growth was more than offset by declines in other energy-related
businesses. Renewable energy in particular posted a double-digit sales decline in the quarter. This market continues to
seek a bottom which is impacting our growth but we do see sales stabilizing in the second half and the comps begin to
ease. We've been actively working to repurpose these assets to other 3M businesses where we anticipate growth.
On a geographic basis organic local currency sales increased slightly in Latin America, Canada, and declined in other
regions. Please go to slide 11.
Health Care had another excellent quarter posting the highest organic growth and the highest operating margins
amongst our five business segments. Sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 6% on an organic local currency basis. We continue
to see broad-based growth across much of the Health Care portfolio including health information systems, food safety,
critical and chronic care, oral care and infection prevention.
Sales in Health Care grew organically in all geographic regions led by double-digit performances in both Latin
America-Canada and Asia-Pacific. Healthcare second quarter organic sales growth was 15% in developing markets on
top of 13% in the first quarter. These are highly promising growth sectors for 3M and we continued to funnel
investment dollars them towards and we're encouraged to see the positive results.
In developed markets healthcare grew 8% organically in Japan and 3% in both the U.S. and Western Europe. Operating
income rose 1% to $417 million and margins were again strong at 31.2%. The recently enacted U.S. Medical Device

Tax was a 40 basis point drag on Q2 operating margins.
Finally, let's review the Consumer business found on slide number 12. Consumer also delivered a good second quarter.
Sales were $1.1 billion, up 3% on an organic local currency basis. Profits rose 4% to $235 million and operating
margins rose 40 basis points year-on-year to 21.4%. We grew organically across the Consumer portfolio most notably
in consumer healthcare where our ACE and Futuro brands showed particularly good growth in the second quarter. We
also posted positive organic local currency growth in our home care, stationery and office and do-it-yourself
businesses.
Q2 is when we begin to see the impact of the back-to-school season and growth thus far has been encouraging. We
have good placement and promotional programs in place and we are seeing some sales lift from our newly introduced
family of Scotch Expressions tapes.
From a geographic perspective, organic sales growth was 7% in Latin America-Canada, 4% in Asia-Pacific and 2% in
the U.S. Growth was slightly positive in EMEA. In developing markets the Consumer business grew 7% in organic
local currency in Q2. Like Health Care, Consumer is one of our most significant growth opportunities in developing
markets as retail sectors expand along with the growing middle class. Developed markets grew 2% organically.
That wraps up the detailed outlook at the second quarter. Now I'll turn the call back over to Inge.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, David. Before we take your questions, I want to highlight our progress on several strategic fronts.
Let's start first with a brief update on the integration of Ceradyne which we acquired in November of 2012. Sales and
profit exceeded expectations for the quarter, very good results and strong evidence of our progress. You will recall that
earlier this year Ceradyne was awarded a $40 million plus order for protective armor plates. We saw some positive
sales impact from this win in the second quarter.
Let me also give some comments on our portfolio management efforts and our R&D investments. We are continuing to
strengthen our portfolio through better priorization and by addressing underperforming businesses.
For example, recently we announced a consolidation of our infrastructure protection division which has been under
strategic review into the electronic market division. We expect to gain rapid cost synergies as we increase the scale and
efficiency on the newly combined entity. In additional, these divisions share common end markets such as construction,
electrical utilities and electrical equipment manufacturing.
Back in May, we announced the sale of our fly fishing equipment business to Orvis. This is a good business and a
market leader in its space but it has no relevance to become important in the broader 3M portfolio.
We're also making good progress in identifying new and promising technology programs. As you may recall, we are
planning to increase investments in longer term disruptive technologies aimed at opportunities with significant growth
potential. We formed a review team called the 3M Innovation Board comprised by myself, David, our Chief
Technology Officer and our Head of Corporate Strategy. The team meets quarterly to review milestone progress and
previously approved programs and to screen new investment ideas. I'm very encouraged by what I have seen so far.
Finally, we continue to move resources to our businesses with the most promising growth opportunities. A great
example is Health Care where the end markets continue to grow nicely and our technology and market positions give
us strong relevance with our customers. Consumer is another example where retail markets in developing economies
are now beginning to develop. And we are actively prioritizing our heartland divisions to ensure that they have the
resources they need to improve their already strong market positions.
In summary, first half conditions were challenging and 3M executed very well under the circumstances. We anticipate
demand recovery in the second half of the year with some help from both the macro economy and the consumer
electronics markets. And we remain focused on driving productivity and executing our plan with strong discipline.

Thank you for your attention. We will now take your questions and comments.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: I'd like to start off with geographies. Maybe you comment on the significance and we
haven't seen this in a while but Central Europe showing stronger growth than the U.S. Is this just the easier comps but
maybe just give us a sense of what you're seeing in Europe now?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Deane. You are specific about Central East Europe where we have had a good
base for quite some time, as you know, as we had built out our businesses there. And we see continued good growth
driven by specifically Russia, Turkey and Poland. But also a lot of the other smaller countries there are doing well. So I
think it's broad-based for us and I'm personally not surprised. I was over visiting here actually this last quarter a couple
of countries including Russia and it's very encouraging what we see in the marketplace there. And again our portfolio
had been built out with very much Industrial as the base in that part of the world and now we see an increase in our
businesses that going into safety-related businesses but also Health Care is taking off very well for us.
So I would say that it's not a surprise to us. It's in fact encouraging as we have moved out our portfolio. We have also
made some investments that actually the last ten years or so relative to local capabilities both in terms of converting and
manufacturing and now research and development. And so we have a big place over there in Poland, in Wroclaw,
where we utilize a lot of capacity in order to serve that part of the world and recently, as you maybe recall on the last
quarter we talked about we're now opening also a center of excellence for logistics in Turkey that over time will serve
as a bridge in between Central East Europe and Middle East-Africa.
So it's very encouraging for us and we would like to be bigger there. And as you are – I'm talking about Central East
Europe and Middle East-Africa – also Middle East-Africa had very good growth for us in the quarter. That's from a
lower base but basically all countries there grew expect we have a little bit slower growth in South Africa due to
instability in that country. So overall very good.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: The commentary – same commentary for Western Europe?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Western Europe – first of all we saw very, very slight growth for the first time in eight quarters,
which was encouraging for us. And the way we look upon it – we separate the in between North and South. And in
North are growing slightly better than in South and I would say in terms of when you look upon the countries – I would
say Germany was basically going sideways on a lower level and we had little bit better growth in U.K. Up to 5% to 6%
in that country. And North for us would be identified as Nordic, U.K., Germany, Benelux and also Alpine as the Alpine
countries are very dependent on Germany.
So it's on a lower level going sideways but at least was encouraging to see that we for the first time in eight quarters
saw slight, slight growth from that part of the world. And as we had talked about earlier, we have really worked on the
back end of the organization there in order to streamline that combined regions and try to manage the cost in the back
end of the operation.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thanks. And last one for me on Safety & Graphics. You all called out roofing granules
and traffic safety and the slide also said security. But how would you split out the margin decline year-over-year across
those three businesses?

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well I think there is three components there. You have one third is related to the FSTech
acquisition. One third is related to the decline in government related project businesses and specifically into road
safety. And then finally we're making some strategic investment in that business into mining, oil and gas and to
personal safety. Personal safety's a heartland division for us. Had in the quarter 6% growth and we're continuing to
invest there. So those are the three elements of that business. And if you take out FSTech that, business was – had an
operating income of almost 24% in the quarter – 23.8%. So very good in our view even if it was a decline versus last
year but not any major concern.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning, all.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: I just want to follow-up Deane's question geographically on the U.S. specifically. It was
2.3% last quarter, 0.8% this quarter, 0.7% volume. Just give us a sense for that slowdown specifically if you could?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. I think when we look upon where we have solid growth was in Health Care, Industrial
and Consumer. So I think it was more relative base comparison and very much into some specific businesses that was
related to government businesses as I talked earlier about from Safety & Graphics business. Very much related to road
safety and then we had also the granule business that we said was an inventory correction for the whole industry that
happened for that business specifically. We had a relatively good Consumer business and a good back-to-school sale in
which I think was just that segment was up almost 10% as we rolled into the quarter. Now we have to look upon the
sell out as we know as we move through the rest of the year.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And then second question, when we look at pricing across the different
geographies and you see Latin America up 6.1% versus the volume of 2.4 and I presume much of that is inflation
driven. Can you give us a sense for how much you think is inflation versus just other kinds of pricing power?
Obviously you're exhibiting a lot of pricing power there. Be helpful to understand that.
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure, Steve, if I could comment. So if you look at and correctly a significant part of our
reported price in the quarter was driven by Latin America which is – it was already up in the first quarter and we saw a
little bit higher this quarter. And that's largely being driven by the fact that we have some of the currencies in several
countries as well as inflation has been picking up so what you see is the business are reacting to that to make sure we're
preserving our profitability and it's in an environment where we're able to – with the good brand positioning we have,
we're able to put through those prices and still deliver growth in the region.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And sorry, just one more. The 40 basis points of strategic investment margin
headwind, how long should we think about building that into our forecast?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. I would say that the strategic investments we're doing those – as I mentioned earlier
are specifically related to our ERP business transformation which will go on for several years. Now on a year-over-year
basis we expect that the phenomenon you see this year will continue certainly through the end of this year and in the
case of the innovation spend we're starting to see that picking up somewhat as we get into these approved programs. So
I think from a planning perspective at least through this year you should expect that kind of investment level on a
year-over-year basis. And then as we get into next year's planning we'll give you guys an update as to what to think
about that.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, Ron.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, David, maybe can you just gauge an update on EPS contributions now going
forward from shares, tax, pension because you're now buying back more shares, you've got lower share count? I don't
know if that still goes lower and I imagine your pension has moved a bit with interest rates. So maybe just gauge what
we should expect in terms of EPS tailwinds from those.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. So if you look at pensions, what you would observe, as we've called out here the
impact on margin in the first half. If you look at first quarter, second quarter, that's added about 0.3 points to the
margins in the first half and you should expect that to continue through the balance of the year. Obviously as you start
then looking forward into the future, if we stay in this in interest-rate environment we'll start to see our expense further
decline as we talked about last November.
If you look at share count correctly we've upped the amount that we would intend to buy back this year and so I think
you can calculate the figures but we will see some reduction in share count impact in the second half. But as you do the
averaging – the increase that we see in the actual buyback in the second half will have a bigger impact next year than
this. So we'll see some pickup in the second half.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: The one thing I'd add to that, Shannon, is foreign exchange was a headwind in the first half to
the tune of about $0.03 a share and that will get a little bit stiffer in the second half of the year when it will be closer to
about a nickel in the second half.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And how should we interpret the share repurchase in terms of what drove your decision
to increase it and is this a reset to a higher range or is this just a one-off?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. It's a good question. So as I tried to call out here in deciding how to proceed on that we
first and foremost looked at how the business is running. And certainly we're pleased with the performance of the
business now and we think that will continue in the context of both the health of our business and the economy.
Secondly, the pension plans – we've been – obviously with the tick-up and interest rates – if you look at our funded
position at midyear we were at about 94% funded globally in all of our plans versus 87% at year end. So were that to
continue that will be some easing on the demand for capital in that area which factors into our decision-making.
And then as I also mentioned acquisitions. We did not deploy in the first half. We continue to expect to and would
guide to $1 billion to $2 billion this year but inevitably, timing is difficult to call. And certainly in this lower
interest-rate environment we're seeing that finding transactions where we can create value for 3M has been more
difficult for us recently. So that'll factor into our thinking on sources and uses of cash.
And then finally, as I mentioned, the capital structure of the company we think is certainly very strong and is adequate
and we wouldn't foresee strengthening further. So add those pieces up, look at how those evolve. That will inform us as
to what kind of planning we'll do in terms of our buyback activity going forward.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And just to clarify on the tax and pension, do you still – taxes coming in lower this year
– do you still expect it to go lower in 2014? And do you have a read of what pension tailwind would be at this point?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So that's right. So we guided tax to 29% to 29.5% which is more in line with the tax
rates that we had last year. Everything we see – and again we're just now in the update of our long-term plan. We've

just started that, but we would foresee – we had indicated last year that by the end of the five-year period we would
expect our rate to be in the neighborhood of 27% and I don't have any reason right now to think that would change.
As to the year by year precise amounts, that's something we'll have to refine here as we go through the balance of the
year.
And in terms of pensions, yeah. As you know it's a very significant consideration for 3M. We have very significant
obligations and we've absorbed over the last five years an increase in our annual pension expense cumulatively of $550
million. This year our pension expense versus last year has declined by $100 million and given the very strong funded
position we have, which is improving, given the fact that we've now transitioned our workforce globally such that we're
moving increasingly into defined contribution type profiles, considering very good return on assets we've been
generating over recent years and then finally rising interest rates, would cause us to expect expenses to decline. So if
you were to close the year today what we would think is that we'd have $100 million or more decline in expense next
year.

Our next question comes from line of Steven Tusa of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Can you maybe just talk about any update to the price cost forecast for the year? It was kind of in
line with the first quarter. There's obviously some inflation driven price you're getting in Latin America. Pricing was
better so just maybe talk about that for the second half.
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So in terms of price cost, we'd indicated that we expected some price improvement
initially which would then decline as we walked through the year and that continues to be our view on an overall basis.
So we had some price performance in the first half year here which was primarily driven by increases we took during
the year last year. So naturally that would be declining as we move into the second half.
In terms of the other piece of price, which is inflation and foreign exchange driven, that – we'll have to see how things
develop but I would say that you could expect that we would continue to have a positive contribution there which
would then be enabling us to offset the negative impacts of exchange.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. So the price cost spread which I think you said was going to be plus or minus this year for
the year is now better than – it's now more favorable? Moving to the area of plus 80 so far...
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. Price cost we expect will continue to decline quarter by quarter but it would be more
favorable than what we had initially indicated at the beginning of the year.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Got you. And are you in position to put through this year with raw material and the economy – are
you in position to get more price this year like you have in previous years? Like another unusual step up like you had
maybe a year ago? Or is it just more normal this year?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. From a planning perspective we don't – other than specific situations where you've got
exchange or inflation driven price movements, we don't right now have particular plans to be driving price. Certainly to
the extent which is normally what we drive to, where we have significant and fresh products and good brand
positioning we have the ability to price but in the current benign cost environment our thinking is, is that steady as she
goes is the right posture for the company.

<Q - Steve Tusa>: Got you. And one last quick one. Inge, can you maybe comment on what you're seeing in Latin
America? A lot of cross currents in the economy there. Maybe if you could just talk about how you see the second half
playing out?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well we're optimistic relative to the second half and as David has commented relative to the
relation of organic growth and price for the first and second quarter we're on plan. Relative to execution we see a slight
uptick coming in Brazil for us, which is good. It's the biggest subsidiary for us down there. And as you know, as we
have talked about before, we have a very broad-based both portfolio – probably the best balanced portfolio in any part
of the world in Latin America and we have execution capabilities across all countries.
So we see it very positive for the rest of the year as well, and as I said, as we have been in that part of the world since
1946 and it's the, I would say, the role model relative to us how to build out businesses in developing economies and
have done very well. We feel good not only for the rest of this year but for many years to come, and as you know, that
business for us is as sizable as China and it's growing faster and it's very, very profitable. So we're very optimistic
about Latin America as we go ahead. In fact I think there is some acceleration for us for the rest of the year and beyond.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay, great. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hi. Yes. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes. Just a question on your share buyback. Can you just tell us on a net basis how much did
you increase the buyback versus the previous expectation? Right, because the stock has done well I'm just wondering
where did options go?
<A - David W. Meline>: Right. So if you look at the re-issuances that we expect to occur during the year I think we
had originally guided $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And right now it looks to us like we'll be at or slightly above the high
end of that range. So think about $1.5 billion maybe slightly above that depending on what happens through the
balance of the year. So if you then think about net the $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion would imply somewhere approaching
$2 billion to $3 billion net versus the original guidance of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Thank you very much. And the second question on Electronics & Energy. If we look at
sequential improvement, how sustainable it is going to the second half and what levers do you still have left to push to
get this business improving in the absence of a recovery on the electronics side?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: First of all it's as you comment yourself, it's stabilized relative to first quarter. So we had minus
two and minus two. So basically you can say stabilized in terms of the growth on a lower level for us. You can see that
we improve margins and that's a result – went from 15.3% to 17.7% sequentially and that's based on mix improvement
and better utilization. And you can also see we're taking action here relative to our portfolio management. We just
recently announced some combination of a couple of divisions where we're going to drive cost and synergy in the back
office while still capitalized on the front end.
Now it's clear, as we have said earlier, that we're counting on the tick up in consumer electronic in the second part of
the year. And we see small evidence of that as we move into Q3 here. And we base that, of course, on what we see on
our spec-ins on platforms. So I would say that we're on plan relative to that business. We need to see a big pickup in
consumer electronics but the way we look upon that, we see what we're expecting, we see that that's coming in our
order flow for Q3. And then what will drive that for the rest of the year is of course end market demand, right? Which

is where we're sitting still a little bit of difficult for us to see but that's how we plan it for now.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Thanks, guys. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I know it may be hard to answer this specifically but when you think about, Inge, the
investments that you've made in R&D and also in just the core businesses and the changes you've made at what point
do you that inflection do you think where you start to outgrow global GDP? Even the last couple of years have been
growing pretty much in line with pretty sluggish global GDP but I would imagine there has to be a point where you
start to show some real progress. Can you give us a sense of is this a 2014 – can we see it this year? Is it more like
2015? Just give us a bit of a sense of what you think.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well first of all I would say that we have outperformed IPI lately, right? So you look
upon last quarter, you see this quarter. We have outperformed IPI. Just to make that clear because I think you said that
we had not, right? We're in line with. I think we outperformed. So we are pleased with that and just to give it in
perspective at least where I'm sitting I'm pleased that we have showed three quarters in a row organic growth or
currency growth, right? So we had Q4 last year, Q1 and now Q2. So that's first the baseline and as I'm looking upon. So
that's very encouraging.
Now when you make those shifts as we're doing, right? There's a couple of strategic shifts in the company. Portfolio
management is a lever for us and it's an important one and as I've talked about earlier we have put that in place. We are
very serious about it. We are on that the whole time. That's an important level. The second one is on investment in
research and development which is very much at this point in time relative to disruptive technologies that will have a
longer term outcome. However, in that pipeline there is some projects that I believe that we'll be able to commercialize
in the middle of next year.
So I think the way that this is moving for us, it's difficult to say exactly a time but I think that we should – 12 to 18
months from now we should start to see the traction of the moves that we are doing. And there's elements here that are
very important that are all in order for us to strengthen the company as we go ahead. And I think as I said and David
talked earlier about our ERP initiative, right? So you think about the lever for us is portfolio management, it is research
and development and then it's investment in ERP. Those three together will strengthen the company as we move
forward.
But I start to see good progress on the growth side but I'm still not happy. Let me say it. I'm still not happy but I can see
that we start to take market share. And we are doing very well specifically in the heartland divisions start to really get
some good traction. And automotive aftermarket this quarter was very good and again it's related to us be able to take
market share and penetrate better around the world.
The same I talked about personal safety. We had 6% growth in a big, very profitable division for us that has brand
equity and a position around the world. So I think that you see the focus we have got around the heartland divisions has
helped us in order to grow and it's based on both taking market share and to improve penetration. And then as we look
upon the businesses that have underperformed that will over time help us to accelerate growth in those where we call
push forward that are businesses that are very good, very strong for us using multiple technologies. But have a
relatively smaller size based on their market but those markets are growing faster. So I don't know if this is helping you

but at least...
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: No, no...
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: You can understand the direction where we are going.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yeah. No. I think the answer is actually very comprehensive and what you said about the big
lever in M&A is fairly relevant too. So as a follow-up, you talked about M&A just because it is so important for a
company that generates as much cash as you do to either have an outsized buyback program or an outsized M&A
program, but what is your bias as it relates to the type of things you want to buy? In your tenure we've seen you
obviously you bought Ceradyne, the Avery deal fell through. These are fairly low growth assets. Are there emerging
technologies that you're looking at or is it more mature companies? Just give us a sense of what we can expect out of
M&A and the type of assets going forward.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: I would go back and repeat what I've said earlier relative to you should expect slightly bigger
than you have seen the past for the five, six years. We did 60 to 70 acquisitions in the last six years or so. Many of them
were very small and in geographical areas that was way out and was maybe in some cases difficult for us to lever from
an execution perspective on a global base. So I think you should see acquisitions that are slightly bigger than in the
past, you should see acquisitions that we should be able to level and scale on a global base ideally and for sure on a
regional basis. And if there's a technology as part of it, that will be very, very interesting. And I think that was exactly
what Ceradyne gave us. Ceradyne had a good solid front end in terms of business but in addition there was a
technology play that was very important for us that we can lever over many divisions in the company.
So I think that's what you should think about. And that's also why the portfolio work that we're doing is so important
because this is as we go also be able for us to categorize the businesses and look upon opportunities as we go ahead. So
we have a very active pipeline and as you know that we are looking upon them from different perspectives but I think
you should think about it in the way of slightly bigger than the past, should be faster growing on average for company
will be ideally and then a technology piece of it will really be good because that's what we're all about. So we can
leverage around many, many divisions in the company due to the fantastic vertical integrated model we have both in
research and development and manufacturing and the subsidiary structure.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Fantastic. Okay. Good luck, guys. Thank you.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: So as it relates to organic growth, you did maintain your organic growth guidance for the
year yet outside of Industrial and Safety & Graphics comps do get harder across your segments in the second half and
the midpoint of your guidance essentially implies an acceleration beyond easing comps. So my first question is, where
there any changes to the segment level growth expectations based on what you reported today and maybe you can talk a
little bit about your confidence on hitting that second half organic growth guidance?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So if you look at the guidance that we've offering which is maintaining the two to five
for the year which is what we've had in place all year, we had expected and that continues to be our view, that we
would see a second half that improves from the first. So no different there. If you then look at the sector level we gave
guidance on the sectors at the beginning of the year for the whole year and generally we expect to be operating within
those levels and those ranges. If there's any area where we have the biggest question that specifically has been and is on
Electronics & Energy.

So if you think of our range for the year, operating to the low end of that range would be in an environment where we
wouldn't see any pickup in the economy, we wouldn't see any pickup in the Electronics & Energy space, which is not
the environment that we're presently expecting. To operate towards the high end of that range for the year, it would, as
Inge was talking about, it would require not only the improvements that we're foreseeing in the third quarter in the
consumer electronics space, but it would also foresee some additional economic pickup generally, which is certainly
not out of line with economic forecasts that are out there. And secondly, it would require pretty robust end-market
demand in areas like general consumer, so think about a good sellout for the holiday season, and then specifically in the
consumer electronics business.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. Great. That's really helpful color, David. And maybe one question for Inge. On
Ceradyne specifically, it seems like things went well in the second quarter, still behind plan for the first half of the year
on the sales side, but doing better on EBITDA. My question is really around the technology platform and the uses of
that platform across your other divisions. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity there? And whether you're
starting to deploy it across to some of the other 3M divisions?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. We do. And I think it's very much aligned relative to the synergies we see with different
divisions. I think at this point in time, there is 13 – I think it's 13 to 15 divisions that see that they can utilize the
technologies that came in from Ceradyne.
So we purchased the company, moved it into 1 division, in Industrial. But I think beyond that, now there is a team in
place that are looking upon the opportunities across businesses and I think it's, from the business groups, where
basically 3 of the 5 are very much involved and I think it's – let's say it's 13 divisions. I think maybe 13 to 15 have seen
opportunities in their different spaces. So it's really very, very encouraged actually what we see there. And Fred
Palensky, our CTO, is very encouraged what he has seen and he was we're very pleased even before we did acquisition.
So I think we are able to talk about it more later when we see some specific programs coming out of pipeline, but we
are very pleased. And as I said, that acquisition was maybe different in the way that was not only for us to purchase a
position in the marketplace, but also to get – build out the technology platform that we had already in ceramics, make it
broader and deeper and then be able to capitalize on it, which is what 3M is very good at.

Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Maybe just on Health Care, so it's very nice to see your highest-margin business also your
fastest-growing, and we've seen that for the last couple of quarters now. So maybe talk about what you seeing there,
what's driving that growth? I know you're seeing very high growth rates in the developing markets. So talk a little bit
about sustainability, especially given what you're seeing on the macro side on the developing countries? So one, what
your outlook is? And then also implications for margins?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. First of all, when you think about that portfolio, 78% of that portfolio is today in
developed economies. So you have 22% are in the developing, if you look upon that portfolio from our perspective in
Health Care. So that's indicating that we have a very strong position in the developed world based on the value
proposition coming out from those businesses through our base. So that's a very strong position to be in and we are
growing in the developed world as well. We have 3% growth in the developed world, so think about that. That's
indicating that the value proposition that we are providing to our customers are very strong. In the developing world,

the growth was 15% in the quarter.
And as we have talked about earlier, as we build out our businesses in the developing world there is now an opportunity
also for developed solutions in that part of the world. And I think hopefully you remember the way that we describe
how we build out the business starting with infrastructure, manufacturing, safety, retail and then finally Health Care. In
many countries, we are now coming to that point in the end in relative to health care. And in fact Health Care is going
ahead of retail in many ways relative to the execution of our plan because there is a different type of network from key
opinion leaders for Health Care versus in Consumer where it is brand equity that is a key element for you to be
successful.
So that – I think that's the reason for us that we have growth. We have growth in both developed and the developing
world, the value proposition is strong in both places, we have made investments for many years into the developing
world in order to be ready for execution as the programs are coming. So and we are able to show here that it's
sustainable relative to margins and as you maybe recall we said earlier we should run that business over time in the
high 20s but we we've been running at above 30 and we're still running at about 30. So that despite that we are building
out our capabilities very much relative to the execution of the programs which means coverage in the marketplace.
But and we have a very efficient manufacturing model there as well where we'll are able to utilize both two huge
centers around the world for manufacturing but also many smaller converting facilities. So it's a very good business for
us – doing very well and we are very pleased and it's not by accident. Has been planned for a long time by the team
here in order to come up to this position.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Of course. Yes. Very nice business and it helps that it's also your highest margin business. So
good work there. And maybe one question for David on utilization. So it's still a headwind. How should we think about
that for the rest of the year? Does that headwind come down as you allocate those assets to other businesses? Or is that
more related to volume coming back in electronics?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. So, Ajay, I would say generally the trend we're working towards obviously is to fully
utilize all of our assets. So we're driving to get better utilization, obviously, as we always are. We see some good
progress here so as I talked about last quarter a couple sources of that underutilization related to some businesses in
renewable energy and one of our automotive areas where we had some inventory overhang so that's largely been
addressed. What's true for us is that the renewable space will continue to be an area that we're working through to
identify exactly what are the prospects for the business going forward, how do we best participate there to offer
technology solutions and also generate a return to the company and that's probably going to take us into 2014 to come
to some final solutions. So we will have some issues that we'll continue to deal with for the foreseeable future but I
think as you've already seen we're starting to get our arms around it and certainly the trend should continue to be down.

Our next question comes from line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Just a very quick one as I know we've gone over. As you look at the ramp in your R&D
investment in these new areas you're looking at investing in, is there an implication that in a few years out there could
be a step up in the CapEx cycle for the company for some reason? Or is it all going be roughly the same capital
intensity as the businesses you're already in?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. Yeah. I would say, Lawrence, in terms of our outlook for capital, as you would know,
we do deployed capital at a level which is typically higher than the average peer, which is an outgrowth of the very
significant level of vertical integration that the company has. Because a lot of our technology is proprietary and know
how that we want to preserve and therefore to do that when it's in the manufacturing process area we feel the best
strategy is to do it ourselves. So we're quite vertically integrated and that will continue.

In terms of, does the step up in investment in R&D imply an increase in our CapEx? Right now, we don't foresee that to
be the case. But quite honestly, we have to monitor how that progresses because there's a bunch of things we're
working on that we haven't fully developed yet. But I would say if I look over a longer period of time, I wouldn't expect
that there's some implied step-up in our CapEx.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Thank you.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yup.

And our last question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in here. Again a couple quick ones from
me. Just turning to the margin bridge – this is probably for David – the impact of FX, just want to confirm, that's the
transactional impact of U.S. exports?
<A - David W. Meline>: That is a – yes. Yes it is. Yeah.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, great. And then maybe just a quick update on where we are on the $2.5 billion of I guess
restructuring portfolio? You've made a couple of actions in terms of one business within E&E, and the security
business back in – earlier this year, just wondering where we are in terms of progress on that $2.5 billion?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well we have made some progress, and as I said, we have not put a timeline on it as
that's difficult to do when you do business, as you know, in terms of what needs to be done. But we are focusing in on
that and you have seen now probably three actions that have been taken relative to make sure that we improve the
position. We sold off one business and we have combined two. And in fact, we are re-harvesting a fourth one. So that's
an ongoing process and we take it very seriously. So there is not a timeline on it by definition, but what I have said to
you, and I've said internally, you cannot stay in that category for long. And so we are working on it. But we're also
doing the right thing in order for us to evaluate the right position for those businesses, as we move ahead.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: And ballpark, right about a $1 billion of actions taken in those four businesses so far?
<A - David W. Meline>: In terms of the portion of the businesses and the revenue impact? Yeah. That's in the
ballpark. Yeah.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.
