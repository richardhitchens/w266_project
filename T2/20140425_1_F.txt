Alan R. Mulally
Thank you, George, and good morning to everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity today to review our first
quarter 2014 business performance, as we continue to move forward with the implementation of our One Ford plan.
Let's get started and turn to the first slide, please. Our One Ford plan, shown here, continues to guide everything that
we do. We continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably at the current demand and the
changing model mix; accelerate development of the new products our customers want and value; finance our plan and
improve our balance sheet; and work together effectively as one team, leveraging our global assets. Our commitment
remains to serve customers in all markets with a full family of best-in-class vehicles: small, medium and large, cars
utilities and trucks delivering profitable growth for all.
Now, let's turn to slide two and review a summary of our first quarter accomplishments. The company achieved its 19
consecutive profitable quarter in the first quarter with a positive operating related cash flow and continued strong
liquidity. Once again, the top-line grew with wholesale volume up 6% from a year ago, and company revenue
improving about 1%.
We saw a higher market share in Asia-Pacific where we achieved a record share in China. Among our business units,
Asia-Pacific reported a record quarterly profit. North America and Middle East & Africa were profitable, and Ford
Credit once again delivered solid results.
Europe reduced its loss substantially compared with last year, but South America incurred a larger loss. This year will
feature the most product launches in our history, and we remain on track with the 23 global product launches we
announced late last year.
Overall, the company's results were solid, but the quarter was impacted adversely by several significant factors that are
not representative of the underlying run rate of our business. Based on our solid start, we continue to expect the
company's full-year pre-tax profit to range from $7 billion to $8 billion. Our outlook for Automotive revenue, operating
margin and operating-related cash flow also remains unchanged.
Before turning to the financial details, let's recap some of our other achievements from the first quarter. As shown on
slide three, we revealed several concepts and products in the first quarter, including the all-new 2015 F-150, the Figo
and Ka 4-door concepts, the new 2015 Focus 5-door and wagon, and the new 2015 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator.
We accelerated the momentum of our global Transit line with the launch of the 2-ton Transit in
Europe, the Transit Connect in U.S. and Canada, and the Transit Custom in Australia. In Asia-Pacific, we expanded
production of EcoSport to Thailand, making it the fourth plant globally to build the all-new urban SUV. We announced
an investment of $168 million at the Ohio Assembly Plant for production of the all-new 2016 F-650 and F-750
medium-duty trucks beginning in spring of 2015.
Also in the U.S., we announced an investment of $580 million and an additional 650 jobs to build a new 2.7-liter
EcoBoost engine at Lima Engine Plant in Ohio to increase production of Super Duty at Kentucky Truck. We also
announced new automated driving research projects with MIT and Stanford University as well as expansion of our

And finally, in January, we increased our quarterly dividend by 25%, the second increase since restoring the dividend
in January of 2012.
Now, Bob Shanks will take you through the detail of our first quarter financial results. Bob?
Robert L. Shanks
Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Starting at the top on slide four, first quarter wholesale volume was 1.6
million units, up 92,000 units from a year ago, and revenue was $35.9 billion, up $300 million. Pre-tax profit was $1.4
billion, excluding special items; $765 million lower than a year ago. After-tax earnings per share at $0.25 were $0.16
lower. Net income attributable to Ford, including pre-tax special item charges of $122 million, was $989 million which
was $622 million lower than a year ago. Earnings were $0.24 a share, down $0.16. The pre-tax special item charges of
$122 million are for separation-related actions, primarily in Europe to support our transformation plan. You can find
additional detail in Appendix 3.
Automotive operating-related cash flow was $1.2 billion, our 16th consecutive quarter of positive performance, and
Automotive gross cash was $25.2 billion, exceeding debt by $9.5 billion. Our first quarter operating effective tax rate,
which isn't shown, was 38%. Consistent with prior guidance, we expect our full-year operating effective tax rate to be
about 35%.
As shown on slide five, both of our sectors, Automotive and Financial Services, contributed to the company's first
quarter pre-tax profit.
As shown in the memo, the year-over-year decline in company first quarter pre-tax profit is explained primarily by the
Automotive sector. Within Automotive, lower results in North and South America were offset partially by an
improvement of nearly $600 million from the other automotive regions. Compared with fourth quarter 2013, company
pre-tax profit was $63 million higher, more than explained by Financial Services.
The key market factors and financial metrics for our Automotive business in the first quarter are shown on slide six.
Beginning this quarter, we will report global and total regional industry SAAR and market share data to improve
transparency and reflect the markets covered by each of our Automotive business units.
As you can see on the far left, and as already mentioned, wholesale volume increased by 6% compared with a year ago.
Automotive revenue, on the other hand, was unchanged. The higher volume is more than explained by higher industry
volumes in all regions except South America, improved market share in Asia-Pacific, and the favorable change in
dealer stocks.
Global industry SAAR is estimated at 86.5 million units, up over 3% from a year ago. Ford global market share is
estimated at 6.9%, unchanged from a year ago. Operating margin was 3.4%, down 1.8 percentage points from a year
ago. And Automotive pre-tax profit was $919 million, down $724 million. Lower results in North and South America
more than explain the change in both metrics.
As mentioned, the first quarter results include several significant adverse factors that we do not consider to be
representative of the underlying run rate of our business. They're shown here on slide seven. In North America, these
factors total about $500 million. They include a $400 million increase in warranty reserves for field service actions,
which include safety recalls and other product campaigns related to 2008 through 2013 models as well as expense for
2001 through 2005 model vehicles. We also experienced premium freight and labor cost of about $100 million during
the quarter related to the harsh winter weather in the U.S., which disrupted our operations as well as those of many of
our suppliers.
In South America, we saw significant currency devaluations across our major markets during the quarter. These are
shown in Appendix 12. In addition to the operating effect of these exchange rate movements, we recorded charges of
about $400 million related to the one-time balance sheet impact of these changes. Included is $310 million related to

the Venezuela bolivar.
In total, these factors reduced pre-tax profit by about $900 million, or the equivalent of $0.17 per share. They also
account for a year-over-year decline in company pre-tax profit of $700 million, as shown in the memo. While similar
factors could occur in the future, it's unusual for items like these to occur in this magnitude in the same quarter.
Isolating these factors provides a better understanding of what we believe to be the underlying run rate of the company
and our North and South America business units.
Slide eight shows the factors that contributed to the $724 million decline in Automotive first quarter pre-tax profit,
including the items just reviewed on the prior slide. The year-over-year decline in Automotive pre-tax profit can be
explained fully by the warranty and premium weather-related costs in North America and the balance sheet exchange
effects in South America. All other factors effectively offset one another.
Slide nine shows the first quarter pre-tax results for each of our Automotive operations as well as Other Automotive.
Effective with this quarter, we're reporting results for Middle East & Africa, our new business unit that was formed to
facilitate an increased focus on this important growth region. To allow comparison, we've revised prior-year financials
and physicals for each of our other business units to align with this new reporting structure. Total Automotive sector
bottom line reporting, of course, is not impacted by this change. You can find detail on the revisions in Appendices 14
through 16.
As you can see, North America reported a solid first quarter result notwithstanding the factors discussed earlier, while
Asia-Pacific's profit was a record for any quarter. Europe cut its loss by more than half from a year ago and by nearly
two-thirds from fourth quarter 2013. The Automotive operations outside North America improved $265 million from a
year ago notwithstanding the larger loss in South America, mainly due to the factors discussed earlier.
The change in Other Automotive from a year ago is more than explained by an unfavorable fair-value adjustment of
our investment in Mazda. For the full year, we now expect net interest expense to be about $700 million, a $100 million
improvement from our prior guidance, reflecting higher interest income.
Now we'll look at each of the regions within the Automotive sector, starting on slide 10 with North America. North
America's first quarter pre-tax profit continued to be driven by robust industry sales, our strong product lineup,
continued discipline in matching production to demand, and a lean cost structure, even as we continue to invest for
future growth.
North America wholesale volume and revenue declined 2% and 5% respectively in the first quarter. The volume
decrease is more than explained by lower market share. This was offset in part by higher industry sales, including a
U.S. SAAR of 16 million units that was 400,000 units higher than a year ago, and a favorable change in dealer stocks.
The decline in revenue mainly reflects the lower wholesale volume as well as unfavorable mix, lower net pricing, and
the adverse effect of a weaker Canadian dollar.
North America operating margin was 7.3%, down 3.8 percentage points from last year. And pre-tax profit was $1.5
billion, about $900 million lower than last year's record profit. The adverse impact of $500 million associated with the
warranty reserve and weather-related premium cost, as noted earlier, is worth 2.5 percentage points of operating
margin.
On slide 11, we show the factors that contributed to North America's first quarter decline in pre-tax profit from last
year. The deterioration is more than explained by unfavorable market factors and higher costs. The unfavorable volume
and mix is explained primarily by planned reductions in daily rental sales and lower small car share as well as
unfavorable series mix and option take rates ahead of the launch of our new products.
Net pricing is lower mainly due to Fusion and Escape, which had very low levels of incentives a year ago due to the
launch of these models. The higher costs are more than explained by the unfavorable $500 million related to the factors
previously discussed. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was lower than in fourth quarter 2013, more than explained
by unfavorable market factors, including higher incentive spending, unfavorable product mix, and lower industry
volume.

Ford's U.S. market share trends are shown on slide 12. Starting with the left chart, our total U.S. market share was
15.3% in the first quarter, down 0.6 percentage point from a year ago, reflecting planned reductions in daily rental sales
and lower small car retail share. Total F-Series share was unchanged from a year ago. Compared with the fourth
quarter, our market share was down 0.1 percentage point.
As shown in the right chart, our retail market share of the retail industry was 13.5% in the first quarter, down 0.5
percentage point from last year, explained primarily by lower small car segmentation and share performance as well as
F-Series. F-Series results reflect our disciplined approach to incentive spending as we manage inventory ahead of the
launch of the new F-150.
Compared with the fourth quarter, our retail market share was down 0.2 percentage point, with losses on F-Series offset
partially by Fusion and Escape. F-Series results reflect our disciplined incentive strategy as well as seasonal full-size
pickup segmentation trends.
Turning to our full-year guidance for North America, we continue to expect pre-tax profit to be lower than last year,
and operating margin to range from 8% to 9%.
Now let's turn to slide 13 and review South America, where we're continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our
product lineup and progressively replacing legacy products with global One Ford offerings. Now, however, we're also
dealing with slower GDP growth in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, along with political and
social turmoil in some countries.
In the first quarter, wholesale volume and revenue decreased from a year ago by 8% and 18% respectively. The lower
volume is more than explained by a 200,000 unit decline from last year's SAAR of 5.9 million units. This includes the
impact of import restrictions in Argentina and lower production in Venezuela, resulting from limited availability of
U.S. dollars.
The revenue decline is explained primarily by unfavorable exchange and unfavorable volume and mix, offset partially
by higher net pricing. Operating margin was negative 27%, down significantly. And pre-tax loss was $510 million, a
deterioration of $292 million. The balance sheet exchange effects discussed earlier account for about 75% of the
quarterly loss.
On slide 14, we show the factors causing a decline in South America's first quarter pre-tax results from a year ago. The
decline is explained by unfavorable exchange, higher cost mainly associated with economics-related effects caused by
high local inflation, and lower volume mainly due to the weaker industry. Although net pricing was substantial,
including some pricing associated with new products, it was not enough to offset the currency and inflation-related
effects.
As shown in the memo, pre-tax results deteriorated compared with fourth quarter 2013, more than explained by
unfavorable exchange. For the full year, we now expect South America to incur a larger loss than in 2013. Based on our
present assumptions, we expect the rest of the year to be about break-even to a small loss.
Let's turn now to Europe, beginning on slide 15, where we continue to implement our transformation plan and remain
on track to achieve profitability in 2015. Europe's wholesale volume and revenue improved from a year ago, up 11%
and 18% respectively. The volume increase is more than explained by higher industry volumes, reflecting a SAAR of
14.5 million units for the Europe 20 market, up over 1 million units, as well as favorable changes in dealer stocks and
higher market share for Europe 20.
The increase in revenue mainly reflects the higher volume and favorable exchange. Europe's operating margin was a
negative 2.5%, an improvement of 4 percentage points from a year ago, and the pre-tax loss was $194 million, a $231
million improvement. The first quarter loss includes $76 million of restructuring costs.
Slide 16 shows the factors that contributed to the improvement in Europe's first quarter pre-tax results from a year ago.
The improvement reflects lower cost, favorable market factors and favorable exchange. This was offset partially by
lower joint venture results and royalties in Russia and Turkey included in Other. As shown in the memo below the
chart, pre-tax results improved compared with fourth quarter 2013 with both factors favorable.

Our European market share trends are shown on slide 17. Starting with the left chart, our total first quarter market share
for Europe 20 was 8%, up three-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago, reflecting improved share from Mondeo
and Kuga. Although not shown on the chart, our commercial vehicle share also improved in the first quarter, driven by
the new Transit Connect as we continue to roll out our all-new commercial vehicle range.
As shown on the right chart, our passenger car share of the retail segment of the five major European markets was 8.3%
in the first quarter, down one-tenth of a percentage point from the same period last year. Lower share reflects adverse
segmentation changes, offset partially by improved performance for Fiesta and Kuga. We continue to focus on the
quality of our market share and improving our sales channel mix, achieving a higher share of the fleet segment in the
first quarter.
We're very pleased with the start to the year by our operations in Europe and the progress the team continues to make
in implementing our transformation plan, notwithstanding the external headwinds in Russia and Turkey. As a result,
our full-year guidance for Europe is unchanged. We expect results to improve compared with 2013.
Let's now turn to Middle East & Africa on slide 18. In the first quarter, we wholesaled 51,000 vehicles in the region,
3,000 fewer units a year ago. Revenue was $1.2 billion, $100 million lower. The lower volume reflects lower dealer
stock increases. The lower revenue is more than explained by the lower volume and unfavorable exchange, primarily
due to a weaker South Africa rand. Operating margin was 4.7%, up 1 percentage point from a year ago, and pre-tax
profit was $54 million, up $7 million. Our full-year guidance for Middle East & Africa remains unchanged. We expect
results to be about breakeven.
Let's now review Asia-Pacific on slide 19. Our strategy in Asia-Pacific continues to be to grow aggressively with an
expanding portfolio of One Ford products with manufacturing hubs in China, India and ASEAN. As shown on the left,
first quarter wholesale volume was up 32%, and net revenue, which excludes our China joint ventures, grew 19%. Our
China wholesale volume, not shown, was up 45% in the quarter. The higher volume in the region reflects mainly
improved market share. The higher industry volume also contributed.
We estimate the first quarter SAAR for the region at 38.9 million units, up 1.9 million units from a year ago, wholly
explained by China. Our first quarter market share was 3.4%, seven-tenths of a percentage point higher than a year ago.
This was driven by China where our market share improved nine-tenths of a percentage point to a record 4.5%,
reflecting continued strong sales of EcoSport, Kuga and Mondeo.
Asia-Pacific's higher revenue is more than explained by favorable mix and the higher volume. Operating margin was
11.1%, up 12.4 percentage points from a year ago, and pre-tax profit was $291 million, up $319 million. Strong results
in China drove the region's record profit.
The improvement in Asia-Pacific's first quarter pre-tax profit from a year ago was explained on slide 20. For the region,
the improvement in profitability is more than explained by favorable volume and mix and higher royalties from our
joint ventures included in Other. Higher costs, including investment for future growth, were a partial offset.
As shown in the memo, Asia-Pacific pre-tax results improved from fourth quarter 2013, explained primarily by lower
cost. For the full year, we now expect Asia-Pacific to earn a higher pre-tax profit than a year ago, improved from our
prior guidance of about [indiscernible] (25:00).
Let's turn now to Ford Credit, which remains key to our global growth strategy providing world-class dealer and
customer financial services, maintaining a strong balance sheet and producing solid profits and distributions. Slide 21
shows the factors that contributed to the largely-unchanged result from a year ago. Higher volume, reflecting increases
in nearly all products globally, was largely offset by unfavorable residual performance in North America.
As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was higher than in fourth quarter 2013, explained primarily by favorable lease
residual performance, as well as lower operating cost included in Other. These changes are consistent with normal
seasonality. For the full year, we now expect Ford Credit pre-tax profit to be about equal to higher than 2013. This
reflects improved financing margin performance. Our guidance for Ford Credit managed receivables, managed
leverage and distributions to its parent is unchanged.

Next on slide 22 is our Automotive gross cash and operating-related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the
quarter was $25.2 billion, $400 million higher than year-end 2013. Automotive operating-related cash flow was $1.2
billion with favorable changes in working capital and Automotive profit, offset partially by unfavorable timing and
other differences, as well as net spending. During the quarter, we contributed $500 million to our global funded pension
plans, down substantially from the last two years, due to the recent improvements in the funded status of our plan.
Dividends paid in the quarter totaled about $500 million.
Slide 23 shows that Automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.7 billion, unchanged from year-end 2013. We
ended the quarter with net cash of $9.5 billion, and Automotive liquidity of $36.6 billion, both $400 million higher than
year-end 2013. Although not yet included in our total liquidity, we're in process of amending and extending our
corporate revolving credit facility. The facility, which is presently $10.7 billion, is expected to grow to about $12
billion. This will provide the company with additional liquidity as we expand our business globally and continues to
show the great support we have from our global and growing bank group for the One Ford plan.
Consistent with our capital and funding strategy, we plan to allocate $2 billion to Ford Credit to support its liquidity.
We expect to close this transaction later this month, and we'll provide details in our first quarter 10-Q filing.
This concludes our review of the financial details of our first quarter earnings. So with that, I'd now like to turn it back
to Alan, who'll take us through our outlook for the business environment, as well as our 2014 planning assumptions and
key metrics. Alan?
Alan R. Mulally
Thank you, Bob. Slide 24 summarizes our view of the business environment for 2014. We project global economic
growth to be in the 2.5% to 3% range and global industry sales to be about 85 million to 90 million units. U.S.
economic growth is projected to be in the 2.5% to 3% range, with industry sales still supported by replacement demand,
as a result of the older age of vehicles on the road. Near-term conditions have shown signs of improvement after some
weakness in January and February data.
In South America, Brazil's economy is slowing due to high interest rates put in place to contain inflation, while the
situation in Argentina and Venezuela remains volatile with both economies facing unclear economic policy direction.
In Europe, an economic recovery is under way. For 2014, we expect GDP growth of about 1% in the euro area and 2%
to 2.5% in the UK. The European Central Bank left its policy interest rate unchanged in a 0.25% in April and indicated
that it will keep rates low for an extended period. The Bank of England also indicated they will keep rates low until
economic growth reduces excess capacity in UK economy.
And in Asia-Pacific, China's economic growth is expected to be slightly below 7.5% with several challenges, including
excess capacity and excess debt. The government intends to be more focused on structural reform and is willing to
accept lower growth within a reasonable range of 7.5%. Growth in India is expected to improve modestly to about 5%
from last year, as high inflation and high interest rates remain impediments to stronger growth. Overall, despite
challenges in the emerging markets, we expect global economic growth to continue in 2014.
Slide 25 recaps the guidance disclosed earlier for all of our business units, as well as for net interest expense. Other
than South America, the guidance has improved or unchanged. Our company guidance for 2014 is detailed on slide 26.
We continue to expect full-year industry volume to range from 16 million units to 17 million units in the U.S., and
China to range from 22.5 million units to 24.5 million units. We now expect Europe 20 markets to be in the 14 million
unit to 15 million unit range, reflecting improved economic growth prospects and replacement demand.
In terms of our financial performance, we continue to expect Automotive revenue to be about equal to 2013,
Automotive operating margin to be lower than 2013, and Automotive operating-related cash flow to be substantially
lower than 2013. This includes capital spending of about $7.5 billion to support new or significantly refreshed products
and capacity actions.

We now expect Ford Credit pre-tax profit to be about equal to or higher than 2013, and we continue to expect company
pre-tax profit to be in the $7 billion to $8 billion range, as we continue to create innovative products such as the all-new
F-150.
Overall, we expect 2014 to be a solid year for the Ford Motor Company and a critical next step forward in
implementing our One Ford plan to continue delivering profitable growth for all.
In closing, our One Ford plan is built on a compelling vision, comprehensive strategy and relentless implementation.
Our One Ford plan continues to deliver profitable growth around the world, and we are absolutely focused on building
great products, creating a stronger business and contributing to a better world.
We delivered solid results in the first quarter, despite several significant adverse factors that are not representative of
the underlying run rate of our business, and challenges in several important emerging markets. We remain on track in
implementing our plan for full year 2014, including continued strength from North America, although down from
recent years, as we launched three times the number of products as in 2013; a loss in South America as we adjust to
changing environment; and continued risk in Argentina and Venezuela; successful execution of our transformational
plan for Europe as we progress towards profitability in 2015 notwithstanding new challenges in Russia and Turkey;
launch of our Middle East & Africa business unit, continued strong growth and profitability in Asia-Pacific, consistent
solid performance from our Ford Credit operation and positive operating – Automotive operating-related cash flow.
Now we will be pleased to take your questions. George?

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.
Please proceed.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Hey, good morning, everybody. Two brief questions. First, on the Asia-Pacific margin, 11.1%,
pretty astonishing result. I think that's about at least three times maybe the margin that the market expected. Can I give
you a chance right now to kind of say hold your horses folks; please don't extrapolate this; consider the following
headwinds that should keep us lower than that? That's my first question.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Okay. So, I'll say, hold some of your horses. We have improved our guidance, so we do
expect the region to contribute more positively than we did three months ago because the performance is strong, and it's
being driven by China and the great response that consumers are giving our products and our brands, so it is going to
do better.
I would not multiply it times four, which I think is the gist of the question, Adam. And that's largely around the fact
that we still have these six plants under construction. Some of them will be coming onstream later this year. I think two
other ones come onstream in 2015. So as we get closer to launch of those facilities, the costs will increase. We bring
people on board. We start to train them before we start producing, that type of thing.
The other factor is we've got Lincoln launching later this year. Of course, we're already incurring expense related to
that, but as we get closer to the launch in the latter part of the year, there will be more expense associated with that. So I

think those are the caveats I would put on, but clearly the region is doing fabulously and we think it's going to have a
great, great year. And finally, we've been talking about and it's been eking through a bit more quarter by quarter. You're
starting to see the payoff of the big investments in the region.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Yes, it's really moving the needle now. All right, second question on the F-Series changeover,
another chance for you to take this opportunity to tell us anything in the remaining quarters of the year outlook,
particularly in the second half for your like – aside from the 13-weeks downtime and the cadence there you've already
talked about that you might say please, guys, this is complicated, big, big change for us, add a little more – any chance
we'd add any more caution in that second half outlook in North America for us or not? Thanks.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Let me give a couple comments first broadly, and then Mark can comment further on
F-Series. So one thing I would say first at the company level, we had a solid start for the year. And I'm sure we're going
to get questions throughout the call on slide seven and the factors that we showed as being standouts, if you will, in
terms of the size and the fact they're all occurring in the quarter. But we see the run rate of the business as being very
healthy and very strong both in cases of total company, North America, I'd even say in South America and you heard
my comments about the balance of the year. Clearly the first quarter is not indicative of what we expect in the balance
of the year there.
So the run rate of the business is much healthier than what the initial view of the bottom line would see. In fact, if
anything, when you think about the emerging market issues, which are more intense than what we expected three
months ago, we're absorbing that and still think the business is going to deliver what we expected. And in fact, we're
now starting to see elements of the business where we're changing the guidance upward. So I just want to give you that
sense of how we're seeing the overall business.
In terms of calendarization of profits for the balance of the year, what I'll say is that we expect the rest of the quarters to
be substantially stronger than what we're seeing in the first quarter. And of course, things will fluctuate from quarter to
quarter, but they should all be better than what we're seeing in the first quarter. And so, Mark, do you want to comment
on F-Series?
<A - Mark Fields>: Overall, Adam, the preparations for the launch are going well and the team is very energized.
They're going through obviously a number of the production builds, but it's going on plan. As we mentioned last
quarter, we had three weeks of the downtime of the 2013 in the first quarter. And remember, we mentioned that
inclusive of that 2013 was the summer shutdown week, so you can deduce what quarter that will be in. But clearly, as
we said, we've got a manufacturing launch in the fourth quarter, so you can pretty much surmise where a lot of the
downtime is going to be as we get the plant ready to go.
But overall, when you stand back and look at our F-Series business, even with the existing model, our share is about the
same as the full year for last year. We continue to run the plants, I think, very efficiently. Our transaction prices are
actually holding up very well. Actually, when you look at our transaction prices for our 2014 model year, they're
probably at the top of the segment of the under-8,500 pound GVWR. So that business is doing well.
We're also looking at potential production opportunities for the existing F-Series in the remainder of this year. We have
more work to do. That could help us potentially get to the upper half of the margin range that we have for North
America, but we have some more work to do on that.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Yes, I just want to focus on the China results and two related questions. One, can you give
us the outlook for Asia-Pacific ex-China? And just directionally, is that getting better, about the same, or worse?
And then secondly, within China, how much of your success is from CUVs versus the car lineup? How do you feel
about your CUV position competitively? And as you bring these plants on board, how are they going to be split

between producing CUVs and cars?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Okay, Brian, I'll handle the first one and Mark will address the second one. So as I
mentioned in the remarks earlier, the quarter's results were driven by China, and I think that's both in terms of the
year-over-year results and an absolute. The rest of Asia-Pacific is not as strong. It's not necessarily a drag on the
business, but it's in a different plate, I think, in terms of where we are and putting in place the big global production
hubs that we're working on in India and also in Thailand. So I think we'll see them start to contribute in a more positive
way a little bit after, if you will, the results that we're seeing now with China. Mark?
<A - Mark Fields>: On the second question, when you look at our share performance in China, as Bob mentioned up
front, it was actually – it was a record for the quarter, 4.5%, which was up a point versus a year ago.
When you look at some of the elements driving that, to your point, when you look at the segment, the SUV-CUV
segment in China, as an industry it was up about 28%. Our sales were up almost 300%. And the reason for that was, all
the products that we introduced last year, the EcoSport, we have the Explorer there, the Kuga, so we have a full lineup
there. That's been a really important part of our growth in addition to the car side of the business, which we've done
very well with. And then when you look at the texture of that, a lot of our growth has been in the Tier 3 through Tier 6
cities, and that's been supported by our network expansion. And when you think of maybe some of the infrastructure
around there, it lends itself well to SUVs and CUVs.
And actually the type of demographics of the customer that we're getting is very encouraging. In addition to the profile
of the segmentation, we're getting younger customers than the industry average. And interestingly, depending upon the
model line, 70% to 90% of customers that are buying our vehicles, it's either a first-time purchase or an addition to the
car in the household. So I think that bodes well for us going forward.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Interesting. So the CUV almost becomes the plus-one car for the mass affluent in China?
<A - Mark Fields>: We're also doing well. We continue to do well with our Focus. As we said, our overall sales in the
first quarter were up 45%, so we're doing well with Focus. Fusion is doing very well there, and the Mondeo is actually
doing very well, or Mondeo is the Fusion, so both of them. It's a combination of both, but clearly our full family of
SUVs and CUVs has really helped turbocharge that.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Mark Fields>: You bet.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Great, thanks for taking my questions. One, any color on why the recall cost was so large within
the quarter, and is it the nature of the repair? Just any color on why it is such a large recall cost is my first question.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: I've been waiting for this. Thanks, Colin. I appreciate the question, I really do. Because this
is a really important thing that we explain, so let go into a little bit of detail here. So first of all, this is a warranty
reserve adjustment, and I need to explain how we at Ford account for field service actions. We use something that's
called a pattern estimation model. So what that means is that every time that we sell a vehicle, we actually accrue a bit
of reserve, if you will, for field service actions that could happen in the future, so nothing specific in terms of a
particular issue or a problem. But based on history, we expect that something could happen, so we reserve for that.
And then what we do as we go forth in time, go forward in time, we then top that reserve up or we might take it down
based on what we're seeing to changes in more recent history, if you will. I think we go back to about 2008 right now,
so we don't go all the way back, but drop a year every year. And so it's just all based on history and what actually
happened.

So what we've seen, we have seen more recalls at Ford and across the whole industry in the last couple of years or so.
And so as that has occurred, what we've had to do is we've had to continue to look at the reserves and adjust them, and
that's what's happening in this quarter. It's based on a process that is disciplined, written in concrete. There's nothing
behind this beyond just the update of the data and letting the data tell us that we need to increase the reserves based on
what's happened.
Now, a couple of other things to let you know is if we then have vehicles that are older, for example, than 2008 and
something happens, what we do is we actually have the impact of that flow right through to the bottom line because we
don't have any reserves in place because we only hold them for, as I said, maybe six, seven, eight years.
If there's also another little tweak on this, if there is an action that exceeds in the case of North America, $250 million
of cost, we'll let that go right to the bottom line, so we wouldn't adjust our reserves, if you will, on a go-forward basis
for that action. We just let it flow through to the bottom line. And actually, we had an instance of that at one point last
year. So, this is simply a reserve adjustment, it's accounting, it's not cash, it's not related to any particular problem that
we know of, or that we're concerned about. It's just an anticipation that something could happen based on what we've
seen in terms of patterns of data over the model years that we're talking about.
So, based on that and letting our process work, we've increased the reserves in the quarter by about $400 million in
total and most of that is related to what I've talked about in terms of just topping up the reserve. So hopefully,
everybody understands that and recognizes it is what it is, but it's not a problem per se.
<Q - Colin Langan>: And how often is that calculation done? Is that a quarterly analysis that you do or is that an
annual?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: This particular adjustment is we conduct what are called deep dives twice a year. It's in the
first quarter and the third quarter, so that's why it's happening in this quarter. And if I go back, because I did go back to
look at – I expected that you guys might ask about what happened in the past, I'm looking at 2013, and we actually
didn't have much that was taking place in 2013. We have one quarter where we had some reserve adjustments going on,
but coincidentally in that quarter we also had a supplier recovery on a particular action which sort of offset that. So
that's why we didn't call either the recovery or the reserve adjustment up because they were sort of offsetting each
other.
<Q - Colin Langan>: One last question. I believe in your comments, you said that North America margins should be
in the 8% to 9% range. You're starting off at 7.3%, and there are a lot of launch costs in the second half of the year. Is
that still a valid range to think about for the full year, or did I mishear that?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: No, absolutely, because when you think about the first quarter, we were at 7.3%, including
all the things that we've just been talking about, the weather issues, the reserve adjustments. So, if you think about the
run rate of the business in the quarter, we were nearly at 10% in North America. As the year progresses, we have a lot
of new products that will be coming in addition to the F-Series. Some of that will give us some favorable product mix
this quarter. We had unfavorable series mix and options, but that will start to be offset by favorable product mix as the
year progresses.
The other thing I think that is different than where we were three months ago, we guided to the fact that we thought
North America would have negative pricing for the year, and certainly we see that in the quarter. But as we look ahead,
I think we're starting to see the possibility of that being maybe more flat, maybe potentially somewhat positive because
the overall environment has been a bit more positive, more disciplined across the industry, in general, than what we
maybe thought would be the case three months ago.
Mark, anything to add?
<A - Mark Fields>: No. Just mentioned earlier, as we look at that 8% to 9%, we're looking at additional production
opportunities on the current F-Series which, all things being equal, could actually push us up in the upper range of that,
but we have some more work to do.

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: You bet.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: There have been a couple already on China and Asia-Pacific, but I would like to approach it
from a little bit different of an angle. Obviously, the results there are quite strong despite the impact of some pretty
aggressive growth-related investments. So, I am curious what comments that you could make regarding the potential
earnings power of this region a few years out, after which presumably we could see some tapering of the growth
investments.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: We've said I think, Ryan, for quite a long time that we thought towards mid-decade or so
that the region would contribute very meaningfully significantly to the bottom line of the company. And I think that's
still our point of view. We expect this to be one of the larger regions of the business going forward. It is the largest
region of the world in terms of industry, and we're making great progress and taking – and participating in that.
We also have capacity increases that are still ahead of us. We have more expansion of our product portfolio ahead of
us. As I mentioned earlier, we see India and Southeast Asia maybe lagging a bit behind where we are in China in terms
of the maturity of our investments there, so I think that's an opportunity down the road. So, I think we feel like this will
be a region that will definitely be a meaningful significant contributor to Ford's bottom line.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay, great, thanks. And then for my second and final question, I guess maybe just one on
South America. You continue to take really a lot of price down there and at the same time, some of the vehicle
production forecasters, IHS, et cetera, they have recently slashed their expectations for sales and production in the back
half of the year a lot, including for you guys. So I wonder if you think that it might be a concern as we transition to a
potentially I guess softer demand environment, that it might become more difficult to continue to offset with price the
inflationary currency pressures as well as you have been in recent years.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: I think it's different by market. We're actually – at least up till now, we've been able to more
or less, maybe it depends on timing of a quarter because we've seen such significant depreciation that sometimes you
can't fully recapture that all in a quarter.
But I think in the case of Venezuela and in the case of Argentina, we've seen better ability to over a relatively
reasonable period of time, to offset the effect of operating exchange weakness or – and/or local inflation. I think it's
different in Brazil. It's a much more competitive environment. All that capacity, as you mentioned, that's coming in, it's
making it, I think, a tougher place in order to capture, to offset, if you will, the effects that I talked about.
I think the thing that is a positive for us, though, is the complete transformation of the portfolio, all the new products
that are coming in, some are still ahead of us because we are seeing an extremely favorable response from consumers
both in terms of what it's done for us in share but also our ability to get a really healthy price, a transaction price for
those products. But nonetheless, Brazil is – we've been talking about this for some time of being a concern around the
competitive environment, all the capacity coming in.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay, I appreciate all the color.
<A - Alan R. Mulally>: The only other thing I'd add to Bob's point about the product lineup and working on the
revenue side. As you can imagine, following our process of looking at the business environment, the team there is very
focused on optimizing our footprint that we have down there. We're working on our logistical costs, which are very
important, material cost reductions, seeing where we can accelerate localization actions and just overall structural cost
improvements, so we're working both sides of the profit equation for that part of the world.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Very helpful, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Good morning, everybody. I was hoping – just not to harp on this too much but the field service
charge is a pretty big number. Can you just elaborate on how much of it is related to adjusting the pattern estimation
model, how much of it is discrete and how much is older vehicles? You did mention that there were some 2001 to 2005
vehicles in there, which obviously is going to raise some questions in light of what some others are dealing with. So
what is the issue there, and maybe if you could just say specifically what is the issue with the 2001 to 2005 models?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yeah, and they're all public. We have about $400 million associated with the field service
actions. Of that, about $350 million relates to the 2009 through 2013 model years. Is it 2008, 2009? 2008 through 2013
model years. We then had two issues that were pretty older model years. We have a Crown Vic rim – I think it's a
Crown Vic Grand Marquis lighting control module that was a recall. That was for the 2003-2005 model years. That
was about – maybe about $30 million to $40 million. And then we had an Escape subframe issue that was roughly $30
million, and that was 2001 through 2004. And then there was maybe about $10 million of just general offset to all of
that.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay, so none of it...
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Most of it is the reserve adjustments. The other two are relatively small.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. So there is not like a review of historical vehicles or something like that that's unusual?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: No, no, no. Those are simply – we're always looking at data to understand where we have
issues. Those were things that clearly popped up and indicated that we had an issue, and per our normal process
addressed them ASAP.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. And just two more things, just your material costs have been, in North America, a really
big offset to the price and mix recently through the past three quarters in a row. Obviously, it's dependent on timing of
new launches. Could you just give us some thoughts on how we should be thinking about price mix versus materials
looking forward?
And then on China, you mentioned again that you have a lot of plants, six plants that are in launch and you had
previously said that higher launch costs are going to be a factor this year, but this quarter it seems like your cost
structure was actually improved. So can you quantify the magnitude of the launch costs that you would anticipate for
this year?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: In the case of North America for the full year, we still would expect to see, I think positive
material cost overall. We're seeing very good material cost reductions. We will have, as the new products are
introduced, increases related to them, but because they're launching, if you will, more second half, if you will, at least a
lot of the volume on a year-over-year basis, the effect will be probably more in 2015 than in this year.
In the case of Asia-Pacific, what we're seeing there is, as you said, the quarter doesn't indicate what we expect to see for
the full year. But for the full year, we'll see more cost come in and that will largely be around spending-related
manufacturing more in terms of engineering and also advertising sales promotions as we launch and support the
products. And then our general admin and expense selling will go up. Some of that related to Lincoln, some of it just
related to the overall growth of the business that we need to put resources in place to support it.
So, it's really across – I guess I'm saying all parts of the business, but it's going to be sort of a growth quarter-by-quarter
as the business expands.

<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Yes, thank you. Actually just sort of building on that last question on Europe, the
losses were pared back more than I think a number of us had thought. Can you just give us a sense of sequentially how
some of the cost cadence plays out because I guess you still have the big Mondeo launch right at Valencia, which I
imagine is going to be sort of a headwind and any other factors obviously we are not thinking about as we sort of try
and model that out?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: I guess I'd say, first of all you know that there's a sort of a pattern to profits in general in
Europe. Usually the first half is better than the second half. Third quarter – I don't think that was the case last year, but
third quarter is usually a weaker quarter because of the extensive plant shutdowns that take place for holidays and so
forth. Of course, all of that, as you said, Pat, is dependent upon particular cadence of product launches that we have
over the course of the year.
But again there we've had some launches, and we're launching actually some things right now in Europe. So, I don't
know that I'd call out any particular thing in terms of the cadence of our structural costs going forward. I think probably
the fluctuations up and down will be more around volume levels and I don't think I'd call anything else out.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay. That is helpful. And one other one on South America. Can you – you might
have said it, but can you kind of parse out what was sort of balance sheet re-measurement in Venezuela versus what
was just kind of operating headwinds just from the lack of volume? And maybe can you give us a sense of just what
you are seeing on the ground there? I mean it sounds like production is at a standstill. I understand visibility is poor, but
what are the prospects for that to improve in coming quarters?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: You're talking about Venezuela specifically?
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Yes. Yes.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: So, maybe Mark can comment, and I'll just – in terms of the balance sheet effects of the
amount that we talked about on slide seven, $310 million of that is Venezuela specifically. About $70 million is related
to Argentina. And then on a year-over-year basis, you can see on slide 14, on a year-over-year basis, the balance sheet
effect was roughly half of what we're seeing in total. And of that, a good portion of that – well actually, most of the
overall effect is actually Argentina and Venezuela, a bit of Brazil.
<A - Mark Fields>: Yeah. From a volume standpoint and an industry standpoint in Venezuela, as we said last quarter,
what we did in the fourth quarter of last year was literally cut our production by three quarters versus the running rate
in the first three quarters of 2013. And what we mentioned is that's our assumption going forward the remainder of
2014. And when you look at the industry development, to put it in perspective, the first quarter of last year, the
Venezuela industry was about 113,000 units on a SAAR basis. This year it's 12,000 units. So, I think we've baked those
assumptions into our plan and we'll continue to watch the environment there and also continue to support our
Venezuelan customers, at the same time minimize our exposures.

Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great, thank you. Good morning. Just going back to the warranty item in the quarter, Bob, why
wouldn't that also potentially impact other regions if you're assessing the overall experience just given the company's
global platforms and commonality?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Because in part, some of the products may not be in some of the regions. We do the same
reserve analysis everywhere. You also have different suppliers. In some cases, products are tailored to different
designs, different powertrains. So they're global but there are differences region by region. Also, as we launch, we don't
launch everything all at one time. So as we launch in one region then the next and the next and the next, we learn from
the first region and we build those learnings into launch of the next region, including design changes and so forth. So
it's not all apples and apples, if you will.

<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Sure. And then the second question, I'm hoping to gauge your temperature on the mid-decade 8%
to 9% margin outlook. I know in December you labeled it at-risk, citing Europe. It seems like Europe is probably going
better, Asia is certainly going better, but South America going worse. Just maybe give us an update of what you're
thinking. Is that more at risk, less at risk, or roughly the same today than it was in December?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: I don't think at the moment I'd say anything different.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Okay, the same. Okay, great, thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take questions from the media. Your next question comes from the line of Dee-Ann
Durbin with Associated Press. Please proceed.
<Q - Dee-Ann Durbin>: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the call. Alan, it's time for my quarterly
question about your future. There is some speculation out there, obviously that the leadership change is going to happen
earlier than the end of this year. Can you comment on whether the plans have changed?
<A - Alan R. Mulally>: Clearly, we don't comment on speculation and we have no change to the plan. And I just
might point out, as I think you well know, is that Bill and I have put a very high priority seven years ago that we would
further develop our team worldwide and have a very robust leadership development and succession plan, and we're
very, very pleased with the progress on that to date. Thanks.
<Q - Dee-Ann Durbin>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. Please proceed.
<Q - David Whiston>: Thanks for getting me in, a question on the credit line extension. Is that primarily being done to
increase the capital liquidity, or are you also expecting some higher CapEx than planned or even returning more cash to
shareholders down the road?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Thanks for the question. No, it's just basically as we get bigger and as we continue to expand
and grow, we thought it was prudent for us to take advantage of actually very strong interest from our global banking
group and also very healthy capital markets for us to increase and extend the credit facility. The other thing that's great
about it is we're actually returning now to a normal credit facility five-year term. I think it's the first time we've been
there for quite a number of years with this change, so we feel very positive about that too. So that's it. That's what's
behind it.
<Q - David Whiston>: Okay. And the incentive spending in North America, I know you've got some pretty tough
comps in the U.S. given how well you guys have been doing there. But this quarter unfavorable headwinds from
volume and mix combined with the incentive spending. Are you guys more just playing defense now for now until the
next generation F-Series is out?
<A - Mark Fields>: I think overall when you look at our incentive spend, we look at our incentive spend in
conjunction with our overall margins and transaction prices. And when you look at our transaction prices, they're at the
top end of the industry, and it reinforces the margin that we have in North America. Clearly, in a number of our
products, they're late in their lifecycle, so we're accounting for that. And also at the same time as those new products
come on, that will offer us opportunities once those products are launched. So that's the way we're looking at it,
balanced and making sure we profitably grow and take care to that.

<A - Robert L. Shanks>: And, David, I would just add that in the quarter comparison, which is what you're seeing in
the data today, a bit of that is, if you will, a difficult comp because last year, we had just launched the Kuga and we had
just launched the Fusion. They were in very, very high demand. We had very tight supplies, and so incentive levels for
those products were very, very low, and those are high-volume products for us. Now it's more normal if you will.
<Q - David Whiston>: Okay, thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Flock with FOX Business Network. Please proceed.
<Q - Jeff Flock>: Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Mr. Mulally, just to confirm and to clarify what you said earlier, I'm
sorry that I have ask about this, but there you go. Earlier, I believe you said you were going to stick to the plan in terms
of succession. And I think if I recall correctly, you said that you plan to serve through the end of 2014. Does that then
indicate that the plan that you will serve through the end of 2014. Can you clarify that?
<A - Alan R. Mulally>: Jeff, no change to the plan.
<Q - Jeff Flock>: I appreciate that clarification. And the rumors that you're going to coach the Detroit Lions, is that
still a non-starter?
<A - Alan R. Mulally>: Yes. That's very interesting, but Bill has a great plan for the Lions.
<Q - Jeff Flock>: So just to confirm, no change to the plan that was announced earlier, and the plan which was you
plan to serve through the end of 2014?
<A - Alan R. Mulally>: No change to the plan, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff Flock>: Copy that, sir. I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Karl Henkel with Detroit News. Please proceed.
<Q - Karl Henkel>: Good morning, gentlemen, one quick question back to the warranty reserve. Is there any way that
you put that in context? How big is that reserve? And I guess being up $400 million versus Q1 of 2013 in that
department, I guess what is it a typical year-over-year increase when you look at the reserve directionally heading
upward?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Thanks, Karl, two responses there. One at the end of last year, our total warranty reserve,
which would include for field service actions, was $3.9 billion for the company. And in terms of the second question,
this is an unusually large increase. And as I mentioned earlier, if I go back and look at the four quarters of last year, we
did not have something of this magnitude occur, so this is unusual. That's exactly why we're calling it out, so that
everybody understands the run rate of the business because you wouldn't expect something like this to happen
quarter-in and quarter-out.
<Q - Karl Henkel>: I guess is there any significant impact, as a follow-up, on just the global sales growth for Ford
over the last few years and looking into the future having a significant impact on that number increasing further, or am
I looking into that too much?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: You mean related to the warranty reserve increase?

<Q - Karl Henkel>: Yes.
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: I don't think so. Because, again, I think what you're seeing across the whole industry is all
OEMs responding very, very quickly in general to the issues that they see. Vehicles have a lot more technology and
they're far more complex. I just think that this just seems to be more of a general industry phenomenon. And
unfortunately, because we don't like product recalls on field service actions, unfortunately that's been our history as
well over the last couple of years. It's really an industry phenomenon.
<A - Alan R. Mulally>: And also, Karl, if you look from our perspective, we're really pleased with the quality levels
we're seeing, clearly all-time record highs in some parts of the world. And even here in the U.S. we're starting to see
some encouraging quality data, which hopefully will then lead through to a better performance, based on the reserves
we set up. But as we said, we're very committed to delivering best-in-class quality to our customers and everybody is
focused on that and encouraging signs.
<Q - Karl Henkel>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey with Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.
<Q - Mike Ramsey>: Hi. Good morning. Karl, kind of stole some of my thunder, but – so if I say that the warranty
reserve is reflective of a larger number of recalls over the last several years, not just for Ford, but also for the industry.
Is that an accurate statement?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Well, the warranty reserves are going up because of our experience. What I am trying to say
is that our experience though is not necessarily unique, if you will, to the automotive industry, you are seeing more and
more companies, higher number of recalls, higher number of units being affected, and that's an industry phenomenon.
But what drives our warranty reserves is our experience.
<Q - Mike Ramsey>: And just as a follow-up, I think it was 2007, wasn't there the inverse of this that was beneficial?
There was a big readjustment of warranty reserves some time I think it was 2007, am I crazy or does anyone remember
those?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yeah. I think that's – it could have been because one of the things that as I mentioned, we
only hold these reserves for about six or seven years. So if that the – when that oldest year, if you will, is ready to run
off as we move into the next calendar year. If there is anything left in that reserve that hasn't been used, we release it.
So it's possible that that could have happened back in 2007, somewhere in that timeframe. I actually remember
something like that as well, Mike, but I know we've had situations like that.
<Q - Mike Ramsey>: Okay, thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Alisa Priddle with Detroit Free Press. Please proceed.
<Q - Alisa Priddle>: Oh, good morning, gentlemen. First, a question for Mark. If you could just clarify, when you say
you want to get more production of current F-150, so are you talking about running more over time in plants or
changing the changeover schedule or what kinds of things that you're looking at?
<A - Mark Fields>: We're working very closely with our supply base. In terms of seeing if they can support some
additional production opportunities and that may mean running more overtime at some of our – whether it is Dearborn
Truck as we run out the existing model and get ready for the new one or in Kansas City where, as you know, we're not
launching that plant till next year.

So, yes, it's so far encouraging, more work to do, but it involves the whole team. And the good news, Alisa, is it's really
based on market demand. And as we said, if you look at the month of March and another month where we sold over
70,000 F-Series, so the demand is out there, customers really like the product, the existing product. And we're going to
trying to get as many as we can to them.
<Q - Alisa Priddle>: Okay. So, you're not talking about changing any of the dates of changeover?
<A - Mark Fields>: No.
<Q - Alisa Priddle>: Those are locked in.

Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Alan R. Mulally>: John.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Just two quick questions for you. First, when you guys were on slide 12 and talking about the
drivers of a slight market share deterioration, you mentioned daily rent and small cars declining. It seems like that is
kind of a trend that has been happening, but also something you might be doing more actively as your larger vehicles
are getting more fuel-efficient and particularly as we think forward to the launch of the F-150 where you guys have
alluded to the fact that it will be net accretive to your CAFE measurements and standalone on its own. Are we sort of
seeing the precursor in the potential for you to deemphasize the not so profitable small car business as we go forward?
<A - Alan R. Mulally>: Absolutely not. We're focused on delivering what customers want and it's not really driven –
those are kind of not the way we're thinking about it. We're thinking very much from a customer and a market-end
standpoint. As you know, we're doing well with our car lineup. We're doing well with our truck lineup. And we're
going to go wherever the customer demands with that full family of vehicles.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. But if they demand larger more fuel-efficient vehicles and not many small cars, you
will go that direction, you will go where the market goes?
<A - Alan R. Mulally>: Well, we're always going to match capacity to demand, and in the context of running a good
business and profitably growing.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. And then a second question, you guys mentioned $2 billion of the new credit facility
would be allocated to Ford Motor Credit. Just curious what that is relative to history and are we seeing more capital
being allocated to Ford Motor Credit so you can grow that business significantly sort of similar to where it was
historically?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: Yeah. No, we haven't done that before and we're doing that so that we can allow them to
diversify their overall funding structure. So it's just a better balance sheet for Ford Credit to support their, own overall
funding structure.

<Q - John J. Murphy>: So it's less of a reliance on the securitization market and more of a reliance on your sort of
on-balance sheet financing now?
<A - Robert L. Shanks>: No, it's also to support, we had something called FCAR in the past, which we're actually
moving away from it. And we're going to replace that with more unsecured debt and this is just part of supporting that.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay, great. Thank you.
