MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Angela and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Third Quarter FY 2013 Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute, to
prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] Thank you.
Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin.
Richard A. Galanti
Thank you, Angela and good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our third quarter operating
results for the 12 weeks ended May 12.
As with every call, let me start by stating that the discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and that these statements involve risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such
statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other
risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.
So to begin with our 12-week second quarter, for the quarter earnings per share came in at $1.04 per share, up 18%
from last year's third quarter earnings per share of $0.88. For the third quarter, total sales were up 8% and our reported
comparable sales figure was up 5%. During the quarter, sales were impacted by both gasoline price deflation and by

weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year such that the 6% U.S. comp sales increase in
Q3, excluding gas deflation, would have been 7%. Our reported 4% international comp figure assuming flat
year-over-year FX rates would have been plus 7% and total company comps, again reported for the quarter at 5%,
excluding both gas deflation and FX impact would have come in at 7% as well for the quarter.
In terms of new openings, after opening 14 new locations during the first half of the fiscal year, we opened five
additional Costcos in the third quarter. Two in Japan, in Kitakyushu and Hiroshima, and one each in Chihuahua,
Mexico; Wheaton, Maryland; and Southampton, UK. All told, that puts our fiscal year 2013 openings through the third
quarter at 19 new locations, and we now operate 627 Costco warehouses around the world. Between now and
September 1, the end of our fiscal year, we expect to open an additional nine locations. Three in the U.S., three in Japan
and one each in the UK, Taiwan and Australia, such that we'll most likely end the fiscal year with 28 new openings for
the year. And that's up, hard to believe, from 16 net openings in fiscal 2012. Also this morning, I'll review with you our
membership trends, our e-commerce activity and, of course, additional discussion about margins and SG&A.
For our third quarter again sales were up 8% from $21.85 billion last year in the third quarter to $23.55 billion. Again,
comps on a reported basis were plus 5%. 5% reported comp sales results were a combination of a flat average
transaction for the quarter. Of course that included the detriment from both the FX and gasoline, which together
represented about 1.5% and an average shopping frequency increase of about 5.5%. That compares to a fiscal
year-to-date shopping frequency number of 4.5%, so pretty strong frequency there.
Cannibalization for the quarter was pretty similar to what it was the prior quarter. That negatively impacted sales by
approximately 60 basis points, and given our expansion I don't anticipate much change in that. In terms of sales
comparisons by geographic regions, all U.S. regions were in the mid to high single-digit comp increases with Texas in
the Southeast being the strongest. Internationally, expressed in local currencies, Korea and Taiwan were on the weak
end of that range with Canada and Mexico being the strongest in terms of comp sales increases.
In terms of merchandise categories, in terms of sales by merchandise category for the quarter, for the third quarter
within Food and Sundries, mostly in the mid single-digit range with deli, beer and wine and candy being the relative
standouts. Within hardlines, overall in the high single-digit range and departments with the strongest results were
hardware, Lawn and Garden and consumer electronics. Consumer electronics by the way were, sales were in the mid to
high single-digit range for the quarter. For soft lines, up about 10%. Small electrics, housewares, jewelry and apparel
were the standouts with media as expected continuing to be on the relatively weak side. And within fresh foods where
comp sales were in the high single-digit range, deli and produce showed a little better results than the other areas.
Moving to the line items of the income statement, membership fees came in at $531 million, up 12% or $56 million
from last year's $475 million, also representing about an 8 basis point increase year-over-year. In terms of membership,
we continue to enjoy the strong renewal rates, and I'll go through that in a minute. Continued increasing penetration of
the executive membership, and of course, as I've mentioned for several quarters now, we're still benefiting from the $5
and $10 membership fee increases that began in November 2011 in the U.S. and Canada for new sign-ups and in
January of 2012 for renewals.
Due to deferred accounting treatment for membership fees that $56 million increase during Q3, a little over half of it
was due to that annual fee increase and how that rolls into the book P&L over about a – just under a two-year period.
And as previously mentioned, the membership fee income will continue to benefit from this deferred accounting for
that fee increase throughout the fourth quarter of 2013 and to a lesser extent into the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2014
this fall. New membership sign-ups in Q3 company-wide were very strong, up 19% year-over-year. That strong
performance is mostly reflective of the very strong sign-ups we had in our Asia openings this past March in Japan.
In terms of number of members at Q3 end, at Q2 end we had 27.8 million Gold Star members. At Q3 end 12 weeks
later, that was 28.2 million. Primary business went from 6.5 million a quarter ago to 6.6 million. Add-ons remained at
3.5 million and you add those numbers up, by Q2 end we had 37.9 million member households and 38.3 million at the
end of the quarter. With the extra spouse card, 69.1 million at Q2 end and 69.9 million at Q3 end.

At May 12, the third quarter end, paid executive memberships were 13.3 million. The vast majority of that of course is
in the U.S. and Canada. We also offer it now in the UK and Mexico. No, that 13.3 million by the way, during the
12-week quarter, represented an increase of just under 250,000 or about a 21,000 additional paid executive members
per-week increase. Executive members are just over a third of our member base and a little over two-thirds of our sales.
Within the quarter – I'm sorry, on a year-over-year basis, the percentage of members being executive members was up
about 1%, which of course would translate into about a 2 basis-point hit on margin as with Reward.
In terms of renewal rates, they continue strong. Again, going back a quarter ago, business renewal rates were 93.9%. At
the end of the quarter they remained at 93.9%. Gold Star went from 88.8%, tweaked up a little bit to 88.9%. So total in
the U.S. and Canada, these are U.S. and Canada numbers, it was 89.8% at the beginning of the quarter or the end of last
quarter and tweaked up to 89.9 at the end of the third quarter.
Worldwide, at the end of the second quarter we were, I mentioned last quarter we were up at 86.5%. And that tweaked
down one tick to 86.4%. Again when you open new warehouses, you tend to start off with a lower renewal rate
particularly in countries where outside of the U.S. and Canada. And so that's to be expected.
Going down to gross margin line, our gross margin in the third quarter was higher year-over-year by 12 basis points
coming in at 10.67% in Q3 versus last year's 10.55%. As usual, I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers. The columns
would be – we'll just do the third quarter here. Two columns recorded and without gas deflation, and the line items
would be core merchandising, the second line would be the ancillary businesses. The third line item would be 2%
reward. The fourth item would be LIFO. The fifth item would be other and then a total of course. So again going – two
columns going across, the reported core merchandise margin was down five basis points and without gas deflation,
down 11 basis points. Ancillary businesses were plus 6% and plus 5%. 2% reward was minus 2 in both columns. LIFO
was a credit, so plus 6 in both columns. And other which is a non-recurring lawsuit recovery, which benefited margin
this quarter by 7 basis points. So plus 7 and plus 7.
If you add the two columns up, the first column of course reporting comes up to the plus 12 basis points that we
reported and without gas deflation, plus five. The core merchandise component again was a minus five on a reported
basis and a minus 11 excluding the benefit of gas deflation. The four core categories, food and sundries, hardline, soft
lines and fresh foods, each showed lower year-over-year gross margin percents as we continue to invest in price both in
our domestic and our international operations. And as I've stated before, this is Costco playing offense. It's driving
sales, member shopping frequency, member sign-ups and renewals and market share. Ancillary business gross margins,
as I mentioned, was up six basis points or five basis points without gas deflation basis points. Margins were stronger in
the one-hour photo, mini labs, the optical and the hearing aids. Slightly lower in pharmacy and gas was slightly
positive.
The impact as I mentioned earlier on the executive membership increased penetration was minus two basis points. And
as I mentioned LIFO, the year-over-year is a six basis point swing basically we recorded $8 million or three basis point
pre-tax credit during this quarter. And lastly other, as I mentioned, is the non-recurring legal settlement that we
received in Q3.
Moving to reported SG&A, our SG&A percentages Q3-over-Q3 were lower or better by a reported three basis points
coming in at 9.82% this year versus the 9.85%. Again, the two columns reported and then without the gas deflation,
and five line items; core operations, central, RSUs, quarterly adjustment and total. In terms of core operations, the
reported piece was plus two basis points, without gas it would have been plus seven or – and a plus means lower or
better. And so we had seven basis points of positive there. Central was plus two and plus two. RSUs was minus one and
zero. Quarterly adjustments actually was zero and zero. Such that total we reported a plus three or SG&A lower by
three basis points. Again, in our view, on a more normalized basis it would have been lower by nine basis points if you
exclude the impact of gas deflation.
In terms of a little editorial on SG&A, again, the reported three excluding the deflation would have been better by nine.
The core operations component was better or lower by two year-over-year. And again, seven by excluding gas
deflation. Within core, our payroll as a percent of sales improved year-over-year by four basis points. Total payroll
dollars actually increased about 6.5% in the quarter compared to the 8% total sales increase. In addition to

improvement in payroll, we were able to leverage benefits including healthcare and workers comp. They were
leveraged during the quarter by a few basis points. Actual healthcare costs in the U.S. which is the key driver of this
area, eased a little bit up around six percentage points in dollars during the quarter. That's down from low double-digits
in the past couple of quarters.
Our central expense, as I just mentioned, was better or lower by two basis points. That's by the way notwithstanding the
fact that the ongoing IT modernization costs, which I've talked about in the last few quarters, during the quarter that
represented about a hit to SG&A or higher SG&A by about five basis points. So notwithstanding that impact of minus
five in the central category, we still showed a lower by two there. So overall, I think pretty good expense control and
it's certainly helped by strong sales results as well.
Next on the income statement, pre-opening, $6 million last year and $10 million this year. We opened four openings,
net openings last year in Q3 and five this year. All total operating income in the quarter was up $100 million or 16%
from $623 million last year to $722 million this year. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was
$6 million higher year-over-year in the quarter coming in at $25 million versus $19 million a year ago.
If you recall, last year on March 15, so about a little over a month into the fiscal quarter, we paid off a $900 million
fixed rate 5.4% interest debt. This represented about a $4 million reduction in interest expense year-over-year in the
quarter. Offsetting that $4 million reduction of course, was our December offering of $3.5 billion debt offering in late
November of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of just under 1.25%. For the 12 weeks that's about $10
million increase of course in interest expense. So the $4 million reduction in the $10 million increase there's the $6
million net increase that we're talking about here.
Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $3 million, coming in at $15 million this year versus $18
million a year ago. About two thirds of that $3 million delta is actual interest income being lower this year coming in at
$9 million this year compared to $11 million last year. And other rounded to the last million, both relatively similar
numbers within the interest income and other line.
Overall, pre-tax earnings were up $90 million or 14% from $622 million last year in the quarter to $712 million this
year. In terms of our income tax rate, very close to being the same in both third fiscal quarters. 34.81% this year, down
just a tick from 34.84% last year, so essentially the same year-over-year.
Overall net income was up 19% from $386 million last year to $459 this year. While the balance sheet is included in
this morning's press release, a couple of items I usually point out.
Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $221 million and that's brings year-to-date for the three quarters to
$651 million. If you look at the balance sheet of course, if you look at accounts payable as a percent of inventories, on a
reported basis it was 104% a year ago and 102% at Q3 end. That includes payables for things other than merchandise.
Most particularly all the construction and expansion activity we got going on. So if you look at just merchandise,
payables to actual inventories, it was 92% last year and a tick down at 91% this year.
In terms of average inventory per warehouse, I think in the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis, we've
generally shown numbers in the $600,000, $700,000, $800,000 increase range or 5% or 6% or 7%. This quarter on a
year-over-year basis it was up $400,000 or 3% coming in at average of $12.2 million versus $11.8 million a year ago.
Just over half of the $400,000 increase related to higher levels of merchandise in food and sundries, scattered among
various sub-departments. About $100,000 was consumer electronics with a balance spread over a variety of other
non-foods departments.
Overall, inventory is in good shape. As well our midyear physical inventories, which were taken back in January and
February, were our best ever. So we continue to do well in terms of, in our view in terms of inventory control and how
that relates to operations safety as well.
In terms of CapEx, in Q1 we spent $488 million, in Q2, $455 million and the quarter just ended, $435 million. So to
date just under $1.4 billion. Our estimate for the year is right at $2 billion and that of course compares to fiscal 2012
expenditures and CapEx of $1.5 billion and of course reflects the fact that we're opening quite a few more units than we

did a year ago.
In terms of Costco online, we currently operate Costco e-commerce activities in the U.S., Canada and more recently in
the UK. For the third quarter, sales and profits were up nicely over last year. Q3 e-commerce sales were up over 20%
both in the U.S. and Canada. And as I mentioned, the Costco UK started less than a year ago. In terms of expansion,
and as you recall in the last four fiscal years, in 2011 we opened 20 net new units, in 2012, 16, to date, for the first three
quarters this year, 19 and our plans are to open nine in the quarter. That would put us at 28 for the year. So as compared
to fiscal 2012's expansion of about 3% unit and square footage growth, this year's 28 units on a base of – beginning
base of 608 would be about 4.5%. New locations by country for the year of that 28, assuming the 28 would be 13 in the
U.S. and three in Canada, three in the UK, seven in Asia, one in Taiwan and Korea each, and five in Japan, and then as
well, one additional unit in Australia and one in Mexico. As of Q3 end, our total square footage was 89.709 million
square feet, so again an increase of about 4.5% year-over-year.
In terms of common stock repurchases, as you know, we purchased a small amount in Q1, about $34 million worth.
And that's all the activity we've done so far. We did no additional repurchases in the second and third quarter. In terms
of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.31 a share. That was recently increased about a month ago, up
13% from the previous 27.5% share. This annualized number of $1.24 per share represents a total cost to the company
of about $550 million a year. These quarterly dividends of course are in addition to $7 per share special dividend,
which totaled about just over $3 billion that we paid out to shareholders back in December of 2012 or in the second
quarter.
The usual supplemental information will be posted on the Costco Investor Relations sites later this morning. Lastly, our
scheduled earnings for Q4, which is the 16-week quarter that ends at September 1, is currently planned for Wednesday,
October 9, and that again will be for the 16-week fourth quarter ending September 1. Mind you, last year we had – it
was a 53-week year and therefore a 17-week fiscal fourth quarter, so that was about 6% more days in the quarter if you
will.
With that, I will turn it back to Angela and be happy to answer any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] You have a question from Deborah Weinswig.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Good morning, Richard. Thanks so much.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Hi.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Hi. Can you talk about your frequency, which is obviously very strong in the quarter on
an absolute and relative basis? Can you talk about any unique drivers behind that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Not really. I mean, we're not doing anything different other than continuing to be
aggressive on pricing. And if you haven't tried our rotisserie chicken, that's the new hot dog in terms of $4.99 chickens.
We haven't changed. There's not been a lot of difference year-over-year in any of the MVM mailers, the coupon
mailers, so not really. We certainly are getting our share of free press out there, whether it's the late-night talk shows or
the morning business shows. So I think, we certainly are getting a lot of – but that's all anecdotal of course. But there's
nothing specific that we have done different of late.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay. And then can you also discuss your inflation outlook as it stands right now?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Talking to the buyers, there's not a lot of anticipatory inflation with the exception of some
aspects of protein. They continue to see inflation in some of those items, beef, poultry and pork. Some of the, what we
call limited-resource commodities like nuts because of increased world demand with the increasing middle class if you
will, those have spiked up.

With those few exceptions, there's not a lot. I think to-date we are – if you look to – if you used as your benchmark the
LIFO calculation, which looks at what our U.S. inventories by item at cost were, and how those costs have changed as
of from the beginning of the year to now, again, there's an ever-so-slight credit in each of – this quarter and the last
quarter. I think together – if 100.00% was the base as of the beginning of the fiscal year, as of Q3 end, it was 99.41%,
so 0.6% lower costs inflation. Now that's again, that's one measurement that's easy to look at because it's basically our
U.S. LIFO inventory accounts. So, but that wasn't that discernibly different than a quarter ago. But we don't really see a
whole lot of trend upward beyond those small areas that I mentioned. And then gas is always who the heck knows.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Right. Okay. And then on the executive membership side, which has obviously been
incredibly successful in the U.S., beyond Canada, the UK and Mexico, how should we think about the growth there?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, there's – we continue to look at it in all countries. I think we seem to like it. It works
for us. Generally speaking, we like to have a core number of locations there because – and start off with a, some small
number but more than one or two of services that we can provide under the executive member format. So the member
service is where the executive members in some cases get a better deal on some of those services. So, we'll continue. I
would guess over time we'll continue to roll it out to other countries. Again, the 13.3 million, I think all but about
400,000 of that are U.S. and Canada, which of course are, U.S. and Canada is probably roughly 80% of our company in
terms of sales or locations or what have you, and well over 95% of the executive member base, but that's because it
started here.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay, great. Thanks so much, and best of luck.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Heinbockel.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So, Richard, a couple of things. The price investments, do you – is there more of a skew
toward consumables or no, it's more broad-based than that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's more broad-based than that given just the sheer volume of items, what we need to make
sure is, we don't want to spread it out. You've got to be wow, if you will, on items, and not just spread it across all
categories and all items. And so we try to do a pretty good job of that. But it's spread among categories. I – a little
tongue-in-cheek talked about the chicken. As protein prices go up, our costs go up and we've been very successful, we
think, in driving sales. And if we can get you into – go to the back of the location and get that great chicken for $4.99,
you're going to shop doing other things, but it's across the board.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So the idea, no matter what department you're talking about, the idea here is not so much
where you can get your cost down, but where you can make a clear impression on the customer perception-wise?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. I mean, ultimately it's an art form, and it's merchandising and it's across the board.
Sometimes we work with vendors and sometimes we rotate items in and out. It's not unlike what we do historically on
the fence. You're always going to see or end caps. You're always going to see some – we try to create excitement as
you walk down those larger aisles, down the main aisles.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Do you think, as you guys look at it, do you think the price gap has changed or widened
versus your various competitors or no? It's about what it was?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it's been pretty similar over the last few years. We don't see any dramatic change in
it. If anything, we tend to sincerely play offense and irrespective of what's going on out there. I mean you're always
going to see what be it our direct competitors of Sam's and BJ's or other category dominant retailers, or you're always
going see items in departments. But for the most part, when we do our weekly by location, market baskets on key
competitive items, those ranges in our view, of our competitiveness, is pretty similar to what it has been, if not a little

higher, a little better.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: More favorable to you?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Well, then just two last things. Is there about $30 million left of incremental benefit on the
membership fee increase? Is that about the residual number?

higher than $30 million.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. And then lastly, when you look at Kirkland, where are you roughly now with SKU
count? And do you think as a percent of club SKU count that inevitably goes higher and I know you don't want to force
it on people, but obviously there's, you continue to find value added items. Does that just go higher over time as a
percent of total SKU count?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes. Absolutely. I think it's still in the low to mid-20s. But it keeps going up incrementally.
Part of that is the increased penetration of some of those items overseas where whatever extreme value we are, it's even
more extreme on those kind of things. I mean we have items that do $2,000 and $3,000 and $4,000 of pallet position in
the U.S. that do five and 10 times that in some of the Asia countries simply because it's a great value on great stuff.
And we can even be more extreme over there so versus brands. So yeah, we continue to look at different areas and
we've – this past year I know we've put it on some women exercise apparel, activewear, which has been very
successful. We continue to put it on – I know we have several men's summer items, whether it's shorts or performance
polo shirts. And so all those types of things. So it's not just – it's food and non-food.
I don't see any discussion on putting it on a television or anything any time soon. But certainly there's a lot of
categories. All the low-lying fruit, paper goods, water, those are all done. But probably the lowest lying fruit in the last
few years was probably the disposable diapers. But there's lots of things – it always amazes me when individual food
items, the cashew clusters or something innocuous like that is a $15 million item and $25 and $30 million a year later.
All of a sudden you've got those types of things out there. So there's – I think it'll scale slowly through the 20s and
upward. But it's not like we have a concerted effort to try to get to a number by next year.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Yep. Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Paul Trussell.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Good morning, Richard. Just with the price investments, you've had a very consistent message
over the past few quarters, past few years really in terms of Costco being on the offensive in terms of making consistent
pricing investments. So should we look at the core being down this period compared to being more flattish the past two
quarters as a signal that this is incremental, that this is in addition to what you've kind of done over the past few
periods? Did you go deeper or wider and how should we think about the next few quarters?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: In all honesty, I don't think we're that smart about it, strategic about it. I think that our
strategy is to constantly drive it downward. And the more we can do that the bigger gap we have with our competitors
and the more our traffic grows and the more our sales grow and good things happen. I remember somebody a few years
back asking, what happens if a month into a fiscal quarter you're not doing well, what are you doing? And we say we
don't change what we're doing. I think that given our strength of late, we look at it and say this is a good time. When we
look at certain countries where we're very profitable relative to the bottom line as a percent of sales relative to the U.S.
and to Canada, and Canada is a little more than U.S. We say let's just make sure – we're our own toughest competitor
when things get too good.

And so, again, I can't suggest that it's a trend. I think three or fourth quarters prior to the last three quarters, so all of last
fiscal year, comparing those quarters to their respective comparable quarters a year earlier, it was down and we were
talking about investing in price. And then the last quarter or two was a relatively flat. So does that suggest it's going to
continue to be flat? Well, Q3 says no, it doesn't. But I don't think that you could use that as a trend line either way.
We're going to continue to do things to drive our business. And we're fortunately in a positive way. We'd rather be
aggressive on pricing and see the benefits of SG&A, which always has been a challenge for us. And – but margins are
not a problem.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: And the – on international is becoming bigger penetration of your business overall and
currently that is – that segment has a few hundred basis points higher margins than the U.S. Is that sustainable or is
there anything – any changing dynamics that you see that might alter that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Meaningfully higher, yes. Is it sustainable at this rate? Probably not. I mean we know
ourselves that as we take a $300 million unit in Taiwan or Korea or Japan and put a new unit 15 miles or 10 miles
away, we'll do $450 million the next year between the two but it's going to hit the margin, it's going to hit the P&L for a
couple or three years. So part of this ramp-up overseas is going to impact that a little bit. And as we've constantly been
reminded, originally by Jim and now you can be assured by Craig, is let's not have the illusion that we can just continue
at these strong numbers. We want to – again, I think some of what you saw in a little bit of margin reduction
year-over-year this quarter, it was a little more so internationally and part of that is the things I mentioned, a little bit of
the increased expansion and sitting in the meetings and saying, guys, let's not get, let's – these numbers are growing
pretty fast, let's make sure we're giving back price in terms of price. So it's our doing.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: That's helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Sandra Barker.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Hi. Richard, I just wanted to clarify, on the price investment internationally, don't you have
less competition there? I'm just wondering, I would imagine you had a bigger – as you talked about the extreme value
on some of the private label, I would think you already had a very large price gap versus the competition. And I had
another question also.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We do. But again, if you look at a company that has a pre-tax return on sales in the 3%-ish
range, very high 2%s or 3%, whatever it is now, and then you look at that U.S. column and extrapolate from the
operating percentages that it's in the low to mid 2%s in the U.S., better in Canada, and a lot better in other countries,
when it gets – we're very good at looking at something and saying, guys, we're making too much here. And so we want
to keep driving it in the right direction.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Okay. And then also, just some illumination on buyback and how you think about that in
the future, since it seems to have dwindled away this year.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I think – I mean, we look at it as between the regular dividend and the special
dividend. And even assuming just the $34 million in stock buyback this year, we still essentially, between the two,
given back about a little over $3.5 billion to the shareholders this year, virtually almost all in the form of dividends. But
we look at both and over a longer period of time we would expect to continue to buy back stock as well. But again, we
don't suggest it's going to be a certain number. Clearly, given the relative strength and the fact that – importantly the
fact that we did the special dividend, we don't feel any pressure, exterior pressure to just do it on a regular basis. We'll
continue to do that over a period of time, though.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Okay and any commentary on any impact from Target in Canada? Just.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Really, no. And not to – without disrespect, there's really not been in our view a lot of
competitive – now, our margins in Canada have come down. And again, that's more us than that. Certainly as I've

mentioned over the last year and a half, we've been preemptive knowing that they're coming in. But we're also – have
had very strong numbers. Our local currency comps up there are in the very low double-digits in local currency. So it's
a strong economy, we're doing very well, and again it's one of those things where Craig in the budget meeting says,
guys, we're getting – let's make sure we're watching, let's not close our eyes and turn around one day and find out that
we're not as special, and let's get pricing back where it needs to be. And what that means is, is we're making good
money up there; it's growing well, so let's make our competitive posture stronger.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: But a lot of it has to do with us, not really a lot of promotional pricing issues that – from
what's going on with them. And keep in mind that they haven't opened a lot of units yet either.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Sure. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from Joe Feldman.
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Sorry, guys, I was just on mute. So just wanted to drill down on inventory again, I know you
had mentioned you feel like you're in pretty decent shape with inventory. But, are there areas where you could be
adding more or maybe where you're actually missing a sale because of not having the right product, or just
opportunities within inventory management, I guess, and assortment planning?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, again, it's part science and a lot of art form. As you probably know, over the last 10
years, we have consciously taken down, reduced our active SKU count in our warehouse from 4,100, 4,200 down to
3,700, 3,800. And that's, in our view, driven sales because we can double mass out something versus having – taking
out an item and replacing it with more of the other item. In that double space you'll do more than you would have done
with two items. So it's always that, if you will, that intelligent loss of sales. I can only tell you that in the 26 days a year
that we spend in a budget meeting reviewing, a third of which is merchandising discussions and part of the operations
discussions are also merchandise discussions, I hear many more comments from Craig and others of when we have too
many of something. Five varieties of cordless phones or whatever it might be, so if anything, we continue to look to see
how we can reduce our selection a little bit.
Now, we're also mindful it's the buyers' and the operators' responsibility as they're visiting competition, is identifying
what they perceive as hot items not only at Sam's, but in other forms of retail, be it Home Depot or category dominant
retailers or specialty retailers. And so, we're constantly trying to figure out what we're missing. Generally it's more of
the opposite, though. What do we have too much of, too much selection of?
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Got it. Thanks, Richard. And if I could ask one more, sort of a – about the traffic trend, which
has been just so strong for so long, I guess I'm curious, how do you sustain it? How does it keep driving because people
are coming in, it seems like at a pretty frequent pace, 4%, 5% every month. And it's better than grocery. It's better than
most anybody else out there right now. And is it just the fact that you have a membership fee, so people feel like, well I
may as well get my money's worth and go to Costco? Is there anything – how do you sustain it I guess, I know it's a
tougher, bigger picture question, but just any thoughts on that
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, this is one person's view here. But, I certainly believe that two big things
that have occurred over the last four or five years in this bad economy is gas prices and the fact that 10%, 11% of our
sales are gas. And that clearly drives, no pun intended, drives people into the parking lot and 30 or so of those for every
100 that pump gas go to shop. Clearly, even if one of those 30 is incremental, that's good aside from having a profitable
gas operation. The other is fresh foods. All the statistics I've read is that when the economy got hammered, people ate
out less not just the steak houses for business travel, but families with neighborhood restaurants. While it has come
back, it's not back to where it originally was. Clearly our strength in fresh foods, I think, has helped a lot. That, again, is
a driver in my view of more frequency. And I get back to the – but the mission of constantly coming up with wow
items and getting brands that refuse to sell us to sell us and diverting more of stuff when they won't want to sell us if we

can get it. All those things are what we're about.
And again, I'm probably a little biased in my antenna or a little stronger in looking, but it seems like every day there's
something on television about us, whether it's a national talk show or a news item or a late night-talk show. You name
it. All that stuff I think is reinforcing. The last thing, of course, is the ramp-up in expansion outside of the U.S. and
Canada, our most mature markets. Clearly, you have higher frequency numbers in newer markets. So that's got to help
a little bit, too. I don't think that's as big a factor because this is still a small percentage of how many total units we
have. I think the bigger factors are that constant lowering of price and that constant – and the gas and the fresh foods.
And look, we've all seen what's happened of late with some of the relative strength in companies likes Home Depot and
Lowe's at the housing market. I think I mentioned some of the category areas, merchandise category areas in non-foods
where we've been strong. So we get a little benefit there as well. But that frequency has got be more that I have no
illusions that it can sustain itself. Seemingly for 20 years prior to late 2008 on average the number was in the 1%, 1.5%
range. It ranged generally from minus one to plus two with the exception of a couple outliers based on how Easter or
July 4th or something falls year-over-year. So we're in uncharted territories. I remember a year and a half into this
recession after coming – having maybe a four for all of calendar 2009, reminding people that if we're zero in 2010
that's still a two and a two for two years and not ever thinking that we can accomplish what we have. And so we
certainly benefited by our model and perhaps by the demographic of our member and by the other things I just
mentioned.
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you so much for the response and good luck for this quarter.

Your next question comes from Chris Horvers.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning. So I wanted to follow up on the international margin side. So the
ramp and expansion, understanding that you're investing in price internationally because you're more profitable there
and you're not resting on morals and also densifying the base. And that brings down existing profitability but what's the
other side of it? Does opening up new stores that are inherently more profitable relative to the domestic? Is that a net
positive to margins for the company?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'd have to honestly pencil it out. Probably a little, but I'm shooting from the hip on that
one.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Okay. Okay. I can follow up. And then also, a lot of retailers that talk about pressures from
the weather and variability to the weather, you had a great quarter on the traffic side and on the comp side. But did you
see much variation around weather? You saw strength in Lawn & Garden. Do you think it would have been better ex
the weather impact suggesting that maybe there's some pent-up demand here that could flow through?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Fortunately, we are in, I think, 41 or 42 states in Puerto Rico in the U.S. if you will. And so
when the weather was bad in one part of the country it wasn't bad in the other part of the country. Clearly I know – I
don't have the numbers in front of me, but I know over the last few months when the regions got up and spoke – some
of the regions had incredible strength as expected – when expected in seasonal items like seasonal clothing and
seasonal patio furniture what have you. Whereas other regions it came a little later. I know that – I don't have the detail
in front of me, but if there's a little pent-up demand it's in a little bit – a few of the regions and some of it's already
happened in the third quarter. So maybe there's a little bit there but I don't see a whole lot of that.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: So is that in similar vein that the high exposure to California buffered your weather
sensitivity?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: California was, again, as I mentioned earlier, all the eight regions in the U.S. were pretty
good. But they were actually at the low end of that range of, I think I said, mid to high single.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Okay.

<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Okay. And then final question, you mentioned about healthcare cost up 6% year-over-year
versus low double-digit in the past quarters. What's changing there? Are you doing something? Is this in anticipation of
Obamacare next year and that's flowing through early. And what's the outlook there? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I wish I knew. For the 12 week quarters, when I look each week, just what we pay out in
U.S. healthcare costs, which is the thing that drives that line item, it generally speaking was pretty consistent in the mid
to a little higher single-digits. And so we didn't have any outliers. Sometimes when you see a week or two that's a 3%
or 5% increase year-over-year the next week is 12% or 14%. And so the average was still 10% or whatever excess. And
there's not a lot of new things we're doing. We're doing a little – couple of things, nothing that would have driven this.
We're hopeful that it'll continue, but we still budget it up a little bit higher than Q3.

Your next question comes from Dan Binder.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi. It's Dan Binder. A couple of questions, first, any early view on how real estate is lining up
for next fiscal year? Secondly, just curious, if the – you commented on the seasonal business being lumpy. Was there
any kind of gross margin hit related to seasonal businesses in the quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: None. Nothing out of the ordinary in the latter question. And what was the first question?
Oh, real estate. Yeah, our best guess right now is right at that 30 number, with half or a little over – probably a little
over half of it outside of the U.S.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: And of that 30 number, I mean how many are secured or definitely going to fall into the year,
versus what might still be at risk?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think there's more than 30 on the list and you kind of just use a little guesstimate by
location, and we come up with a number that's close to 30. So I, it's a little too early to tell. It could be, if you asked me
for a range, I'd probably say three left and five more than 30, in the sense, 27 to 35. But I'm guessing here.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: But 30 is probably a good number.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: A final question, on membership fee growth, recognizing, due to the accrual accounting and
the sort of the tail end here of benefit that you're getting from the membership fee increase, when we take that into
account, and the one less week in the quarter, any color you can sort of provide from the impact of those two things
versus, let's say, the 11.8% growth rate that you were at here in Q3?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Right. I think if you take out the deferred accounting over the last few quarters, the number
is in the 6% to 7% range, probably in dollars. And when we look at Q4 last year, 17 weeks versus 16, one 17th is about
six percentage points. So, I just, I have no – I don't have any Q4 estimates in front of me, but just those two simple
math items would tell me that anything at or slightly above zero would be expected, but I haven't looked at it.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Right. Okay. That's what we were coming up with. Thanks.

<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi. Good morning. Richard, I think you said payroll was up 6% plus in the quarter. And so if
your dollar per hour wage increase is I think around 3%, that's implying your hours worked per club would be flattish,
is that correct? And if so, how are you managing that with the mid single-digit traffic increase? I know you've got a
signature change you put in with AMEX, but what are the other key initiatives that are helping here?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Cutting overtime I think has helped a little bit. I've used the word focus before. The
operators have also talked about, and people asked me a year ago, what's different about Craig? Craig, it's not a
question of what's different about Craig versus Jim, but Craig would say himself, his strength is he grew up in
operations. So I think there's focus on that. SKU count management, going from X to a lower number means you're
messing up more stuff and you're – I think it's all of the little things. There's nothing huge. Your comment on the
signatures being captured, certainly yes. Can that shave off seconds in a transaction? All those things help. But a lot of
it is the pallet presentations and what we do.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Okay. Thanks. And then can you give us some perspective on your efforts to get global pricing
terms with suppliers? I mean are you getting traction on this? I guess if it's in the numbers it doesn't look like we're
necessarily seeing it yet?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, we are getting traction. It's still not material to the size of our company, but again,
every month when the country managers, the country heads from each country are here for two days, part of their
presentation is, and part of their offsite additional meetings with our merchants here is getting, on a global basis, our
buyers here to work with multi-national vendors to make sure we're getting better pricing and in some cases, better
availability of certain items. It's a process.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Thanks. Final question, what was the one time legal settlement?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's – I can't say what it is, but it's a few year period of time where we picked up money
that totaled about seven basis points in the quarter. It was good. But it's non-recurring.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Better plus than minus. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Brian Nagel.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Hi. It's Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. I wanted to just focus on unit growth, I think a couple of
questions, someone asked you about the number for next year. It sounds like you're intended to open new units at a
pace next year consistent with this year. The question I have is what's allowing – more from a – I guess stepping back
philosophical standpoint, what's allowing you now to more rapidly open units? Is there something changed in the
marketplace or was it a decision internally to do it? And as we look beyond just this year and next year, is the company
committed to continue to open units at kind of a longer term pace consistent with what we've seen this year?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: To answer the last question first, yes. We've got more people – literally more real estate
people on the ground in more countries. The pipeline has taken time to fill up, but it's filled up. Once we decided – if I
look back a few years ago when we had just as an example in Korea, Taiwan and Japan, six or seven units in each of
Korea and Taiwan and maybe eight or nine in Japan. We've ramped that up. And so we're going from opening between
those three countries a few years ago, opening a couple of units a year between the three countries to opening up five,
six, seven, eight between those three countries a year. But again, that's partly that conscious effort both in the real estate
area under Jeff Brotman and his people and Craig also pushing that. Yesterday and today, they're both out looking at
sites in different parts of the country.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Okay. Well, thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And we believe that we can – our goal over the next five years, I think I've said, is to –
about 150 buildings. And if we can get a little better than that, great, but that's certainly a good starting point given
where we've come over the last few years.

<Q - Brian Nagel>: So, I guess, Richard just a follow up on this, as you look at it kind of we talked about it, it seems
like if you go back a few years growth, the unit growth numbers didn't hit your targets maybe what investors were
thinking and now you're showing a faster growth. So it sounds to me like you've kind of made the internal decision to
grow faster. To any extent, is it a competitive response? Are you seeing a need to jump out in front of a competitor or is
it just internal decisions?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, sometimes it's competitive only from the standpoint that as we look at our success in
other countries, we have a competitor in Korea. We recognize that. We want to – we're successful in several countries
where we're the only one. We want to do more of that. We think that if you look back at the history of Canada, there
was a competitor there that chose not to stay there. And I can remember the time when we had probably 55 or 60 units
in Canada and I thought one day we might have 75.
Now we have in the mid-80s, high-80s. And we think that we can get to a little over 100. So we'll keep doing that to
drive our business. It's not a – mostly it's not a reaction to others. It's a reaction that we're doing well and we want to
keep ramping it up a little bit. And, yeah, the decision to ramp up as an example internationally, given there is a longer
time line to get a unit open many times was really made two or three years ago and it's now coming to fruition this year,
those efforts.

<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Yeah, hi. It's Jason DeRise at UBS. I wanted to ask a bit more about the membership fees.
Could you maybe share a little bit actually about how the membership fee grew without FX for this quarter, an organic
number? And then if you could talk about how membership grew internationally versus U.S., that would be helpful.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, again, I think of the $56 million versus whatever million dollar number of increase, a
little over half of it, was the deferred accounting. So I think you take that out and I think it was 12% dollar increase, so
that would imply about a 6%, rounded up to 6%, dollar increase ex that deferred accounting.
Overseas, I don't have the detail in front of me. My guess is it's higher in local currency, but it was a little lower
because of the FX – of the fact that on average, on a weighted average, foreign currencies weakened relative to the
dollar. So when we convert everything to report in U.S. dollars, it was actually a slight negative. So you've just made –
the light bulb just went off. Actually the underlying number ex deferred accounting in local currency probably would
have been a little better. But again, the numbers we speak about when we showed membership income was including
the detriment of weaker FX.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Right. So I mean the FX would be similar to the FX impact you see on your net sales is that
right or?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure, yeah. Yeah.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: And then I guess understanding the members from another point of view in terms of the
traffic, obviously you guys give an all-in number. Do you have how international traffic is actually doing versus the
U.S.? I know you alluded to it that it's been good.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's actually very similar to the U.S. But we're not going to go down the road detailing it,
because I always find as I try to put more out there then I got to give it for the rest of our life.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: You could just put it all out in one statement right at the beginning of the day, but maybe we
could talk about that later. But the other question that I have in terms of this international versus U.S., obviously U.S.
fee increases are very invisible to most of the investor base. But what's happening elsewhere in the world in terms of

fee increases and anything in the pipeline there?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We're driving the business. Historically we've shown that we're prepared and we will
increase fees, but we'll take that one step at a time. Again, I don't want to suggest that we have a plan to do it tomorrow
or a year from tomorrow, but I would guess over time you would expect to see fees continue to improve – to go up, but
then recognize what we do when we have increased fees, we get more competitive.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Right. Makes sense. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.

Your next question comes from Bob Drbul.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Hi. Good morning. I guess just one question that I have. Over the next several years I think you
talked about like 150 clubs over the next five years, how many do you think you can have in the U.S.? And how many
of those clubs would you expect to be in the U.S.? Of the 150?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think on our cheat sheet from last year it was 55 out of 150 were in the U.S. And
my guess is it will be a little bit more than that. And at – if we opened what we say we're going to open this quarter, we
will end the fiscal year with 636 units, of which 452 would be in the U.S. And if you add 50 or 55 to that, you're at 505
or 510. And my guess is the five years after that, it's not 50 more but it's 20 to 30 more. Who knows? So I think that
what we have found over almost 30 years and what I assume we'll continue to find is we'll always end up opening a few
more than we thought were possible.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Sean.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Can you hear me?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. Great. I guess on the International front, just on – you talked about Mexico a little bit
and that does sound like one of the strengths in the International business. Can you just give us a little bit of an update
on that business and how that market is performing and is there an opportunity to grow a little bit more aggressively in
this market? And how the productivity is doing in those boxes today?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We're growing – for the five years up to when we acquired the remaining 50% interest last
July, I think in five years we opened a total of three units. So less than one a year. I think this year we're opening one.
And my guess is that it'll quickly go to a few couple of, two to four, who knows. But we'll ramp it up. Keep in mind we
have I think 32 or 33 units there. Sam's has well over 100. And we think there's plenty of opportunity down there, it's
very profitable. Expressed in dollars its average unit does about half the dollar volume because of just the relative
currencies. But it's growing nicely. Its bottom line is much stronger than the company as a whole. But so are a few
other countries in terms of the bottom line with a much stronger top line. So Mexico is great. It's been a healthy growth
for us. And if anything, for unrelated reasons, we hadn't grown a lot for those four or five years, and we are starting to
invest more now.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. Great. And then I guess from a category perspective, consumer electronics has been
an area of strength. I think it inflected about – maybe if I'm remembering this correctly, about 12 months ago, and it
sounds like the inventory is up a little bit on a per-warehouse basis, I guess, can you talk about the strength? Kind of,

what's driving that in this category? And then, is the opportunity still there moving forward? And then, is this an
increase in SKU or is this more ASP related?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes and yes and yes. It's – there's a little bit more presence out there. We have done very
well not only within TVs but higher-end TVs, the 60 inch and 80 inch TVs, and the smart TVs. We've also done well,
at a much smaller scale dollar-wise, but on cell phones, and doing much better in things like tablets because we're
selling some. We've got all but one of the main brands and names are out there, and those are really starting to pick up
for us. But TVs dwarf everything else, just in sheer dollar volume. And again they were up low double-digits this
month, and I think in the last year have probably been up in the – probably on average in the mid to high single-digits
in dollars.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay, great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Peter Benedict.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hi, Richard. Just back to the traffic question, can you give us a sense of maybe which
member group is driving more of that traffic, if there is a difference? Is it the Business member or the Gold Star
member? Is there anything discernible there?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's executive. If you put them in simple sequence order you've got your regular Gold Star,
you've got your regular Business, you've got your executive of either of those categories, and then the triple-play, if you
will, would be, you've got the executive business member with the co-brand AMEX card. All those things lend itself
towards higher frequency and higher total purchases, but executive member is clearly a driver.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Yeah, okay. Good. That's helpful. And then on to the SG&A, the five basis point headwind
that you called out from the IT modernization efforts, how does that compare to last few quarters? I know you've talked
about – I don't know if you quantified the impact, but just wondering if that's kind of typical if that's what it's been
running. And how long do you think it will persist, and when do you think we start to see some payback from those
investments?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it's been probably in the range of four to six, but it's been pretty similar over the last
few quarters. I think that it will still be incrementally up over the next four quarters, but probably a little – not five,
lower than that, and then hopefully it will subside a little bit. And hopefully then you get some benefit from it as well
from more efficient operations, whatever we're putting out for it. But it's – for those of you who have known us for a
long time, we pride ourselves in keeping things simple. And we were basically a legacy shop. We wrote our own GL
years ago, and so this is new for us. And what we're doing – and it's taking a lot of effort for us, a lot of money.
Fortunately it's spread out. It's divided by a lot of sales of dollars. But, so five basis points is still a lot this year, I don't
know if it's two or three next year, but it's going to be lower than five is my guess, and then that will then not be a
discussion topic in terms of SG&A basis points.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, and then one last one if I could here. Just back on what Bob's question was, on the
clubs left in the U.S., can you just talk about maybe, what do the markets look like that you're going to the next 50 to
80 or so Costcos in the United States? I mean, how are they different than, kind of your existing footprint? Are there –
is there certain regions where you're going or is it different types of formats, malls, et cetera? I'm just kind of curious
on that. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Quick back of the envelope guess would be half of it's infill in strong existing markets and
half of it's in newer markets. I think, I'm just looking at the opening schedule this past year. So it's in everything from
another unit in Washington, D.C. and Maryland in the U.S. to one last fall in Huntington Beach, California, which is
clearly infill, to several units in the Dallas and other Texas markets, which I would say have gone from new markets to
very clearly good infill markets in Chicago as well, infill, to markets like Knoxville, Tennessee, New Orleans,
Louisiana, so, a combination of both. But Baxter, Minnesota, I'm not sure if that's an infill or an extension of

Operator
Your next question comes from Brandon Melich (sic) [Greg Melich].
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. I just had two questions. I want to follow-up on the inflation in the quarter or lack thereof.
So if I've got it right, gas and FX was 100, 150 bps, so, ex those, ticket was up one or one and a half. How did that
break down? Was there any inflation or was it all just items in the basket and mix that actually got some basket growth?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Very little inflation. I mean the difference – I'm just looking here.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: I'm saying with LIFO gain, there might have been a little deflation and maybe items in the
basket or mix helped a couple of hundred bps.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, seems like LIFO deflation just from – as of the beginning or the end of last fiscal
year, not just this quarter.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Fair enough, yeah.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, but if I look at literally it's a couple of basis points on our LIFO inventories in the
U.S., so very little inflation or deflation other than gas.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: But that's at year end.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And also with the – and that's a nice transition. What behavior have you seen with the dotcom
sales up 20%? Who's driving that? Is it a small group of members that are using it a lot more? Or do you find that a lot
of your members are trying the online site?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it's a little of both. We're still doing it the old-fashioned way and some would say
the stubborn way. We are doing a few more things. Clearly re-platforming, the dot com people feel that's helped.
Mobile has helped a little. The apps are driving people to it. I forget what percentage of the total sales are coming on
apps, which is both phones and that. It's small but it's growing. And again we don't do a lot of stuff. Our MVMs
probably, in our view, have had as much effect as anything, when we have some of those exclusive online only MVM
coupons in the mailers, in the physical mailers. So we're doing a few, I hate to use the phrase social networking stuff,
but we're getting the name out there a little bit more.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Got it.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's nice to see some increases that didn't have one digit or a one in front of a two digit.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And then lastly on the cash flow, could you help us out a little bit on the – even with the CapEx
up, do we still expect free cash to be around $1.5 billion, even with CapEx up this year? And can payables actually get
to inventory? And then also, is it still the plan to buy back enough stock to make sure that there's no option dilution as
to the big special dividend? How you're thinking about that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, clearly the special dividend has some impact on that. Clearly the very ramp-up in
strength in our valuation. But our view is we're still on average a stock buyer over time. We don't feel pressure that

we've got to do a certain amount by a certain date. In terms of cash flow, you take your estimates for net income. Take
depreciation up the 9% or 10% it's up. Dividends, the regular dividend seems to be going. We just represented it pretty
close to what our eight year average increase is, about 13%, or whatever. Your dividend I think, the regular dividend is
about $550 million a year. Even with those, and assuming CapEx went from the $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion, you're
going to cash flow a little higher than you suggested, but that assumes no stock buy-back and we'll see. I would hope,
and I can't say expect, because we don't look at it that formally every day, but over a period of time, clearly we want to
cover our issue dilution. But we don't feel compelled that we have to do it by year-end for this year.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Got it. And on the payable side...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Getting to100% is tough. I think it's been in the low – seasonally it gets over 100% sure.
But probably on average, it's probably 94%, 95% on average during the year, maybe 93%, 94%. And one of the things
that happens, particularly in this low interest rate environment, particularly since we have a lot of cash, we'll offer
vendors, particularly medium size vendors, that might need to clean up a balance sheet at quarter end for certain
covenants, we're being pretty aggressive on, what will you give us if we pay a little early on something? Even though –
outside the regular terms, which are not big numbers but you turn around, it's hundreds of millions of dollars. So, I'm
not sure if it ever gets to a hundred unless the term goes from 12, 13, up to 15 or something. And that's going to be
tough. But we'll keep working at it.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Got it. And how does international affect that payables? Maybe you look at per merchandise
payables inventory? Does that force it down a little bit or?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it's higher volumes, but I think the payables percent is a little lower in some of the
countries. But the part of that is timing. If there's the budget of stuff you ship to Asia. If 25%, 35% of our sales over
there are U.S.-sourced goods and with the exception of probably fresh food items that have to be air-freighted, a lot of
that stuff could be on two and three – two week plus containers. Sometimes you're able to negotiate with a vendor to
socialize that and sometimes you're not. So my guess is, I'm just looking here at one thing. Hold on a second. This is by
country though. Oh there it is. I'm sorry. If I talked about, I think I mentioned it was 91% for the quarter, merchandise
payables. And that 91%, there were two countries that were over 100%. And there were – outside of the U.S. And there
were two countries that were below 80%. And a couple – one in the 80%s and a couple in the 90%s. Of course U.S.
was right on – U.S. and Canada on average are a shade above the 91% average. And the U.S. is right on it. So, it's a
little all over the board. Australia I would have guessed Australia would be near the lower end and that's because it's the
longest place to ship goods by sea.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Got it. Great. Thanks, Richard.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. Why don't we take one last question, if there's any out there.
Operator
We have a follow-up question from Sandra Barker.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Yes. Richard, I don't want to beat a dead horse about the price investment, but I wanted to
clarify, can you explain the mix of the price investment and how much of it is going toward international versus the
U.S.? I know in the U.S. you had a fee increase and that would be sort of a logical assumption that you would have –
that you'd be offsetting that there, but if it's more skewed towards international is this a different philosophy than you
had in the past and how are you sure that you get back more than you're giving up if you are the only club in the
country? Or you're still sort of new and have a ton of traffic already? I'm just trying to sort of understand the
philosophy there.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Every action has a different reason. So it's not – sometimes it's emotional and it's what we
do for living. Sometimes it's certainly, as you just suggested, given our membership fee strength in the U.S. and Canada
that allows us to be more competitive in other areas and certainly that's part of it. Given our strength and profitability in
some countries that gives us opportunity to be more aggressive on certain things. So it is, I do want to emphasize it, it's

not as scientific or as analytically thoughtful, but we know when sales are going in the right directions we could be
more aggressive, and we choose to be. And it has worked for us. And so I'm sorry, I can't shed more light on it. If I look
at the core businesses, I think probably the one that was least impacted was the U.S. this last quarter. But if you look at
all the other countries every country has a different reason. And it's not every country, it's all over the board and
sometimes it's on hot items. Sometimes it's – we're trying to build something.
