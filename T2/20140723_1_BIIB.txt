MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Tiffany and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Biogen Idec Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Claudine Prowse, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Claudine Prowse
Thank you and welcome to Biogen Idec Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I encourage
everyone to go to the Investors section of biogenidec.com to find the press release and related financial tables,
including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we'll discuss today.
Our GAAP financials are provided in Table 1 and Table 2. Table 3 includes a reconciliation of our GAAP to
non-GAAP financial results. We believe non-GAAP results better represent the ongoing economics of our business and
reflect how we manage the business internally.
We have also posted slides on our website that follow the discussions related to this call.

I would like to point out that we'll be making forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations
and beliefs. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially. I
encourage you to consult our SEC filings for additional detail.
On today's call, I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. George Scangos; Dr. Doug Williams, EVP of Research
and Development; Tony Kingsley, EVP of Global Commercial Operations; and our CFO, Paul Clancy. We'll also be
joined for the Q&A portion of the call by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Al Sandrock.
Now, I'll turn the call over to George.
George A. Scangos, Ph.D.
Well, thanks, Claudine, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. Biogen Idec had a great second
quarter; strong financial performance and several key pipeline accomplishments. So as we recount these achievements
today, we believe that our continued progress reflects the strength of our underlying business and good execution
towards our 2014 goals.
Our core multiple sclerosis franchise performed remarkably well and we continue to see an increasing number of
patients using our therapies. TECFIDERA continues to gain market share and we believe it's on-track to become the
leading MS therapy in the U.S. The early months of our European launch reinforced our belief that TECFIDERA will
continue to be a major value contributor to the company moving forward.
AVONEX and TYSABRI also performed well as physicians and patients continued to look to them as the injectable
and high efficacy therapies [indiscernible] (02:52). With these important medicines available to patients, we believe
that we have a product portfolio that makes us the global leader in the treatment of MS.
In our late-stage pipeline, we moved forward two new potential therapeutic options for relapsing MS patients this
quarter. PLEGRIDY received a positive CHMP opinion in Europe.
And at this point, I'll diverge from my prepared statements to say that just this morning, as we're sitting in the room
preparing for the call, we received a letter from the EU saying that PLEGRIDY had been approved. We haven't had the
chance to look at the label or any details yet, which we will do, and when we're through that, we'll issue a press release.
But since we're sitting here, PLEGRIDY has now been approved in the EU.
We also reported positive top line results from the Phase III trial of daclizumab. And should all these products complete
registration, we'll have six important medicines to offer MS patients with different needs.
Moving beyond the MS franchise, we launched ALPROLIX, the long-lasting therapeutic hemophilia B, and received
FDA approval of ELOCTATE, our therapy for hemophilia A. These products mark our entry into a major new
therapeutic area.
ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent the first meaningful innovations in the treatment of hemophilia in many years
and reflect our mission to help bring new therapies to patients who are under-served. We believe that these therapies
have the potential to meaningfully reduce treatment burden and significantly improve patients' lives.
These accomplishments are reflected in our strong quarterly financial performance with a 40% growth in revenues and
a 52% growth in non-GAAP EPS year-over-year. As Paul will discuss, this quarter's financial performance also
benefited from the approval of an agreement with AIFA relating to TYSABRI sales in Italy.
We've also made excellent progress in Japan, which is an important strategic priority for us as we expand our global
presence. We recently obtained Japanese approval for TYSABRI and ALPROLIX and filed a marketing application for
ELOCTATE earlier this year.
The expansion of our products into Japan allows us the opportunity to introduce new treatment options to patients and
physicians in new regions around the world. We believe that Japan represents an attractive long-term growth

opportunity for our company.
So, we had an eventful and productive quarter with a lot of exciting developments. And I'll now pass the call over to
Doug.
Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D.
Thanks, George, and good afternoon, everyone. We and our collaborator, AbbVie, recently announced positive top line
Phase III data for daclizumab HYP in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Based on this study and previous clinical
data, we're working expeditiously to file an application for regulatory approval of daclizumab. We believe that if
approved, daclizumab could be an additional effective therapeutic option to treat this heterogeneous disease.
A number of our other clinical programs continue to advance. In the coming 12 months to 18 months, we anticipate
Phase III data from TYSABRI in SPMS, as well as data from earlier-stage programs including BIIB037 in Alzheimer's
disease, neublastin in neuropathic pain, STX-100 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, anti-CD40 Ligand in general lupus,
and anti-LINGO in both acute optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis.
We'd like to take the opportunity to review our ongoing anti-LINGO clinical studies and clarify the timing of
anticipated data readouts. The Phase II program remains on-track and includes two studies, one in MS and the other in
acute optic neuritis. We believe the totality of data from these studies will provide us with a clearer understanding of
anti-LINGO's potential in both clinical settings.
The goal of the acute optic neuritis study is to demonstrate proof of mechanism in humans. We will examine whether
anti-LINGO is able to protect and repair the optic nerve when given shortly after the acute damage caused by a
demyelinating lesion of the optic nerve, or optic neuritis.
The study will examine various endpoints, including novel endpoints developed by Biogen Idec. The primary endpoint,
visual evoked potential, will measure effects on optic nerve's signal conduction. We'll also use optical coherence
tomography imaging to determine if anti-LINGO treatment impacts the viability of axons in the optic nerve and retinal
ganglion cells.
As an exploratory endpoint, the study includes objective and patient reported outcome measures to examine any
potential benefit on visual function. The study is fully enrolled, and we expect to disclose top line results in January,
2015 and full data disclosure at a 2015 medical meeting.
In the second study, we're evaluating whether anti-LINGO can facilitate remyelination and functional improvement in
patients with active relapsing MS. The primary endpoint is the clinical composite measure testing various aspects of
both physical and cognitive improvement. As exploratory endpoint, we'll also examine various advanced brain imaging
techniques to detect potential remyelination and axon preservation, as well as numerous blood and CSF biomarkers.
The MS study is designed to treat patients for approximately 18 months, with the primary efficacy endpoint being
evaluated at the end of that period. There will be a preliminary look at data after all patients have reached 12 months of
treatment duration to inform future study planning.
Based on current enrollment rates, which are ahead of projections, we expect the interim look to occur in the second
half of 2015. Investigators, patients and the study management team will remain blinded in order to preserve the
integrity of the ongoing study. We expect MS study results to be presented at a scientific meeting in 2016.
We look forward to sharing additional data as our pipeline advances. I'll now pass the call to Tony.
Stuart Anthony Kingsley
Thanks, Doug. The second quarter marked another strong performance for our commercial organization. We think we
demonstrated that we can launch multiple products while also maximizing our base business. This has been no small

feat for our company, and I'm very pleased with how the commercial team has executed and driven results.
Let's start with MS. We continue to grow our MS market share through executing our franchise strategy. TECFIDERA
in the U.S. continued on a solid trajectory. TECFIDERA has been broadly used across numerous patient segments,
newly diagnosed, switches prompted by efficacy and non-efficacy reasons, as well as patients returning to the market.
We believe TECFIDERA is generally viewed by physicians and patients as efficacious with an attractive safety profile
and a manageable tolerability profile. Importantly, patient retention rates have been similar to other marketed MS
therapies and in-line with our expectations.
Outside the U.S., TECFIDERA is off to a strong start. In countries where we've launched, including Germany, the
uptake for TECFIDERA has been encouraging. Where we had been more cautious about uptake in Europe given
TECFIDERA's later entry in the markets where other orals had a stronger foothold, we now believe that we're seeing
launch trajectories that are similar to what we experienced in the U.S.
We're also making good progress on reimbursement. Currently, we have obtained full reimbursement in six markets,
and TECFIDERA is also available in a number of other countries with limited reimbursement. In the U.K., we recently
received a favorable pricing decision from NICE and we expect to obtain full reimbursement in most of the other large
MS markets by the end of 2015.
During the quarter, AVONEX gained share among interferon therapies. As expected, injectable therapies continued to
decline as patients move toward oral therapies. While global units for AVONEX declined 7% year-over-year,
AVONEX has shown staying power in a dynamic market.
We look forward to the potential launch of PLEGRIDY to extend our leadership in interferon. We believe PLEGRIDY
has the potential to provide MS patients a combination of strong efficacy, a safety profile consistent with a MS beta
interferon class in a subcutaneous auto-injector administered every two weeks.
Across markets, TYSABRI demand remained solid as physicians continued to choose this therapy for patients requiring
high efficacy. The U.S. TYSABRI business improved as patient retention rates are stabilizing and are now similar to
pre-TECFIDERA launch.
TYSABRI performance in Europe was also favorable despite the increased oral competition. We continue to focus on
execution. And despite an increasingly crowded market, we believe neurologists continue to view TYSABRI as having
unique power to control disease.
Turning to hemophilia, ALPROLIX is off to a solid start since its introduction to the U.S. market in May. Our focus
to-date has been in two areas: raising awareness of the therapy's attributes and streamlining patient access. Our field
force has built strong relationships with customers and is achieving its early goals of reach and frequency with
hemophilia treatment centers, or HTCs. As of the end of the quarter, approximately one-third of HTCs had prescribed
ALPROLIX, which we believe indicates very good initial interest.
Early indications suggest ALPROLIX has not faced significant hurdles with reimbursement. We've also established
financial and patient support programs which have enabled a smooth initial launch.
As expected, we believe the majority of ALPROLIX patients have started with once-weekly prophylaxis, a significant
improvement over the current standard of care of two or more prophylactic infusions per week.
Turning to ELOCTATE, we're pleased to have launched ELOCTATE in the U.S. last week with what we believe to be
a competitive label. Our initial objectives are focused on extensive education to physicians, payers and advocacy
groups, and we're also beginning to expedite access for patients starting on ELOCTATE.
We're pleased with the performance of the commercial organization. Across an expanding portfolio of therapies, we
believe we're demonstrating strong execution and solid results.
I'll now pass the call to Paul.

Paul J. Clancy
Thanks, Tony. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.01 in the second quarter. Our non- GAAP diluted
earnings per share in the second quarter were $3.49. I'll provide additional details on the AIFA agreement, which
benefited both revenue and earnings in Q2 in a minute.
Walking down the P&L, let me start with revenues. Total revenue for the second quarter grew 40% year-over-year to
approximately $2.4 billion.
Second quarter AVONEX worldwide revenue was $774 million. In the U.S., Q2 AVONEX revenue increased 4%
compared to prior year to $498 million. And outside the U.S., Q2 AVONEX revenue was $276 million, a decrease of
6% compared to prior year.
Global TECFIDERA revenue was $700 million in Q2. In the U.S., TECFIDERA revenue was $585 million. We're very
pleased with the compliance in gross to net performance, which provided a benefit to revenue in the quarter.
We ended the quarter with approximately 3.5 weeks of inventory in the channel, which includes specialty pharmacies
and wholesalers. This is a slight decline versus prior quarter.
International TECFIDERA revenue was approximately $115 million, as the launch in Germany has exceeded our
expectations. Germany represented approximately three-quarters of our ex-U.S. revenues.
TYSABRI worldwide revenue net of hedging was $533 million in the second quarter. These results were comprised of
$250 million in the U.S. and $284 million internationally. TYSABRI benefited from two events which helped the
year-over-year comparison. Recall during the first quarter of 2013, we increased inventory levels in anticipation of the
asset transfer from Elan to Biogen Idec. This equated to in-market revenues of approximately $26 million, increasing
Q1 of 2013 and decreasing Q2 of 2013.
In the second quarter of this year, TYSABRI revenues outside the U.S. included the impact of an agreement with
AIFA. Our agreement with AIFA provided for the elimination of the reimbursement limit related to TYSABRI sales in
Italy from February 2013 going forward. As a result, we recorded approximately $54 million of previously deferred
revenues related to the period from February 2013 through March 31, 2014. And in the second quarter, we recorded
TYSABRI revenues in Italy at the full reimbursed price, which increased revenues by approximately $14 million
versus prior trend.
We continue to be in discussions with AIFA to resolve our dispute concerning the periods February 2009 through
January 2013. Nevertheless, we'll be booking revenues at the full reimbursed price going forward. Adjusting for these
items, we're very pleased to see TYSABRI experienced low-double-digit revenue growth in the second quarter.
Moving to hemophilia, ALPROLIX revenue in Q2, its first quarter on the market, was $10 million.
Turning to our anti-CD20 franchise, U.S. profit share was $285 million for the second quarter, and royalties and profit
share and sales of rituximab outside the U.S. were $18 million. The result was $303 million of net revenue from
unconsolidated joint business.
Now, turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L. Q2 cost of goods sold were $292 million, or 12% of
revenue. Q2 non-GAAP R&D expense was $446 million, or 18% of revenue, which includes approximately $40
million in milestone and other payments related to our collaborations with Eisai and Isis. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A
expense was $540 million, or 22% of total revenue.
Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 27%.
During the quarter, as part of our shares stabilization plan, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for a total of
approximately $340 million. Our weighted average diluted shares were $237 million. And we ended the quarter with
approximately $2.6 billion in cash and marketable securities, which approximately two-thirds is within the U.S.

As a reminder, we expect to enter a period of large TECFIDERA CVR payments to the former shareholders of
Fumapharm. In Q2, we accrued $150 million as we reached $2 billion in cumulative sales of TECFIDERA.
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $3.49 for the second quarter, an increase of
52%.
Now, let me turn to our updated full year 2014 guidance. We now expect total revenue growth between 38% and 41%.
Clearly, this change represents a meaningful increase from prior guidance, owing primarily to the growth of
TECFIDERA in the U.S. and EU, the strength of our other MS therapies, and clarity on the AIFA pricing matter.
Let me provide additional color. First in U.S., underlying demand for TECFIDERA in addition to compliance in gross
to net dynamics are all anticipated to be favorable throughout 2014 compared to our prior plan.
In Europe, as Tony noted, we had originally assumed TECFIDERA would've experienced a slower uptake than the
U.S. due to delayed launch. Our forecast now assumes TECFIDERA uptake in Europe similar to what we saw in the
U.S. on a country-by-country rollout. We continue to expect Germany will be the primary TECFIDERA revenue driver
outside the U.S. for 2014. And it does continue to appear that TECFIDERA has expanded the market.
Second, we believe AVONEX and TYSABRI performance will remain resilient, each carving solid roles in the market.
And our 2014 guidance now includes the impact of the agreement with AIFA as we picked up the previously deferred
revenue and will no longer defer revenue for the balance of the year. The full year impact from that AIFA agreement is
favorable by approximately $96 million versus prior guidance.
R&D expense is expected to be between 20% and 21% of sales. Our full year R&D forecast now includes greater than
$150 million for the balance of the year for business development opportunities. Coupled with what we had spent on
Eisai and Sangamo, this represents over $300 million for the full year, an increase over prior guidance. This remains
strategically important focus for the company. However, if we cannot find high-quality pipeline assets by the end of the
year, some of this amount may drop to the bottom line.
SG&A expense is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% of revenue. SG&A now includes increased investments in
2014 associated with the ongoing TECFIDERA and hemophilia launches. We realize this is a meaningful increase in
SG&A dollars and remain committed to SG&A leverage in 2015.
As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.90 and $13.10, and GAAP EPS to be between
$11.26 and $11.46.
I'll turn the call over to George for his closing comments.
George A. Scangos, Ph.D.
Okay. Thanks, Paul. So in closing, we had another productive quarter and we successfully executed against several key
objectives. We said earlier this year that our goals for 2014 were aggressive and will be requiring focus and dedication
from our employees, and we've made significant progress.
But with the second half of the year yet to go, we still have a number of product launches and pipeline milestones
ahead of us. So our efforts over the coming months will focus on the launch of four new products in two distinct
therapeutic areas, a real challenge for a company of our size.
We'll continue to launch TECFIDERA across the EU as we work to expand marketing approvals across the globe. We
anticipate both U.S. and the EU launch of PLEGRIDY for relapsing MS, and that's an important part of our strategy for
maintaining our leadership among the injectable products for MS.
And then, the continued launch of our hemophilia products – ALPROLIX for hemophilia B in the U.S. and other
countries including Japan, and ELOCTATE for hemophilia A – an important step towards revenue diversification.

We also expect an important part of our long-term value creation will come from a number of mid-stage proof of
biology and proof-of-concept readouts this year and the next.
Our strategy for sustainable growth centers on deep commitment to the patient, leveraging our areas of expertise in
neurology, hematology and immunology, while continuing to focus on innovation. We believe that if we anchor
ourselves in these three tenets, patients will benefit and meaningful shareholder value creation should follow.
As always, I want to thank our employees who are dedicated to making a positive impact on patients' lives and the
patients and physicians who are involved in our clinical development programs. The achievements we've made together
could not have been realized without their steadfast passion and commitment.
So, thank you all for joining us this morning. And operator, we'll now open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is
now open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning. On TECFIDERA, just drilling down a little bit, the beat
was significantly higher than anyone would've thought so I'm just trying to understand the compliance you mentioned.
Do you think that that's actually getting better, that there's less drop-outs over time? Is anything there that you're
seeing? There's still a lot of people out there suggesting that that's a hindrance for some patients. So maybe, just
thinking about that compliance rate over the last year.
And then just as a follow-up for Paul, there's been a lot of things in the industry as it relates to M&A in domestic and
foreign companies. Have you been thinking about this? Is there any comments you can make as it relates to tax
strategy? Are there other things you can do to impact your margins such as [ph] what they'll be in your (25:28) AbbVie
collaboration? Maybe, any comments around that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Michael, this is Paul. I'll try to take both of them. Yeah, we're very pleased with the
TECFIDERA results for the quarter, but I'd say it was across both Europe and the U.S.
When we refer to compliance, we're actually referring to essentially the number of pills a patient takes over the course
of a month, if you will. That's slightly different than discontinuation rates or persistency, which I think you had kind of
referred to.
The persistency and discontinuation rates are still a little bit opaque for us. So I think that what we said in the past,
around kind of 10% to 20% over the course of a year, I think we still believe that and that's kind of the triangulation of
the data. But I think the TECFIDERA numbers were just kind of real good performance in compliance, better than
expectations in the United States on gross-to-net, and certainly the German launch has exceeded our expectations.
We're probably about five-and-a-half months into the German launch. We're a little bit less time in a few other
countries, but we're very pleased with the performance in Europe.
With respect to inversions, it's obviously a very topical – I mean you can't kind of open up The Journal any day without
being able to read an article on re-domiciling. It's clearly something that we've thought about over the years, right? I
mean we did an asset purchase agreement with Elan a year ago. So the course of time leading into that, we clearly
thought about it, because the ability to do that has been around for a long period of time.
I'll give you a couple of perspectives on how we think about it, because I certainly don't want you to lead into that we're
all excited about it just given the press news. Kind of just as a level point, let me explain our effective tax rate is kind of
a combination of the RITUXAN cash flow, which is really all U.S. cash flow so it's going to be a high 30%s on [ph] net
(27:44) cash flow and everything else that is probably more biopharmaceutical-like. Even re-domiciling without IP
migration would not meaningfully affect the RITUXAN cash flow tax rate. And we generally cost share assets in our

pipeline. So, that's the way to think about our tax rate as it stands now.
The way we conceptually think about a business combination which would result in re-domiciling is all the benefits of
re-domiciling are essentially like a synergy. And of course, you always want to try to get synergies in a business, but
we don't think that's a rationale for a business combination. That has to make industrial logic, first and foremost. So if
there's industrial logic which we just have not seen around a business combination, then there'd be a possibility for that.
I think the other thing to point out for Biogen Idec, a major consideration for us which is probably more acute than
others, is for our long-term shareholders, it would result in a meaningful capital gain. Just the result of we have
shareholders that have been in the stock for a very long period of time, and with the capital appreciation of the stock,
that's a major, major consideration that we think about. So, that's a little bit of perspective.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. First of all for George. It's been
very noticeable this year that you flagged the intention to enter into new early and mid-stage business development
opportunities. Given the fine form and front-running commercial performance you've delivered in the first two furlongs
of this year, do you see potential for even greater focus on these deals and which domains would you like to dominate
by these deals?
Let me sneak another one in for Doug. So anti-LINGO, how will the renewed synergy data influence the Phase III trial
endpoints? Do you see more of an evolution or revolution in endpoints normally seen in Phase III MS studies? Thank
you.
<A - George A. Scangos, Ph.D.>: Okay, Ravi, this is George. I'll take the first part of your question. Look, I think we
said for a while now that our strategy was to continue to build out our pipeline so that we can have a high-quality
pipeline of sufficient size to generate us additional value as we go forward. We've done a number of business
development deals, already a couple this year, certainly several last year, and we'll continue to do them. I don't see any
big divergence from what we've done in the past. As Paul said, we have money now in the budget for additional deals
this year, but that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to go spend it, right, that we have money available if and when
the appropriate technologies or product opportunities come our way.
We will focus in our areas of expertise, so on the neurodegenerative diseases, immunology, hematology. I think there's
a big advantage to sticking to our knitting and focusing in areas where we have real expertise. A lot of this business is
based on information arbitrage and getting some insights that not everybody has, and we believe that's an important
part of our strategy. We've done that focusing now for years and we'll continue to work in those areas where we believe
we have a real depth of knowledge.
<A - Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D.>: And, Ravi, this is Doug. I'll take your question about revolution or evolution with
respect to synergy in the endpoints. I guess that's in the eye of the beholder, but I think what we're trying to do here
with this study is learn as much as we can about the correlation between remyelination and the impact on what we think
are important parameters of disease progression in these patients.
What we're hoping to see with the study is actually an improvement in EDSS and a change in cognition. Cognition is
not a sort of traditional endpoint, if you will, from a regulatory approval perspective, but we think it's important in
terms of understanding the totality of impact on remyelination in the brain of patients with relapsing forms of MS and,
actually, progressive forms as well.
So, I think the study is designed to collect and capture as much information as we can. The paradigm that we're trying
to put forward is to improve outcomes for patients and not just stabilize disease. So I think in that regard, it's probably
somewhat revolutionary. And I think that the study is designed in a way to guide us forward, not only with LINGO but

with other strategies that we've got further back in the pipeline that are also geared towards remyelinating, BIIB061
being the first candidate to go forward.
So I think it's important that we run the study in a blinded fashion through the 18 months of the study, and that was the
decision that we made and that we've talked about in my comments in the earnings call. And I think that that will give
us the information we need to plan an appropriate Phase III study, where we are looking to change the treatment
paradigm in MS by actually causing improvement in outcomes for patients as opposed to just stabilizing disease.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a – just one, a topic that hasn't
been addressed yet on this call, but I'd just like to get your, Doug and Al, if he's on the call, just get your current
thinking on TYSABRI in SPMS. What would be the biologic rationale for TYSABRI to actually show efficacy in that
indication?
And then my second question I promise is very easy. Paul, can you just remind us roughly what the German price is for
TECFIDERA? Thank you. And whether or not that could change? Thank you.
<A - Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D.>: Hi, Mark, this is Al Sandrock. On TYSABRI SPMS, there continues to
be emerging data that gives positive signals potentially for how TYSABRI could work. One is that there was a
publication earlier this year, labeled – it was called the study of a proof-of-concept of natalizumab in SPMS. It was
published by a Danish group. And it showed that when you look at CSF neurofilament levels, that the levels drop after
starting TYSABRI treatment and that the drop occurred within six months to nine months.
So I think that's yet more evidence, in addition to the evidence we've been talking about for a couple of years now,
which is the CXCL13 decrease, which is a marker of follicular dendritic cells which we think are important in
organizing the sub-meningeal lymphoid follicle that, in about half the patients, seem to be important for progression in
SMPS. So, I think there's continuing biological data that tells us that we could potentially see a positive affect with
natalizumab in SPMS.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: And, Mark, just for the quick response on the German
price, it's in the low-€20s on a euro basis on an annual cost of therapy, which gets essentially to right around $30,000
annual cost of therapy in Germany right now. And that, as you know, is in the one-year "free pricing" period. So it's
actually important to keep in mind – so I appreciate you kind of pointing it out – important to keep in mind that as we
spin into 2015, we'll likely move into a different, more negotiated price, likely, through the AMNOG process.

Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for taking the question. And again, congratulations on the really
terrific results, particularly in TECFIDERA in Europe. I'll try and slip in two, as what seems to be the fashion. Can we
just be clear on the LINGO MS study? We won't hear, in 2015, the results of the 12-month analysis, but we will hear
the 18-month results disclosed presumably not until 2016?
And then secondly, Tony, could you just give us a little more color on exactly where TECFIDERA is in the ex-German
markets, not the smaller markets but the other big five European countries, when you expect to actually get the launch
going there?
<A - Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D.>: Geoff, this is Doug. You're correct, that the data flow is as you described it. A
small team internally will have access to the 12-month data. But we've decided that it's important to avoid the

possibility of creating bias in the study outcomes, to maintain our disclosure in 2016. So once the study is fully
complete, we'll disclose the data at that time. And we think it's important to keep the study blinded between the
12-month and 18-month timeframe, and that will kick the disclosure over into 2016, as you described.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah, it's Tony. On the ex-U.S., so we have – you saw the nice opinion from the
U.K. The process, once they issue the FAD, is six weeks to eight weeks they give guidance. And then, there's a couple
of months to get funding in. So, think Q4, by the time that the funding hits the market. We're in the market in France in
a limited way in the hospital channel. Negotiation is ongoing. We also think that's Q4 timing. Spain and Italy would
likely be 2015, hard to handicap but we think the first half of 2015.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Paul or George. It sounds like business is good, the
revenue stream is increasingly diversified. The outlook is very favorable, you're building cash. So, I guess I'm asking
about your capital reallocation plan and thoughts on the dividend or a substantial share buyback.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Thanks, Eric. Yeah, important question. So we certainly rebuilt the cash position over the last
12 months. As we talked about this 12 months ago, following the asset purchase of TYSABRI running on fumes. That
has changed meaningfully as the businesses performed quite well. We want to continue to be cognizant over the kind of
next couple of year time period, that we be probably, greater than I would've expected, have the potential for the CVR
tech-related payments just to come maybe at a corporate pace. Those, obviously, term out, as people know, but we
wanted you mindful of that. We continue – our strategic bias remains these tuck-in acquisitions where we think it's core
to the business and great internal rates of return and all that.
With that said, more than likely, we have excess cash over the next number of years. We've been having very
constructive conversations over the last couple of months with our shareholders on this topic, not all of them but a
number of them. I think we completely agree, it's one of the more important judgments that we have. We agree that it is
all about deploying this and returning it in the way that maximizes the intrinsic value. We'll continue to have that
dialogue. I think it's a mosaic in terms of preferences around which vehicle to return cash in. We'll have to synthesize
that and get to our own judgment. So, nothing to report per se yet but very high on the agenda of our conversations here
– Georg and I and with the board. And hopefully, we start to get clarity in the near term. George?
<A - George A. Scangos, Ph.D.>: Don't have too much to add to that. I think, look, this is the topic, as Paul said, that
we are in discussions with the board with a number of our shareholders. And as we have started to refill our coffers
after the Elan acquisition, that becomes something we're discussing more, but nothing really to add at this time.

Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. It's a question maybe for Al or Doug. When you look
at the combination, admittedly, it's an animal model. And the EAE model is not a great model because inflammatory.
But when you look at LINGO and AVONEX, together, there's some data suggesting maybe LINGO alone is just as
good as the combo and perhaps LINGO is more synergistic with an oral like GILENYA. So I wanted to get your
thoughts on that.
And then, if you don't mind, I'm just going to sneak in for Paul. The IMS data, how good is that? It sounds like,
historically, you've said that it's [ph] good, predicting (41:56) TECFIDERA, excluding the stocking. Although it sounds
like there was a slight destocking, yet you beat by about 30% the IMS' kind of prescription number. So, what are we
missing there? Thank you.

<A - Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D.>: On the EAE question, it's been traditionally difficult to see a robust
effect of interferon in EAE. So, it doesn't surprise me that adding LINGO to AVONEX doesn't give you very much
more than LINGO. I think the bottom line is that the effect of LINGO, that even in a knockout setting or other settings,
it's pretty robust on remyelination animal models in general, including EAE.
And then in terms of combining, that is it better with GILENYA, yes, we published data that suggests that you have to
be cautious about these S1P antagonists. Some of them actually have negative effects on oligodendrocyte
differentiation, remyelination. So I think it needs to be studied further, but I think it's a very complex field because
many of these antagonists cross to multiple sub-types of S1P receptors and they could each have different activities.
And so, we're actually studying that quite extensively ourselves.
<A - Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D.>: I'd also say that one of the issues that is still an open issue for us with respect to
the Phase III study design is what we will combine with anti-LINGO – assuming we'll get to Phase III, what we'll
combine with anti-LINGO as far as a disease-modifying therapy. And part of that will depend upon conversations with
regulators in terms of what they're going to require vis-à-vis the kind of labeling that we'd be able to achieve. So that's
an open question and one that's under active debate right now, but we'll obviously require some input from the
regulators in terms of how that proceeds in Phase III.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Yaron, on the first part of your question, as we said in the past, over time IMS seems to be
predictive. In any given week or any given quarter, it can have some wobbling as it tracks. Our inventory in the
channel, actually, as I mentioned, modestly went down, so I don't think that's kind of driving it. It may be gross-to-net,
as I had pointed out. We had originally thought in our plan that the gross-to-net percentage would approach AVONEX
this year, and it's probably really closer to mid-teens rate. So, we're getting a little bit of favorability which pulled
through the second quarter. That may account for some of it.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to ask, when you launch
TECFIDERA in the U.S., you obviously solved through a pattern of TYSABRI patients or some weakness in
TYSABRI. It's hard for me to break out what's going on in Europe given some of the agreements and one-time items.
I'm wondering if you think we should expect to see that in Europe as well or not. And then, Paul, can you just be
specific on what the sort of gross-to-net swing for TECFIDERA in the U.S. was? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks, Matthew. It's Tony. So the short answer is yes, we've expected to see some
TECFIDERA impact on TYSABRI in Europe but substantially muted relative to what we saw in the U.S. The reality is
in 2013, one of the issues with TYSABRI in 2013 is outside the U.S. and largely in Europe, we had a bunch of patients
with discontinuance, switched to GILENYA. We also had GILENYA get in front of TYSABRI. So we think we
actually absorbed a lot of that impact of the oral switch, frankly, when we didn't have TECFIDERA in the market. We
aren't going to see some switch from TYSABRI to TECFIDERA. We think it's less dramatic than in the U.S., frankly,
because a bunch of it happened with GILENYA 12 months ago.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: And then, Matt, with respect to the kind of gross-to-net question, I wouldn't characterize it or
portray it as a swing. I think I'd portray it more as our prior thinking in kind of conversations with you had been that,
what we had thought originally was that it was approaching AVONEX-like, which would have getting it close to 20%,
and it's probably more mid-teens-ish, which is benefiting from that vis-à-vis our original plan.

<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First on ALPROLIX, anything notable about the early
adopters that you've seen there? And anything we can read through to ELOCTATE? And I know it's still early there,
early days, but anything we can read through from ALPROLIX to ELOCTATE? And then, Paul, on SG&A leverage,
you mentioned a commitment there again. I think consensus is [indiscernible] (47:14) about a 1% improvement. Is that
the right order of magnitude? Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Good question. Tony on hemophilia. So, look, with ALPROLIX, we're pleased, to
be clear. We always said this was difficult to predict, what the trajectory will be, because it's such a patient-driven
market and there hasn't been a new entrant in some time. Look, having said that, we always thought there would be a
cohort of patients that we could activate more quickly; prophylaxis patients who were really – bought the proposition,
were well informed. And there were, certainly, investigators or others who were more familiar with the product.
So I think we've demonstrated that that has happened. That's who we sort of captured as the early adopters, which is
good. We're very pleased with that. We're getting access to HPCs. But on ALPROLIX, I think the harder work begins
now, which is that next year of patients, convincing them this is the right value proposition and activating them and
getting the physicians ready. But we feel very pleased with the execution.
ELOCTATE, yeah, early days, too early to comment on the performance. We're also confident in the ELOCTATE
product profile. It's a less simple sell, frankly. The ALPROLIX once-a-week sell is a pretty straightforward message.
It's easier to counter-position. You don't have to listen to some of the competitors' earning calls to talk about what
they're doing.
So, we have some work to do to get out and educate physicians and patients. We think the extended half-life makes a
big difference for patients, and we think we're going to be able to communicate that message to patients and also to
hemophilia treatment centers. So early days, but pleased with where we are.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Terence, on the SG&A leverage question, so the 100 basis points, I mean certainly not crazy. I
mean it's obviously going to be a function of revenue as we spin into 2015. I'd hate to, though, get pinned down on that.
Let me kind of give you, more broadly, the thinking.
The thinking more broadly is, look, we realize the SG&A growth has been pretty meaningful, right? I mean just in
terms of raw dollars, it's been very meaningful. We have, all along, thought that that has been the right business
judgment to make during this unprecedented time of launches. For a company our size, to go through the
close-to-handful-of-launches, we needed to make sure we weren't, as I've said before, penny wise and pound foolish.
Conceptually, where we're thinking as we move into 2015 is that those launches, we now move to a time period of
leverage, and I think that's both a cost and shareholder value perspective as well as a cultural perspective, to make sure
we don't kind of take a base that was designed for one reason and just keep building off of the base. And conceptually, I
think that we believe, as we go into 2015 and 2016, the resource allocation shift can actually move towards making
sure we're building the pipeline.

Question on one of your pipeline opportunities in IPF with STX-100. I've asked about this before, but in the past
quarter we've gotten two complete Phase III data sets from other IPF drugs and they look like they're going to be
approved into next year. And so the question is, if your Phase IIa data are positive in terms of the biomarkers and other
signs and symptoms of disease, what would then be the next step for STX-100? Would you go straight into
combination studies? With that be additional Phase II work before moving into Phase III? And then related, is there
either one of the two assets that are out there that look more combinable or more attractive as a combination partner?

<A - Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D.>: Yeah, hi, Matt. This is Doug. I think at the moment, the issue of combination
versus whether you would target later-stage patients which presumably the labels for these two front runner drugs
wouldn't cover, I think there's a variety of different ways that we can think about running the next series of studies. I
think we're still exploring the data from both the InterMune and the BI study, but I think there's a lot of options that are
available to us. As you point out, one option is obviously looking at combination therapy.
I can't give you a clear preference yet, other than to say that there is a difference in the safety profile between the two
drugs and that would lead one to believe that perhaps InterMune will have a leg up in terms of market share and
penetration. So that might be a bit more attractive to think about from a combination perspective, but I think that the
differential mechanisms lend themselves to combinations.
And I also think that this is a market that's going to evolve, much like other disease-modifying therapy markets, not
unlike MS which is not every drug will work in every patient. And so, the market will evolve with space for multiple
entries into that market over time. And I think that STX-100 represents an attractive opportunity, either as single agent
or potentially in combination with one or both of those agents.

Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Robyn
Karnauskas, your line is open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Sorry about that, I was on mute. Thanks for taking my question. So in
Alzheimer's program, can you walk us through the rationale, Al, for targeting the insoluble form of Abeta versus the
soluble form and why you think that will work?
And then, just any color on the second-generation XTENylated hemophilia product with Amunix? What could be the
timeline? What's the science behind the longer half-life of that technology? Thanks.
<A - Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D.>: Yeah, hi, Robyn. This is Al. So we – if you have a drug that binds to
soluble forms, it's going to have a hard time getting to the plaque, because there's soluble forms not only circulating in
the blood but also there's going to be soluble forms all around the brain. So if you really want to – and many of the
dystrophic neurites are around the plaque. So we think the plaque, if we can remove the plaque, we can remove not
only the fibrillar forms of Abeta but all the other smaller forms, the oligomers that we believe are toxic, not only to
synapses but also to nerve fibers. So I think having a drug that targets the plaque allows access of the antibody to, we
think, the core of where the toxic proteins are emanating from, and that's our rationale.
But also, if we look back at the old paper where the neuroimmune antibody came from, those are patients in that small
study of 30 patients who had developed antibodies to plaque amyloids actually were doing better than the patients who
had not developed antibodies to plaque amyloid on cognitive studies. And it was the basis of that paper that was
published in [indiscernible] (55:17) years ago that got us excited in this particular antibody.
<A - Douglas E. Williams, Ph.D.>: And Robyn, this is Doug. I think you're alluding to the next-generation Factor VIII
that utilizes the XTEN technology. That could come into the clinic as early as next year. That's our hope. And the
technology behind that molecule is really, based on the fact that if you look at all of the extended half-life Factor VIII
molecules that are out there, they're all clustered around one-and-a-half to two-fold greater half-life than the
unmodified versions of Factor VIII. That's because they interact with von Willebrand factor.
And so, we said about trying to engineer the molecule to sort of break through that barrier and based on the preclinical
data that we've accumulated thus far, it looks like that we have probably another two-fold extension of the half-life
beyond what we have with ELOCTATE right now, which could be very meaningful from the standpoint of further
extending the frequency of infusions for patients with hemophilia A. So, we're hoping to bring that forward as early as
next year.

Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. One for Doug or Al. So when you look at
anti-LINGO in MS, I know it's tough to say specifically, but mechanistically should there be a meaningful difference
between 12 months and 18 months of treatment? And are you guys assuming, for these novel endpoints, a decline in the
AVONEX-only arm? And then, just a quick one for Tony on daclizumab. You have Phase III data in hand. I just
wanted to get the early read about how you're thinking about positioning. Thanks.
<A - Alfred W. Sandrock, Jr., M.D., Ph.D.>: So, Jeff, this is Al. As Doug said in his great answer to this question,
what we're trying to do is learn as much as we can. This is really the first well-controlled trial of any drug for
remyelination.
What we're trying to do in the MS study and in the combination of the MS and optic neuritis study is to understand,
first, do we get remyelination when we look at images; second, do we get any electrophysiologic consequences, so
that's why we're looking at nerve conduction velocity in the optic neuritis; and then third, and this is the most important
thing, is what's the connection of these biological changes, if you will, or electrophysiologic changes to clinical
endpoints? Because ultimately, that's what we're going to have to show on Phase III is, assuming we get remyelination
or preservation of axon, are we going to get improvement in disability, are we going to get improvement in cognition?
And the timing of these things is probably going to be different. For example, I can imagine that we would get a rapid
effect on remyelination more rapid, and then you would have a delayed effect on axon preservation and, even more,
delayed effect on cognition or disability improvement. I think it's the timing of this and the correlation, as Doug said,
between these biological measurements of these clinical endpoints that we're trying to sort out in these two studies.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: So, Tony on daclizumab. Look, with obviously top line data has been released, we'll
have to see as the full dataset gets released. So, before the other market reacts to it. Also, we don't have a sort of
detailed market back view on that. But we think there's clearly a place for this. It's got a nice combination of efficacy,
one-time-a-month dosing. I think physicians are intrigued by the MOA, which gives them another option. The open
questions will be through registration and labeling, where it comes out in terms of safety monitoring and all that other
stuff.
There's a meaningful switched population of patients still who are going to come off injectables, who are going to come
off orals. There are people for whom TYSABRI patients JCV-positive might be appropriate. So, we'll have to do more
detail as we get the more-detailed data, but it feels like it's an interesting mechanism that has physicians intrigued and it
feels like there's a package there that could have a meaningful place in the market.
<A - George A. Scangos, Ph.D.>: So, Jeff, this is George. Let me just pick up a little bit on the LINGO question. At
the end of 12 months when we do the interim analysis, we'll know the data, right, which is the important aspect for us.
And there'll be a group of people in here who will know, and that's important for us to know, how to start planning for
the Phase III, how to design it. We are incredibly excited about this project as lots of people outside the company seem
to be because of its potential. We just want to make sure we get it right.
The important thing is that we get a good trial that gives us an accurate picture of the potential of LINGO, and that we
don't jeopardize that trial. It will be part of the registration package. It's not a Phase III pivotal trial, but it will be an
important part of the registration package.
And so, the two most important criteria is that we know the data so we can start planning and that we conduct the trial
and don't impact the integrity of the trial. Unfortunately, that means a likely delay of when we would tell you the data,
although the trial itself seems to be somewhat ahead of schedule.
So, those are the reasons. And we'd like to be transparent, as we always do, but we have other considerations to think
about here as well.
