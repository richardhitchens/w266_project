Ursula M. Burns
Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Today we're reporting our first quarter 2014 earnings that reflect the
benefits of our diversified portfolio and improved performance across a number of areas, including ITO, Document
Technology and Document Outsourcing. And within BPO, our commercial business, especially commercial healthcare,
showed good results. We did have challenges in the quarter, especially in the area of government healthcare, which I'll
get to in a few minutes.

So, let's begin with a review of our 2014 priorities. The first priority is growing revenue. Today, Services represents
57% of our revenue and we continue to expect that number to grow to two-thirds by 2017. The shift over time will
drive improved revenue growth. To realize this growth, we need to strengthen and differentiate our portfolio. We
participate in some very attractive segments of the Services and Document Technology markets, and we are investing
in these areas to increase the value we bring to our customers.
I was very encouraged by what I heard from our customers a few weeks ago at our event called simple@work. Over
800 customers got to see all that Xerox has to offer, the innovation we're bringing and the commitment we have to
solving their real-world business problems. What I heard from them was very positive. They're eager to understand all
of our offerings and work more with Xerox.
Another priority for us is to improve our cost structure and eliminate areas of underperformance. We have made great
strides on this in Document Technology over the past few years and we're on a path to do the same for Services.
Key to executing on these priorities is having a strong team to drive long-term results. We have a very seasoned team
of executives with good subject matter expertise and we have brought in proven leaders to broaden our perspectives
and execution capabilities.
A few weeks ago I announced the appointment of a new head of our Services business, Bob Zapfel and the retirement
of Lynn Blodgett. I want to thank Lynn for his service and dedication to Xerox and welcome Bob, who is with us on
the call today. Bob and his team are focused on the areas where we know we can and must improve. He'll lead the
implementation of our Services' five-plank strategy, which includes driving our cost initiatives while supporting
investments in areas where we see opportunity and benefits for our customers, opportunities like global growth where
we are seeing progress. And across both segments, Services and Document Technology, we have a keen focus on
supporting our customers, our investors and our people.
Our final priority is to continue to focus on capital allocation to deliver shareholder returns. We have a business with
very strong cash flow, and we are committed to deploying that cash in a balanced way to drive shareholder value now
and in the future.
So, moving on, I'd like to share my perspective on Q1 results, a few positive takeaways from the quarter. We reported
adjusted EPS of $0.27, which was above our guidance. Operating margin was up year-over-year by more than a point
and operating profit grew double digits driven by Document Technology and Document Outsourcing as well as
improvements in commercial BPO and ITO, and we generated over $250 million of cash in the quarter, which positions
us well for our full-year objectives. We repurchased $275 million in shares and we are increasing share repurchase
expectations for the year.
Some challenges did persist on a couple of fronts; revenue declined 2%. Although this is an improvement from quarter
four and is within our expected range for Q1, it is below our full-year objectives, so we'll need to continue to see
improvement, especially in the second half when we lap some of the near-term headwinds. And we came up short in
Services margins, which I know is an area of keen focus for investors and I can assure everyone an area of intense
focus internally.
The shortfall is driven by incremental costs incurred in our Medicaid and health insurance exchange implementations.
Kathy will add more detail, but know that we are committed to doing what's needed to get these systems stood up and
we're confident that these investments will pay dividends down the line in this very attractive market segment. As we
deal with challenges in this business and work to remedy the issues for the future, we need to reset our guidance
expectations. We'll go through the specifics in a moment.
It is important to note that we're making margin progress in other areas. For instance, we saw good margin
improvement year-over-year in our commercial BPO and ITO businesses and I'm extremely pleased with the revenue
growth and margin improvements in commercial healthcare, but we have much more work to do.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kathy and then I'll wrap up and we'll open the call for questions. Kathy?

Kathryn A. Mikells
Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by walking through our earnings. Overall, we were
pleased with our growth in operating profit and the related operating margin improvements in the quarter. Our core
operating results came in a bit better than expected, driven by strong margin expansion in our Document Technology
segment, with a gain on the sale of real estate and lower tax rate also aiding our EPS beat versus guidance.
We saw positive results in trends in a number of areas within Services, but disappointing results within our government
healthcare business caused us to miss our Services segment margin guidance for the quarter and adjust down our
Services margin expectations for the year. I'll walk through this in greater detail when we get to the segment review.
Revenue in the quarter was down 2% at both actual and constant currency. This was better than the 4% constant
currency revenue decline in Q4 as both Document Technology and Services revenue growth rates modestly improved.
Gross margin of 30.2% was down 30 basis points year-over-year, as improvements in Document Technology was not
enough to offset the incremental pressure on Services margin. Ongoing productivity initiatives, as well as lower
pension expense, yielded significant improvements in both SAG and RD&E. As a result our operating margin
expanded 110 basis points to 8.6%, enabling operating profit growth of 13%.
Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net was $72 million, an increase of $59 million year-over-year. The
drivers of the increase were higher OID and higher restructuring expense. OID was up year-over-year. The largest
factor was that this year's gain of $30 million associated with the real estate sale was less than the prior year's $37
million litigation reserve reduction. We've been working on the real estate sale for some time and expected it would
close in 2014, but a bit later in the year, so it aided our beat this quarter.
Restructuring was $27 million, which was $35 million higher than in 2013 and about $0.01 higher than our guidance.
Adjusted tax rate of 22% was in line with 2013, and under our guidance due to favorable audit resolutions, which were
discrete item in the quarter.
Adjusted EPS of $0.27 was flat year-over-year and above our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25, with the upside coming
from Document Technology profitability, the real estate gain and tax rate, partially offset by higher restructuring.
With that, I'll move to the Services segment slide to review those results in more detail. Services revenue growth was
flat year-over-year, which was a modest sequential improvement from Q4 when Services revenues were down 1% at
constant currency, although it was short of our 1% growth target.
Document Outsourcing continued to grow mid-single digits. ITO was slightly up and BPO was down a couple of points
as good growth in commercial healthcare and international were offset by student loan run-off, lower volumes in
customer care and transportation, and less inorganic contribution.
Turning to signings, signings were up 1% on a trailing 12-month basis, but were down year-over-year. As we
highlighted on our Q4 call, we had a challenging signings compare this quarter as our Q1 2013 was one of our highest
signings quarter in recent memory. That said, signings in the quarter were a bit softer than we expected. New business
signings were down 7% year-over-year as we saw some decision delays and shift of contracts to Q2.
New business pipeline remains very strong, up 9%, and we expect sequentially higher signings in 2Q, although once
again we face a relatively strong year-over-year compare.
Total contract value from renewals were quite a bit lower year-over-year despite a renewal rate of 91%. Both new
business and renewals can be lumpy and the lower renewals in the quarter were a function of fewer renewal decisions.
So, all in all, renewals aren't a concern, and we would have liked to have seen a little bit better new business growth,
but we feel we're well-positioned as we enter the second quarter.
Shifting to profitability, segment margin was 8.6% in the first quarter, down 70 basis points year-over-year and lower
than our target of 9.3%. The year-over-year decline and outlook shortfall is driven by incremental costs associated with
the rollout of our new government healthcare and Medicaid systems, and implementation of the Nevada healthcare
exchange. The work involved with implementing these new platforms is significant and we faced greater challenges

than anticipated getting new clients to a good level of operating performance and then costing down the ongoing
maintenance of the program. While we're making progress on improving our operational performance, it's costing more
than we expected. And it's going to take us more time before we can lean out the resources supporting these projects.
We're making good progress in other businesses within Services. Excluding the higher than anticipated government
healthcare costs, Services margin would have been flat year-over-year with improvement in Document Outsourcing
and our commercial businesses where we saw benefits from our cost actions roughly offsetting headwinds from student
loan run-off and lower volumes in some areas.
Turning to guidance, we're resetting our expectations for Services. On revenue we continue to expect Services revenue
growth to improve sequentially as we move through 2014, driven by signings ramp, moderation of headwinds
impacting BPO, and greater inorganic contribution, averaging mid-single-digit growth in the back half of the year.
Taking into account the slower start with flat revenue growth in Q1 and later ramp in new business and acquisitions, we
believe full-year Services revenue growth will be approximately 3%.
Given the Q1 margin performance and expectation for continued higher costs in government healthcare, we expect
full-year Services margin to be down and in the range of 9.4% to 9.8%, which compares to our original expectation for
a 50 basis point improvement to approximately 10.3%.
Government healthcare was an area where we had expected good year-over-year profit growth, specifically in the back
half of the year when we expected to get significantly reduced costs. Our Q1 experience was just the opposite, as we
had to dedicate incremental resources. We're taking a number of actions to address the issues. In the past few months
we've brought in a new leadership team for government healthcare, an experienced chief development engineer from
our technology group, as well as Bob to run Xerox Services.
We're enhancing our program management under a single point of accountability that also serves to enable quicker
learnings across different implementations of the same platform. We know it's going to take us longer and will cost us
more to get these implementations right, and we're committed to do that in support of both our current and future
customers.
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 4% at actual currency and 5% at
constant currency. We saw consistent performance in the U.S., some improvement in Europe, and ongoing weakness in
developing markets.
Equipment sales revenue was down 4% year-over-year and supplies was down 3% year-over-year, and improved
sequentially from down 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In addition our previous finance receivable
transactions negatively impacted revenue growth by about a point.
Looking at our product group, high-end had positive equipment revenue growth again this quarter driven by strong
color install activity. Mid-range also continues to show good color install activity driven by ConnectKey.
Finally, entry, although impacted by weakness in developing markets, did show improvement from the fourth quarter.
Looking to margins, Document Technology margin was very strong at 12.2%, which was 340 basis points higher
year-over-year. This improvement reflects the ongoing benefit from cost and efficiency savings, lower pension
expense, and a currency benefit from the weak yen. In addition we had a relatively easy prior-year compare. This
strong margin performance resulted in operating profit growth of 34% despite the revenue decline, so good overall
performance for Document Technology.
Looking toward the second quarter, we face a more difficult compare, especially in equipment revenue given the timing
of last year's ConnectKey product launch. And we continue to expect Document Technology to have revenue down
mid-single digit with good margin, although most likely not at Q1 levels.
With that let's turn to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was quite strong at $286 million in the quarter, which
compared with an $87 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2013. The year-over-year improvement was driven by
working capital. Accounts receivable and accounts payable were the largest factors year-over-year, reflecting in part

timing benefits related to our efforts to continue to smooth out working capital. Inventory was better year-over-year as
we had higher than normal buildup of inventory in the first quarter of 2013 related to the ConnectKey launch timing.
Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were $120 million use in the quarter. We spent $103
million on CapEx and $54 million on acquisitions. In January we closed on Invoco, a German customer care company
which supports our international expansion. We've had a better start in M&A this year but had hoped to get a bit more
done by this point. The pipeline continues to look good, and we're close on a few opportunities, so our full year
expectation to spend up to $500 million in 2014 is unchanged.
Cash from financing was a use of $349 million, and includes $275 million spent in share repurchases and $74 million
in preferred and common stock dividends.
Wrapping up cash flow, we have a good start and our full-year guidance remains $1.8 billion to $2 billion of operating
cash flow, with a more even distribution through the year. Q2 cash flow will be down year-over-year, but overall cash
flow for the first half should be roughly in line to the prior year.
Moving to the next slide, I'll walk through our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $8 billion in debt, which is
consistent with our beginning of year balance. We have $1.1 billion in debt coming due in May, $200 million of which
we pre-funded as part of last December's note offering. We plan to refinance the remaining $850 million throughout the
year. Applying seven to one leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.4 billion, leaving
core debt of $3.6 billion. Financing debt has come down over the past few years, driven by the finance receivable
transaction as well as from lower originations.
As we've previously indicated, we don't plan to do any finance receivable transactions this year, and thus we expect
finance debt to be relatively stable. We manage our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our
investment-grade rating. We continue to expect to end the year with about $7.8 billion in total debt, with the reduction
simply reflecting the $200 million that we pre-funded last December. Additionally, it's worth noting that we amended
our $2 billion revolver to extend it through 2019 with more favorable pricing.
We feel good about our stable capital structure and if we move to the next slide, I'll review where we are on share
repurchase and dividends. Our strong cash flow and beginning of year cash position enabled us to repurchase $275
million, or 25 million shares in the quarter. We now anticipate doing at least $700 million in share repurchases for the
year.
Share repurchase has been a consistent element of our capital allocation plan for the past few years, and as a result,
we've reduced shares outstanding by a net 17% since 2010. As part of our commitment to creating value for
shareholders, we announced last quarter a 9% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.0625 per share, which is effective
for common dividend payable on April 30. We'll spend about $300 million on dividends in 2014, so combined with
share repurchases we're targeting to return at least $1 billion to shareholders this year.
Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for Q2 and full year. We're pleased with the
performance of Document Technology and expect continued strong margins, albeit likely lower than Q1, and relatively
stable revenue declines with a somewhat more difficult compare in Q2 given the timing of last year's new product
launch. So, overall, Document Technology is on track with full year margins expected to be up modestly
year-over-year.
Within Services, we're seeing good results in document outsourcing, commercial healthcare, international and other
commercial BPO businesses, reflecting the progress we're making implementing our five-plank strategy for improved
margins and growth. But required additional spending in our government healthcare business has triggered a revision to
our guidance. We expect Q2 Services revenue and margin to improve sequentially with lower margin year-over-year
given the strong 10.2% prior-year compare. As I mentioned earlier, for the year, we expect to be between 9.4% and
9.8%.
At the consolidated level, for Q2 we expect revenue will decline approximately 2% and adjusted earnings per share of
$0.25 to $0.27, which includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring. And for the full year, given the change to our

outlook for Services, we now expect consolidated revenue to be flat to slightly down year-over-year and adjusted
earnings per share of $1.07 to $1.13, which compares to our previous full-year guidance of $1.10 to $1.16.
With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns
Well, thanks, Kathy. I want to get to your questions, so I'll quickly summarize our performance.
First quarter performance reflects how our portfolio mix benefits our business. Our profits in Document Technology
helped offset the shortfalls that we faced in government healthcare solutions. Our distribution and international
expansion is extending our reach to more customers around the world and our strong cash flow allows us the flexibility
to increase the value we bring to customers by investing in growing vertical markets.
We are consistent in our priorities and our focus. We continue to strengthen our management team and we are
executing on our five-plank strategy in Services, designed to promote revenue growth and improved margins. Despite
the current pressure on government healthcare, we are optimistic about our healthcare business overall. There is good
growth and profitability on the commercial side and a room for improvement on the government side.
We will capitalize on the most advantaged segments of the Document Technology business to maintain our leadership
position in the industry and we'll continue to use our healthy cash flow to deliver shareholder value.
Thank you. And now over to you, Jim.
James H. Lesko
Thanks, Ursula. Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide
more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I ask
participants to limit yourself to one follow-on question, so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll
turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.
Operator, please open the line for questions now.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Great. Thank you. So, I have a question for Bob, whom I believe you said was on the call and
perhaps Ursula as well. Given the challenges and the volatility we've seen in the Services segment, particularly on the
margin line, could you give us some early thoughts on the changes we might expect to see in the management of the
business and how that'll hopefully produce more predictable results going forward?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Why don't I start and then I'll turn it over to Bob. One of the important things that we did
when we outlined the five-plank strategy was to do that from a broad-based leadership perspective, so not only in
Services but including the leadership of the company, the CFO, the head of strategy, myself and obviously the head of
Services. So, the strategy that we have in place for margin improvement and revenue growth in Services is one that is
in place and will continue. What we realized at the time though was that we need to change our implementation process
and cadence and we did a couple of things there. One is a structural change inside, which is not that much of interest to
the external world, but was really important to how we manage the business for transparency and clarity across many
different lines of business and many different implementations. Second, and probably first for most, was we look at our
leadership team and the capabilities that we had there and made sure that we understood if we had any gaps and if we

had gaps we actually went out to fill them. Three areas we had to look at to improve and we did. One was we brought
in a new head of our government healthcare business and he has brought in leaders underneath him to help assure that
we can have this standard implementation across the many different implementations that we have around the nation,
both in MMIS and in our health information exchanges.
The second thing that we did was we actually moved some technical resources that we have from our technology
business to our Services business to manage these platforms, which are fairly collocated and the third and most
important was that we started searching for and we brought onboard a new leader to actually implement the five-plank
strategy, somebody who had experience in doing this type of management structure and process and that was Bob, so
let me turn it over to Bob now.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Thanks, Ursula. Yeah, Bill, I would just add, I mean I had good opportunity before coming
and joining the Xerox team to really in the due diligence, understand the five-plank strategy, and it really matched my
experience base in terms of how do you drive value for clients by transforming your delivery model. Services is, at the
core, a delivery business and we're still in the relatively early part of the journey, but a journey that is very well mapped
out to drive best practices across our units through improved process standardization, automation to take work out of
the workflow, and leveraging a global talent pool. So, on your question of volatility, I really think as we mature our
process, we will be even more predictable and it was part of what made Xerox and the Services business very attractive
for me personally.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Great. Thanks and congrats on the new role Bob. I guess outside of the Services segment, the
technology business, we're obviously seeing some positive surprises. Should we be – I understand that this quarter was
sort of a bit of an outlier in terms of the margin strength, but should we be thinking about tech segment margins that are
potentially sustainably above the ranges you've given us in the past when we think about our modeling longer-term?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So, I'm not going to attempt to give 2015 guidance this early in 2014, but we're really
pleased by the performance that we're seeing in the technology business. We had commented in the back half of last
year that the technology business had really stabilized and we have a great focus on driving profitability and margins in
the technology business with ongoing restructuring plans. So, we feel good about the margin we produced this quarter.
In my commentary about the second quarter, I clearly said we expect continued strong margins, albeit expect it to come
down a little bit from where we are in Q1. So, overall, we're really pleased. We expect we'll be up a little bit
year-over-year in technology margins and we expect continued good performance there.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Bill. If we could have next question please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you. I had another question on Services and maybe Bob wants to jump in, or Ursula.
As you look at what's happened in Nevada and the challenges in that, has it changed your thoughts regarding
government healthcare opportunities? And how do you view the landscape given what we've seen, not just at Xerox but
obviously other companies as well?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I'll take it and Bob can follow up if there's a need for it. The government healthcare market is
relatively large and it's definitely growing and the demographics are all tailwinds for it, all in the favor of government
health. The majority of our healthcare business is not government healthcare, and the majority of that is not new
platforms. And let me just break it into two parts so that we can parse out where we're having the challenges and what
we're doing to fix it, and therefore, I think it will help you understand why we're still so bullish on the market.
MMIS is one large amount of engagement that we have. This is a long and historic business for ACS and now Xerox.
It's Medicaid. We've been in it for many, many, many years and we've been managing on a platform that's an old
platform. When the platform is in it lasts for many years, 10 years, 15 years plus, and after you stand it up the business
on an ongoing basis is very predictable and fairly profitable, actually very profitable. Where we are today on Medicaid

engaged in. We've been engaged in for many years, and California is going fairly well, and MMIS is actually going
pretty well and we're now at the point where we're starting to lean out our implementation on California and drive it to
increased profitability.
MMIS, we have some new implementations as well, and those new implementations, which some of them started late
last year, a couple later this year, and one in 2015 and more to come, I'm sure, will be going through the same process
of implementing the new platform and then leaning it out and driving it towards profitability. MMIS is an area that is a
challenge, but it is not a large concern for us. We know our path forward there.
The place that is the biggest challenge for us right now is the health information exchanges and it is the one that we
lead on, and that's Nevada. And this is a brand new platform. It's a one-of-a-kind implementation for us so far to-date,
this is the only place that we've done it. It has not gone well. We are working very hard and closely with the client to
make sure that we do two things. One is stand it up to the client's assurance and comfort, that we do that. We're doing
that very well and aggressively with leadership in Nevada, but also lean it out as we go forward. That is taking a lot
longer than we thought, as Kathy said, and as I've said, and as you're hearing probably when you read the newspapers.
It's taking a lot longer than we thought and is taking more resources than we thought. As we lean that out, we will do
the same thing. As we stand it up, we'll lean it out and then we'll drive it towards more stable operation and
profitability.
On health exchanges as well though, we're involved in a lot of other states in varying ways. Not implementing the
platforms, but handling transactions processing, handling call center, doing some specific modules and health
exchanges in six or seven states. They are going very well. So the focus area for us in health exchanges is fixing
Nevada. We do that, we should be able to actually glide on a go-forward basis following the implementations that are
going well.
And on MMIS it is literally just about continuing on the improvement path that we're on, which is very good already
and driving towards profitability. So it's a good market, a growing market, and one that I don't think that we can
actually step away from. I know that we can't step away from because we have a history of success in this business.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. Thank you. And then my next question is just for Kathy. You've maintained cash
flow guidance, but you're lowering Services margin. So can you just give us some ideas of what's supporting that
decision, where the incremental drivers of cash flow will come from?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. And so I'll start with our first quarter cash flow was very strong performance, so I
feel good about where we're starting the year. If you look at I'll call it overall income, obviously bringing down
Services margin that is at least partially offset by pretty strong margins that we're seeing within Document Technology.
And even within Services some of the reduction in overall income is coming from slower implementations, which are a
non-cash change that we're taking.
So overall that plus top line is coming down a little bit more, and that gives us another working capital benefit. I feel
really comfortable we'll be able to hit our full year guidance. So we're not going to see nearly as much flow-through to
cash flow as you're seeing kind of from the income statement.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Shannon. If we could have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yeah. Thanks a lot. Can you just talk also on cash flow about your efforts to smooth it out,
meaning make it less volatile? Obviously the cash flow in the first quarter is a greater percentage of the total than usual.
And what's going on there as well to make it smoother as we go throughout the quarters? And will you still have the big
hockey stick in the fourth quarter, Kathy?

<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: We will still have in the fourth quarter a big push, Ben. What you're seeing is largely
payable timing being smoothed out during the course of the year. As I look at our first quarter I feel really good about
gains that we're making in terms of just receivable days outstanding, which I'm certainly expecting are going to hold for
the year.
So while you'll see quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year movement, that's going to just result in a little better cadence of
overall cash flow during the course of the year. So we're still going to be I'll call it seasonally peaking in 4Q. But yes,
less so than you've seen us in past years.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Okay. And then I was just trying to quantify the hit from the new guidance on the EBIT line. I
was thinking just backing into your Services guidance, it's like $60 million to $80 million in less operating profit in
terms of when you add up the lower revenue and the hit. And then I was wondering is there an incremental
restructuring on top of that, which also accounts for the lower guidance for the year? I'm just trying to tally it up to get
to the $0.06 or to the $0.03 or so in the range and trying to get the EBIT numbers right. Is that about the way to think of
it? And what is the incremental restructuring versus what you were thinking on previously before this call again?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. And so we had given guidance on restructuring kind of roughly similar
year-over-year, and that really hasn't changed. If you look overall in Services, we're taking the biggest hit in terms of
operating earnings there as a result of the change in Services margin coming down. So we had initially said we thought
we'd see a 50-basis-point improvement. If you look at the range I'm now providing, in the middle of that range it would
be down 20 basis points. So call it a 70-basis-point change relative to where we started. That's worth about $80 million
in terms of overall operating profit.
Now I expect Document Technology is offsetting a little bit of that, right, because we clearly saw really strong first
quarter gains in terms of overall margin. And I suggested I thought we'd be up modestly now in Doc Tech margin
year-over-year. And so you're getting a little bit of an offset there.
And then if you just kind of look to what other things changed to get us to a full year change, let's call it down $0.03,
we're doing a little bit more in share repurchases. So we started out a little stronger in terms of the timing of those share
repurchases, and we've upped our guidance now from $500 million to at least $700 million. And so we get a little bit of
pickup there as well.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. That was good detail, appreciate it.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Ben. If we could have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hi. Thanks guys for taking the question. I guess hey the first one for me, Ursula, is, and
then maybe Kathy, just sort of could you walk through the contribution, or I guess the sort of different buckets of
impact to the Services growth for the quarter? And what you think the underlying reasons for those were? And I have a
follow-up? Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Okay. I'll go ahead and take that. When I look at top line, we had initially targeted that we
thought we'd be up 1%, and we ended up being flat. There's really two different things contributing there. Slower ramp,
so both within some of the healthcare implementations that are taking us a little longer, so the new ones that we're
standing up are having a slower ramp. And we saw a little bit of overall volume decline, specifically within
transportation. That's in part weather-related and also due to some slower ramp there.
And then finally, I'd point to M&A. While we started out the year stronger than we did in 2013, we're still getting a
relatively low contribution from M&A, less than half a point. And that's clearly below where we'd like to see it.

So while I feel good about the pipeline, we're close on a couple of opportunities, I still feel good about our ability to get
closer to spending $500 million for the year. It's coming on a little slower than we had hoped.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Got it. Thanks. And then with regards to buyback, and congrats on raising the range there. I
guess philosophically, how should we think about you executing the rest of the buyback through the year? I think the
idea was to do it more ratably through the year this year, commensurate with cash flow, and you had a really strong Q1.
So sort of how should we think about strategy on buyback?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah, I think that's exactly how you should continue to think about it. In contrast with last
year where we really did essentially all of our share repurchases in the back half and very heavily weighted to the
fourth quarter, we intend to continue to be in the market throughout the year with our share repurchases.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Ananda. If we could have the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, guys. I'm going to follow on Ananda's question on growth, and I was hoping for my first
question, if you could talk about your confidence surrounding, Kathy, I think you said 3% revenue growth in Services?
And while you're doing that, if you could address a few things: a) the bookings was weak this quarter and I think you
said it's going to be down on a tough compare. What does that suggest about the longer-term growth, b) pricing and
then c) also ITO? I question the strength of ITO as we get to the back half of the year when you're really I think
anticipating a pretty dramatic increase to mid-single digits in the broader Services category. So if you could perhaps
just talk about your confidence interval on Services, and then I have a follow-up? Thank you.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Okay. So on Services, I feel really good about our renewal rate, 91%. We had a 92%
renewal rate last year. In this quarter, our new business was a little softer than I had hoped, down 7% for the quarter.
We had some things that's taking us a little longer to get the contract on. I feel pretty good about second quarter, clearly
mentioned that we expect to see sequential improvement. We do have a tough compare. I mean in the second quarter of
2013, we were up total contract value 40% year-over-year, so it's a little bit of a tough compare from that perspective.
But we should benefit from the strong signings that we saw last year. And so overall, I continue to feel really good
about our organic growth and I like some of the places that we're seeing good organic growth.
In the first quarter, we had double-digit growth in Europe overall within Services, and a piece of that was inorganic, but
even our organic growth was actually up double-digit, so very strong growth there as well. So we're feeling pretty good
about the sequential improvement that we expect to see over the course of the year, and again, while I said M&A
started out to a slow start, I feel good about the pipeline. We're close on a couple of deals.
And then, finally, some of the other things we're doing, we mentioned in our Investor Day last November that we have
a big push on improving our overall mix of business, and so you referenced ITO growth slowing, which has clearly
been expected and anticipated by us. We're adding a number of sales people into the businesses where we have higher
margins. We recently announced hiring another 60 sales people, so we're making investments to ensure that we get the
organic growth we're expecting.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Thank you, Kathy. For my follow-up, just philosophically, Xerox has had a couple of
quarters of disappointment in Services and you're bringing in new leadership, exciting new leadership. How do
investors take some comfort in the fact that Bob's having a new role will be digging underneath the covers and could
uncover some additional areas that he's not comfortable with, is the guidance the right guidance? In other words, you're
asking Bob to step into a position and you're providing guidance at a position which presumably he hasn't had a chance
to really dig underneath the covers? Or is that an inaccurate perception and we should assume that Bob's kind of
blessed these numbers in this guidance?

<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Keith, this is Bob. So no, I would say that in the first 22 days here, I have been through these
numbers in excruciating detail. I've had a good chance to be out with clients and with the Xerox team as well but no,
I'm on the call and on the hook and I think from an investor standpoint, we appreciate that you're going to measure us
based on our results. But this is not a – I'm not inheriting somebody else's call in terms of what we're committed to
deliver. The 100,000 person Services team and I are on the line for what we've covered on the discussion today.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: I'd add a little bit to that, Keith. When I look at the first quarter and kind of peel back the
layers of our performance, the additional spending we had within government healthcare was truly what caused us to
miss our guidance on Services segment margin for the first quarter. If I look across the business, I mean, we had very
good margin expansion in document outsourcing, we had margin expansion in ITO, we had margin expansion in
commercial BPO. Obviously our government transportation business is where the student loan pressure shows up, but
overall we're seeing exactly what we expected in terms of Services margin expansion outside of the government
healthcare solutions group.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: As an important point I'll just ring in here. Bob has been here for 21 days, fortunately came
onboard right during the time that we have to actually look at our go-forward commitments and so he was actively
involved there, that's why I'm bringing up what Bob said and what Kathy said, if you look at the parts of the business
excluding government healthcare or the calls, the part that we called that would come down in government
transportation solutions group, literally we're expanding margin in every other line of business. The biggest business
that we have, commercial BPO, which is about 75% of our business, margins expanded to the point where we had
planned them to. ITO, they did as well and document outsourcing, they did as well. So we do have an isolated issue
here, it's a big one, one that we're in front of, but not one that causes us to adjust the rest of the business areas and the
path that we had going forward there.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: All right. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: You're welcome. Thanks, Keith.
<A - James H. Lesko>: If we could have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Hey. Thank you very much and I guess, a concluding comment is, hey, it could've been a lot worse.
So anyway I guess you could laugh about that a little bit. But when I think about it, is it really that Xerox misestimated
the amount of person, bodies and hours it needed to be on this to get this state healthcare exchange up and running? Is it
the state is asking you to do more than what were originally planned or it's more complicated than what you thought?
Or how come Xerox seems to be the one eating all the costs on this? Or am I just misunderstanding the key issues here?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So it is a combination of many things, and I don't think it's fair or the government would
think, Nevada would think that we're the only ones eating all of the costs here. I think they probably feel a little bit of a
sting as well. But it's a combination of things. One, it is clearly that we misestimated and I will say that we
misestimated the amount of energy and effort that it would take to one, get the system defined right, this is jointly
between the state and us, one to do that, and then once you get that to stabilize it to the point where the operations are
predictable, that we can understand what volumes would come in at what time, what number of people would try to
enroll on certain days. Something that you've seen unfortunately across a lot of the health exchanges is just the flood of
people on any given day, or any given time is just not predictable. So we had something to do with just not
understanding fully – not predicting fully what could happen at any given time. There's also change in requirements, it
is a new set of laws that we're trying to develop a system around, it's a combination of many things here, but I want to
make sure that I leave the call with understanding that Xerox is responsible for it and has to be responsible for fixing it
and we're going to do that on behalf of the government of Nevada and that's what we'll do. MMIS is different, we're
pretty comfortable with what we have to do there, we have a couple of implementations that are going fairly well, we

know how lean it out, we know how to move, it's taking a little bit more time, but it's not as unpredictable as Nevada
has been.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Okay. And then Kathy made a comment about M&A and the pipeline being strong there, yet M&A
continues to come in softer than expected and many investors like the M&A and the accretiveness of it. Kathy, is it just
so much of your effort has been diverted to trying to fix the Services business? Or why would this M&A additions
continue to take longer and longer and longer and yet the pipeline continues to be healthy and healthy, it seems like that
there's some type of disconnect there about we've heard this story before, and what's the delay here?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So, I'll start with, M&A actually started out stronger this year than it was in 2013, so while
I am also pointing to M&A as we had hoped to get more done at this point than we've been able to get done, on a
year-over-year basis just the Invoco deal alone is in excess of the Services deals that we did in 2013. So it isn't that
M&A isn't improving and on a good track, it's just not going as fast as we would desire it to go. And it's more timing I
would say than revising our overall expectations in terms of what we think will get done this year. And so, we have one
decent sized deal, I'd say, under our belt; we did another deal, but it was relatively small in this quarter, and so it's not
going to give us all that much in terms of revenue and profit, but we're close on a couple of things and I do feel good
about our ability to get more done.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And Kathy is not distracted. I mean, she has a team that works on this that is pretty much
separate from the rest of the operational areas of the business. We are focused on this at a level of intensity that's pretty
high. We're not going to do as we say it all the time, we say it continuously any deal that we don't think we can manage
and bring in comfortably into the company, and we're not going to do a deal that doesn't fit into the strategic growth
areas that we have, and we do have a pipeline that's pretty good now. And as Kathy said, some that are [ph] tripping
(51:26) towards the end in the coming quarters, so.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yeah, I would just add that I think our process is really strong. So on your comment on
whether people would be distracted, we largely wouldn't be looking to do it in the space where we've had the
government healthcare solutions problems that we've talked about so extensively, and I would say the process in terms
of the discipline, what's the economics, how does it fit from a growth standpoint is very strong. So they don't happen
overnight, and we still have more that we see that we will be able to drive.
<Q - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Jim. If we could have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Kathy, you touched on this earlier, but could
you provide some additional color on the progress of your various margin initiatives in Services outside of healthcare in
terms of productivity initiatives and offshoring efforts? And if you were to think about excluding healthcare sort of
giving us a sense of what margins for Services would be for the full year?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So, I'll speak a little bit more to the quarter as opposed to the full year, and then I'll come
back to circle back to the full year. So I really appreciate the question because overall the additional costs and resources
we've had to pour into government healthcare really overshadowed I think the good progress that we're making
elsewhere. Clearly, we had pointed to at our Investor Day in November a big push on I'd say bold shifting labor
offshore in order to get benefits from those lower costs as well as just improving efficiencies overall, really both of
those things targeted to try and get labor costs as a percent of revenue down, which is a big part of the push towards
margin expansion.
And so I feel good about the progress that we made in the quarter there, again excluding the incremental cost that we
poured into government healthcare, both in terms of moving people offshore and hiring more offshore as we attrit
people in the U.S. But I'd say especially, George, in terms of just getting enhanced productivity and putting more
money to work in terms of restructuring. So I feel very good about that, other plank of our five-plank strategy,

international expansion, I think the Invoco acquisition and ongoing organic growth seems to be going very well. I
spoke to some of the things that we're doing to push up growth rates organically in some of our more advantaged
businesses with higher margins.
So as I look across our five-plank strategy, I feel good about what we're doing to execute. And if you put government
healthcare aside, that was worth 70 basis points in the first quarter. If you look at the adjustment we've made to full
year, it's basically a 70-basis point adjustment on full year from where we had originally started thinking we were
going to get 50 basis points of expansion. So I think we're on track in terms of making progress outside of government
healthcare.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: That's very helpful. Thank you. And for my follow-up question, Ursula, could you discuss
the leverage you're seeing from past government healthcare platform implementations? And what kind of leverage you
expect once Nevada health exchange and other current MMIS implementations have been fully stood up?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Right. So we have a business where we actually operate MMIS systems in 12 states today
plus the District of Columbia, maybe a little bit higher, maybe 13 states. But 12 states plus the District of Columbia.
We implemented those states under a platform from many years ago, and those states and the operation of them,
smooth operation and very profitable business for us and very happy customers in the state.
These platforms as I said take a little bit of time to stabilize, obviously a little bit more difficult on the new MMIS than
on the old one. They last a very long time, a decade, decade-and-a-half easily. And if you look at our history there, we
expect as we stabilize the new MMIS enterprise platform in the states that we have won and that we continue to
compete for that we'll have a mirror, essentially a mirror of the government health MMIS business that we had in the
past on a go-forward basis.
If we didn't do a new platform by the way, we would not be able to compete very effectively for this business, so it's a
necessary thing to do to hold our position in the enterprise space.
On health exchanges we operate in a number of states, six or seven states generally in a partnership fashion, a
consortium fashion with other providers doing other pieces. In those implementations we are humming along, they're
delivering as we expect. The profitability in the model is as we expect. In Nevada as I said in the new exchange, that's
the place that we're going to have to stabilize. And it'll take us a little bit more time to do. And we're figuring it's going
to take us for the rest of the year to get this all straightened out and so that's the thing.
So I think healthcare historically, government healthcare historically and on a go-forward basis, it will be very
profitable and is very attractive. And we continue to expect it to be.
Commercial Healthcare is a winner for us, already growing revenue ahead of where we expect and expanding margins.
So Commercial Healthcare, broad participation there, a big business for us, actually bigger than government healthcare
business and a very profitable business for us. So we expect this whole space of healthcare to actually be a good
business for us, continue to be a good business for us as we go forward.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, George. If we could have the next question please.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question really about the cost of these government
contracts in the sense that it looks like if your margins [ph] would otherwise have been sliced (57:34), probably cost
about $20 million more in costs this quarter, maybe $80 million for the year. Are those numbers in the ballpark, firstly?
And then beyond that as you win new government business, I'm trying to think about the synergies you might have.
And like could it be the case that next year you go for more of this type of business, you win more states or more
exchanges or however you want to describe it? And those costs meaningfully drop to zero? Or would there be an

ongoing level of cost that Xerox are hit with as we go through a learning curve?
I know it's probably a hard question to ask because every contract is different. I'm just trying to think of what level of
visibility you have as you try and build out this government business. Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So let me start with first you mentioned, hey with government healthcare did it cost you
about $20 million in the quarter and about $80 million for the year? And my answer to that is yes. Year-over-year it did
cost us $20 million in the quarter.
And as we look to full year and our revision to Services margin, which I talked about earlier, that is for us to now
anticipate and build into our overall guidance an expectation of just higher costs in government healthcare throughout
the year.
As we look forward to incremental implementation, our expectation would be that we will get better at incremental
implementation. I mean as we are bidding on new work, we are taking the learnings that we've had today into
consideration in looking forward and bidding on new specifically MMIS platforms in other states.
As it relates to Nevada, I think it's really important to understand we actually participate in a handful of other state
healthcare insurance exchanges. We just don't play this role in terms of being the primary on the implementation of the
platform. And in those other states we're doing really well in terms of supporting call center work and other BPO
claims processing work and the like. And so that continues to be I think both a strong business for us today and a good
opportunity on a go-forward basis.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Kulbinder. If we could have our last question now please?
Operator
Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Great. Thanks. I'll try and be quick, because I just want to build on a couple past questions.
First, the confidence in the second quarter signings, you mentioned some customer decision delays. Can you elaborate
on that? Is that cyclical and broad-based and has that persisted in April? And I have a follow-up.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Thanks. And so as we look at signings in the second quarter, we're expecting we're going
to see a sequential improvement relative to the first quarter. But the other thing I mentioned is we also have another
tough comp year-over-year.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Right.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So last year signings number was about $3.7 billion and at that point it had been up 40%
year-over-year. So I'm expecting good sequential improvement.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Okay. Then just the higher cost tied to government healthcare, I know you've had a lot of
questions. It feels a little bit like déjà vu to me. But any risk in meeting SLA milestones? Is the state cooperating? I
mean I'm just trying to understand if you're spending enough. I know $20 million is a big dollar amount. But just
wanted to make sure we're covered here in terms of any other future surprises?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So I think from the MMIS perspective, I'm very comfortable that we're spending what we
need to spend. MMIS spreads across many different states, so small increment spending. First data, I think we have that
pretty well comprehended. In the Nevada exchange, we have comprehended a fairly big chunk of additional spending
throughout the year, and I think that we've comprehended that well in this go-forward guidance. So I don't believe that
we have much additional upside or downside depending on how you do it, downside in margin or upside in cost. We've
actually comprehended a fairly large amount for the rest of the year.
