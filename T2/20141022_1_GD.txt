Director of IR, Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Erin Linnihan
Thank you Tahitia and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter conference call. As
always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These
estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the
company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. With that I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive

Good morning. As you can observe from our earnings report, we enjoyed a particularly compelling quarter. We
reported EPS from continuing operations of $2.05 per fully diluted share on revenues of $7.75 billion, and income from
continuing operations of $694 million. This is $0.21 per share better than the year-ago quarter and $0.14 per share
better than consensus.
Revenue was up $16 million against the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings were up $38 million or 4%, and income
from continuing operations was $42 million higher. Operating earnings of $999 million reflect 12.9% operating
margins, a 50 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2013.
Sequentially the news is much the same. Revenue was up $277 million, 3.7%. Operating earnings were up $50 million
on a 20 basis point improvement in operating margins and earnings from continuing operations were up $48 million.
Finally, EPS was $0.17 better than last quarter.
In short, we experienced the highest revenues so far this year, had the highest operating earnings in four years, the
highest margins in six years, and the highest earnings from continuing operations on my watch. This led quite naturally
to the strongest quarterly EPS we have ever had, all pretty powerful and a strong indication that our focus on operations
is paying dividends.
With respect to cash, we had $2.33 billion of free cash flow from operations in the quarter. That is 336% of net income
from continuing operations. We have $3.46 billion year-to-date, 179% of net income from continuing operations.
However a word of caution here. Some of this cash is from advance payments on international orders and will be
deployed in future quarters for programmatic purposes and leave the balance sheet. That having been said, it was still a
very powerful quarter from a cash perspective.
With respect to share repurchases, in the quarter we repurchased slightly less than 3.8 million shares for approximately
$468.5 million. We have purchased somewhat in excess of 28.8 million shares year-to-date for about $3.2 billion. We
planned for modest share repurchase activity in the final quarter of the year, with a resumption of increased activity
early next year.
As you can see from the backlog charts that we attached to the press release, this quarter is also a story of continuing
growth in the backlog. Once again there was a substantial intake of orders resulting in significant increases to backlog.
We ended the quarter with the total backlog at an all-time apex of $74.4 billion, up from $71.1 billion at the end of the
last quarter. All of this growth occurred in Combat Systems group, largely the result of international orders. You may
recall that at the end of the third quarter of 2013, Combat Systems had a backlog of almost $7.8 billion. It now stands at
$21.6 billion, more than a three-fold increase.
If we look back over the last year for the entire company, you will see a similar story. Our backlog has grown from
$47.8 billion a year ago to $74.4 billion today, from my perspective pretty impressive. Looking forward toward the
fourth quarter, we would expect the Aerospace group to enjoy very strong order intake as a result of the introduction of
the two new aircraft announced this month along with a growing interest in existing products, in part precipitated by the
new product announcements. In other words, customers can now choose between the near-term availability of G450
and G550 and the longer wait for new products with different speeds, ranges and price points. The clarity of these
options for customers is helping drive decision making.
Before I turn this call over to Jason Aiken to give you some segment details, I will note that I was particularly pleased
by the revenue and earnings growth of the Aerospace group, the continued excellent margin performance of Combat
Systems, the revenue growth in the Marine group and the steadily improving margins at IS&T. We are not where we
want to be at IS&T, but we are improving. Jason?
Jason W. Aiken
Thank you, Phebe. As Phebe indicated, the quarter was marked by very strong operating results from each of our
business groups. I'll start with Aerospace. Aerospace had another very good quarter. Revenues, earnings and margins
were all up from the year-ago quarter as well as for the first nine months of the year. The group reported sales just shy

of $2.3 billion, up from the third quarter of 2013 by 6.4%.
Operating earnings increased 11.4% over 2013 to $411 million, the highest level of quarterly earnings the Aerospace
group has ever seen. Operating margins were up 90 basis points to 18% on improved performance in G650 and G280
manufacturing and outfitting as well as another good contribution from Jet Aviation.
On a sequential basis, the group experienced some margin compression from the first half, consistent with our
expectations. This is attributable to a variety of factors but primarily to the mix of aircraft deliveries and an increase in
pre-owned aircraft activity. Of course, the aircraft mix is more than just large versus mid-cabin. Keep in mind it
includes the variety of models within those categories.
Next, Combat Systems. Combat Systems revenues and operating earnings were also up compared with third quarter
2013. In the quarter, sales were up 6.8% to $1.4 billion while earnings were up 1.8% to $232 million. Taken with a
second quarter that was essentially flat year-over-year, it would appear that we've found the bottom with respect to
sales for the group. As expected, the group's margin rate, while exceptionally strong, was down from a year ago when
the group posted its highest margins in its history. In fact, barring the third quarter of last year, the group's margins this
quarter were the highest they've ever been.
So far this year, the Combat Systems group has experienced very strong performance with an operating margin rate of
14.4% year-to-date. When we look sequentially, revenues were down $70 million from the second quarter, but
operating earnings and operating margins were both up, $12 million and 160 basis points respectively. This reflects the
impact of the various restructuring actions taken in the past 18 months across the group's businesses, including a
significant reduction in our European cost base and last year's combination of two of our U.S.-based businesses.
With the last of the European restructuring charges taken in the first quarter of this year, the group's margins have
expanded significantly from the first quarter to the second to the third. The cost reduction efforts position the group
well to execute on their strong backlog.
Moving on to Marine Systems. The Marine group's revenues were higher than 2013 both in the third quarter and the
first nine months. Revenues in the quarter were up by 7.2% to over $1.8 billion while year-to-date revenues increased
by 3.7% to nearly $5.3 billion. The growth in both periods is attributable to the group's submarine programs and
commercial ship construction activities. The group has started construction on the fourth block of Virginia class
submarines, which was awarded in the second quarter, and is continuing development activities on the Ohio class
submarine replacement program. Construction is also underway on the first three of 10 Jones Act ships under contract
at our NASSCO shipyard.
Operating earnings were steady compared with this point last year at $170 million, and the group's operating margins
were down 70 basis points in the quarter and 30 basis points year-to-date as a result of mix shift. The group is
transitioning from Block III to Block IV of the Virginia class program, and from the mature Mobile Landing Platform
program to the new commercial ship contracts at NASSCO. However, margins for the first nine months of the year
remain a very respectable 9.7%.
And finally IS&T. You may recall that we had expected a 20% decline in revenue this year for IS&T, but based on the
strength of the first half of the year, we adjusted that expectation on last quarter's call to a 15% decline. The group
continues to outperform our top line expectations through nine months, with operating earnings following suit.
Revenue of $2.25 billion in the quarter was off by about 13% compared to the prior year's third quarter, but on the
other hand operating earnings declined just 6.5%, roughly half the decline in sales, to $202 million. As a result,
operating margins increased by 60 basis points to 9% in the quarter. This is the group's highest margin rate in the last
three years and marks the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion. All three of the group's businesses contributed
to this improved performance in the quarter.
The story for the first nine months is similar. Revenues were approximately $6.7 billion, down only 11.7% versus the
expected 15%, however operating earnings were down only 4.3% resulting in 70 basis points of margin improvement.
When we look sequentially, revenues and earnings were both up, $84 million and $14 million respectively. And as I
noted earlier, the group has expanded margins sequentially since the fourth quarter of last year, demonstrating good

operating leverage and the group's ongoing efforts to take costs out of the business.
On that front during the quarter, we announced a decision to combine Advanced Information Systems and C4 Systems
effective January 1, 2015. We expect this combination and resulting restructuring efforts to make the combined
organization, General Dynamics Mission Systems, more efficient, profitable and responsive to our customers.
I'd like to cover just a few miscellaneous financial items before I turn it back over to Phebe to wrap it up and begin the
question-and-answer period. The net interest expense in the quarter was $21 million versus $22 million in the third
quarter of 2013. For the full year, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million. At the end of
the quarter, our balance sheet reflects a cash balance of $5.1 billion and a net cash position, that's cash and equivalents
in excess of debt, of $1.7 billion. In this regard, you should reflect on the cautionary note Phebe introduced on this
subject in her earlier comments.
Our effective tax rate was 29.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected due to the resolution of some open
matters related to our 2013 tax returns. For the full year now, reflecting on our experience to-date, and a tax rate of
29.8% for the first nine months, we now expect an effective tax rate around 30%.
We funded our pension plans in the quarter as anticipated, bringing our contributions through the first nine months to
just over $500 million.
And I'll turn it back over now to Phebe to give you some wrap-up thoughts.
Phebe N. Novakovic
All right. As we turn to guidance I will be brief. Somewhat higher revenue, higher than anticipating operating earnings
and a modestly lower tax rate combine to permit us to increase our guidance for EPS from continuing operations to
$7.60 to $7.70, approximately $0.25 up from our last discussion with you. Now let's get onto your questions. Erin?
Erin Linnihan
Thanks, Phebe. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to

No problem. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Phebe, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about this backlog at Combat
Systems and what it portends for margins out in the future. Just offer up your view on how profitable that increased
book of business might be and the sustainability of margins in Combat Systems?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: If we look into next year, margins ought to look about the same as they do this year
because we really expect the ramp ups in 2016 and 2017 and beyond. As we go through, come down our learning
curves, we're going to improve our operating earnings and margins. These will be very profitable programs because
they're in our core. We know how to produce them and so we have strong expectations for Combat Systems' margin
performance.

<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. Great. And then at IS&T, can you talk a little bit about the contracting environment
that's going on there today and whether you feel like things are getting markedly better, staying the same on the margin,
getting a little worse? Just contract terms as well as the cadence of bookings and the size of bookings.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes. We're not seeing much of a change in our contract terms and conditions. And so as a
result for us, margin expansion is all about performance, and we've seen some of that improved operating performance
throughout that group. Just to give you an example, we had a book-to-bill of 1 for the quarter in IS&T, so nice order
activity and I really haven't seen any material change in the contracting.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne, Agee. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Phebe. Just a question on IS&T. You've talked about the
combination creating this Mission Systems business and you just mentioned the contracting environment, do you think
this business ultimately can continue to see margin expansion? Or is there something structural that keeps it below 10%
for the long term?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Oh, I see no reason why this business can't get into the double digits. We undertook this
consolidation because our markets are changing, so it was an opportune time for us to just take a fresh look at our entire
portfolio. And it became pretty clear to us that we were going to benefit from a consolidation, so from my perspective
the consolidation's going to result in additional cost savings going forward. So that is margin expansion opportunity.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. I'll stick to the one. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Phebe, can you talk a little bit about the $0.25 improvement in terms of the guidance in
terms of where that's changing, which of the different segments? Because I know like as an example IS&T down 15%,
you're certainly down a lot less than that year-to-date, so it would imply a pretty weak fourth quarter unless there's
some changes amongst those.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No, I think our guidance reflects our year-to-date performance and the fourth quarter's
going to look very much like what we are leading and what we're guiding to on the overall company. So Marine will be
a little bit up, and everybody, all the other groups are pretty much steady. There's some margin compression in IS&T
but not much. So I think when we've increased, we've increased our guidance really to reflect where we've been and
where we see going forward for the remainder of the year. So I'm comfortable with our guidance.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: But in terms of each of the four segments, did the outlook change relative to what you talked
about? I'm trying to just understand where are you moving that increase of $0.25 from.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, it's really kind of across the board. We've got higher earnings in, we anticipate
higher earnings in Aerospace, higher earnings in the Marine Systems and higher earnings in Combat. So a little bit
margin compression as I said in IS&T in the fourth quarter, but when you roll it all up where we've been and what we
see for the fourth quarter, $7.60 to $7.70 is, we're very comfortable with that.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks so much. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Just a couple of things on cash. Phebe, you mentioned that the conversion rate was
[indiscernible] above average over the first nine months. Where do you expect this to go in the future? Are we going to
go back to 100% or below that as you burn through these advances?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We'll be at around 100% as we begin to take that cash off the balance sheet and send it on
its way to our suppliers. So we've targeted about 100%.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay, and on the buyback.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Still very good cash generation.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Yes. On the buyback, is there any reason why you're easing off in the fourth quarter?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We've told you all and our investors that we would deploy most if not all of our free cash
flow to share repurchases and dividends and we're about at that point. So we'll go a little bit slower in the fourth
quarter, but I expect to pick that activity back up in the beginning of the year.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Morning.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: You talked earlier about the G500 and G600 and then the G450 and G550 and how this
gives customers the opportunity for a lot of different decisions. But when you look forward on the G450 and the G550,
what's the level of backlog that in terms of months that you're comfortable with to make sure that you can continue to
keep production at the levels you're at today until the G500 and G600 come out? I'm curious where you stand today in
terms of that and how you get confidence that you're going to be in a good position.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So let me give you a little bit of color on that. In the quarter, our backlog increased by a
quarter for almost all of our models. G650, G650ER third quarter is 17, G550 first quarter of 16, G450 about the same,
280 third quarter of 15 and the G150, frankly the largest increase at the first quarter of 2016. So that provides us pretty
steady production rate as we go forward to plan for the next at least 12-month period. And you recall, we set our
production rates at the end of the prior year and then we'll give you some details about those rates as we go forward.
But it's too soon to project. I think it's just too soon to project when we have any material changes in production as a
result of the new airplanes. And when we get to that, get closer to that point, we'll give you a little bit more clarity.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: So is it fair to say you're looking at having some flexibility there as you see how demand
rolls out for each of the different models over time?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes, we always have flexibility. I think that agility helps us keep our profitability high
and as we balance resources against demand. So I'm comfortable that as we stand here today, we've got an executable
plan going forward. And as I said, as we get closer to the entry into service of the G500 and then the G600, we'll give

Your next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning. Good results.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thanks.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Phebe, just on Marine, the margins have come down a little bit the last couple quarters and
you've indicated that it's transitioning on the multi-years for Virginia class plus the MLP over to the new commercial
ships. How are the ships coming? I mean this was your business before your current position and so as you look at the
early stages of the curves on the ships, how are they coming? And where do you think the margins kind of bottom out
before we start seeing an uptick as they mature?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, you pretty much got it right on the mix shift. We've got mix shifts on Block III to
Block IV and then the transition from the MLP to the Jones Act ships. You know it's an interesting, when you think
about what NASSCO's been able to do, they've demonstrated that they can build these ships and meet the customers'
needs competitively and profitably while they are continuing to deliver Navy ships. So the current work we have
in-house at NASSCO provides us nice revenue and earnings for the foreseeable future. We've got three ships in
production. They are all performing on or above plan. So I would, now one thing, one caution here is that think about
commercial shipbuilding as providing nice, strong margins but the – nice, strong earnings, but the margins are going to
be a touch lumpier as we move from one ship class to the next ship class because these are shorter cycles than Navy
shipbuilding. So I suspect we'll see continued margin improvement at NASSCO and at Electric Boat as we work
through some of these mix shifts. I would suspect to see some of that next year and certainly going into 2016 and
beyond.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Just to be specific, so next year you expect to see margins start to perk up?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes, they ought to be. It ought to. I expect – we haven't done our detailed planning yet but
I anticipate that they will somewhat mirror this year's.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thanks so much, Phebe. So if you could give us maybe a little bit more color on
Gulfstream, are the G650 margins kind of above? You said they're above the G450. Where are they relative to the
G550? And in terms of cash, when do you expect to get initial signed contracts for the G500? And what kind of impact
is that going to have? That should have a positive impact on cash. Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes. So the G650 and G650ER margins are beginning to approach the G550 and I suspect
sometime next year we may have the crossing point on that. We haven't yet planned out our cash in any detail with
respect to the G500 and G600s. We expect to see some this year, but more going into next year. And by the way, we'll
give you a lot of color in the fourth quarter call in January about the order activity on both of those airplanes.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Can you give us some initial color on that, on that order activity? Or just the reception and
whether you?

Your next question will come from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Thank you very much. Phebe, can you give us a couple updates on a couple ground vehicle
programs I think are in a bit of state of flux for you guys? One is AMPV, and the other is JLTV. On JLTV, can you
confirm, have you guys excluded yourself from bidding on the LRIP contract next year? Are you officially out of that
program at this point and on?

Thank you.

our customer on options for where our vehicles may make some sense. But our mature programs in our tanks and
strikers are doing exactly what we thought they would do and very good margin performance and good earnings. So we
have a lot of stability as of today on our ground systems domestic market.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Okay. And just one quick follow-up, I missed it. How long was the wait for G650 right now?
Thank you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: It is for G650 the third quarter of 2017.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning. Phebe, I was going to ask for some more help on Aerospace backlog and
just reconciling the book-to-bill with the extension of the backlogs for the models you talked about earlier. I suspect a
lot of what's happening is you've been working off a very strong G650 bookings back in 2011. So there's distortion. Is
there a point at which we start to get current on bookings and deliveries or does the introduction of these two new
aircraft create new distortion in the next couple quarters as these orders come in?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So you quite aptly and correctly pointed out the G650 order book and given the length of
time between a order today and a delivery of that aircraft, it has some distortion in our book-to-bill and we've talked
about that I think for the last five or six quarters. As we move into the new airplane orders, we expect something very
similar. So I think that we used to watch book-to-bill with great, in the Aerospace group with great, I wouldn't say
consternation, but detail. And I think that's less apt now. So what we watch for is the mix of the airplanes. And so far,
our in-service models are doing very, very well.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. And then just switching topics, a quick one if I could on a potential additional
Stryker bridge, could you talk about any upside there in timing?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well that kind of depends on when we get an appropriations bill passed, we've got money
in the 2015 appropriations for the Stryker Bridge. The customer is very anxious to get those vehicles. So it was pretty
much in line with what we planned for in 2015 and 2016. But as I said, we don't have our detailed plans done, but there

Your next question will come from the line of...
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: That might have gone across on a live mic.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of John Godyn from General Dynamics. Please proceed.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Hey. It's John Godyn from Morgan Stanley. But thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: You got a battlefield promotion there.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: That's right. Phebe, I wanted to follow up on Aerospace margins a bit. When I think about the
progression throughout the year, I think it's safe to say that they've exceeded expectations. Earlier in the year you had
highlighted a number of puts and takes and when we think about your full-year guidance now, it seems like those
aren't, I guess the downside risk isn't coming to. I was hoping you could just give us a bit of color and maybe a play by
play on what exactly drove the beats versus earlier concerns in the year and what that means as we look out into 2015
and risks and opportunities to improve margins from here.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So the single largest factor, particularly for this quarter in margins, was pre-owned. And
we've talked I think for the last couple of quarters about with a business of this level of complexity, there are a lot of
puts and takes, aircraft mix, the mix of service, both in terms of volume and types of service work. Some service jobs
come in with a lot more high content work. R&D is lumpy. G&A can be lumpy. The pre-owned in this quarter was
significant and we didn't have much pre-owned in the first couple of quarters of this – in fact zero in the first half of
this year and we had three this quarter. So that's I think, well that is what affected our margins this quarter.
And then for the fourth quarter we were looking for pretty much the same. We'll have some margin compression, but
not a whole lot. Again we anticipate a couple of pre-owned that carry no margin with it. Going forward, we believe that
we're going to see some margin expansion particularly as the G650 comes down its learning curve. We're not done
improvements on the G650. In fact production, in fact you're never really done. And then in the out years when we start
to ramp up G500 and G600 production, we'll see some compression in margin as we come down our learning curves.
But again, nothing that is remarkable or particularly out there.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Got it. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Maybe first a clarification, the cash conversion that you expect in the fourth quarter.
And then usually it's seasonally strong. I just don't know how much of an influence this pull forward will have and if
you extend suppliers' cash here from the advance in the fourth quarter. But the real question, Phebe, is given the
breadth of growth in the defense backlogs, I mean it seems like you'd be in a place to, I don't want to say declare a
bottom for your defense business, but certainly look toward a potential for growth in 2015. Is that across the defense
portfolio in aggregate, is that an accurate statement?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes. Let me talk about growth and let's go by group. In the Marine group you ought to see
steadying low single-digit growth year-over-year, and we've been predicting that and that's in fact what has happened.
Combat Systems, given the considerable backlog it has, when we start ramping up production and that's largely going
to be in 2016 and 2017, I think you're going to see good bottom line and top line growth. In IS&T, we believe we're at
the bottom and we've had a good order book in this last quarter, so we see some good potential there. So on cash
conversion, the fourth quarter will be lighter obviously because we're beginning to defer some of that cash to our
suppliers.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Will it be positive free cash flow?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes, good morning. Phebe, I wanted to explore a little bit the Aerospace margins in a
different way. And if you just look at the incremental margin this quarter, it was 31%. The second quarter you couldn't
calculate because the margin was up on down revenues, and the first quarter was also close to 30%. So I know you say
there's a lot of moving parts and everything in there, but it does seem like the incrementals still come out to around
30%. Now is there any reason why that shouldn't continue as we go forward? And then also, if you could just update us
on what's your expected large cabin deliveries are for the year, if that's changed any from the second quarter.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No, we're at 116 large cabin and 32 mid cabin, and that's on green deliveries.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: And basically the same for completions. So, look, margins are going to be, and I think
you've seen they are somewhat lumpy. Earnings are going to follow revenue growth, but we will have lumpy margins
for a whole series of reasons that we've talked about at some length. R&D will fluctuate. Net R&D will fluctuate. G&A
will fluctuate. Mix is going to fluctuate, pre-owned. With a complex business, with a lot of moving parts you've got a
lot of puts and takes, right?
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Right, and that's why to me it's still surprising that when you look at the incremental
margins, they don't seem to vary all that much, seem to be up around that 30% level.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, our performance continues apace. It's just that you've got in any given quarter the
things that are affecting it and activities that are affecting it. So we have on our, our gross margins on our airplanes
continue to be very, very strong. And we see improvement across the board quarter-over-quarter.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So, go ahead.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: One quick one, maybe for Jason. How much were the revenues in the quarter associated
with the three pre-owned aircraft?
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: Yes, one second, that.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I think it's over $100 million.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: Yes, it's actually closer to about $70 million or so.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks very much, Phebe, and good performance.

Your next question will come from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thank you.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Hey, Phebe, I was just wondering if you could give us some color on what's going on
with Russia and China with the sanctions and I think the corruption crackdown in China. Are any of those issues,
particularly the sanctions, holding up any Gulfstream deliveries? And overall for both countries, are you seeing any
orders being deferred or just slowing in general because of what's going on in those regions?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Not yet. The sanctions have only impacted us at the very, very far margin and more at Jet
Aviation than in Gulfstream. And China, China has a history of variability in its order activity. So I don't see anything
abnormal there.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Okay. Got it. And then just, you touched on the pre-owned market a little bit. Can you
talk about the pricing in the pre-owned market, maybe by mid cabins and large cabins? Is it fairly stable year-over-year,
or not really improving, or can you just add some color there?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes. It's stable, and we're seeing some improvements, particularly in the larger cabin.
Prices are firming up in the pre-owned.
<Q - Peter John Skibitski>: Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Excuse me. Thank you very much. Phebe, it seems as if you're continuing to go through the
businesses and find opportunities for either sell things or reposition them. And obviously you've done one in Combat
and then you have a small sale to MDA. Could you elaborate a little bit on some of the longer term objectives that
you're looking for for each of the businesses? I mean you've sort of hinted at some of them in earlier questions. Could
you provide a little granularity, please?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes. So in the case of Combat Systems, and by the way, all of our internal reorganizations
have been in response to changes in our market. So as we looked at last year, our ATP and OTS business, it made
eminent sense to go ahead and combine those two, primarily some for scale, but primarily for cost reduction, and that
has executed beautifully. So we've got nice, nice margin activity at now the new OTS.
The IS&T was something we'd thought about for a while. But again, as the markets have contracted, it made sense now
to integrate those two businesses, primarily again for cost reductions. And we ought to see that, as the margins benefit
from that starting next year and going into the future. But also it provides us some scale, which is helpful too in this
down market. Look, what we want to do in a down market is manage what you can manage and keep our margins as
high as possible. So we've had a long road of recovery on IS&T margins, but I anticipate that they will continue to
improve.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then just, I don't know, the other thing that you've done is you clearly took work
in-house for Gulfstream and you've hinted at some exciting manufacturing changes. Could you just elaborate a little bit
more on what you've done there to take productivity to a new level and what does that imply for what you're setting a
standard for other parts of the organization to look at these options?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Wow, that's an interesting question. Let's go to the what we have done in anticipation of
the new airplanes. We learned a very important lesson with the G650, that a purpose-built facility provides much
greater margin expansion over time. That plus the way these airplanes were designed, is they were designed for
produce-ability, so fewer parts and cleaner and clearer build paper, work paper that gets out on the shop floor. So given
that we have these purpose-built facilities and the way these planes were manufactured or designed, I think we've got
very, very good earnings potential in the future.
We've taken some work in-house that we previously had outsourced largely just as a matter of control and efficiency.
For some of these parts that we are now manufacturing at Gulfstream, the transportation costs are significantly less
when you move it from one building right over to the next building. So that was a factor in how we thought about
optimizing earnings potential going forward for these new airplanes.
I don't believe that this is necessarily a model for the defense businesses, not something that they look at. The Marine
group is not a vertically integrated group. Neither is our Land Systems. So they have a very robust and disciplined
supply chain network and I don't see them bringing more work in-house.

Your next question will come from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Phebe, where are you in the process of selling AxleTech?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: As you know, we moved AxleTech into discontinued operations and we are selling it, and
I think it's not appropriate to comment any further than that.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. As a follow-up, Jason, on the pension legislation, HAFTA legislation, I know you guys
deal with CAS differently than everyone else. But how does that impact you from a mandatory contribution standpoint
going forward? Does that help you?
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: It does. It, I think like just about everybody else, it brings down pretty meaningfully the
mandatory contributions that we are projecting. That said, I think as you're aware, those contributions that we've had in
the past and are forecasting aren't necessarily potentially as significant to us as it may be to others. So the reduction
isn't something that we've focused on as a material item that will change our cash flow outlook or anything else like
that in a significant way.

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a couple of quick clarifications. Jason, you said that the contribution from Jet was good
in the quarter. I wondered if you could characterize whether that was better than what you've seen in maybe the past
couple of quarters. And then with respect to the Mission Systems creation, I wondered if there were any restructuring
or other expenses associated with the combination that are non-repeating for next year, and if you could help us think
about what that might contribute to next year's margin. Thank you very much.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: I think with respect to the Jet Aviation question, we continue to see steady improvement in the
business and year-over-year each quarter, we're seeing improvement, second quarter to second, third quarter to third
and so on. So we expect to continue to see that slowly and steadily improve in their operations.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Any charges with respect to restructuring will be taken in the quarter in which they are
incurred and more than offset by the cost savings. So we don't see any material headwinds as a result.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.
