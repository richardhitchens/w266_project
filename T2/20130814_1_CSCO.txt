John T. Chambers
Mel, thank you very much.
As we close fiscal year 2013, we are pleased to announce another strong quarter and strong end to our fiscal year. Q4
was a record quarter on many fronts, with record revenues of $12.4 billion and record non-GAAP operating income,
record non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.52. In every case we exceeded the midpoint of
our guidance. We generated $4 billion in operating cash flow in the quarter, another record as well. Delivering the
record results we did this quarter and every quarter this year despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop speaks
to our increasing strategic position in the market and our ability to manage our overall business as a portfolio across
technologies, customer segments and geographic regions.
With this backdrop in mind, I want to highlight five key takeaways from Q4. First, our results. We continue to
consistently deliver. Our performance in Q4 FY 2013 was differentiated versus many of our peers. We drove both top
line growth of 6% and bottom line growth in terms of non-GAAP EPS growth of 11% with stable gross margins for the
year and strong operating margins. From the $4 billion cash from operations, we returned over $2.1 billion to our
shareholders in buyback and dividends.
Secondly, we are leading many of the technology transitions in the market, which are increasing in pace. With the
network squarely at the center of cloud, mobility, BYOD, security and the Internet of Everything, we believe we are
uniquely positioned to help our customers meet their business goals, and they're asking us to play this role. An example
is our continued success in mobility where we are driving the transition to a unified access architecture in cloud and
saw revenue growth of over 30% in our wireless business this quarter.
Our data center business is a second proof point. We successfully drove the transition to a converged architecture, and
you see this in our data center results: a $2 billion plus business in five years, growing revenue over 40%
year-over-year in the most recent quarter. And we are not stopping. At Cisco Live in June, we previewed our
application-centric infrastructure strategy with Insieme. We are delivering the next wave of industry innovation from
the cloud through the campus and driving our continued market leadership.
Third, we delivered the strong performance in what continues to be a challenging and inconsistent global
macroeconomic environment. While we saw continued momentum in year-over-year orders in the U.S. enterprise up
9%, U.S. commercial up 12% and an upturn in U.S. public sector, which grew at 4%, in APJC, our Asia Pacific, Japan,
China operations, we saw the same weakness many of our peers experienced with orders down 3% along with
economic challenges impacting several of our top five emerging markets. Last quarter, I described a continued slow
recovery, and I haven't seen anything to suggest that this dynamic will change in the short term. But this recovery is
more mixed and inconsistent than others I've seen.
Fourth, we are committed to our long-term financial model, including driving profitable revenue growth of 5% to 7%.
In this tight environment, we as leaders must continuously rebalance our resources to invest in new opportunities. In
my opinion, we are managing our opportunities and our business better than we ever have, and our customers and
shareholders are seeing the benefits.
And fifth, we believe our vision and strategy are working. We have never lost when we are aligned with our customers,
helping them to solve their most important business challenges. You saw that in our U.S. enterprise and commercial
business, global service provider customers, and even entire countries. When we partner with our customers on their

business priorities, the results speak for themselves. As an example, I look at our success selling solutions that deliver
business results, not selling products in Brian Marlier's U.S. Enterprise business, resulting in terms of the pipeline more
than 50% year-over-year increase in orders of over $1 million in that territory.
At the country level, I look at a 27% year-over-year increase in orders with Israel in Q4 as we align across all political
parties to focus on the country's priorities, job creation, inclusion, education, healthcare, future infrastructure and
technology industry development. When we partner with a customer, in this case a country, Israel, to drive their
success, our business benefits, which Forbes refers to as profits through peace. The latest industry data shows our
relevance with customers is only growing as we move to become the number one IT company.
To provide additional details on our Q4 FY 2013 results, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank. After Frank, I'll then
walk through some additional details in terms of what we're seeing in the business. Frank will then detail our guidance,
and then we'll wrap up with a quick summary and move into my favorite part, which is the Q&As.
Frank, to you.
Frank A. Calderoni
Thanks, John.
I'm pleased with our strong performance in Q4 and throughout FY 2013. We delivered top line growth for the full fiscal
year of 6% and we grew profits faster than revenue for each quarter and for the full year. We effectively managed our
business with strong operational execution, while maintaining stable gross margins and delivering profitable growth
and return for our shareholders.
Starting with the full, fiscal year performance, our total revenue was $48.6 billion. Our non-GAAP net income was
$10.9 billion, and this was up 8%. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $2.02 per share, which
grew 9% year-over-year. As for our GAAP net income, it was $10 billion, or $1.86 per share on a fully diluted basis,
representing increases of 24% and 25%, respectively.
We generated strong operating cash flows of $12.9 billion, increasing 12%. We returned $6.1 billion of cash to our
shareholders through our dividends and share buybacks, representing 52% of free cash flow, which was $11.7 billion.
This is consistent with the capital allocation strategy that we introduced a year ago.
Moving on to Q4 results, we had solid execution with results consistent with our expectation. Total revenue was $12.4
billion, growing 6% year-over-year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.52 per share, growing 11%. Our Q4 marked the
seventh consecutive quarter where we grew profits faster than revenue as measured through earnings per share.
In this quarter, we closed three more acquisitions, including SolveDirect, Ubiquisys and JouleX, and we announced two
more acquisitions in Security and Software. Composite Software provides enterprise data virtualization software and
services, and Sourcefire is a leading intelligent cybersecurity solutions company. These acquisitions are aligned with
our portfolio approach of driving long-term returns and complementing our innovation engine.
In terms of our business momentum, we saw product and service revenue both grow at 6%, with total product
book-to-bill comfortably over 1. Total revenue from a geographic perspective grew 7% for the Americas, 12% for
EMEA, and decreased 3% for APJC. We delivered strong and consistent non-GAAP operating margins of 28.2%.
Within our operating margins, we have driven stability in our gross margins and maintained a concentrated focus and
discipline on our operating expenses. In Q4 our total non-GAAP gross margin was 62.1%, and this compared to 61.9%
a year ago, and 63% last quarter. Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 60.8%. This compared to 60.4% a year
ago, and also 62.1% last quarter.
We saw good gross margin stability across most of our product areas. Our non-GAAP service gross margin was 67.1%,
and this also compared to 66.5% last quarter and 67.1% in Q4 FY 2012. Total gross margins by geography were
Americas at 61.8%, EMEA was at 64.4%, and APJC was at 59.5%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2
billion, or 33.9% as a percentage of revenue compared to 34.4% in Q4 fiscal year 2012.

We made head count investments this past quarter of approximately 900. These additions were driven by our
acquisitions and portfolio investments in sales as well as in services.
Now moving onto the non-GAAP tax provision rate, that was 20.1%. Our non-GAAP net income was $2.8 billion, and
this represents an increase of 13%. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income was 22.9%. As I mentioned
earlier, our non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.52, and this is versus $0.47 in the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2012, and it represents an 11% increase.
From a GAAP net income perspective, it was $2.3 billion, representing an increase of 18% as compared to $1.9 billion
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. Our GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.42 versus $0.36
in the same quarter fiscal 2012, and this represents a 17% increase.
As a reminder, we announced in June that our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for Q4 FY 2013
included an impact of the TiVo patent litigation settlement. We recorded a charge of $172 million, or $0.03 per share.
The non-GAAP earnings this quarter excludes this charge.
During the quarter, we returned $2.1 billion to our shareholders, including $1.2 billion through the share repurchase
and $918 million through our quarterly dividend.
Total cash, the cash equivalents, and investments, were $50.6 billion, including $10.2 billion, which was available in
the U.S. at the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations was a strong $4 billion, up 29%, and this was an all-time
record.
Our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2013 was approximately $4.9 billion as compared to approximately $5 billion
at the end of fiscal 2012.
In terms of our key balance sheet metrics, DSO, or days sales outstanding, were 40 days, reflecting a slightly reduced
linearity profile of product and service billings this quarter. This impact was partially offset by strong collections on
our receivables. And finally, our non-GAAP inventory turns were strong at 12.8.
Overall, our priority of long-term profitable growth is proving to be effective. We are driving focus and discipline in
the right areas of the business, which helps us to continue to be ahead and innovate IT solutions for our customers. We
remain highly focused on shareholder value through rigorous expense management and strong cash return to our
shareholders. We remain confident in our ability to continue to execute.
John, I'll now turn it back over to you for more detail on the business momentum.
John T. Chambers
Thank you, Frank.
I'll now provide some additional detail on the performance in Q4 and trends we are seeing in our business and in the
market. I'll first walk through our product portfolio in terms of year-over-year revenue growth followed by discussing
geographic and customer segments in terms of year-over-year orders.
First, in core networking, we have driven innovation and execution across our switching portfolio, which has resulted
in solid growth in our switching business this quarter of 5%. Our Nexus switching product line continues with its strong
double-digit growth, over 20%, and in the campus, our fully converged wired and wireless Catalyst 3850 platform
continues its very strong performance with the current quarter order rate of over $150 million after only two quarters in
the market. Despite hype around new technologies and potentially disruptive competitors, our performance in switching
has been extremely solid, and we're innovating to continue to lead in the future.
We saw another strong record quarter in our wireless business, up 32%. We were particularly pleased with the
performance of our cloud networking business, based upon our acquisition of Meraki this quarter, which grew orders
over 100% from the prior quarter with an order run rate now annualizing Q4, of over $250 million. This speaks to the

power of industry-leading technologies, in this case acquired, integrated into an architecture accelerated by a
world-leading channel organization. We are also pleased with the initial uptake of 802.11ac modules with the AP 3600,
leading the adoption of gigabit Wi-Fi, the new industry standard for wireless LANs.
In NGN routing, total revenue for NGN routing was flat. The story across the industry this quarter was one of the edge.
We saw our ASR 9000 revenues reach a record high with growth of 69%, well outpacing our peers. In the high-end
core, we experienced weakness similar to many of our peers. In the quarter, we introduced the CRS-X system with over
400 GPS capacity to address the surging demand for video, mobility and collaboration. We are very comfortable with
our product leadership and plans for the future in this market.
In mobility, we expanded our customer penetration with our newest ASR 5500 series with several key wins. This
product tends to be large order-driven. In my words, i.e., lumpy, even though I know you don't like it, Mel. Sorry about
the humor. And following strong growth for several quarters, we saw a slight decline this quarter. We are bringing
advanced software and management tools to carriers that will enable them to lower operating cost and drive efficiencies
around their overall network spend. We believe our internal innovation coupled with the recent acquisitions of
BroadHop, Cariden, Intucell and Ubiquisys position us to be the clear number one in this mobile market over the long
run.
Cisco ONE continues to gain strong customer momentum by delivering, in our view, the most comprehensive
framework for network programmability and SDN. We have more than doubled the number of beta customers to over
120 who are utilizing Cisco ONE to program, orchestrate and manage their networks. We also are continuing to invest
in open source communities like OpenDaylight and OpenStack as a means to help accelerate our customers' adoption of
SDN and cloud. Technology from Sourcefire, our most recent announced acquisition, is based on industry-leading
open-source platform for security.
Moving on to the data center cloud, where we grew revenue 43% year-over-year, growing across all regions. We are
pleased to have moved into the number two position worldwide in the x86 blade market with approximately 20%
market share, something our peers would have considered impossible a couple – a few years ago. We saw this strong
performance despite a very challenging compare to Q4 FY 2012 where a year ago, we blew out the numbers with 90%
year-over-year growth.
Our partner ecosystem, including VCE and NetApp as well as hundreds of application partners continues to accelerate
the adoption of our Unified Data Center architecture as the leading data center platform. VCE specifically had a very
strong quarter with order growth over 50% and strong demand from new and existing customers. We are seeing similar
momentum with our FlexPod solution with NetApp, where FY 2013 orders also grew over 50% compared to FY 2012.
Moving on to video, total SP video revenues grew 23%, driven largely by our NDS acquisition. We continue to see
good performance with our video software and solution business that includes NDS, driven by new innovative
solutions like cloud, DVR and compelling user interfaces.
Moving on to collaboration, we continue to improve our collaboration execution. Revenue was flat normalized for the
underlying server revenue. Momentum, as measured by collaborative orders, reached a record high this quarter,
growing normalized 5%. That's the first quarter in five quarters that we've grown positively now. But revenue growth
lagged, as the profile of this business shifts to recurring revenue. We saw this trend in our conferencing performance,
which was flat, and UC when normalized was down 2%. TelePresence was up 3%, driven by strength in end points.
Moving on to security, where revenue of $346 million was flat year-over-year, network security is flat, and content
security was slightly down. The continued shift in the security business to term-based software licensing, i.e., recurring
revenue, is having a short-term impact on year-over-year revenue growth.
Last month we announced our intent to acquire Sourcefire for $2.7 billion, and we expect this acquisition to close in the
second half of the calendar year. With this move, we made a major step forward to being our customers' leading
security partner, and our aspirational goal to become the number one security company.

Finally, services. Services revenues grew 6%, representing 22% of total revenue. As we said before, we are committed
to our long-term growth rates of 9% to 11% in services. Together with our partners, we are winning large, multi-year
service deals as our customers ask us to partner with them to meet their business goals.
In summary, we believe our innovation through build, buy, partner, combined with our architectural approach is
working extremely well. We continue to focus on market transition and customer priorities to drive our innovation and
focus.
I will now move on to provide some color on our geographic and customer segments. The following geographic and
customer segment growth rates are in terms of year-over-year product orders for Q4, unless specifically stated
otherwise.
In Q4 Cisco's total product orders grew 4% year-over-year. Looking at the numbers from a geographic perspective, the
Americas region grew 5%, as I discussed up-front, we continue to see solid momentum in the U.S., with U.S.
Enterprise up 9%, and Commercial up 12%. U.S. Public Sector growth of 4% was driven by state, local and education
strength in their buying season, which was up 9%, and Federal business growth was up 3%. U.S. service provider was
down slightly. We saw challenges in the Asia-Pacific Japan and China region, down 30% due largely to
macroeconomic challenges.
We saw challenges in Japan due to reduced large SP CapEx, and economic challenges. We also continued to work
through the challenges in China, and saw a 6% decline in our business there. China is less than 5% of Cisco's total
revenue from an overall perspective. India was clearly the highlight in Asia-Pacific, up 19%.
One of the most positive trends we saw in Q4 was the continued improvement in our Europe, Middle East, Africa, and
Russian region, which was up 6%, and Europe itself was up 6%. Economic conditions in Europe still vary significantly
by region with the North and U.K. showing very positive progress. We remain cautious, however, given the instability
of the southern region.
Our Emerging Markets business was up 8%. However, we saw mixed results in our top five emerging countries with
India and Mexico up in double-digits, Brazil and Russia approximately flat, and China down 6%. The changes in
macroeconomic conditions in the emerging markets, both positive and negative, are driving more inconsistent growth
than in the past.
Now moving on to customer segment view, again, from an orders perspective. Enterprise declined 2%. The decline was
driven largely by EMEA enterprise, which declined 10% year-over-year. Commercial grew 5%, service provider grew
6%, global public sector grew 6%. This once again has been a very positive trend with global public sector, and if you
were to just look back over the last year, Q1 of this last year, global public sector was down 6%, Q2 was flat, Q3 up 1%
and Q4 up 6%.
Our results demonstrate the mixed nature of the market. In technology areas, we are seeing switching and data center
strength offset by routing and set-top box weakness. In customer segments, we see public sector momentum offset by
softness this quarter in Enterprise. In geographies, we see improvement in the EMEA, in Europe, if you will, offset by
weakness in APJC.
Despite these trends, we continue to grow. Our total product order growth continues to slowly increase over the last
four quarters, excluding acquisitions and divestitures so we compare apples to apples speaking to the power of our
portfolio and our execution. While the trends of ICT spending and global GDP growth according to industry experts
continue to be revised downward for calendar year 2013 industry estimates have the growth of our total available
markets and were looking through calendar year 2017 in the 5% to 7% range, once again echoing our view that this is
the area that we ought to grow in over the longer time period.
In summary, I believe the macro effects will fuel a continued mixed environment, but I feel very good about how we
are positioned and about how what we can control.
I will now turn it over to Frank to provide Q1 fiscal year 2014 guidance.

Before Frank continues, I want to clarify one number. The Asia Pacific Japan China region was down 3% in terms of
orders year-over-year and not 30%.
John T. Chambers
I was off by a factor of ten. Thank you, Mel. No wonder there's a note coming over here. I can't blame that on a
Southern accent, can I?
Melissa Selcher
Oh, no.
John T. Chambers
No. Okay. Down 3%. Frank, to you.
Frank A. Calderoni
Thanks, John.
Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments
include forward-looking statements, and you should review our recent SEC filings that identify some important risk
factors and understand that actual results can materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements
and that actual results could also be above or below the guidance. This guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP
basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.
For Q1 FY 2014, we're managing the business to account for a slow inconsistent recovery. With that in mind, we
expect revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis. For the first quarter, we anticipate
non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 is expected to be in
the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. And our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the first
quarter. Our Q1 FY 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.50 to $0.51. We remain
committed to our long-term financial model of driving profitable growth by growing revenue 5% to 7% and non-GAAP
EPS 7% to 9%.
As you would expect, we continue to make portfolio trade-offs to ensure we are investing in future growth through
innovation such as cloud, data center, mobility, services, software and security, as well as driving operational
efficiency. In the past two years, we have managed the business with discipline and focus.
In order to execute on the portfolio investment and operational efficiency opportunities that we see in FY 2014, we are
rebalancing our resources with a workforce reduction, which will impact approximately 4,000 employees or 5% of our
global workforce. We expect to continue to deliver non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of revenue in the high
20%, consistent with our long-term financial model.
We expect to take this action starting in Q1 FY 2014 and currently estimate recognizing pre-tax charges to our GAAP
financial results of up to $550 million. We expect that approximately $250 million to $300 million of these charges will
be recognized during the first quarter of FY 2014 with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal
year. We anticipate our GAAP earnings in Q1 to be $0.16 to $0.20 per share lower than our non-GAAP EPS. Please
see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail.

Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP as
well as our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring,
and tax or other events, which may or may not be significant. And as a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its
financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
John, turn it back to you.
John T. Chambers
Frank, thank you very much.
The most difficult decisions we make as leaders are those that impact our employees. However, we will always take the
necessary actions to efficiently manage our business for the long run. Consistent with what we've said over the past two
years, we are positioning Cisco to accelerate and lead with greater speed, flexibility, and agility.
As we close the very successful fiscal year 2013, I am very pleased with how we are operating as a company and the
value we are delivering to our customers, our partners, our employees, and our shareholders. We have delivered on and
remained committed to our long-term profitable revenue growth of 5% to 7% and capital returns of a minimum of 50%
of free cash flow annually and believe Cisco is better positioned in the market today than ever before.
As I look at the areas of very strong momentum going into Q1, I feel extremely confident. I know it is a long list, but I
ask you to bear with me, as I think these areas of strength are proof of our increasing relevance and strong execution
over the next number of years. Specifically, I'm very pleased with the following: U.S. enterprise and commercial
momentum, data center and cloud leadership, mobility and wireless strategy, switching growth and leadership,
European momentum and execution, SP strategy and architecture, global public sector improvements.
We have seen two things that have changed over the course of this year. First, the economic recovery is slower and
more inconsistent, with global GDP continuing to tick down for calendar year 2013 and global challenges in Southern
Europe, several of the large emerging markets and Asia-Pacific.
Second, the pace of change has continued to increase. This is an environment that we are very effective at and very
much want to lead. We are going to focus on aligning our resources to our top opportunities, speeding the decision
cycles and time to implementation, balancing expenses to revenue and driving efficiencies in the business while
investing in growth.
We never convince ourselves the market will evolve a certain way because it's convenient to our current business.
Rather, we align closely with our customers to transform to meet the long-term market needs. We prioritize and invest
for where we believe the market is going. Every technology company should move with this agility; many don't, and
those companies that don't get left behind.
Investments we made many years ago are paying off today. Nothing is more evident than what we discussed earlier in
terms of our movement in the data center. It started over seven years ago. We recognized the impact of data center and
cloud would have on networking and the opportunity to bring innovation in terms of product, architecture and
go-to-market. We moved from being an unknown into the market to the number one cloud infrastructure provider today
as reported by Synergy Research. We are driving this same strategy across our business using innovation, acquisitions,
spin-ins and partnering to drive our agenda, making strategic bets and investments to position us well for the future.
My confidence in our ability to be the number one IT company is increasing. This leadership is evident in our customer
and partner satisfaction scores that are the highest in the industry and our customers want us to do more. Now more
than ever our customers and our partners want Cisco's help navigating these challenging landscapes successfully. They
recognize the benefit of a partner who is not only the leader in their product categories, but can bring technology and
solutions together in an architecture to lower operating costs, reduce time-to-market and future-proof their investments.
I'd love any player to take us on in this strategic approach. This is a strategy we invented and have delivered on
successfully for over two decades and we're moving aggressively to play on an even broader scale. While we are

planning conservatively given the broader macroeconomic environment, we remain very much a company on the
offensive and very comfortable with maintaining our position as the disruptor in the industry. Both today and in the
future, we will measure our success by the value we deliver to our customers, partners, employees and shareholders.
Mel, let me turn it over to you for questions.
Melissa Selcher
Great, thanks, John. We'll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell side analysts please ask only one
question.
Operator, please open the floor to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Tal.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hello. Hi. I have a kind of a blunt question. If the environment is improving, why are you guiding a
little bit conservative and why are you laying off 4,000 people, which is about 5% of your workforce, if I understand
correctly?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure. So the environment in terms of our business is improving slightly, but nowhere near
the pace that we want. You know what product orders have done, minus the acquisition and spin outs, because that
gives you a feeling for what our growth is going to be, and those will bump them up or down. It's just not growing at
the speed we want. The inconsistency of global GDP growth and lots of time you see Northern Europe start to get
stronger. You see the issues in emerging markets start to get softer. You see us successful in one category, switching,
and you see us not as successful except in the edge in terms of the routing. You begin to see a balance, which was 13%
growth in emerging markets back down to 8% in terms of the opportunity.
And so the combination of weakness in APJC offsetting what went on in Europe, the strength in the U.S. offset by what
went on in emerging markets, et cetera, is kind of leveling off. So, Tal, what we see is slow steady improvements but
not at the pace we want. Now if we're going to lead in this industry, the one thing I've learned over the years is you are
the first mover. We have to very quickly reallocate the resources. So a fair amount of that 4,000 people will be
allocated to new growth opportunities.
The second thing is even though, Gary, I think you and I would agree, we were very pleased with how we made
progress in the last two years on speeding up decisions, in today's marketplace, they're almost up exponentially on how
quickly not only decisions have to be made but how quickly you implement those. Those need to be done with small
teams. We just have too much in the middle of the organization.
When you have that type of layers and span of controls, without meaning to, very well-meaning people begin to really
look at how they add value to decisions made, and Rob, we're just not moving with the speed that we need in this area.
So you're going to see us focus very much in this area on span of control and also layers. It's all about speed of pace in
this new industry, which we intend to balance in.
Third, we made commitments on a financial model, which we're absolutely sticking to. You heard our commitment:
61%, 62% gross margins. You heard our commitment: operating margin 27.5% to 28.5%. You've seen our
commitments to grow earnings on most quarters faster than revenues and we see a market where we're gaining market
share even at these lower numbers. Every well-run business in the world grows and keeps expenses in line with revenue
growth and driving up productivity. Candidly, we didn't drive productivity this last year.

So with the change in the macroeconomic environment and you saw this from the Fed officials, you've seen it in all the
forecasts on emerging countries, et cetera, and you saw it in our business numbers, with inconsistent data, even in our
own operations, which tends to be more lumpy than I like to see, this is just good business management. And I've
learned in this industry, you lead with your mind, not with your heart, and this is something that we think will allow us
to grow our profits but also, most important, to achieve the number one position in the industry and move our resources
very quickly to the growth opportunities. If this were a normal pace, you could move those resources over two years
with attrition and realignment.
But I think, Gary, given what we want to do on speed and organizational structure and our ability to move fast, you're
going to see us target that 4,000 people. We're obviously going to hire back part of them and – in other categories, and
realign where we need to go for growth.
So, Tal, that's a blunt question. My key takeaway is I'm real pleased with our momentum in the market. It's just not
growing as fast as we need, and there are enough inconsistencies in the market we think not to remain agile and flexible
to be able to grow for our growth markets quickly, putting the resources behind that as needed. This is what we
strongly believe we will do as a company.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Tal. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you, our next question will come from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to clarify some of the moving pieces around the
guidance and then I had a question, but in terms of the clarification, you know, there were just a bunch of data points
that pointed in opposite directions. I think you said your book-to-bill was comfortably above 1. I saw your deferred
revenue was up 6% sequentially yet the backlog was down and the guidance was for some deceleration. So if you can
just kind of reconcile those conflicting data points.
And then in terms of the question, it seems like some of the weakness was in your service provider business and orders,
I think you said, in the Americas there declined, routing was also flat. But when we look at the carrier spending in
North America, in particular, it seems actually to have strengthened in the last few months. If you can just help us
understand that as well.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. Simona, we'll answer all the questions but we'll try to ask in the future for just one.
Let me take the book-to-bill, you take the other two financial questions and I'll take the service provider question.
The book-to-bill was in line with our normal Q4s. It was very comfortably over 1. And I mean very comfortably, in line
with what we normally see.
In terms of the quarter, linearity to the indirect part of your question, the first month of the quarter was lighter than we
would like. Second month was very consistent. Third month was more stronger in terms of the linearity.
Maybe, Frank, to the other two issues and then I'll do the service provider question.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: Yeah, John. So overall, Simona, I would say that we were very pleased with the
performance throughout the year, 6% top line growth, 9% from a non-GAAP EPS growth. And if you look at the
momentum throughout the year, I think we were fairly consistent. We started to see improvement as the year unfolded,
especially in the back half of the year, if you look at the order rates. As you know we had flat orders in the first two
quarters, then we started to get order growth rate of about 4% in Q3, 4% in Q4. So we got some good momentum.
I think it also helped with the backlog, kind of where John mentioned before, and then we also have deferred revenue,
as you mentioned, which was up 6% at the end of the year. So I think from a trend standpoint, we're first of all, pleased
with how the quarter closed, the year closed. And we're also pleased with the momentum that we started to see at the

end of the year.
Now the guidance for Q1 that I gave was 3% to 5% on a year-on-year basis from a revenue standpoint, and then also
from an EPS of $0.50 to $0.51 non-GAAP EPS. So that's slightly down from what we normally see sequentially. Some
of that has to do with what John was talking about, about some of the inconsistencies that we're seeing, and we're trying
to be, with those inconsistencies, a little bit conservative as we're looking into the start of a fiscal year, and a fiscal year
going into Q1 always has some challenges here or there. And so we're taking that into consideration. Again, the slight
decline from a profitability standpoint, we want to make sure that we can continue to drive the margins, very consistent
margins over the last two years from a gross, and then improving margins from an operating income. We want to make
sure that we're consistently following through, staying committed to the long-term model, 5% to 7% long-term growth,
7% to 9% non-GAAP EPS growth, getting operating margins, as I said, in that high 20% range. So we're trying to
balance all that as we go into a new fiscal year, and making sure that everything is aligned to investing in the most
effective innovation growth opportunities that we see over the next 12 months.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Simona, to your question on service provider. I could not be more comfortable with where
we are on our service provider architecture and key customers. Their spending does tend to be lumpy by service
provider group and category, and if you watched, to the indirect part of your question, we did extremely well in the
edge with ASR 9000, which compares to the Juniper MX, although I think it's vastly superior, which grew 43% in the
quarter. We do a little but more revenue, I think, than the Juniper MX does, but if you were in the edge market in fixed
edge this quarter and you didn't do well, you had a real problem.
Now if I back into that number, Mel, Juniper's total growth was 6%, and you take 43% for $350 million, all their
growth was in this one product category. There is a little bit of bleed-over with the ASR 9000 into the core, and a little
bit of bleed-over in terms of other [ph] pure pedi products in the core (43:47). But we outgrew all of our peers here
comfortably.
Our problem in service providers was in the cable set-top boxes, and the cable companies. Our business was down Q3
to Q4 by 40%. Usually, Q3 to Q4 goes up comfortably. This is part of our focus on profitable set-top boxes in a market
that is becoming very tough, almost commodity-like. We've got to be able to take set-top box business and migrate it to
the cloud, and implement it very successfully within that.
To the other part of the question, we did extremely well on the large two carriers, growing comfortably well above
20%. So this is an issue that you're talking about core networks being loaded, not at the level quite that we'd like to see
in a number of accounts, some CapEx slow-down, but largely, an issue of set-top boxes affecting us disproportionately.
Again, this is part of a conscious decision to drive profitability on our overall gross margins.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks. Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yeah, thanks. Could you give a little more detail on this work force rebalancing? When are you
going to see the savings, and how does that play-out as we go throughout the year? And also, with regard to your
revenue outlook, you're below your target model at 4% next quarter. So when do we get back into the 5% to 7% range
as it plays out -
<A - John T. Chambers>: A bunch of questions, Ben, and today, we want to spend little bit more time on the
questions asked, we'll do that, and all I ask is please hold them to one as we go forward.
In terms of 3% to 5% guidance, that is at the low end of what we've said before. We were at 6%, 5%, 5%, 6% this last
quarter – last year for all four quarters. We are very comfortable with the 5% to 7% over the long run. A lot of it
depends on emerging markets and GDP growth. We need some consistency there; we're not seeing it. And we are often
the first ones to see changes and I think you all have seen our ability to gain market share. I have no worries here on

any major competitive issues, across-the-board.
Our ability from an architecture and the position overall I think is kind of unmatched in the industry. And I think in
each category, including some like security and collaboration, we haven't been growing as fast as I would like to see.
We're starting to slowly pick up momentum there, and you look to the second half of this fiscal year, I'm comfortable
that you'll see us exit at higher levels within that.
But it's really to me is the consistency of GDP growth and an issue where we begin to take revenues, which used to
occur at a given point in time and you begin to get them recurring. That means you've got all the expenses up front and
you get the revenues over a longer period of time. That's great for shareholders in the longer term, but short-term it puts
a lot of pressure on the profits and doesn't show you the growth that you would've seen under other models from a top
line growth.
Frank, to the other part of the question – but before you do, let me help you; we're obviously not going to discuss where
this is going to occur in timing. We're just now getting our communications out to our employees at the time this call is
going on. We will spend time with our employees and spend time talking with them on these key items. So we're not
going to share any detail now or in the near-term future which geographies are going to be affected at which level. So
within that framework, maybe a clarification on the write-downs and why the write-downs were...
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: So I think, Ben, to get to your question, and correct me if it's not addressing the question
directly; I think you asked about as far as the savings going forward associated with the work force reduction. One of
the things I think it's important to note here is that what we're talking about is a work force rebalancing. And so we are
looking at the areas of most focus for us from an innovation standpoint. As we've talked about, data center, cloud,
security, software and services, as well as video. Those are the areas that we are looking to continue to invest in. And as
we go through this and focusing on that, we're making some trade-offs. And that's what we're talking about, and we
expect to continue to drive.
The other thing I think that's important, which I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is as you look at the operating
income as a percentage of revenue, and this goes back to even what I shared in the financial analyst conference that we
had last December, in that we're looking at high 20s. I mean, we've been able to execute at high 20s for the last two
years. We expect to continue to follow through that model. This work force rebalancing allows us to position the
investment for growth, as well as, as John mentioned before, continue to drive operational efficiencies in line with
many of the things that we've had underway and improving over the last two years.
<A - John T. Chambers>: The timing is purely dependent upon treating our employees fairly, as you would expect us
to do, and also local rules and regulations and laws by country.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Ben. Next question?

Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Simon.
<Q - Simon M. Leopold>: Thanks. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could speak a little bit
more about what's going on currently in the data center market, and I'm asking the question as a market vertical, not the
reporting segment. So what I'm specifically trying to get an understanding of is how much of your business comes from
that market vertical, so including Ethernet switches and anything else like services? And then within that context, how
do you see the trend in that marketplace from this quarter out into the future?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. You know, Simon, we don't break it down that way. I don't think I have a problem at
all answering that if I had the data to be able to combine services and split the switching depending on what campus,
what's in the data center, et cetera. To your question about growth, we understand the growth in this market in many
people's opinion is slowing. Ours has been the reverse. We feel very good about our data center growth and balance

into the future. I love our architectural play and I love our next-generation products coming out from what we have
planned for UCS to switching to what we're going to do within semi and a total cloud architecture.
Very simply, we're going to lead in this industry and it will be a combination of software, ASICs, hardware,
management, orchestration, wired and wireless, global multiple clouds, et cetera, coming together architecturally. And
there's nothing that points that out more than the Internet of Things in terms of you'll see processing power, storage,
applications run throughout the network, and just an embodiment of SDN in terms of implementing from everything, as
we discussed last quarter, for our ASIC design, et cetera. So extremely bullish on the data center. I want to be careful in
saying it will be our fastest big-growth area for next year, but I feel very comfortable it will on it.
Rob, would you add anything else to that?
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: John, I'd just add that if you looked at the data center portfolio of switching, obviously the
Nexus portfolio has done very well. Growth in the Nexus this quarter was over 20%. We have a very good innovation
pipeline. We've just now started to see the Nexus 6000, the new platform start to ramp quite nicely. A couple of weeks
ago, we introduced the 7700, a 40, and a 100 gig switch to the data center as well as 40 gig interfaces for the existing
7000.
So the portfolio is very, very strong there in addition to what we see happening with UCS, and actually, I think
architecturally in the current environment and as we shift to more of the application centric opportunities in the future, I
feel really good about the roadmap and great about our innovation.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Simon. Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Hey. You talked about the set-top box business has kind of been challenging I think for at least
the last year. Can you talk about when you see that as – kind of what's your long-term view of that and when do you
see your customer base really shifting to more of a cloud-based SGP model?
And then real quick, if I can slip it in, you did really well again in the wireless LAN space, growing over 30%. What do
you see going on there? Is it the incremental growth of Meraki or is there more share gain occurring, and what's driving
that if that's the case? Thank you.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Got you. So in terms of set-top boxes, it's a big market for us, not real profitable, which is
one of the reasons you've seen our profitability do very well at the same time even though our revenues have dropped
off. The volume, literally, Q3 to Q4, as I said earlier, was down 40% in terms of the run rate.
In terms of the transition, the customers none of them are completely into the cloud yet, and a lot of them are in
between. And so this will be a transition over the next three to five years, a lot depends on how quickly we can help our
customers transition through that and how they get their business models set up effectively on it.
So we continue to model in our expectations, the set-top box is coming down. There might be quarters where we have a
profitable deal or an emerging market deal that we go after but continuing to come down it's a $2 billion base. Now in
terms of the question about overall service provider with this, let me reiterate what I said earlier, in very good shape
product-wise.
In other words, Rob mentioned the numbers, and if you look at our core service provider market, the CRS, it was down
30% but that 30% was one company, one account that did great with us last year and the year before, and they are not
buying anybody else's gear but the network load, and we put in tremendous capacity, isn't anywhere near where they
require additional capacity. So you're almost talking 30% off of our core product areas like CRS just because of the

year-over-year comparison where the company is not buying more. So, Brian, that would be the way I would answer
the first part.
In the wireless, it's both. The wireless LAN is hot. Meraki is hot. Remember that I think it's almost 30% or 35%, Mel,
of Meraki's business unfortunately is recurring. So when you talk about the number of bookings, a third of that just
goes into recurring revenue, and that's great for future earnings but it means you've got your expenses, your
implementation up front and you get the recurring revenue over a period of time. What's causing it? It's architecture.
The minute we move the discussion into architecture, and remember we give the choice to our customers. They can buy
à la carte, by the piece, or they can combine it into an architecture or bundle. They can pick through that and when you
begin to provide a product like the 3850, which is just on fire, the ability for them to pick and future proof their
environment it's very good.
Going back to the issue of software, when you look at what we're going to do, we're going to put software over our
ASICs and over core UCS architecture and over storage throughout the network. This is why I think you're going to see
our customers begin to think about how they future proof their environment as opposed to go for an area that adds
tremendous complexity with potentially, in my opinion, very little benefit.
So thanks, Brian.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Brian. Next question?

Your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.
<Q - Amitabh Passi>: Thank you. Frank, I apologize but I wanted to clarify this one more time. On the workforce
rebalancing, is that a net reduction of 4,000 people or again are you basically reallocating and moving folks from one
organization to the other?
And then, John, I just wanted to pick up on your Public Sector comments. It sounded like things were improving this
quarter. The September, October quarter tends to be the strongest in U.S. Federal. I was just wondering what your
outlook is for the federal sector particularly as we look over through the next quarter?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, so the first part of the question is obviously a combination. It's a work force
realignment and rebalancing, bringing expenses back in line with revenue growth. Granted, off a conservative number,
we hope and believe over time. But we've got to move this quickly, and this is where we can't free up the head count
through attrition or normal means and move it over. Then Gary and the rest of the team were completely united on
we've got to speed time to market. Small teams move in much faster, and we've got to take a lot of this structure out of
mid-level management in terms of the opportunity and get moving quicker overall.
In terms of Public Sector, I do think to the direct part of your question, it's turned the corner. I think it turned the
quarter in state and local government in the U.S. about two to three quarters ago. I think you're seeing it on a global
basis it has also turned the quarter in terms of growth. Fed is too early to call. We grew 3% this quarter, Pat Finn's
group did amazing on that, as well as on state and local government repeating the 9% number. This is the busy season,
so in the U.S. public sector, is probably 50% state and local, 50% federal.
In last quarter it was clearly the busy time for state and local, this quarter, as you said, is for federal. It's too early to
call. There are a lot of moving parts, as you all are aware there. I like the trends. It has moved consistently upwards in
the federal side of the business, but I'd say it's too early to say for sure that the market has turned as much as I would
like to see it.
And I want to verify something just before I give you numbers, in terms of the trend on state and local government.
Make sure got it right here. The federal, just to give you the balance, it started off Q4 last year -11%, Q1 of this fiscal
year 2013, -15%, then -5%, then -3%, then +3%. So this is the first positive quarter we've seen. Too early to call the

trend on that. The state and local government, however, started the year at 3%, then 7%, then 13%, then 9%. That's a
trend that I do feel comfortable with, barring a surprise in the economy calling.
So fed I would say is still a question mark. And this goes back to the inconsistencies. I think that we're going to
consistently gain market share in most all of our top 18 product families. It's just that we are having fits reading the
data. Just like our own economists are doing, hopefully we do better than they do, about interpreting where we need to
go. So that would be how I answer public sector. Federal, still – U.S. Federal still a question mark, but not down like
we saw before. At the extent we were seeing.

The next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark Sue>: Thank you. John, with all the data – Hi, John. With all the data that you have and the actions you're
taking today, does 5% to 7% growth become increasingly aspirational, or is it conditional? So when the economy does
well, Cisco will be in that band, but if not, Cisco will be below that band? And if we do see more economic
inconsistencies, is it possible that growth can actually turn negative and follow the trends in your backlog? Or should
we rather see it as the actions you're taking today more related to active portfolio pruning, and just cutting declining
businesses before they actually get worse?
<A - John T. Chambers>: So a bunch of questions. I'll try to go in reverse order. Again, the actions we're taking
today, the first goal is all around re-aligning resources. And so it's about a growth objective goal of putting resources
square where the growth's going to be, but if you're not going to be able to increase head count, by definition, you have
to move them. Some of them have the talent move over. Candidly, some of them we're going to have to hire with the
given expertise.
Second area on re-balancing the resource. Got to take out our middle-level management in terms of it's just not a large
enough span of control. We improved from what, 5.9 to about 6.9 the last two years. But that number needs to be much
higher, and this is the time where we need to get after span and layering. What I'm really after there is speed of
decisions, but more importantly, speed of implementation. Even when you push things down from the top, it can take
longer than it should in this new environment, which is moving at a much faster pace, and that's where we really enjoy
it.
In terms of the market momentum let me say it very specifically. Our product orders have steadily improved for four
quarters. It's just been slow. And in terms of the approach, that is not taking into consideration anything with
acquisitions up or down, or spinouts. So you compare apples to apples, we are clearly projecting that continuing into
Q1. We just do not have the benefit of NDS, which is what Frank said, it's two points in Q1, and we don't have the
benefit of Linksys, which is one point. And Sourcefire hasn't kicked in until later in the year. So you've got an issue
here where the acquisitions have helped us by two to three points, now they're not going to help us, and you've got an
issue on recurring revenues.
Nice way of saying, even in this environment, which is very mixed, very comfortable about our momentum, it's just not
fast enough. And I'm not going to let us miss the window of opportunity, which could get this company into trouble.
And I think we're doing this with very much proper focus on our customers, but also our shareholders and our
employees. The shareholder return and projections is good.
So 5% to 7%, very comfortable with. It's one that I would measure our leadership team here. It would not surprise me
at all if we go above it over the next couple of years. It would not surprise me if there are a couple quarters where we're
slightly below it. Given today's environment, I don't know anybody that's doing back flips in terms of their growth, and
most of our peers in the high tech industry, many of them are growing flat or negative. That's clearly not the case with
Cisco.

Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMC.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: I just had – I just wanted to clarify some of the commentary on order growth, John, and Frank, if I
could. You guys are talking about the year-over-year growth here being 4%, so that's flat year-over-year on last quarter.
Is it – were orders up sequentially? And can you give us any idea how much? I mean, it feels like maybe they were up
just a few percentage points sequentially, but I'd like to get clarification on that.
And then I also wondered if maybe you could drill down into the APAC order decline with a little bit more detail, help
us understand? You know, you gave us China and India, but what was the most surprising thing about APAC to you?
Was it a product area that was weaker? Or was it a particular country? Or are we just talking about across the region
sluggishness? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. In sequencing, the product order growth in Q3 was 4%, including obviously 2%
from Meraki – I'm sorry, not Meraki, from NDS. And the product order growth was 4% in this quarter, including NDS.
NDS will not be in Q1.
In terms of the sequence on the numbers, it actually rounded up a little bit, so it did continue on the line which has been
steadily improving, and we anticipate it continuing to steadily improve into Q1. So that's exactly why I wanted to say
very specifically apples-to-apples, it's just slowly increasing, but it's painful and it speaks to the inconsistencies in the
market.
In terms of sequential, Q4's always our most powerful quarter. It increases dramatically year-over-year from Q3 to Q4
in terms of sequencing numbers. This one was very much in line, so asking about your indirect question, are we seeing
sequentially the same data that would support what we're saying in terms of the year-over-year, yes we are. Q1 is
always down. So if I were to not give you specific numbers, but using Q3 to Q4 in double-digit increase, Q4 to Q1,
double-digit decrease. That's why you build a lot of backlog in Q4, and we did once again this year, although it was a
little bit more back-end loaded than we would like to see.
In terms of APAC, and the uniquenesses there, China is a little bit unique to Cisco because of some of the issues going
on which you all are aware of, but over there I think you've all seen the numbers on it. APAC in most of our peers'
environment has slowed. We're doing better in India than most of our peers. We're doing pretty well in the emerging
markets there. We're getting hit hard in Japan.
Japan was down in the teens, and this again has to do with our success the last several years in Japan, especially in
service providers. And it isn't a question of we're losing business, we just built out their networks with tremendous
capacity. And the great news is they're running smooth as can be. The bad news is we haven't got it loaded at the pace
that we want, and the CRS' are what we market them as. You just build them up, you multi-chassis them together, and
those suckers hum and produce it. So Japan is not a surprise that they are down in the teens, and when it's as big or
bigger than China in that, then you see the challenges of the two.

But APAC overall is just weak, and I think that's what you're seeing from our group. They're – I'm not going back flips
on any of the major countries there, other than India. But the emerging countries, the smaller emerging countries, we
saw reasonable growth on. Otherwise, you wouldn't have got the 8% total in emerging countries if you have your top
five which represent half of that in very low single digits.

Our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Jess I. Lubert>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the service business, which
decelerated for a third consecutive quarter and delivered growth well below the 9% to 11% range you've been targeting.
So while I understand you've had some difficult comps over the last few quarters, with your solution oriented approach
appearing to drive better product growth each of the last two quarters, I was hoping to understand how come we're not
seeing that drive better results in the service business? And perhaps you can help us understand if you expect the
service business to get back to your target range in fiscal 2014? And what are the keys to driving reacceleration there?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Gary, can you take that for us?
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Yeah, so...
<A - John T. Chambers>: Thanks, Jess.
<A - Gary B. Moore>: So, Jess, I mean first off 6% growth, 67.1% gross margin, this is a very important business for
Cisco. And as I said last quarter, our service revenue would be slower growing because of the slower core product
growth that we've seen for a number of quarters. But we see a solid opportunity relative to the business model, relative
to the new things that we're looking at and the long-term plans there.
So I'm very confident in our ability to get back to that long-term 9% to 11% growth over the next three to five years is
what we said in December. I actually see – we see very strong potential, but as the core product bookings reaccelerate,
which we see, services will follow that, normally, a couple of quarters behind. So as you see that core grow, better
attach rate and some of the programs that we have to drive even higher attach rate right now, we're very comfortable in
getting back there. So hopefully, that makes sense to you, but it's not – we're not surprised here, and I actually
mentioned it last quarter.
<A - John T. Chambers>: In terms of, this is a compound growth number we're talking about. We're not talking about
just spiking in and back down or spiking above and back into it. So both in our 5% to 7%, and 9% to 11% we expect
that to be on the average if we execute well. If we don't, we hold ourselves accountable for the results on. So we're not
sending a mixed message but it's going to take several quarters even with the economy picking up to get back to where
Gary and I will be more proud of the numbers which is a 10% give or take a point or two in terms of that approach.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Jess. Next question?

Next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Great. Thank you. John, I wanted ask about strengths in U.S. enterprise and commercial, what
the driver there is versus what you're seeing in emerging markets in Asia. Is this mostly – is the divergence mostly
macroeconomic or is there something else you can point to as a contributor?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Well, kind of the good news and part of the challenge is the U.S. economy is one of the – is
the strongest engine right now in the world as far as pulling the rest of the world and we all know GDP growth has been

projected decelerating here versus what we would have thought just one or two quarters ago in terms of the direction.
So it's a better number to work with, and that's part of it. But the real issue is, we're learning how to sell architectures
and solutions to our customer's needs and the numbers that I talked about with Brian, think about it for a moment.
In a business that is growing primarily as U.S. enterprise grew a 9% year-over-year and it's been in high single digits
for several quarters now. The number of million dollar deals in the pipeline is up 50%. They're selling solutions. That's
how you beat it. It doesn't matter if it's a different consumption model. It doesn't matter if it's IP as a service from
Amazon. It doesn't matter if it's individual companies trying to put together product solutions. And in that, that's where
you sell to the business leader as well as the CIO.
Now interesting enough, Alison Gleeson's 12% is very similar. She sells, if I remember right, Rob, almost as many
UCS' and new architectures including Cisco ONE in terms of leading edge in the commercial market and it grew at
12%. But she doesn't sell, again, the indirect part. She sells total architecture to respond to RFPs with our commercial
group, but it is a machine. Both of those average, as you can imagine, $10 million per sales rep in terms of the ability to
crank. And you will see us selectively add sales reps and SEs around the world. That goes back to rebalancing,
probably to the tune of 400 people in terms of sales reps and SEs to really go after these opportunities is our feel for the
market.
So the answer is they sell what our strengths are. They sell architectures, they sell solutions to customer needs, they
deliver on those, and they're often the number one IT partner within the organization.
Mel, you're giving me the signal that I talked a little bit too long. I want to close. First, unbelievably strong results. I
want to leave you with that message. In my view, I don't see an area that I think I'm overly concerned at that we
control. Within that, clearly inconsistency of GDP growth and the importance of moving rapidly to take advantage of
new opportunities so when you talk about workforce rebalancing, more than two-thirds of the reason for that is to align
to move very fast on new opportunities and get our mid-level management back to a number that will support our
growth objectives as we said.
We have strong momentum. I mentioned it probably in nine major categories. Mel, gave me a hard time about it being
too long, but thank you for bearing with me. That's the type of momentum we're going in with and it's very solid
execution, even though Gary, Frank, and I and Rob, would be critical of ourselves about what we have to do better, I
would argue very strongly we're out-executing our peers and we're winning in architectures and we're winning on new
trends that perhaps three or six months ago people were being concerned about and candidly, we are leading these areas
as opposed to play defense. We're going to be a disrupter and we're going to be the company on the offense.
So I'm very comfortable. I think if you look at the other five IT companies that Gartner has in their top six, and I think
we've shown this year in terms of our appreciation, return to shareholders, growth, market share, execution, we're
beating them all and we intend to as we move forward.
So, Mel, let me turn it back to you.
