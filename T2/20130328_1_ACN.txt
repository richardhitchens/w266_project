MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Accenture's Second Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings
Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.
[Operator instructions] And as a reminder this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference over to our host, Ms. K. C. McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.
K. C. McClure
Thank you, Katie, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2013 earnings announcement.
As Katie just mentioned, I'm K. C. McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre
Nanterme, our Chief Executive Officer; and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will then take you through the financial
details including the income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational metrics for the second
quarter. Pierre with then provide a brief update on our market positioning. Pam will then provide our business outlook
for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2013 and then we will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at
the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursement or net
revenue.
Some of the matters we'll discuss on the call are forward-looking including the business outlook. You should keep in

actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements and that such statements are not a
guarantee of our future performance. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic
conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed under the risk factors section of our annual

During our call today we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliation of those measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release
or on the Investor Relations section of the website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to
update information presented on the conference call.
Now let me turn the call to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, K. C., and thanks, everyone for joining us today. We are pleased with our results for the second quarter,
which were in line with our expectations. We continue to drive profitable growth and are investing in differentiated
services that are clearly resonating with the needs of our clients. Here are a few highlights.
We delivered very strong new bookings of $9.1 billion including record consulting bookings of $4.4 billion. Revenues
were $7.1 billion, up 4% in local currency including strong local currency revenue growth in outsourcing of 10%. And
we were particularly pleased with our double-digit revenue growth in both Financial Services and Health & Public
Service.
We delivered earnings per share of $1.65, on a GAAP basis, including the benefit of two items that Pam will talk about
when she takes you through the numbers. Absent the benefit of these items, earnings per share were $1. We increased
the operating income and expended operating margin on both a GAAP and adjusted basis.
We continued to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $5.6 billion. And we
continue to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Today we announced a semiannual cash dividend of $0.81 per share, which will bring total dividend payments for the
year to $1.62 per share, a 20% increase over last year. So, with the first half of the year behind us, I feel good about
where we are. And we remain well positioned to meet our outlook for the fiscal year.
Now let me hand it over to Pam, who will review the numbers in greater detail. Pam, over to you.
Pamela J. Craig
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for listening today. Let me tell you more about Accenture's fiscal 2013
second quarter financial results. Revenue growth was driven by year-over-year strength in three of our operating
groups, in outsourcing and geographically in the Americas. Profitability in the underlying business was excellent and
we delivered additional margin expansion this quarter. New bookings of over $9 billion reflect strong demand for
future business. The delivery was very solid and we are well positioned for the future.
Now let's go through the numbers. Unless I state otherwise all figures are U.S. GAAP except the items that are not part
of the financial statements or that are calculations. New bookings for the quarter were $9.1 billion, our second highest
level after the record in Q4 last year. Our bookings reflected a flat foreign exchange impact compared to new bookings
in the second quarter last year. Consulting bookings were $4.4 billion and outsourcing bookings were $4.7 billion.
Let me give you some bookings details starting with those record consulting bookings. In management consulting,
bookings were strong in the United States as well as in Asia Pacific and also in parts of Europe. We continue to see
client demand for transformational projects in operation, customer relationship management and talent and organization
as well as a pickup in demand for risk management.

Our bookings in technology consulting moderated this quarter and they primarily reflected projects to drive cost
reduction in the data center, network and desktop infrastructures of our clients. We see lots of opportunity ahead and
have strengthened our leadership focus on the technology transformation agendas at our client.
System integration bookings reflected strong continued demand to modernize and upgrade installed ERP systems as
well as an increase in demand for industry specific systems across the major platforms. Emerging technologies are
often part of the mix, as we are doing more and more to help our clients integrate Software-as-a-Service, cloud
platforms, mobile applications and digital solutions.
Turning to outsourcing, our technology outsourcing bookings were very strong in Q2 as our clients continue to seek
solutions for driving operational efficiencies and flexible cost effective sourcing. Our Global Delivery Network
continues to be very well positioned to meet the increased demand for such solutions. These bookings reflect strong
demand across all five of our operating groups and geographically in the Americas and Asia-Pacific.
BPO bookings in Q2 reflected continued demand for our cross industry offerings, especially finance and accounting
and for our industry specific solutions in communications and banking. Additionally, we had bookings of over $100
million at 14 clients with all five operating groups represented.
So reflecting on bookings overall, we feel good about the strength in demand for our services, particularly given our
very strong bookings in two of the last three quarters. Our improved position in contracted revenue makes our visibility
better. This bodes well for revenue growth over the longer term. At the same time, the conversion of consulting
bookings to revenue at a slower rate, a trend that began a year ago, and continuing – and is therefore continuing to
impact our revenue growth short term.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the second quarter were $7.06 billion, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars and
in local currency over the same period last year. Our previously guided range of $6.9 billion to $7.15 billion of
assumed a foreign exchange impact of negative 1%. There was $55 million more in U.S. dollar revenues resulting from
a more favorable actual foreign exchange of 0.2% – negative 0.2%.
Our revenues of $7.06 billion was up slightly below the midpoint of the recalculated range. Consulting revenues were
$3.75 billion as compared to $3.78 billion last year, flattish as expected, negative 0.5% in local currency growth
actually and rounding to a 1% decline in both U.S. dollars and local currency.
We had single digit local currency growth in the Americas and were down modestly in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. As I
just mentioned, the slower conversion of bookings continued this quarter and influenced our consulting revenue
growth. That said, we did see good sequential growth on a net revenue per network day basis in consulting in Q2.
Outsourcing revenues were $3.31 billion, an increase of 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency with strong
double-digit growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific and modest growth in EMEA. EMEA growth was impacted
significantly by the ramp down of one contract in CMT.
Now let me give you some highlights of revenue growth in our operating group. Health & Public Service revenues
increased 13% in local currency reflecting strong growth in health again this quarter with strength in both consulting
and outsourcing and across the three geographic regions. We also had good demand in public service this quarter in
both consulting and outsourcing driven by strong growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. We continue to reposition
the public service business in EMEA.
Financial Services revenues increased 10% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected very significant growth
driven primarily in the Americas across all industry groups particularly in insurance and in banking. Outsourcing
growth in EMEA was also strong in banking and insurance. Consulting revenues grew slightly driven by strong growth
in Asia-Pacific across all industries and very significant insurance growth in the Americas. This was partially offset by
a consulting decline in EMEA as we continue to see less demand for smaller projects there.
The Products operating group had local currency revenue growth of 6% driven by strong growth in outsourcing in both
technology and BPO in all industry groups and across all three geographic regions. Consulting revenues were flat with
puts and takes and strong revenue growth in our pharma life sciences industry. Overall in Products, the Americas grew

double-digits, EMEA returned to positive growth this quarter and Asia-Pacific declined slightly year-over-year.
Resources net revenue decreased 3% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected slight growth overall with
strong growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific partially offset by a decline in the Americas. Consulting revenues decreased
in all three geographic regions and most industries where we have recently completed a few large ERP programs.
Consulting growth was significant in chemicals with ERP ramping up. We are sharpening our strategy to expand
Resources portfolio and our services particularly in the Americas. And we thus expect that Resources' growth in both
consulting and outsourcing will be challenged near term.
Communications, Media and Technology revenue decreased 4% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues reflected
slight growth driven by strength in the Americas. EMEA declined primarily due to the expected significant ramp down
from one contract.
Consulting revenues declined in all three geographic regions particularly in Asia-Pacific and EMEA where certain
clients are reducing or deferring investments due to ongoing economic challenges impacting their businesses.
Significant consulting growth in high-tech in the Americas continued as clients increased their focus on building
capabilities and enhancing their competitiveness. We continue to anticipate that CMT will return to growth by the end
of the fiscal year.
Now, let me comment briefly on our geographies. In the Americas, we were very pleased with the performance,
particularly the U.S. which posted double-digit growth.
EMEA declined very slightly this quarter, less than 1%. Although a handful of countries declined, we are otherwise
holding our own in this part of the world with growth in most of the countries.
Asia Pacific grew less this quarter and we expect this trend to continue. Q2 included a decline in Japan, which was
primarily in CMT, where certain clients in the high-tech industry there in particular, have significant challenges in their
businesses right now.
In summary, our revenue results reflected strength across many parts of our businesses as well as some areas where we
are sharpening our strategy in order to reignite growth.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 31.6% compared with 31.1% for the same period last year, a 50
basis point increase. This result reflected improved contract profitability, primarily in outsourcing.
Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was $834 million or 11.8% of net revenues compared with 11.4% of net
revenues for the second quarter last year reflecting higher costs to replenish our pipeline.
General and administrative expense was $456 million or 6.5% of net revenue, compared with 6.7% of net revenues for
the second quarter last year, a 20 basis point decrease as we keep driving efficiencies in our cost base as we grow our
business.
In addition, we had an unusual positive item this quarter, a $224 million benefit from a reduction in reorganization
liability that we had established in connection with Accenture's transition to a corporate structure in 2001. This is a
non-cash item and at this point the reorganization liabilities established 12 years ago are almost behind us.
So GAAP operating income was $1.16 billion in the second quarter. Excluding the reorganization item I just
mentioned, operating income for the second quarter was $940 million or 13.3% of net revenue, up 20 basis points,
compared with Q2 last year.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was negative 0.5% compared with positive 20.5% for the second quarter last year.
We had a second unusual non-cash item, also with a large positive impact, a $243 million benefit from final
determinations related to prior year U.S. federal tax liabilities. Excluding the benefits of this final determination item as
well as the reorganization item, the effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was 24.8%.

Net income was $1.19 billion for the second quarter and it was $714 million for the same quarter last year. Excluding
the two unusual items just mentioned, net income for the second quarter was $720 million, an increase of 1%.
Diluted earnings per share was $1.65 compared with $0.97 in the second quarter last year. Excluding the two unusual
items, EPS for the second quarter were $1.
Let me walk down the components of the $0.68 year-over-year increase in EPS. So firstly, without the unusual items,
the increase is made up of $0.06 from higher revenue and operating results, $0.01 from higher non-operating income,
$0.02 from a lower share count, partially offset by $0.06 from a higher effective tax rate. These net to a $0.03 EPS
increase before the two unusual positive items which were $0.34 from final determinations of prior year tax liabilities
and $0.31 from a reduction in reorganization liabilities. Together these two unusual items generated an additional $0.65
for a total year-over-year increase in earnings per share of $0.68 in the quarter.
Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continue to be industry-leading in a difficult environment. They were
31 days, down slightly from 32 days last quarter and up from 29 days in Q2 last fiscal year. Free cash flow for the
quarter was $544 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $634 million, net of property and
equipment additions of $90 million. Lower free cash flow this year was driven primarily by a lower sequential decrease
in DSOs from Q1 to Q2 compared with the same period last year.
Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at February 28th was $5.6 billion compared with $6.6 billion at August
31st last year. The current level reflects the cash returned to shareholders so far through repurchases and dividends. The
U.S. pension contribution we funded last quarter and some acquisitions we've made this year.
Moving to some other key operational metrics. We ended the quarter with a global head count of about 261,000 people
and we now have approximately 170,000 people in our Global Delivery Network.
In Q2 our utilization was 88%, consistent with Q1. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations was 11%,
consistent with Q1 and down from 12% in Q2 last fiscal year. Lastly, we continue to expect that at least 50,000 people
will join our company this year.
Let me wrap up by commenting on our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and
dividends. In the second quarter we repurchased or redeemed approximately 8.8 million shares for $609 million at an
average price of $69.43 per share. Year-to-date we've purchased 12.1 million shares for approximately $830 million at
an average price of $68.69 per share. At February 28th, we had approximately $3.6 billion of share repurchase
authority remaining.
Finally, earlier today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared our second semi-annual cash dividend in the
amount of $0.81 per share. This dividend will be paid on May 15th, 2013. This is in line with the semi-annual dividend
$0.81 per share we paid in November and represents a $0.135 or 20% increase over the dividend we paid in May last
year.
Now, let me turn the call back to Pierre to give you an update on some exciting things going on in our business and
then I'll finish up with our business outlook.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, Pam. Our highly diverse portfolio of business, combined with our industry expertise and broad technology
capabilities is positioning us very well to see the opportunities in the marketplace.
Our clients continue to focus on large scale transformation and we are seeing strong demand for our services. This is
evident in our excellent new bookings for the quarter, as we are helping our clients try tangible and measurable value,
particularly in this fast changing technology environment.
Our latest Technology Vision report, identifies to trends that are having a big impact across different industries and
explores how companies can use technology to improve business results. One of these trends is the convergence of

social media, mobile computing, analytics and the cloud, which is transforming the way businesses operate and this is
driving demand for our services.
In mobility, we recently helped a leading global pharmaceutical company, move sales and service from traditional
on-premise delivery channels to the cloud and onto mobile devices for its global sales team of more than 25,000
people.
In analytics and mobility, we are helping a global industrial equipment company, design and implement a telematics
capability that will allow its customers to monitor the equipment in real time. Equipment users can now immediately
identify parts that need maintenance which will reduce downtime and increase revenue growth for our client.
And in cloud, we are creating efficiencies and cost savings for a large government agency by developing a private
internal cloud for systems that process nearly $100 billion in transactions annually. Accenture's industry expertise
continue to be a key differentiator and we are driving growth with our unique end-to-end services, which combine our
management consulting technology and business process outsourcing capabilities.
In addition to providing market-leading services across more than 40 industries, we continue to prioritize our
investments around specific industries where we see an opportunity for greater return.
Three of these industries where our focused approach is clearly paying off are insurance, banking and health, which
contributed significantly to the strong performance of our Financial Services and Health & Public Service operating
groups this quarter.
In insurance, one of our key wins in the quarter valued at more than $200 million is to help the leading U.S. property
and casualty insurer with a major transformation of its operating model. We are helping the client to accelerate growth
by reengineering sales across all product lines and channels through one of the largest Salesforce.com implementations.
In banking, we are using process automation to help the leading bank in Italy transform its accounts payable and
procurement operations. We are using Accenture finance and risk management services to help migrate to client's
legacy applications to SAP. Streamlining invoice and payable processes and then running them on a managed service
basis. The goal is to deliver a sustained reduction in operational cost of as much as 25%.
In health a great example is Accenture Clinical Services and the work we are doing for Trinity Health, a leading
operator of hospitals in the United States. We are helping Trinity leverage analytics to better coordinate and standardize
patient care and improve patient outcomes. In addition to cost savings and safety improvements, Trinity is already
realizing many important patient gains, including a reduction in patient mortality from sepsis of almost 20%.
We continue to focus on our gross markets, which as you know, include our priority emerging markets as well as
mature underpenetrated markets.
I continue to be extremely pleased with the strong performance of our business in the United States. With double digit
growth, we are gaining market share and we are benefited from our recent investments in mortgage processes,
insurance and life sciences.
And of course, we remain focused on operational efficiency to drive profitable growth, while applying rigor and
discipline across the board, to increase our competitiveness and expand our margins through pricing, cost and
productivity improvements. This gives us the capacity to reinvest in the business, to extend our differentiation into
marketplace.
The overall macroeconomic environment remains challenging, and there is still a considerable amount of uncertainty,
especially in Europe, Japan and to some extent Brazil. We continue to watch this very carefully and to assess any
potential impact on our own business. So we remain agile and flexible in the way we are deploying our investments
around the world.
With that said, we continue to execute well against our growth strategy and we continue to focus on gaining market
share.

With that I will turn the call back to Pam who will provide our business outlook for the third quarter and the full fiscal
year. Over to you Pam.
Pamela J. Craig
Thank you, Pierre. Now let me give you our update on how we expect to land fiscal year 2013. As I mentioned in the
last two quarters, we knew that revenue growth would be lower in the first half of fiscal 2013, particularly in
consulting. And overall we are where we thought we'd after the first half.
With our strong bookings positioning us well for the future, we expect the growth will now start to gradually pick up.
And as always, we remain focused on driving overall profitable growth in our broad-based global portfolio.
Let's start with our outlook for the next quarter's revenue and then go through the elements of our annual outlook. For
the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.25 billion to $7.5 billion. This assumes
a foreign exchange impact of negative 2.5% compared to the third quarter in fiscal 2012.
Turning to the full fiscal year 2013, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we assume
the impact of foreign exchange on our results in U.S. dollars to continue to be negative 1% for fiscal 2013 compared to
fiscal 2012.
First, net revenues, based on how bookings have been converting to revenues this year, we now expect net revenue
growth in local currency to land in the lower half of our previous range of 5% to 8%. Our new bookings, we continue
to target to be in the range of $31 billion to $34 billion for the full fiscal year 2013 and anticipate that they will trend
toward the upper half of the range.
We now expect GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 14.9% to 15% for fiscal 2013. Excluding the impact of
the reorganization benefit in Q2, we continue to expect the adjusted range to be 14.1% to 14.2%, a 20 basis point to 30
basis point expansion over fiscal 2012.
Tax rate: we now expect our annual effective tax rate to be the range of 19% to 20%. Excluding the impact from the
reorganization and final determination items in Q2, we continue to expect the adjusted range to be 26% to 27% for
fiscal 2013.
EPS: we now expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.89 to $4.97. Excluding the impact from the Q2
reorganization and final determination items, we continue to expect the adjusted range to be $4.24 to $4.32 or 10% to
12% growth this fiscal year.
Cash flow: for the full fiscal year we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5
billion with property and equipment additions to be approximately $400 million. We continue to expect free cash flow
to be in a range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion.
Finally, we remain committed to return a substantial portion of the cash we generate to shareholders. In fiscal 2013, we
continue to target a return of at least $3.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases and to reduce the weighted
average diluted shares outstanding by about 2%.
In conclusion, despite the fact that there continue to be mixed signals all over the global economy; we are staying
focused on driving the revenue growth we need for the rest of this year.
Before Pierre and I take your questions, there is one other thing I would like to update you on. I have made the decision
to turn over the CFO reigns to my successor in a few months effective July 1st and to retire from Accenture at the end
of the fiscal year to pursue some new things.
It's been a great 34-year run for me including almost seven years as CFO. It's a good time for me to do this. This
company continues to be well positioned for long-term financial success. My successor, whom Pierre will tell you
about in a minute, is fully prepared and ready.

The finance team that supports us is first class in every way and for me it just feels like it's time. It's that simple and I'm
grateful to have had the opportunity to work first with Bill and then Pierre to share our outlook and how we are doing
with all of you every quarter for the past 26.
It's truly been a privilege to be CFO of this great company and as I look back on my career, I know that it is the people
of Accenture and the work we do for clients every day that makes this company so special.
Of course, I will continue to work closely with Pierre and with my successor, whom I know well and trust fully to
ensure a smooth transition. Pierre?
Pierre Nanterme
Thanks, Pam. Just let me take this opportunity to thank you for your dedication, for the tremendous contribution you
have made Accenture's growth and success. You've always been committed to doing the right thing for our people, for
our company, for our clients and for our shareholders and it has been a real pleasure for me to work with you,
especially since becoming CEO.
As Chief Financial Officer, you have built a world-class finance organization and your focus on rigorous financial
discipline has contributed to our strong performance over the years. Of course, a key part of this has been grooming
your own successor, and I'm very pleased to announce that David Rowland, who has been a longstanding leader in our
finance organization, will become our CFO on July 1st.
David has decades of experience at Accenture and a deep understanding of our business. I have known David for many
years and I know that he is absolutely committed to ensuring that we continue to create value for our clients and our
shareholders. I am confident that David will be an outstanding CFO and in true Accenture style we will have a smooth
transition.
With that, let's move to the Q&A. And Pam and I are ready to take your questions on the quarter and our outlook for
the year.
K. C. McClure
Thanks, Pierre. I'd ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to
ask a question. Katie, would you provide instructions for those on the call?
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Great. Thanks. Pam, congrats on the retirement. Thanks for everything. I definitely always
enjoyed working with you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thanks, Tien-tsin.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Congrats to David as well in the new role. So, let me start by asking obviously the bookings
are very, very solid. I think you said the bookings are going to track to the higher end against the revenue at the lower
end. So is it safe to say that the primary driver of moving revenue guidance to low end, is it really just to slower
consulting revenue conversion? Is there something else that we should consider there?

<A - Pamela J. Craig>: There really isn't. It is that simple, Tien-tsin, in the sense that consulting is just ramping more
gradually. There's fewer of the smaller deals in there and that converged after and that trend has continued even beyond
where we thought it would. And so we do need more bookings actually. And so we are trending – and we are indeed
trending toward the upper end of the range.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Okay, great. Now, that's encouraging. So just as my follow-up, just a couple of small ones.
Just – can you help us what the book-to-bill trend and as we sort of exit this fiscal year going into next just directionally
is there something different we should consider, especially in consulting? And then also just in the second half for
consulting revenue. Can we expect return to positive growth in the third quarter and something higher in the fourth
quarter given what you see today?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: So first on the book-to-bill. Just based on this complexion of the consulting revenue, we are –
we do believe we need to be higher in that range of 1.0 to 1.1 that we've talked about with you for years. So right now,
we are looking and it is this quarter 1.1. Of course if the smaller shorter-term stuff comes back into the mix in a greater
proportion at some point then it might move around in there, but you're right at this point that's what we see.
In terms of the consulting revenue growth rate, we really do think the way we'll eke out positive consulting growth in
Q3 and then it will be at least low positive single-digit and that trend would continue in Q4.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Al right, great. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Congrats again.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay, great. Hey, and Pam, I definitely wish you the best, very impressive career at
Accenture and you've definitely put together a world-class finance organization. I'm sure everybody there will miss you
and I think The Street will as well. So thanks again.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you, Rod.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Sure. And, so, question here on the consulting outlook. It sounds like the small deals are
still soft, and I'm wondering whether that is purely a function of softness in the market or if there are competitive
dynamics that are playing an increased role in being able to win some of the smaller less transformational type
consulting deals that are out there?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: It does. Rod, to us it is a market phenomenon. We see it primarily in Europe, where we
traditionally had particularly in some operating groups like Financial Services a lot of that kind of smaller consulting
work. And so it's not that it's going down at this point, it's actually staying pretty stable, but just as a proportion of the
bookings, it is smaller and we do see it primarily as a market phenomenon more that clients just don't sort of gravitate
to that stuff as much as other things.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And just add a color on this, I mean, indeed just as volume is remaining for Accenture stable
and so it's just a proportion we see changing, but we are starting to be encouraged by the healthy pipeline for this type
of opportunities. So we're starting to see some things happening. Again, volume stable, proportion a little bit lower, it is
not shrinking at all and the pipeline is showing some good signs.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Particularly in management consulting.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Correct
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: All right, great. We've had a lull in management consulting, so it's good to see that looking
up. So, hey, on the booking side, given the strong bookings in the February quarter, I should ask if duration rose
meaningfully on a year-over-year or quarter-to-quarter basis and if you could answer the duration question for both the

consulting segment and the outsourcing segment? And then I've got a quick question about the May quarter bookings
outlook.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, the duration has stayed pretty stable Rod and in the sense we were sort of looking in all
those metrics, aging, velocity etcetera and it's all pretty stable.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay, great. So you had a very strong August quarter 2012 bookings. You had some
softness in November, because you were seemingly replenishing the pipeline and then it looks like that pipeline
replenishment paid off in February with the stronger bookings. How do we think about the May quarter? Is the May
quarter another quarter of pipeline replenishment or are you still seeing deals ripe to be signed with another strong May
quarter on the horizon here?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, we do have the pipeline replenishment and that's been going well during this month. So,
I mean if I just wanted to give you just some sense, I think the bookings will be higher than they were in Q1 and not as
great as they were in Q2.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: All right, great. Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Hey. Thanks. Pam, also want to extend my congratulations and I wish you the best. Thanks
for everything.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Listen, just want to jump in on the geographic mix, I mean, we saw some weakness in Europe.
It looked like Asia was little bit slower as well, is there anything we should read into any sort of transition on the
segment there – the geographic segment? Is it just really more of the same; is it timing or anything we should focus on,
any weakness developing in that region we should be worried about?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, I mean Asia Pacific as you know is a big place and there's a lot of different things that
I'm going to let Pierre give a little color, but let me just give you some number stuff and then do that, but – so we have
countries that we're clearly trying to develop like China, that has a high growth rate. Places like India, etcetera which,
where the growth is good. Then we have the more mature markets like Japan where we did see some isolated decline
which was in CMT this quarter, and – but we have a decent size business there. So it had an impact. And then there's
places like Australia, which had just phenomenal growth recently and we do see that coming a little off. So, sort of the
mix yield next to something. It's a little positive, it was 2%, but I think in terms of the positioning for the future, it's
shaping up nicely, but let me let Pierre give you some color.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, just to add on this, I mean first we continue to be extremely pleased with what we see in
the U.S. and that's very important for Accenture as you know United States is our single largest market. So that's very
good for us. In Europe, I mean, Europe you all know the complexity of the macroeconomic environment and I think we
are holding on our own quite well and we have several of our large markets even growing in Q2 in Europe.
When you look at APAC, it's a collection of different markets and indeed Pam said it very well. We had some very
specific situation I would say in Japan and we have this Australian compare as well. But overall just to add a color on
this, we had record bookings this quarter in Asia Pacific and we maintained a healthy pipeline. So I think directionally,
I think our geographies are moving in the right direction, of course with a different pace, reflecting some different
specific situations here and there.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: All right. That's helpful. So it sounds like it's sort of similar also on timing in terms of
bookings being strong, but should catch up also on revenue a little later on?

<A - Pamela J. Craig>: That's right, Darrin.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: All right. Just one quick follow-up, now on the outsourcing side, I guess there has been a few
quarters of deceleration on growth on outsourcing. It also seems like there is a bit of a shift in terms of consulting,
obviously being longer term as we talked about earlier in Tien-tsin's question also there with book-to-bill. Are some of
the contracts that you used to think would be an outsourcing sort of shifting gears, are you just positioning I mean to
the consulting side or are clients actually moving more elements into more discretionary – more development type
work that are – that would now be considered something more – have more elements of consulting than they used to,
that previously would have been in the outsourcing area?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: No, I mean if anything, outsourcing continues to be strong and we've had 10 quarters or so of
double-digit growth and we do see that moderating a little bit, but the pipeline is very strong and healthy and certainly
outsourcing as a business and an area of demand continues to evolve very nicely. I mean what's happening in IT
services, as it evolved to more managed services and just the potential and in BPO is very strong. We've made some
acquisitions there, et cetera. So, we feel really good about the outsourcing business.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: All right, good. Yeah, that's all I need to know. Thanks, Pam.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi. I just wanted to clarify the guidance for revenue at the lower end of the range and I guess
let me ask you in a different way. What – is there anything that's actually changed over the last three months or is it
such that nothing has actually changed and the market continues to be soft and you expected a pick up?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Sorry. Just ask that one more time, Bryan. I just want to make sure I understand your nuance
here.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: I'm curious to know what's changed, if you look at it from the last three months since you last
guided and maybe nothing changed, the environment remains pretty much the same in consulting and you didn't see the
pick-up in the revenue or don't expect the pick-up in the revenue anymore because the market isn't better. I'm just
trying to figure out the slight nuance, the lower revenue growth in consulting, what's really causing that or what's
different from what you expected originally?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I think in terms of what we expected six months ago, we did expect that we would turn to
growth in the second half in consulting faster than we are. So it's just a little more gradual. And I would say it's similar
to how we felt three months ago.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I would just confirm. I do not see any change. So, let me be clear with that, in any pattern. It
is just indeed, we continue to see the conversion of consulting booking to revenue at a slower rate; something, as Pam
mentioned, began about a year ago, we to some extent had some expectation that we had an anniversary in this Q2
quarter, and this trend of conversion at a slower rate is continuing and therefore it's impacting our revenue growth
short-term. So what we see is just a more gradual trajectory but we do not see any structural change on anything.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. No, that's helpful. And then Pierre, are we seeing an inflection point yet? Or a bigger
appetite for the market to move more to cloud services?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, I mean this trend, I mean, continues, I would say, nicely. Again, I do not see anything
that would qualify as dramatic. I'm very pleased with our performance in terms of cloud, but I would add mobility as
well, everything going digital, all of this is moving at a good pace. It's driving a significant growth in those areas for
Accenture. Now, I do not see a kind of dramatic point of inflection, if you will. I think this market is picking up. It's
still early days. I think there is more to come in those different businesses in the coming decade and it's just moving
nicely.

movements and the impact to the numbers?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Absolutely, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Congratulations.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you very much. And also I just want to point out one thing that – sort of got passed a
note here as we're sitting here is, just in terms of we did point towards the lower half of the guidance in the 5% to 8%
and that really is just because at this point in time as we look forward it just is more clear that it's going to be the lower
half.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, helpful. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Great. Hey, Pam, since we have one last chance, can we get your initial view on fiscal 2014
right now?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: There we go. We knew there would be – we knew there would be one of you, and if we had
taken bets on who it would've been, probably you would have popped to the top of the list, Julio.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Congratulations.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: And I'm just going to say sorry to see you leave, but we're looking forward to working with
David as well.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Absolutely.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: I guess, just real quickly, I mean, I think most of the questions have been asked around sort
of the triangulating between bookings and the lower-end number. I guess maybe from the way that we think about the
model more bottom-up, if you think about the head count growth. I think you did say the 50,000 was still in line, which
I guess would suggest in the back half of the year you would have to have a pretty big ramp in head count. Any
particular drivers there in terms of where you would expect to see that head count growth continue to come from?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well it's primarily the Global Delivery Network. And as you know from the growth that we're
seeing there, is that this has really become sort of an incredibly diverse group of people around the world that not only
do IT, but really we have doctors, we have nurses, we have people doing very sophisticated analytics. So this is really
our focus and delivery is really building up that network. And then being – having the right size of our workforces
locally to combine in with that. So the strategy is the same, but you are going to see more growth in the GDN.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Okay. And then on the SI component of the GDN. I know about a year ago or so when you
guys laid out some plans for SI growth on the GDN side. How far along are we there? Is that going to continue its pace
as well?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, it's going along as planned.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Okay. I guess just more thematically, one of the sort of, I guess, questions that we typically
get around the growth of SaaS, the growth of cloud and, theoretically, this coupled with more offshore growth in
Global Delivery should be having, I guess, a negative effect in the overall size of bookings and bookings awards. But in
fact, when you look at the bookings results that you guys are putting together, the numbers are coming in much, much
higher, but we are not getting it converted to SaaS. I'm just trying to draw some sort of – some cross-links between
more Global Delivery and maybe more sort of SaaS and cloud-based work. I mean is that stuff just – is it smaller

overall, but there could be more duration? I'm just trying to find a sort of a link between this concern that this new work
is just not going to add as much revenue but the bookings don't seem to tell the story.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: You're absolutely correct. And I would just like to refer that why we are very pleased to
announce this – one of our major win this quarter with this leading U.S. property and casualty insurer more than $200
million, which is going to be one of the largest Salesforce.com implementations.
So I think that's what that is. We are transforming sales operation. We're not only implementing Software-as-a-Service.
And, so, indeed even if the strict SI implementation of the Software-as-a-Service might have an impact on the effort
overall as reflected with that illustration. The overall effort to do a Salesforce transformation or a sales transformation
even based on Salesforce.com is still representing a significant transformation on investment including SI. So I think
that's a good illustration to your question.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: And just as Paul – I mean that's just a great example, right. And as Paul Daugherty in October
pointed out is that this kind of new work implementing the new technologies is we do see those kinds of projects at
least as large over time. But they are instilled a little differently, right. They don't necessarily have these big giant
development ramp up and then ramp down, it's a little more gradual. So I think it sort of plays into this whole trend as
well.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Congratulations, Pam.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you, Julio.

The next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Good morning. The $9 billion in bookings was about $1 billion above what most
analysts modeled. So can you talk about whether that was also above your internal expectations and given the size of
upside talk about some of the areas of strength whether it'd be project types or geographies?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: We always have high expectations, so we're extremely pleased with $9 billion, but we are
never complacent. So I'm extremely pleased, but I'm not complacent. I mean, we need to drive the business for
profitable growth and this is what we are doing and it's all starting with bookings. The bookings are our revenues for
the future, we are building contracting revenues what we, in the past, we called backlog. And – but when you look at
the areas of strength as we mentioned, definitely I would say that it's been the quarter of Financial Services.
I don't want to always mention my prior operating group, but it was indeed a quiet of a high mark this quarter around
Financial Services, banking, insurance; I mentioned one of our largest sales. But what is interesting is what Pam
mentioned, 14 sales over $100 million across all five operating groups.
So indeed, we can mention Financial Services, they're going to be pleased this quarter, but I think across the board, I
would please to refer to – health's continued to do extremely well. We're very strong in products from a booking
standpoint. So that would be maybe the three operating groups I would describe, and then the good bookings in
consulting, but these – those – these 14 sales over $100 million across the five is probably for me a great source of
satisfaction.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: So, and then as a follow up, you mentioned several times throughout the call the lower
conversion of consulting revenue and that's been a topic for couple of quarters. Can you talk a little bit more about why
this is occurring and clearly the customers have decided to harness an opportunity, they've signed a deal, they're
moving forward but they're clearly moving through the stages of these transactions or projects slower than expected.
Can you talk about why that's happening?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, Katy, let's just break it down a little bit. First of all, I think that there is this – in the
bookings every quarter, in the consulting bookings ever quarter there is a mix of things. And so the first thing that's

impacting it is in the mix of how the overall set of bookings converts to revenue, when you have less of the lower – of
the smaller stuff that converts fast than that just works the average, right? And so that's pulling – so the higher volume
of the bigger and longer stuff is pulling that average up.
And then I think in terms of that work, we do see, and that things are being arranged not as the sort of giant consulting
projects but more in phases and more chunks and so that too I think just influences how the stuff then bleeds into
revenue. So they're the same size but it's just that buying patterns are overall continuing to evolve and we see that in our
portfolio of bookings.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay. So there's a mix shift in duration and then with the separate phases of contracts I guess it's
a little more difficult to forecast?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Is that right? Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: But on the other end it is giving us more visibility.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: So that's an interesting situation where indeed this longer duration, which as well is linked to
the nature of the programs which are more transformational by nature. So, you need to put transformation with time.
There is no transformation you can drive in the short-term, that requires some times.
So we've seen the duration, which I think is more linked structurally to the nature of the business, which from that
direction is good and has definitely given us more visibility in our business and more backlog moving forward. So, we
need to get through this transition, if you will, in term of pace of short-term growth and as Pam mentioned, we are, in
the back-end of the year, we expect to see a consulting growth in the single-digit as mentioned by Pam.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay. Thanks, and congrats on the retirement, Pam.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you, Katy.

And our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Thank you. Pam, let me add my congratulations as well and then all the best for the future.
And, David, welcome. So at the risk of flogging a dead horse here, I just want to go back one more time to the small
versus large contracts and the dichotomy there. Could you provide us some idea of maybe how important are small
versus large in terms of magnitude in terms of the contract, is it 15% of the total, 20% of the total? Is there any
particular focus on specific verticals? And I think competitively as well, I know the question was asked before, is it –
that in the large contracts you maybe see more of IBM but in the smaller ones you might see the Indian guys, any
information there?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, I'll comment on the, you say what industries? I mean, it is in Europe and historically
some of our businesses did have higher proportions of these in their mix of bookings and particularly in Europe and I
mention Financial Services they had a high proportion of those, so there is some of that. And again when you think
about the transformation that's happening in Europe in banking and that sort of thing, this all just makes sense in terms
that those buying patterns would change. So I can at least give you that much. I mean we're not – we don't give out the
numbers in terms of how these things – proportionately, but just as a proportion of the total bookings, they are stable
but a lower proportion because bookings are up.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Okay. Got it. And with regards to EMEA, which countries in EMEA? Is it the normal
suspect, I guess Benelux, weak for a while and maybe France weakening here. Are those the countries that you sort of
mentioned as weak?

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: So, as you mentioned France, I'm almost thinking that as a personal attack so...
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: France is actually good.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I have to respond on this. And I am extremely pleased, delighted to communicate that France
is back with some growth in Q2 but more seriously, indeed, when you consider the overall macroeconomic situation in
Europe and we all know the challenges in term of economic recession in most of the part plus all the Cyprus and other
things happening almost every day. It's very encouraging for us to see that countries such as Germany, and I got to
mention the kind of big one, big practices, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, France, Spain.

<Q - David M. Togut>: Thank you. It's good to be back. Just shifting gears, if you could give us some insight into
pricing across your range of services and maybe drill down into consulting and outsourcing and then contrast that to the
wage increases you are paying in major practices?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I mean overall, pricing is stable. I might say maybe – I would say stable plus.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Right.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I mean you will characterize the plus, but I think it's slightly more than stable, but overall it's
stable. We used to say with pockets of pricing power, if you will, but I am feeling comfortable with our pricing
situation. And I would characterize into pricing plus. I don't know whether we can give more details Pam on...
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: No, I mean that's exactly right. I mean when you look at the contracts margin that are up
particularly in outsourcing, as it was reflected in gross margin, I mean part of that is pricing, right, that we are able to
get that. Now we are characterizing it as stable overall because as you can imagine across this giant business of all
these things there are some puts and takes but I think stable plus is a good way to characterize it.
<Q - David M. Togut>: You mentioned contract margins were up in outsourcing but you didn't specifically address
consulting. Can you provide insights into that business?

<A - Pamela J. Craig>: They were up as well, but just not as much. Yeah, it's a little more marginal, it just wasn't you
know – but they were certainly not down.
<Q - David M. Togut>: Got it. And then finally, on the wage trends across the business?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, as you know, we put in our salary increases primarily September 1 and we do adjust
those during the year if we need to but we're just starting the planning actually for what we will do next year.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, but if you reflect on what we did last year we did a good job in setting the wages at the
right place, in absorbing reasonably rapidly in Q1 in the first half of the year as reflected as well in the margin. So it's
what we continue to have an eye to call rigor and discipline. I'm called Mr. R&D in Accenture I would expect that will
be Mr. Research and Development, but it's more rigor and discipline. But I think we are – we know how to manage our
costs and it's very important in such a competitive environment we need to be competitive. So we will never give up in
our competitiveness and we're going to continue to invest in our differentiation.
<Q - David M. Togut>: Understood. Thank you very much.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thanks, David.
Pierre Nanterme
Thanks a lot, David, and thanks all of you for joining us on the call today. As you heard, this call today was somewhat
special for Accenture, but, to be honest, special for me as well with Pam's announcement.
Now, coming back to the business and in closing, I am pleased overall with where we are. As we said at a time where
economic volatility and uncertainty are still prevalent, we continue to manage our business with a permanent focus on
driving profitable growth. We are leveraging our global footprint and our unique end-to-end transformational
capabilities to provide highly relevant business solutions to our clients. We are investing in our future. And we remain
totally committed to delivering value for clients and shareholders.
And finally, with 261,000 highly qualified and highly dedicated men and women around the world, frankly, I feel
confident in the ability of Accenture to continue to win in the marketplace. We look forward to talking with you again
next quarter. And in the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to call K. C. All the best.
