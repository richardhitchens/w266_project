MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Celeste Mellet Brown
Good morning. This is Celeste Mellet Brown, Head of Investor Relations and welcome to our third quarter earnings
call. Today's presentations may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or
beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may
also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at morganstanley.com for a
reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks
and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley.
This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our
consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument. I will now turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Before I comment on our performance, I
will reflect briefly on where we are as a firm and where we're going. The management team here has been together for
almost five years and while we have accomplished a number of things, there's clearly more we can do.
In short, we do not think that this firm is close to reaching its full potential. The stability and cohesiveness of the team,
significant depth of talent across the organization, commitment from our people, reshaping our business model, all
position us for significant growth. At our core, Morgan Stanley is a client-focused firm and our philosophy has always
been to do first-class business in a first-class way.

With the current regular paradigm, having a client-centric business model is key to sustainable success. The
opportunities in front of us are based on increasing client penetration and accelerating new client acquisition and may
include building on our leading position in advising on cross-border M&A deals, with particular success in Japan and
our other strong banking franchises; the growth of our bank, both in Wealth Management and Institutional Securities,
raising new funds in Merchant Banking and Real Estate; and the use of technology to improve the efficiency in which
we serve our clients with a high-tech, high-touch approach across the entire franchise. Those are just some examples.
Now, turning briefly to the quarter. We grew our revenue and profitability quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in
both Wealth Management and Institutional Securities. Firm-wide revenues, excluding DVA, were up 7% compared to
the third quarter of last year. In the Wealth Management business, our revenues grew 9% versus a year ago, driven by
the continued execution of our bank strategy, as well as revenue tailwinds from higher markets.
Notably, our margin improved to 22%. Fee-based assets as a percent of client assets increased to 38%, up from 36%
last year and just 23% when we closed on the initial portion of the acquisition a few years ago. Revenues in all of our
major institutional businesses were up versus year ago. Investment Banking revenues were up 35%. Fixed Income
results, excluding DVA, were up 19%, notwithstanding continued reduction RWAs. Our equity sales and trading
revenues were higher versus last year, as we continue to execute across products and regions and that franchise remains
number one in the world.
The momentum of our businesses also drove continued improvements in our earnings and our ROE. EPS, excluding the
tax benefits and DVA in this quarter and a year ago, was up about 40%, while our ROE on the same basis increased
180 basis points to approximately 8%.
We're not yet at acceptable levels, though we're making consistent progress. For example, we have made progress in
improving the returns and reducing the capital and expenses in Fixed Income & Commodities over the last few years.
We believe there may still be meaningful opportunities to optimize the remaining components of commodities beyond
the recent TransMontaigne sale as we continue to drive for higher returns. In addition, we're always vigilant with all
our resources, especially the balance sheet.
A final thought, we believe we remain well-positioned for further capital actions, given the magnitude of our
fundamental strategic change and our improving earnings profile. The CCAR process is ingrained in every aspect of
our business.
I will now turn the call over to Ruth to discuss the quarter in detail.
Ruth Porat
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided
reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. The impact of DVA in
the quarter was positive $215 million, with $132 million in Fixed Income sales and trading and $83 million in equity
sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $8.7 billion, up 2% versus the second
quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the third quarter was 21%, reflecting a discrete net tax
benefit of $237 million or $0.12 per diluted share, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a
cost lower than originally estimated.
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders, excluding DVA, were $1.5
billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share, excluding DVA, were $0.77 after preferred dividends.
On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $8.9 billion. Earnings from
continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $1.7 billion. Reported earnings from
continuing operations per diluted share were $0.84 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was
$34.17 per share and tangible book value was $29.25 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $814 billion at September 30, down from $827 billion at the end of
the second quarter. Deposits as of quarter end were $124 billion, up $7 billion versus Q2. Our liquidity reserve at the

end of the quarter was $190 billion, compared with $192 billion at the end of the second quarter. Year-to date, we
benefited from strong, global demand for our credit, enabling us to pull forward issuance from future periods, reflecting
broad global investor participation.
Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Common Equity Tier 1 transitional ratio
will be approximately 14.3% and our Tier 1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 16.1%. Basel III
transitional risk-weighted assets are expected to be approximately $415 billion at September 30. Reflecting our best
estimate of the final Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma Common Equity Tier 1 ratio using the Basel III fully
phased-in Advanced Approach was 12.6% at September 30, up from 12.3% in the second quarter.
Our pro forma standardized ratio was 11.7%, up from 10.7% in 2Q. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III Advanced
RWAs are expected to be approximately $423 billion. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under
the U.S. final rule to be approximately 4.9% at September 30, up from 4.6% at the end of 2Q. These estimates are
preliminary and are subject to revision. Turning to expenses, our total expenses this quarter were $6.7 billion, flat
versus the second quarter.
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues excluding DVA were $4.3 billion, up
3% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.3 billion, flat versus the second quarter. Compensation expense was $1.8
billion for the third quarter, up 3% versus the second quarter, in line with the increase in revenues and reflecting a 41%
ratio excluding DVA. Non-compensation expense for the third quarter was $1.5 billion, down 3% versus the second
quarter. The business reported a pre-tax profit of $1 billion, excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of
DVA, revenues were $4.5 billion and the pre-tax profit was $1.2 billion.
In Investment Banking, revenues of $1.3 billion were down 6% versus last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters,
Morgan Stanley ranked number one in global IPOs and number two in global announced and completed M&A at the
end of the third quarter.
Notable transactions included, in advisory, Morgan Stanley acted as sole financial adviser to Sigma-Aldrich in the
announced $17 billion sale to German Merck. Morgan Stanley also acted as financial adviser to Dresser-Rand in the
announced agreement to be acquired by Siemens for $7.6 billion in cash.
In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as joint bookrunner on the U.S. $25 billion IPO of Alibaba Group, the
largest IPO in history. Morgan Stanley also acted as lead left bookrunner and stabilization agent on the $3.5 billion IPO
for Citizens Financial Group. The IPO represented the largest U.S. bank IPO in history and the largest U.S. financial
institution IPO since 2007.
In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as lead left bookrunner for Tyson Foods on its $3.25 billion of Senior
Unsecured Notes in multiple tranches to finance its acquisition of Hillshire Brands. This financing complemented our
role as lead financial adviser to Tyson on its acquisition, lead left arranger for an $8.2 billion committed bridge facility,
and lead left bookrunner and stabilization agent for the $2.4 billion offering of common stock and tangible equity units.
Advisory revenues of $392 million decreased 6% versus our second quarter results, driven by lower results in EMEA
and Asia Pacific. Morgan Stanley remains a leader in cross-border activity. Underwriting revenues of $948 million
decreased 7% versus our second quarter results; though were strong for a third quarter, driven by equity underwriting
revenues of $464 million, which were down 5% versus the second quarter, reflecting lower volumes in the Americas
and EMEA, partially offset by strength in Asia Pacific.
Fixed Income underwriting revenues of $484 million were lower versus the second quarter, primarily due to declines in
investment grade and high-yield bonds that were partially offset by higher revenue from loans. Equity sales and trading
revenues excluding DVA were $1.8 billion, flat compared to last quarter.
Results were strong across products and geographies, demonstrating less seasonality than is typical for the third quarter.
Solid client activity and the underwriting calendar drove cash revenues above second quarter levels. Derivative
revenues also increased sequentially on higher client activity. Prime brokerage revenues were lower, reflecting reduced
activity in Europe. Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1 billion, flat

versus the second quarter. Macro revenues were up significantly this quarter, most notably in foreign exchange, which
benefited from improved market conditions with higher volatility.
Securitized products and credit products revenues declined on lower secondary client activity and less favorable market
conditions. Commodities revenues were meaningfully lower, reflecting lower client activity and a difficult market
environment. CVA was a benefit in the quarter. Other revenues were $225 million, up versus $108 million in the
second quarter, driven by a gain on the sale of TransMontaigne and the sale of a retail property space. Average trading
VaR for the third quarter was $42 million, down from $48 million in the second quarter.
Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were $3.8 billion in the quarter, up 2% sequentially. Asset management
revenues of $2.2 billion were up 5% versus last quarter, reflecting higher markets and positive flows. Transaction
revenues were down compared to last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $503 million, essentially flat to
the prior quarter; investment banking-related fees of $224 million, up 5% versus last quarter, reflecting a pick-up in
closed-end funds; and trading revenues of $185 million, down 31% versus the second quarter, driven primarily by
lower marks in our deferred compensation plans.
Net interest revenue increased 4% to $601 million, driven primarily by higher revenues from our bank deposit program.
Other revenue of $112 million increased versus the second quarter, primarily due to the gain on sale of a retail property
space. Non-interest expense was $2.9 billion, flat versus last quarter. Non-compensation expense was $767 million,
effectively flat to last quarter. Compensation expense was $2.2 billion, flat versus the second quarter. The
compensation ratio was 58%, down versus the second quarter, driven by revenue mix, including ongoing growth in net
interest income.
The PBT margin was 22.1%, up versus 20.6% in the second quarter. PBT margin, excluding the benefit from the sale
of a retail property space, was 21.3% in the quarter. Profit before tax was $836 million. Total client assets were $2
trillion. Global fee-based asset inflows were $6.5 billion. Fee-based assets under management increased to $768 billion
at quarter end, representing 38% of client assets.
Global representatives were 16,162, essentially flat to the second quarter. Deposits in our bank deposit program were
$129 billion, up $2 billion versus the second quarter. Approximately $116 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks.
Wealth Management lending balances continue to grow, reflecting the ongoing execution of our bank strategy. Lending
balances increased $3.5 billion in the quarter.
Investment Management revenues of $655 million were down 5% sequentially. In traditional asset management,
revenues of $456 million were up 5% versus the second quarter, driven by positive flows and higher markets and
partially offset by lower marks in deferred compensation plans.
In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $113 million were flat to the second quarter. Merchant Banking revenues were
$86 million, down 41%, driven by lower investment gains in the quarter. Non-interest expenses were $467 million,
down 4% from the second quarter, consisting of compensation expense of $253 million, reflecting a compensation ratio
of 39% and down versus the second quarter, driven by lower marks on deferred compensation plans and the mix of
revenues in the quarter.
Non-compensation expense was $214 million, up from $196 million in the second quarter, primarily due to the
settlement of a legal matter. Profit before tax was $188 million, down 8% sequentially. NCI was $18 million versus $7
million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $398 billion, driven by higher flows, though partially
offset by market depreciation, driven primarily by foreign exchange.
In conclusion, our outlook is guided by the meaningful transformation we've made during the last five years and benefit
from growth in our most annuity-like businesses. First, our Wealth Management business continues to have momentum
with growing profitability from the secular trend toward managed money. We enter the fourth quarter with a modest
tailwind from stronger equity markets at the end of Q3 and clients remain engaged as they assess evolving
opportunities in markets.

Second, we continue to have earnings upside with ongoing loan growth in our bank. This remains a differentiated
contributor because we benefit from asset optimization on a growing loan book even without the benefit of rising rates.
As we enter the fourth quarter, the pipeline for loan origination remains strong in both Wealth Management and
institutional securities.
Third, our Investment Banking pipeline remains healthy. In advisory, it is broad-based across industry and geography
and generates financing opportunities. Ongoing market volatility may affect institutional results if it persists. However,
we view recent volatility as a repeat of a theme seen frequently during the last several years, with growing activity
levels across products and businesses building, only to be disrupted by macro events, then followed by a reset. A reset
could occur with recognition that stronger growth in the U.S. may offset challenges in other economies.
Finally, our capital and liquidity position continue to be a source of strength. Our healthy capital ratios on both an
absolute and relative basis reflect a robust foundation and evidence our ongoing successful execution of our business
and balance sheet strategy.
Thank you for listening. James and I will now take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Glenn Schorr with ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Good morning.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Good morning. Maybe just a quick one on the mechanics of this whole fair value of deferred
comp that showed up in both – in your comments in both Investment Management and Wealth Management. If I heard
you correctly, it hits both the revenue line and the comp line?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Correct.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: And can you just help us, when and why that happened?
<A - Ruth Porat>: It's a function of the assets in the deferred comp plan, so they move as the market moves. And it
therefore flows through revenue and comp and in this instance, as you could see, we went through the impact on both
businesses. You know that...
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. And do I need to care? Meaning, are they comparable amounts on the revenue and
expense line and they net out to not a big impact?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes, although they, by definition, therefore imply a higher comp ratio, but yes, they net out.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Understood. Okay, cool. Moving on. Curious, you definitely commented about how you've
extended the duration of your book a little built – or a lot, I should say, in the past. But curious, market to market, your
thoughts on NSFR, impact on prime brokerage, specifically, in conjunction with the Fed's recent comments on
short-term wholesale funding. Just kind of, how is it impacting? It's an important business for you. You're really good
at it. How is it impacting how you run the business and the profitability of the business?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So, taking the two rules, obviously, both of which are, at this point, preliminary and we're looking
forward to seeing the final rules; on the net stable funding ratio, as you noted, we've frequently said that durability of
funding is important and it's the way we run the firm. And as a result, probably not surprisingly, we think having a
measure of long-term durability is appropriate. And we've spent a lot of time, as you noted, achieving this durability

through proper ALM and we've spent a lot of time walking everyone through how we've done that within our secured
book. The challenge of being more direct in answering your question is the rule is preliminary. But given all that we've
done, we don't expect to make meaningful changes. And as I said, we very much look forward to seeing what the rule
is.
And then on SIFI surcharge, the increase for short-term wholesale funding, somewhat similar given the Fed has only
provided the broad contours of what the rule is going to be. It's unclear how it's going to be implemented, and in
particular, how it's going to be calibrated. I think, obviously, the entire industry has some element of wholesale funding
and we've often said, not all wholesale funding is created equal; very much to your question.
Our view is that logic would suggest that proper calibration would incorporate not just size but the quality and
durability of funding. In particular, given the Fed has recently published an article about durability in the industry, one I
noted in a recent conference, and it's just too early to know. But again, given all that we've done and given the strength
of our capital positions, we are not looking at changing what we're doing with our business here. And I guess the last
point I would make on the wholesale funding is we would hope the rule is dynamic and does adjust as the industry
adjusts to the new rule.
But the big point is that given what we've done with our funding, with durability of our funding and the way we're
managing our balance sheet, we don't see it really at this point – still waiting for the rule, so I'll leave that caveat, but
really affecting the way we're running the business.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Last quickie is just you guys, your growth has been great, as you noted, in both the
PLAs and the residential real estate loans. Are the FAAs being especially incented to drive that? I know it comes at a
higher profitability for the firm, does the low – is the offset of rates not going up for you guys, low rates actually help
drive the growth in those lending products?
<A - Ruth Porat>: There are a couple of different, I guess, questions in that. As we've talked about, loan growth is not
on the comp grid, on the formulaic comp grid. It's what we call non-compensable revenue. So there is compensation on
it, but it's not part of the formulaic grid. And what's really driving this is, we've talked about on some prior calls, is the
take-up by FAA. And what we're finding is we're having growth in the loans per financial advisor, growth in the
number of financial advisors using the product. As they use it, they see the value to their clients, they see the ease of
using it. We've invested meaningfully in the infrastructure that support financial advisors. And so they're seeing the
strength of this product suite. And we're also seeing higher draw-down on the securities-based lending – loans. So you
have origination occurs and then you have the draw-down over a period of time. So, really what this is is increased
penetration on what is a very sizable client base and that's what's really driving it.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, excellent. I appreciate it.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: We've heard a lot of complaints from investors who were worried about the Street reducing
the liquidity that it provides. We heard a lot more about it in the last few weeks of the third quarter. And at the same
time, in the third quarter, the G-SIBs began to have to make daily reports to regulators based on Volcker and liquidity
regs. Do you think this may have had an impact just because it's onerous and it kind of puts in your face every day the
impact of inventory and hedging? Or is the issue more broadly structural in your view?

Page 7 of 15
<A - Ruth Porat>: We think it's more structural and it's really the combination of other regulatory requirements. We
don't think it's as a result of the Volcker reporting. People have been working on that for quite some time. As you said,
it's now started to be submitted to regulators. But when you look at the combination of the supplementary leverage ratio
with the other various tests, whether it's CCAR or for some firms it's the LCR, there are a number of factors which are
really changing dynamics in the market, liquidity in the market.
At a recent conference, I put up a slide that looked at the extent to which balance sheets have come down on the one
hand and liquidity requirements have increased on the other hand. And by definition, that's squeezing the amount of
balance sheet available for trading activity. So we do view that as a structural change in the industry driven by
regulatory change in the aggregate.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And is there a way that you're actually seeing in which this leads to fundamentally better
spreads?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, the gapping that you saw this week, I would say, I wouldn't view that as a positive for the
market. I think that one of the things that have been concerning is the increase in treasury sales, which I think initially
were attributed to the SLR and there was a view that potentially there would be a re-adjustment in markets. But in fact,
through the course of the third quarter, even before the last couple of weeks, the trend line was up even when market
volatility was low and I think that is a concern.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And actually, if you don't mind, can you comment a little bit on the early going in October?
Obviously, we're only a couple of weeks in and they've been an unusual couple of weeks. But certainly, JPMorgan
commented earlier this week that the market's businesses had seemed a lot more mixed over the last couple of weeks.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, as you said, the macro environment, the trading markets are really the key issue and it has
been a challenged quarter to date. But as you appropriately noted, two weeks isn't a quarter. And as I said in my
opening comments, we've seen this through the last several years, choppiness in markets and then a reset and it's tough
to gauge when it resets. So it's been a choppy early start, but when you look, again, across the franchise, the Investment
Banking pipeline is strong. You've seen continued issuance throughout this period. And, yes, a sustained downdraft
wouldn't be constructive and it could affect the timing of deals, but at this point, the pipeline continues to build.
In fact, a lot of deals that we may have thought would close in the first quarter were pulled into the third quarter, were
executed earlier. And the pipeline has replenished, which really goes to the strength of the dialogue across the banking
franchise. And similarly in Wealth Management, what we're seeing – I appreciate your asking about trading markets,
but as we look across our franchise, what's quite relevant is just the consistency we're seeing in Wealth Management as
well.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks. You mentioned the SLR and thanks for giving us the figure. Is there still a
SACCR-type benefit that we should be looking for?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, there's been no update on the rule. We do still expect that SACCR will be a part of the
standardized risk-based capital calculation. And as proposed, based and the third quarter number, that would be about a
30 basis point benefit to our standardized ratio. On the SLR, it's unclear if the rule would include SACCR. If it would
include it, we would expect a modest benefit there.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks. I have a question on Wealth Management. As you pointed out, the fee-based asset
inflows at $6.5 billion were quite a bit lower than in either of the reference quarters. I think you were $12.5 billion last
quarter and $15 billion a year ago. And I was wondering if there was any color you can provide there, any special
factors that we should pay attention to.
<A - Ruth Porat>: No special factors. We've seen same strength in the business. In our view, it just reflects timing.
And as you noted, we had strong flows throughout the year, so as we're looking at it year-to-date, we just had strong
flows and there were timing issues.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. And then I just have one more which is that you talked about the discrete tax benefit
because of being able to repatriate more attractively than you had expected in terms of your tax provisions. How

unusual an event is just the repatriation itself? And can you give us a sense for the order of magnitude involved? And I
guess what I'm looking for is a signal as to what we're looking at in terms of potential capital return.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So in terms of repatriation, as I noted, it was due to some non-U.S. earnings that were at a cost
lower than originally estimated. I think we look at requirements in geographic markets throughout the year. This one
just happened to be with a benefit.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And can you tell us sort of what the gross amount was that you repatriated?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We indicated the tax benefit here. I don't have more than that with me.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it.

The next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: I was hoping just to follow up on your comment about further capital actions given
the strategic changes. I don't know if that's just referring to the CCAR process, earnings are higher, there's been more
stability, so think about higher payouts or was there something else that you were referring to, maybe related to selling
the Commodities business, freeing up capital, things like that.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Why don't I take that? I think we're just pointing out that in the context of all the
things going on at this firm, we're obviously building pretty solid capital buffers. That said, we live in a dynamic
regulatory environment with potentially new G-SIFI buffers coming out. But we feel strongly about where we are with
our capital base and we feel strongly about where we're going coming into the CCAR process. We certainly expect to
continue to return our capital to shareholders, in increasing amounts over the coming years.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And then have you guys disclosed either the assets or revenue related to the
Commodities business, either what you sold or just the entire unit?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No, we haven't.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, there was an article in the paper a couple of weeks
ago related to the dividend arbitrage that some clients are using, that the U.S. broker-dealers and global broker-dealers
are helping. I'm just wondering how big of a business is that for you guys? And remind us of the seasonality around
that. And thoughts on, I guess just the business going forward.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, as we've said repeatedly, our equity business is strong, diversified across products and
regions and that's what drives it. We don't break out particular pieces. And there are seasonal patterns throughout the
year.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And is that an area that you think you and others will pull back a little bit,
given just that it's being highlighted and maybe scrutinized a bit more than in the past?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah, it is one of a number of services that we provide clients and it's really based on client
activity.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And just lastly the non-comp, I mean, expenses overall actually came in
pretty good this quarter and in general. The non-comp, in particular, has been managed down quite nicely. Is there
anything – I guess, from here, is there more that you can do or should we think about this as a pretty reasonable run

rate?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Our view is that there is more to do. We remain very focused on expenses overall. And if you go
back to 2012, when we first laid out our expense reduction goals, we had an expense ratio at that time of about 84%.
And we indicated, by the end of this year, we'd get to 79% or lower. Year-to-date, we're at 77%. But the process of
going – over the last couple of years is really to provide the analytics, the tools, the dashboards to the businesses to
ensure that ingrained throughout the organization is a real focus on expenses and expense management. And we view
that as an ongoing part of the way we run the business.
As I talked about at a recent conference, we divide our expenses into what we call run-the-bank and change-the-bank.
And we've been able to extract savings in run-the-bank to fund what we call change-the-bank requirements, which
include both regulatory requirements as well as ongoing innovation in the business investments to ensure we're
enhancing client experience and applications across the platform. So again, we've got a very strict lens on that because
it does create incremental capacity as well. And we think it's the appropriate way to run the overall franchise.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

The next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Thanks. Can you just update us on the FIC RWA this quarter? And maybe just more
strategically as we think outward if there is more pressure from regulators with a SIFI surcharge on top of a surcharge
focused primarily on repo and other aspects of the Fixed Income business, do you think that there could there be some
changes in trying to push the RWA lower over time? Thanks.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So risk-weighted assets in Fixed Income are $191 billion this quarter, down from $192 billion last
quarter. We just had less roll-off this quarter. And we remain very comfortable with the $180 billion target for Fixed
Income, which was originally end of 2016. We pulled it forward to end of 2015. As I indicated at a recent conference,
we want to make it clear, though, that there is not – just as with the non-comp expense question, there's not a line in the
sand on a particular date where activity stops.
Beyond the $180 billion, there's about $25 billion of incremental risk-weighted assets that run off over time in areas
like structured credit and long-dated uncollateralized derivatives, which generate a negative ROE because we have to
finance legacy positions. And so as we exit, we take those from a negative ROE to neutral, and as we redeploy them,
you shift to a positive ROE and we're already generating strong ROEs in a number of our businesses within Fixed
Income, like credit and securitized products. And so we have an opportunity to reallocate to get a higher return on
those. And that's really the way we're looking at what we're doing within Fixed Income.
You know, as it relates to changing regulatory requirements and the potential surcharge, I would note that our ratios are
very strong. The transitional ratio at 14.3% and even fully-phased in, as we're talking about, 11.7% standardized,
12.6% advanced, so what we're really looking at is how to best optimize within each business to drive the ROE within
each business, and we believe we've got room to really use a number of different levers to do that.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: All right, that's helpful. So if you think about the $180 billion, there is $25 billion that's sort of
run-off beyond that, but you might be re-investing, depending on the environment. Is that the way to think about it?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah, depending on the environment and client activity, because we have the opportunity already
resident within a number of products within Fixed Income to generate an attractive return; so depending on
requirements, there's ample capacity.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay, great. Thanks.

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. What inning are you in in redeploying the deposits that you achieved from the joint venture?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So we are – what inning? You frequently do ask the inning question, I think we're well on our way.
And I think – let me give a couple of parts to that. The early days, I guess you would say, even pre-game, was building
the infrastructure required to support the growth once we closed out the acquisition and started onboarding the deposits.
And so that was a very important element of really the set-up, ensuring that we had the infrastructure, the risk
management, the bankers supporting the financial advisors, so that as the deposits started onboarding, we could have
positive growth, a good experience for our financial advisors, as I've already addressed and see the kind of rollout that
we've had.
The other thing is we've emphasized repeatedly, that our focus is on prudent loan growth, prudent loan growth within
Wealth Management and Institutional Securities. And we have two broad franchises that enable us to have strong
demand, but what we've been focused on is really prudent loan growth. And so we have ample capacity beyond here.
We've been closing the gap versus the industry average, but still believe we have ample capacity beyond here to grow.
And that is just with the contractual onboarding of deposits, where, as you've seen this quarter, there's organic on top of
the contractual. So we view this as the opportunity to have the 10th largest depository embedded within Morgan
Stanley that creates substantial incremental opportunity in a flat rate environment or a rising rate environment. And I'm
going to give it to James because he tends to like the cricket matches and they last a lot longer and that's the way we
view this bank, it's got a long way to go.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, I'm not sure you're asking about cricket innings, but if I were to put a number on
it, I'd say we're somewhere around the bottom of the fourth in baseball and at the afternoon tea session on day two of a
five-day test match.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. How much do interest rates help if they increase and how much do they hurt if they don't
increase? I mean, some of the more traditional banking peers will actually quantify this for us and you haven't done
that. Can you just help size the benefit or the harm?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes. I'm glad you asked that question because it's an important one, given the way we see the
outlook for the bank. So overall, rising rates are a good thing. They do benefit the bank as we deploy deposits into
lending and AFF. And second, it should signal an improving economy which would increase activity levels across the
franchise. But the main point, and I tried to indicate that in the opening comments, is that the main driver of NII growth
is deposit deployment. And you can see that in our year-over-year numbers, we're benefiting from deploying these
legacy Citi deposits and with more coming on board, we have a positive impact even without rates rising. And so you
take that – that to us is a really just differentiated advantage. We're pleased to see the ongoing growth in NII, again,
even without rates increasing.
So, now you flip to the other side. At some point, rates will increase. And for modeling, a couple of the key points, I
guess, first is that the reason we've gone through this, giving you contractual deposit onboarding, kind of what the
schedule is and what the current asset mix and what the target asset mix is, is so that you can model the rate impact
whenever you do expect it to occur.
The other components in modeling that we think about is, one, what's the impact of higher rates on deposit outflows
and the data suggests that, for Morgan Stanley, that would be de minimis because our deposits are working capital and
client accounts, so very sticky. We've talked about that in some prior calls.
In terms of deposit pricing, we model that based on historic data of both Morgan Stanley as well as for retail deposits at
regional and large money center banks, notwithstanding the fact that, as I just said, our deposits do behave very

differently than those retail deposits. And our analysis and our model would reflect about a 45 basis point increase in
deposit pricing with the first 100 basis point increase in rates. We do believe that is conservative, given the nature of
our deposits and structural changes in deposit alternatives, but it's what we would assume kind of as something to put
into a model.
Fed Funds is the most relevant rate for our business. And the last point is that the average duration of our bank assets is
about one-and-a-half years, so rising rates do benefit us quickly. So, the way we look at it is in a flat environment,
there's upside given NII growth, but it's all about asset optimization. And in a rising rate environment, given the factors
I went through and the cost structure of our bank, no bricks and mortar, the investments have already been made, any
rise in rates does drop nicely to the bottom line.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Just two quick follow-ups. The deposit data of 45% seems somewhat low compared to many
traditional banks. Are you sure about that? It's not a whole lot of sensitivity there.
<A - Ruth Porat>: When we look at the data that we've looked at over time, and again, given the nature of the deposits
as I indicated, our view is that that's appropriate given the nature of the business. And as I said, we're talking about the
first 100 basis points. So it moves over time.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then low rates, if it stays lower for longer, what impact does that have on your refinancing
of your debt? You issued a lot of debt when your credit spreads were blown out two years ago and now they have come
in. Can you take advantage of that?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We can and we have, because we've started refinancing debt that, as you noted, came on kind of in
the 2010-2011 period. We do realize the benefit over time, given the weighted average maturity of our unsecured debt
is about six years. So we would leg into any benefits over time, but at this point, we're refinancing debt we issued
post-crisis and there's a benefit.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. A quick one first, the $141 million gain that you laid out, was that only on
that real estate sale or does it also include the gain on TransMontaigne?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No, it's just on the real estate.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Is it possible to quantify the TransMontaigne gain? Was that significant?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We don't break that out. That's included within the other revenue line. And just as a reminder, that
also includes the contribution from our joint venture with MUFG. It's where the real estate is TMG and there are a
dozen line items in that one.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Okay. So, I guess though, given the fact that you broke it out would imply that you
didn't view it as a material number enough – it wasn't material enough to break out, is that fair?
<A - Ruth Porat>: It's included, as I said, within the other line.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. All right. And then thinking about the rest of the physical business and the potential
sale to Rosneft, what are the next steps if that doesn't go through here by year-end? Can you start to shop the asset
now? Is there any sort of change that can be made proactively on that front?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, as you noted, in the way you framed the question, the terms of the contract are such that if the
deal doesn't close by year-end, the contract expires and so we're considering alternatives if it doesn't close.

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Is it possible also, while on the physical commodity front, to think about what growth
rates might have been if we exclude either the TransMontaigne component of the physical Commodities revenue out of
FIC or physical commodities overall, just given that it's getting shopped?
<A - Ruth Porat>: TransMontaigne wouldn't have – it would have been immaterial to the results. And as we indicated,
commodities overall was very low. It was down meaningfully year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So it wasn't
much of a contribution across commodities generally.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. So is it possible that the growth rate might have even been higher if we X out the
physical business?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Oh, yes.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Yeah, yeah.
<A - Ruth Porat>: [indiscernible] (45:38)
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Right. And then one last one, just when we talk about the loan book, a lot of times we focus
on the Wealth Management end of it. I'm just kind of curious because you've disclosed that at least half of the loan
growth is going to be coming from the institutional side. How should we think about the NII from those loans flowing
through your P&L, and generally, how should we think about the spreads on those loans versus the loans in your
Wealth Management business? Is there a way to sort of frame how to think about that side of the loan growth?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah, it's a fair question because, as you know, in the Institutional Securities business, NII is a
function of a number of factors, so it's not as easy to parse through as in Wealth Management. Just to give you some
loan growth numbers, so in Wealth Management, I think I indicated securities-based lending's up $2 billion,
residential's up $1.5 billion. In Institutional Securities, we were up $1.5 billion on the quarter, primarily in commercial
real estate. And we are focused on continuing to build a diversified portfolio. And our focus is on lending in areas
where we have strong client franchise, strong domain knowledge, so the other elements of it is it's enhancing our
overall client experience within institutional securities. It's in addition to what we're already doing with key clients.
And so it's reflected there as well and in our view accretive to the overall relationship. And we've had some slides that
we've used in prior conferences that give you yields on a blended basis.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And when we think about those yields and how those yields play in, my guess is or
my sense would be that the level of competition in those markets, probably a bit more intense than you would see on
the retail side. Is that a correct assumption or is that off base?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, again, as I said, part of it – on both sides, Wealth Management and in Institutional Securities,
what we're doing is really focused on our client base and in Institutional Securities, it's adding on to what we're doing
within our key franchises. So we view all of our businesses as competitive. We don't take anything we're doing with
any of our clients for granted, but we've got, in our view, a strong opportunity. And what we've said repeatedly is that
we're focused on prudent loan growth. It's not as though we're looking to create, to originate volume merely to originate
volume. There's a substantial opportunity within our client base on both sides of the house and the key lens is, you've
probably heard us say it too many times, prudent loan growth and it's driven with the tightest lens on risk management.
And that's what's key to the way we're looking to build the bank here.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks for the color, Ruth.

<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks a lot. Ruth, just on some of the regulatory ratios, any update on the bank SLR or
the LCR?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the bank, given we capitalized the bank to support the loan growth that I'm pleased that we've
been talking about a lot on this call, we're in a strong position on all the various capital ratios, LCR, SLR. And again,
it's because we capitalized the bank to support what we expect will be ongoing loan growth.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. And then small items, but just in terms of the tax outlook and then also the CVA, I
just wanted to find out, significant this quarter or kind of an average level?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So in terms of the first part of your question, over time, given our business mix, the tax rate should
be around 30%. And then on CVA, it was positive this quarter. It was a drag last quarter and last year. But one point
that is worth noting is Fixed Income, excluding Commodities, was up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And if
you exclude CVA, that same trend would apply. So the business, Fixed Income products broadly excluding
Commodities, up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, excluding CVA.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. And then just on trading, so on Commodities, anything in the quarter that you would
say was like a one-off versus environmental? And that's more going into the fourth quarter and into next year. And then
I guess same thing on equities, just given the relative strength, anything that you would say was especially strong that
you wouldn't expect to continue?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No. And so starting with Commodities, nothing specific to call out; and so our view is that what
we're looking at appears to be structural headwinds in certain commodities markets. And as a result, the key question is
how to best maximize returns if, in fact, these are structural headwinds. But there was nothing specific there.
And similarly, in Equities, we had broad-based strength again across products and geographies, just given the
leadership in that business. We did benefit from a strong global underwriting calendar, but I would say that's kind of
core to the overall franchise and the strength of what we're doing in equity underwriting generally, and the equity
underwriting calendar remains strong. But nothing specific to call out as broad-based strength again.
I guess just to add, one of the things to note is that we have seen in the past that if challenging markets result in overall
poor performance, you'll often see reallocation, but overall, I think that one of the key things is, typically, activity slows
as you go into the end of year, in particular, with prime brokerage clients. We've seen that in prior years.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Yep. All right. Thanks.

The next question will come from Fiona Swaffield with RBC.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Hello, I just had two questions. Firstly, was on just understanding the compensation ratio
sequentially a bit better, because you took out the gain, in your analysis on the pre-tax margin, so I assume we should
also do the same on the comp ratio. And if we do that, obviously, it has approved less, could you also explain this issue
of the employee deferred comp and how that would affect the comp ratio sequentially?
And the second question is on the SLR. Could you talk a bit more about the balance sheet, or the denominator, it
obviously seems to have gone down, which is helping. And is there more prospect of that continuing? Thanks.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Certainly. So starting with the SLR, 4.9% up versus 4.6% last quarter, we had a contribution from
both the numerator and the denominator. The benefit on the denominator was actually primarily for mitigation of the
gross-ups. And so we've been talking for quite some time about the number of workstreams against which we've been
executing, including the net long CDS sold, the pick-up in compression activity, the reductions in Fixed Income RWAs
over time. And that was the bulk of the benefit that we saw on the denominator. As you noted, we also had a decrease
in our GAAP balance sheet, but the other items were a bigger contributor to the benefit from the denominator.

And then, on the numerator, beyond earnings, we did have a pref issuance this past quarter, those two drove the
numerator higher. In fact, the split between the numerator and the denominator was about two-thirds of the benefit
came from the numerator and one-third came from the denominator.

The next question will come from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick one on FVA, a number of your peers have now
implemented this adjustment to their derivatives books. Curious on your latest thoughts on where Morgan Stanley
stands on this.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So FVA, referring, obviously, to – fair value adjustment refers to the potential implied financing
cost for uncollateralized derivatives, and only to the extent that those are observable. We do continue to evaluate it. As
you noted, there's a lot of industry discussion, there's also been a lot of academic discussion on the topic. But in our
view, transparency continues to be lacking, so there's no basis to take the adjustments.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. And then, quickly, on VaR, that came down, particularly interest rates on credit line. I
assume there was more client activity during the quarter, so just curious if you could parse out the decline there
between positioning versus volatility.
<A - Ruth Porat>: You know, it's come down, I think, in line with overall activity levels coming down. You can see it
in – you noted one line, I would say, but in Commodities it also came down, so it was really just more in line with
client activity.

The final question will come from Steven Chubak with Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: James, I appreciate your comments on your CCAR focus internally. And clearly, you've
made considerable progress delivering stronger returns over the last four quarters. And one thing I was a little bit
surprised by, just looking at your latest company-run mid-year stress tests, is that your PPNR forecast of $8.3 billion
wasn't meaningfully different than your prior company-run submissions. And I was wondering whether this merely
reflects increased conservatism on your part in an effort to maybe match the Fed's historically conservative view of
your PPNR profile. And just given the progress that you've made over the last 12 months, assuming no meaningful
changes to the CCAR guidelines, would you expect to see a better result this coming year?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Why don't I just take it at the top line for a minute on the better results this year. We
didn't ask for something that we didn't get last year. So it's not like we've been restrictive. We've behaved according to
what we thought was the right balance for the business and the right balance through our capital actions. So, yes, as
we're accreting earnings, which we've been doing throughout this year significantly, and we've met the capital ratios
which we expect to meet and we're entering the CCAR process with a reasonably high degree of confidence, again, for
I think it's our sixth go around, we would expect to have further action on the capital side. So it's not like we asked for
something and didn't get it last year. We're just proceeding on a plan that we've been on for several years.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: I certainly wasn't suggesting that. It's more a focus on the, I guess, your perception of the
PPNR progress that you've made. And it's probably the one area where one could argue that the Fed has been overly
conservative. Or at least, that's certainly something that we've heard from other market participants as well.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: That's a fair comment. And I think I'll let Ruth take you through how we're thinking
about it this year.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So we would agree. It's obviously premature to comment on 2015 CCAR since we haven't seen any
of the rules yet, but we would agree. We think the PPNR calculation was very counterintuitive last year. And our view
is that another year of evidence to the benefit of the change in the business mix logically should help.
Last year was the completion of the most strategic transformation with the acquisition of the final piece of the Wealth
Management business. And you've seen we substantially increased the quality and consistency of earnings with the
acquisition. So our view is that this is an iterative process that improves all parties, have improvements throughout the
course of time. And it was counterintuitive and we're working hard to highlight all that we've done and the benefit of
the earnings stream. And so, again, that's been the key focus. You've identified it. We did think it was counterintuitive.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Thanks. That commentary is extremely helpful. And then just switching over, just one quick
question on preferreds, you issued the additional $1 billion as you noted in the quarter. It appears that you're at least
fast approaching the 150 basis point of RWA target others have contemplated and has been mentioned by Basel. I'm
just wondering at this juncture, do you feel as though you're full on preferreds at the moment or should we anticipate
additional issuance going forward?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We have no plans for more preferred issuance this year. Over the past two years, we've been
optimized on capital stack as you said. But prospectively, I'm not going to close the door permanently, but at this point,
no plans for preferred issuance this year.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Understood. Okay, thank you for taking my questions.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Thank you.
