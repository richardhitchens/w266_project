MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the Johnson & Johnson first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. All participants will
be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of this conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone
has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.
Louise Mehrotra
Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it
is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2013. Joining me on the call today is
Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details; this review is being made available to a broader audience via a webcast
accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I'll begin by briefly reviewing
highlights of the first quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. Following my remarks,
Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the financial results and guidance for 2013. We will then open
the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately one hour.
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and/or
businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is
the press release.

Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered
forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2012 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's
actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company
does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or
developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online.
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables
reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.
Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2013. If you would refer to your copy of the press release,
let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area. Worldwide sales to customers were
$17.5 billion for the first quarter of 2013, up 8.5% compared to the first quarter of 2012. On an operational basis, sales
were up 9.8% and currency had a negative impact of 1.3%.
The acquisition of Synthes was completed in the second quarter of 2012. In the current quarter, the acquisition net of
the impact of the divestiture of the legacy DePuy Trauma business contributed 5.7% to the worldwide operational sales
growth.
In the U.S., sales were up 11.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 8.7%, while the effect of
currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.4%. The Asia-Pacific-Africa region grew 11.8%
operationally, while the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 9.1% operationally. Europe grew 6.2% on an
operational basis. The success of new product launches, and Synthes sales made strong contributions to the results in all
regions.
If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings were $3.5 billion compared to $3.9 billion in
same period in 2012. Earnings per share were $1.22 versus $1.41 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the box
section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. As referenced in the
accompanying table of non-GAAP measures, 2013 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude special items,
primarily related to an increase in the litigation accrual as well as integration and transaction costs related to the
acquisition of Synthes, Inc.
First quarter 2012 net earnings included a gain related to an after-tax special item of $106 million, as outlined in the
reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding these special items for both periods, net earnings for the
current quarter were $4.1 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.44, representing increases of 8% and 5.1%
respectively as compared to the same period in 2012.
I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on
to the segment highlights. For the first quarter of 2013, cost of goods sold at 31.7% was up 130 basis points from the
same period last year, primarily due to an inventory step-up charge related to the Synthes acquisition. Excluding the
inventory step-up charge, which has been treated as a special item, cost of goods sold increased 50 basis points versus
the same period last year. Incremental amortization expense related to Synthes of approximately $140 million
negatively impacted cost of goods sold by 80 basis points. Also impacting cost of goods sold were the ongoing
remediation work in our OTC business and the medical devices excise tax. Positive mix and cost reduction efforts
partially offset these items.
First quarter selling, marketing, and administrative expenses at 29.8% of sales were down 130 basis points due to
timing of expenditures as well as cost containment initiatives across many of our businesses. Our investment in
research and development as a percent of sales was 10.2%, consistent with our 2012 results. Interest expense net of
interest income of $104 million was down $26 million versus the first quarter of 2012 due to a lower average debt
level.
Other expense net of other income was $515 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $611 million of other
income net of other expense in the same period last year. Excluding special items, other income net of other expense of

$83 million was $411 million less than 2012, due primarily to lower gains on divestitures. Excluding special items, the
effective tax rate of 19% in first quarter of 2013 compared to 22.8% in the same period last year. Dominic will provide
commentary on taxes in his remarks.
Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products
or businesses for the first quarter of 2013. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales
for the first quarter of 2013 of $3.7 billion increased 2.2% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational
basis, sales increased 3.3%, while the impact of currency was negative 1.1%. U.S. sales were up 2.4%, while
international sales grew 3.8% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisitions,
operational growth was approximately 4.3%.
Baby Care products increased on an operational basis by 7% when compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due
to wipes, hair care, cleansers and powders. Sales in the Oral Care business increased 5.1% operationally. Results were
driven by strong sales of LISTERINE due to the continued success of new product launches, partially offset by the
impact of the divestiture of the manual toothbrushes in the U.S.
For the first quarter of 2013, sales for OTC pharmaceuticals and nutritionals increased 7.6% on an operational basis
compared to same period in 2012, with U.S. sales up 14.4% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.9% on an operational basis.
The strong sales results in the U.S. were driven by analgesics and upper respiratory products due to progress in
returning a reliable supply of products to the marketplace and a strong flu season. Strong growth of analgesics drove
results outside the U.S.
Our Skin Care business was flat on an operational basis in the first quarter of 2013. Strong results for NEUTROGENA
were offset by impact of divestitures, the initial stocking related to new product launches last year and competitive
pressures. Women's Health grew 0.8% on an operational basis due to strong growth in liners, offset by lower sales of
K-Y products.
Wound Care/Other sales decreased 10% on an operational basis, with a sales decline in the U.S. of 13.3%. And outside
the U.S., operational sales were down 6.1% due to competitive pressure and impact of divestitures.
That completes our review of the Consumer segment, and I'll now review highlights for our Pharmaceutical segment.
Worldwide net sales for the first quarter of $6.8 billion increased 10.4% versus the same period last year. On an
operational basis, sales increased 11.4%, with a negative currency impact of one point. Sales in the U.S. increased
14.7%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 8.1%. U.S. results included a positive
adjustment to previous estimates for Managed Medicaid rebates under the Affordable Care Act related to new data
received from the states. Excluding this item, both U.S. sales and worldwide sales were up approximately 8%
operationally. The most significant impacts from the adjustment were in immunology, neuroscience and PROCRIT.
Now reviewing sales for major therapeutic areas, immunology products grew 16.8% operationally, with sales in the
U.S. up 12.8%. Excluding the adjustment, U.S. immunology growth was approximately 6.5%, with REMICADE
excluding export sales up approximately 4%, SIMPONI up approximately 22%, and STELARA up approximately
57%. Results were driven by strong market growth across the major products, complemented by increased market care
for STELARA. With the strength of our portfolio, we continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology.
REMICADE export sales declined 7.7%, due primarily to a change in inventory levels.
Immunology sales outside the U.S. increased by 30.1% operationally due to strong results for both SIMPONI and
STELARA. SIMPONI's strong growth was due to the increased shipments to our distribution partner and very strong
growth in Japan. STELARA made significant contributions due primarily to market share gains, complemented by
strong market growth in the major regions.
Sales of infectious disease products increased 8.6% on an operational basis. INCIVO, a treatment for hepatitis C, grew
24.9% on an operational basis due to success of the continued rollout, primarily in Latin America. Please note for your
models; 2012 sales by quarter for both INCIVO and XARELTO have been included in the sales by major product
schedule. Continued momentum in market share growth of PREZISTA made notable contributions to the results, as did
the combined sales of COMPLERA and EDURANT.

Neuroscience product sales increased 7.7% on an operational basis, with U.S. growth at 10.7%. Excluding the Managed
Medicaid adjustment, which is primarily related to TOPAMAX and CONCERTA, U.S. sales declined approximately
2%, impacted by generic competition primarily for CONCERTA and DURAGESIC.
The long-acting injectable antipsychotics, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION, achieved
operational growth of nearly 20% due to an increase in combined market share. INVEGA achieved double-digit
operational growth of 11.1% due to strong operational growth outside the U.S., primarily driven by increased market
share in Japan.
Sales of oncology products increased 35% on an operational basis due to very strong results for ZYTIGA. ZYTIGA is
now approved to treat both chemo-refractory and chemo-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In the
quarter, ZYTIGA achieved operational sales growth of over 70%, with U.S. sales growing 61% due to very strong
market growth of over 20% and increased market share in the combined metastatic/castrate-resistant prostate cancer
market. ZYTIGA has captured 28% of that market and is up 1.5 points sequentially. Operational sales outside the U.S.
grew 83.4% versus first quarter 2012 and on sequential basis were up over 20%. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 75
countries.
VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma. Sales increased 2.5% on an operational basis. As I mentioned last
quarter, timing of tender business negatively impacted the growth rate in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding the timing
of the tender business, operational growth was over 20%. Strong performance in patient share in the front-line setting
and the launch of the subcutaneous version continue to drive sales growth.
Other oncology increased primarily due to DOXIL/CAELYX. Regarding DOXIL in the U.S., Janssen is releasing
additional DOXIL produced by an alternate manufacturing approach under the regulatory discretion of the U.S. FDA.
The longer-term solution for DOXIL/CAELYX production, involving transitioning manufacturing to additional
suppliers, continues to meet expected milestones.
Other pharmaceutical products declined 1.7% on an operational basis, with lower sales for EPREX and PARIET related
primarily to generic competition. PROCRIT results were impacted by the Managed Medicaid adjustment. Excluding
this item, PROCRIT sales declined approximately 14%, due primarily to a market decline. Positively impacting results,
XARELTO sales grew over 60% on a sequential basis, capturing 38% of the new-to-brand scripts in cardiology. Total
prescription share in the broader anticoagulant market grew 1.6 points on a sequential basis to 5.6%.
As an update on the status of the acute coronary syndrome indication for XARELTO, the FDA issued a second
Complete Response Letter. Janssen is continuing to work with the FDA to address their questions.
That completes the review of the Pharmaceuticals segment. I'll now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostics
segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment sales of $7.1 billion grew 11.9% operationally
as compared to the same period in 2012. Currency had a negative impact of 1.7 points, resulting in a total sales increase
of 10.2%. Sales excluding the net impact of Synthes were down 2.4% on an operational basis, with U.S. sales down
5.2% and sales outside the U.S. down 0.2% on an operational basis. Divestitures and exits from certain businesses
drove approximately half the worldwide operational decline in the quarter. Market dynamics, including lower
distributor inventories, pricing pressures, as well as impact of less selling days, particularly in our orthopedics business,
negatively impacted operational growth by approximately two points. I will provide more commentary on these factors
in the franchise reviews.
Now turning to the MD&D businesses, starting with Cardiovascular Care; Cardiovascular Care sales were up 8.5%
operationally, with the U.S. up 12.5% and sales outside the U.S. up 6.2% operationally. Excluding the impact of
drug-eluting stents, worldwide sales were up nearly 11% on an operational basis due to strong results for Biosense
Webster and endovascular products.
Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business, achieved worldwide operational sales growth of nearly 12% in the
quarter, driven by market share growth. The expansion of the installed base of the CARTO 3 system and the success of
catheter launches made strong contributions to the results. Strong double-digit growth for endovascular products were

driven by relaunch of the S.M.A.R.T. vascular stent system and the EXOSEAL vascular closure device.
The Diabetes Care business operational sales declined 9.8% in the first quarter of 2013, with the U.S. business down
19.6% due to the impact of the initial stocking related to new product launches last year, lower price, and competitive
pressures, including private label. The business outside the U.S. grew 0.9% operationally, with strong sales in emerging
markets largely offset by lower sales in many of the developed markets.
The Diagnostics business declined 4.9% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of RhoGAM
and the Therakos business, operational sales grew approximately 2%, with U.S. growth of approximately 8% and
growth outside the U.S. down approximately 3% operationally. Results in the U.S. were driven by strong growth in
clinical labs and donor screening.
Infection Prevention declined 10.5% on an operational basis, with sales in the U.S. down 26.7%. Last year in the U.S.,
a customer program to upgrade systems to STERRAD solutions ended in the first quarter, impacting the timing of
capital purchases for the balance of the year in 2012. Excluding capital sales, U.S. results declined approximately 3.5%
in the quarter, due primarily to timing of purchases for consumables. Outside the U.S., operational growth of 4.1% was
driven by both consumables and capital item sales.
Orthopedics sales were up 60.7% on an operational basis when compared to the same period in 2012. Excluding the net
impact of Synthes and the divestiture of certain neurosurgical instruments, operational sales were flat, with the U.S. flat
and outside the U.S. down approximately 1% operationally. Worldwide sales were impacted by approximately 1.5 less
selling days in the quarter.
Operationally, hips were up 2% worldwide, driven by 5% growth in the U.S. due to strong results in primary stem
platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the U.S. were flat on an operational basis,
with strong results in emerging markets offset by slower sales in the developed markets.
Knees worldwide declined 1% on an operational basis, with the U.S. up 1%, driven by fixed-bearing and revision
platforms, offset by lower sales of rotating platforms. Sales outside the U.S. were down 2%, with lower sales of Low
Contact Stress, or LCS, and mobile bearing technology.
Including the Synthes business in both periods and excluding the divested DePuy Trauma business in both periods,
Trauma grew approximately 2% on an operational basis, with similar results both in and outside the U.S. The fourth
quarter supply disruption in the U.S. was substantially remedied late in the first quarter.
Including the Synthes business in both periods, worldwide Spine was down 7% on an operational basis, with the U.S.
down approximately 10%, impacted by the continued softness in the market as well as the restructuring of the
commercial sales organization. Outside the U.S., sales were down approximately 3% operationally.
Specialty Surgery operational growth was 1% in the first quarter of 2013. U.S. sales were down 2.4%, and sales outside
the U.S. were up 4.7% on an operational basis. Strong sales of energy products outside the U.S. and solid results for
biosurgical products were substantially offset by lower sales of Mentor products due to market and pricing pressures.
Surgical Care worldwide sales were down 5.4% on an operational basis, with the U.S. down 10.5% and sales outside of
the U.S. down 2.4% operationally. Negatively impacting growth were divestitures and business exits as well as other
factors such as reduction in inventory levels. Excluding these items, the underlying business was down approximately
1.5 points. Competitive and pricing dynamics impacted sales in the quarter.
Rounding out the review of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment, our Vision Care business achieved
operational sales growth of 1.6% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, with similar results both in
and outside the U.S. Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses, partially offset by lower sales of
reusable lenses.
That completes highlights for the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for
Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2013. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?

Dominic J. Caruso
Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that our thoughts and prayers are with the
families and victims of the tragic event in Boston yesterday.
Now turning to the business of this call, I'd like to provide additional comments about our first quarter results, highlight
some of our recent business and pipeline developments, and then provide our guidance for you to consider in refining
your models for 2013.
I am pleased to say that we're off to a good start in 2013, with solid results in the first quarter. We continued delivering
on our three near-term priorities: building on the momentum in our Pharmaceuticals business; integrating Synthes; and
returning a reliable supply of OTC products to the marketplace.
I'd like to make a few comments on the state of the healthcare market. While we believe that overall healthcare
utilization trends continue to show signs of stabilization, the modest positive increases we saw in the fourth quarter do
not appear to have persisted. And at this point, we are not anticipating a meaningful market acceleration this year.
Adapting to these changes in the healthcare environment is important. And our leaders continue to apply financial
discipline to our operations while investing in key growth opportunities.
Our growth strategies of creating value through innovation, global reads with a local focus, excellence in execution,
and leading with a purpose are being executed well across our businesses, as you will see in the review of our
highlights for the first quarter. The breadth of our business, which provides balance and consistency to our overall
performance, as well as the extraordinary achievements and dedication of our people in all of our locations around the
world positions us well to sustain and drive growth in this increasingly dynamic global healthcare market.
Let's review some highlights of the Q1 results. We had a solid start to the year and are pleased to report earnings per
share of $1.44 excluding special items. This result was driven by operational sales growth in the first quarter of 9.8%
versus the prior year, which was led by the success of many of our recently launched pharmaceutical products as well
as the addition of Synthes to orthopedics business.
As we announced in February, our first quarter earnings were impacted by the Venezuelan government's decision to
devalue its currency, for which we incurred a charge of approximately $100 million to net income and which resulted
in a $0.04 negative impact to earnings per share. This charge is related to the remeasurement of our local balance sheet
at the date of the devaluation. We did not treat this charge as a special item, and I am pleased that this negative impact
to earnings was more than offset by strong operating performance in the first quarter.
As you know, the federal R&D tax credit was renewed by Congress in January under the American Taxpayer Relief
Act for both 2012 and 2013. And during the first quarter, we recorded the full-year impact of the 2012 effect.
We recorded special items in the first quarter of approximately $600 million on an after-tax basis that consisted of
charges primarily for litigation expense accruals related to various legal matters and, as expected, continued costs
associated with the global integration of Synthes. Along with the charge for in-process research and development, these
special items negatively impacted our first quarter results by $0.22 per share. Excluding these special items, our
adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 for the quarter exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates of $1.40 as published by
First Call.
So let's look at sales performance by segment. In Pharmaceuticals, we reported operational sales growth in quarter of
approximately 11.4%, fueled by the continued strong performance of long-established brands, including REMICADE,
PREZISTA, STELARA, and INVEGA SUSTENNA, and more recently launched products such as ZYTIGA and
XARELTO, which are continuing to grow share, even with new competitors entering their markets, largely due to the
strength of the clinical profiles of these medicines themselves and the strong commercialization capabilities in our
Pharmaceuticals business.
In MD&D, sales increased 11.9% operationally versus the prior year. This included impact of Synthes net of the
divestiture of the DePuy Trauma business, which contributed 14% of growth. In addition to Synthes, Biosense

Webster's electrophysiology devices and Cordis's endovascular products in our Cardiovascular Care business coupled
with Vision Care's Acute TruEye, ACUVUE TruEye, and 1-DAY ACUVUE moist disposable lenses also contributed
to our growth.
Strategic divestitures and exits from certain businesses have impacted the growth in our MD&D segment this quarter,
as did key market dynamics, such as the initial implementation of the Medicare competitive bidding legislation in
diabetes, significant decreases in the women's health market, and reductions in the U.S. distributor inventory levels, as
well as less selling days, particularly in orthopedics, as Louise mentioned.
In our Consumer business, of particular note this quarter is the growth in our over-the-counter medicines businesses, as
we continue to make progress in returning a reliable supply of high-quality products to consumers. In the quarter, we
saw an operational sales increase of 3.3%, driven by the positive contribution of TYLENOL and MOTRIN analgesics,
upper respiratory over-the-counter medications, baby care products, LISTERINE mouthwash, and our Neutrogena skin
care products. Divestitures impacted the growth in this segment by 1%.
I'd like to provide update on exciting developments in our pipeline of new products, and I'll start with developments in
our Pharmaceutical business. We were extremely pleased to have received FDA approval for INVOKANA, the first in
a new class of SGLT2 inhibitors for Type 2 diabetes to be available in the United States. It's also the first
pharmaceutical product for Johnson & Johnson in this category and will be a core component of our comprehensive
platform for the management of diabetes. As such, our Diabetes Care business will partner with our Pharmaceuticals
business to directly sell INVOKANA to healthcare professionals for treating patients with diabetes.
We're expecting a decision from the European Medicines Agency on our application for INVOKANA later this year.
And in order to expand its use, in March we submitted a marketing authorization application to the European
Medicines Agency seeking approval for a fixed-dose therapy that combines INVOKANA and immediate-release
metformin. You will recall that we filed an application for this combination with the FDA in December.
In the quarter, simeprevir, or TMC435, was filed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in both Japan and the U.S.,
and an EU filing is expected in the second quarter. In addition, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designations
for the investigational oral agent ibrutinib as a monotherapy for three B-cell malignancies. We continue to anticipate
filing for the mantle cell lymphoma indication by end of the year. This designation is intended to expedite the
development and review time for potential new medicines that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions
based on preliminary clinical evidence.
Turning to our MD&D businesses, Ethicon Endo-Surgery earned 510(k) clearances from the U.S. FDA for two
products in the ENSEAL G2 line, the Cordless Tissue Sealer, a first of its kind product that includes a power generator,
and the ENSEAL G2 Articulating Tissue Sealer device, which makes it easier for surgeons to seal some vessels and
control bleeding.
Supporting our strategy to further our position in the endovascular market, Cordis completed its acquisition of Flexible
Stenting Solutions, a leading developer of innovative flexible peripheral arterial, venous, and biliary stents.
And recently, our Diabetes Care business submitted a pre-market approval application to the FDA for the Animas Vibe
insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring system. This next-generation insulin pump incorporates Animas's
color screen and waterproof technology and the Dexcom G4 Platinum sensor, which enables people with diabetes to
make more informed decisions to help control their disease.
In our Consumer business, during the quarter Johnson & Johnson (China) Investment completed acquisition of
Shanghai Elsker Mother & Baby Company Limited, a well regarded baby care company in China known for its
position in the natural segment. This is in line with our growth strategy of driving global growth with products intended
for use in specific local markets.
Our ability to continue to advance our pipeline for new product in all three of our segments supports our confidence in
the continued growth of our business.

Now let me provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2013. Let me begin with a
discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $6 billion of net
cash. This consists of approximately $22 billion of cash and marketable securities and $16 billion of debt. For purposes
of your models, assuming no major acquisitions, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $450
million and $500 million, consistent with our previous guidance.
Turning to other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as
gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, and other
divestitures, asset sales, or write-offs. This account also includes the impact of the Venezuelan government's decision
to devalue its currency. This account is difficult to forecast. But we would be comfortable with your models for 2013
reflecting other income and expense as a net gain, excluding special items, ranging from approximately $750 million to
$850 million, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
And now a word on taxes; the first quarter reflects the full-year impact of the 2012 R&D tax credit. And for the first
quarter of 2013, the company's effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 19%. We suggest that you model our
effective tax rate for the full year of 2013 at approximately 20%, consistent with our previous guidance. As always, we
will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate during the remainder of the year.
Now turning to sales and earnings; we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase
on a constant currency basis of between approximately 5.7% and 6.7% for the year, which is higher than our previous
guidance. This would result in estimated sales for 2013 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.1 billion to
$71.7 billion.
While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact if currency
exchange rates for the remainder of 2013 were to stay where they were as of last week, as an example with the euro at
approximately $1.31, then our sales growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for the year. Thus,
under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to be between approximately 4.7% and 5.7% for the year,
for an expected level of reported sales of approximately between $70.4 billion and $71.1 billion, which is lower than
our prior guidance, due exclusively to the weakening of several currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar.
Turning to earnings, as a reminder, our guidance reflects the following major assumptions. The implementation of the
medical device excise tax; this has an incremental negative impact to earnings per share of approximately $0.05 and is
recorded in cost of goods sold throughout the year. We will have a full-year impact of amortization related to Synthes
of approximately $550 million on a pre-tax basis, or an incremental half-year negative impact to earnings per share of
approximately $0.06. Our estimated 2013 earnings include total amortization expense for the enterprise of
approximately $1.4 billion on a pre-tax basis.
Considering these factors that I just noted as well as the early strength we saw in our operating results for the first
quarter, we suggest you consider full-year 2013 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items, of between $5.33
and $5.43 per share on an operational basis, or a growth rate of between 4.5% and 6.5% on a constant currency basis,
which is higher than previous guidance.
We are not predicting the impact of currency movement. But to give you an idea of the potential impact on earnings per
share if currency exchange rates for all of 2013 were to remain where they were as of the end of last week, then our
reported EPS excluding special items would be positively impacted by approximately $0.02 per share, or $0.03 lower
than the $0.05 positive impact we had previously estimated in our guidance due to exchange rate fluctuations. We
therefore suggest that you model our reported earnings per share excluding special items in the range between $5.35
and $5.45 per share, or a growth rate of between 5% and 7%, resulting in our reported EPS guidance being consistent
with our previous reported guidance, reflecting some stronger operational earnings offset by the negative impact of
weaker currency exchange rates.
Overall as you update your model for the guidance I just provided, you should see that pre-tax operating profits are
expected to improve at a slightly better rate than we had previously contemplated when we provided guidance back in
January.

Now, Louise, back to you for the question-and-answer session.
Louise Mehrotra
Thank you, Dominic. Stephanie, can you please give instructions for the Q&A session?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: A couple quick questions. First on Managed Medicaid, how far back does that accrual go
and why in Q1 because you didn't highlight it on the fourth quarter call? That's my first question.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Matt, good question. The Affordable Care Act was instituted in 2010, in March 2010.
And it's only recently in the first quarter that we received sufficient information from the various states to true-up the
estimates we had made leading from the time that legislation was passed until now. So hopefully that answers your
question.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: It does, and then one more quick one for you, Dominic. On foreign exchange, it's now up to
negative 100 basis points for the top line, but it's positive $0.02 on bottom. That usually doesn't work that way with
you. How come it's a positive on the earnings this time?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right. The major swing in currencies, Matt, that are negatively impacting sales are
primarily currencies where, although there may be significant sales growth, there's lesser earnings impact. So for
example the yen is dramatically weakened. However, the amount of money we earn in that currency is different than
the level of sales in that currency; whereas the euro, which is where most of the profitability of the company resides
ex-U.S., has not been impacted as greatly as some of the other currencies like the yen. So there is a different weighting
factor of the currencies' impact on sales than there is on earnings.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Thank you, Dominic.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: You're welcome, Matt.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Next question, please?

Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.

<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Good morning, Louise and Dominic. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Larry.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Dominic, could you just help with the outlook on the diabetes blood glucose
monitoring business? The Medicare cuts start I think in July 2013. So I assume the U.S. growth will probably get worse
before it gets better. Maybe you can help us with some metrics to understand how to forecast that business given what's
going on there, and maybe a little bit about your strategy to address these issues, and I had one follow-up.

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Larry, great question. As I know you've all been following, the recent legislation
provides a pretty dramatic reduction in pricing for diabetes test strips. Of course, that legislation pertains to the
Medicare portion of the business. I think roughly the Medicare portion of the business for us is in the 20% to 25%
range, so it's not obviously the entire business.
And then in terms of the strategy going forward, of course, I just described earlier that we were pleased to have filed a
new application for a new blood glucose monitoring system, a continuous glucose monitoring system with the Dexcom
technology. So I think it's important that we continue to innovate where we have the ability to provide patients and
healthcare professionals with the tools to better manage their diabetes care. I think that will always be an important part
of what we continue to do, although we'll have to manage through the pricing impacts that pertain to the Medicare
portion of our business, as I just noted.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Thanks, Dominic, and then one more for you. More and more of your peers are
excluding amortization from non-GAAP earnings. You mentioned I think $1.4 billion. And by our math that potentially
reduces your stock price by about $6. Do you think that impacts your valuation? Is that something that you may be
willing to revisit in the future, excluding it from your non-GAAP earnings? Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right, Larry, so we're certainly aware of that. I think if it was that easy for me to just
change our earnings by excluding amortization and our stock would go up $6, I guess we would do that in a heartbeat.
But we think our company is well followed, understood, and we try to be as transparent as possible with our earnings
guidance. And hopefully, the data we give you provides you all enough data to model the company appropriately.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: You're welcome.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Next question, please?
Operator
Your next question is from Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Good morning, thanks. So I guess the one piece of guidance that surprised me, Dominic,
was what Matt was touching on, which is the FX swing. So you had a 130 basis point swing on the top line versus your
initial guidance in fourth quarter, but that's only a $0.03 impact to your EPS guidance for the year. Is that purely just
because of the differentials in profits, or was that related more to either your transfer pricing or some hedges you may
have there that we're just not aware of?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: It's primarily related to the reasons I mentioned. Currencies like the yen have dramatically
decreased. But a currency like the euro, for example, is only off $0.02 or $0.03 from our previous guidance. And most
of our ex-U.S. earnings are, quite frankly, in the Eurozone. So the impact to earnings is not as pronounced as the
overall basket of currency would indicate.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Interesting. I want to focus on some of your commentary around utilization in your
medical device end markets and obviously understood you were trying to signal that you don't see a pickup in some of
your device end markets. And you also made comments though about your competitive positioning in a couple of them.
So maybe you could spend a minute more maybe on both, and I want to maybe focus on two areas. One is general
surgery, and the second is orthopedics. So can you just give us more of a sense of both how you're feeling about those
end markets; and competitively, particularly on the general surgery side, where you may be seeing some impact?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Mike. With respect to utilization, we're trying to follow what's happening in the
marketplace. And obviously we have a good vantage point from where we stand with the broad-based business that we
have, but we did not see any meaningful continuation of the upswing that we saw, although it was modest in the fourth

quarter. We didn't see that persist into the first quarter. And we also know that certain hospitals are already predicting
lower levels of procedure volume than they had previously indicated. We just saw something this morning from HCA,
for example, that talked about the level of procedure volume that they see, which is quite frankly lower than the level
they had predicted when they announced their guidance for 2013. So overall I think that the market is probably seeing
some seasonality, quite frankly.
So if I comment on orthopedics first, we did in fact see an uptick in the orthopedics market overall, and we did
particularly well in fourth quarter. We did not see that persist in the first quarter of 2013, although there is some noise
there, of course, because then you have less selling days, as Louise pointed out. So if you neutralize for that, it's about
equal in terms of the overall impact to our business first quarter versus fourth quarter, so no great acceleration but no
deceleration per se in orthopedics. Just really the selling days impact is what is dramatically impacting that business.
For surgery, there are a number of factors that we mentioned, for example, lowering levels of inventory by distributors;
some pricing impact; and we did see some competitive inroads in general surgery. And obviously, our response to that
is to continue to improve with the offering of products we have like the ENSEAL products that I just described that
were recently produced. So I would say more competitive pressures in surgery, less so in orthopedics, if you were
distinguishing those two particular markets.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay, thank you, Dominic. I'll let some others jump in.

Your next question is from Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi, thanks for taking the question.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Just going back to the guidance and I guess increasing the constant currency sales
guidance, I just want to be clear on what gives you the comfort that you can raise it at this stage of the year, especially
given what you just described as being generally weak within the medical device business. It sounds like your
expectations for utilization in that category are more moderate relative to what you saw entering the year.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Kristen, so that's a good observation, obviously, but as you know, we have a
broad-based business. So even though we may see weakness in the MD&D market, we're very pleased with the launch
of the products in the pharmaceutical market. We did have the adjustment that Louise described, which is obviously
positive for the quarter and positive for the year. And our Consumer business is off to a very good start as well, and we
expect that to pick up as products continue to come into the marketplace from the products that were previously off the
market. So overall, the breadth of our business allows us to feel comfortable that although in some areas of the business
we may experience market weakness, other areas of the business are more than picking up. So that gives us good
confidence to lean forward in terms of how the business is doing for the balance of 2013.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay, and then any update on the Diagnostics business just in terms of your thinking on
that franchise, whether it's to spin off or selling it?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: No, no updates just yet; we're still going through the process, and it's probably too early to
comment.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question is from Rajeev Jashnani with UBS.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Hi, Rajeev.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Good morning.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: My question first on the Consumer business, it looked like OTC had a nice rebound. I was
wondering if you could talk about where you're at with bringing those products back to the market. I think you had
previously talked about having the key products back by end of the year. Is this on track? Are you perhaps doing a little
bit better there? And then as a corollary to that, the margins in the Consumer business are obviously quite depressed
right now. And maybe talk about the path to improving margins in that business over the longer term.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Rajeev. We are very pleased with the rebound in Consumer business. As you saw, the
OTC business in the U.S. was up 14%. I think that has to do with two things, the expected rollout of our products back
in the marketplace, but also a "pretty healthy", if I can say that in quotes, a "healthy" cold and flu season from our
perspective. So I think we did benefit from that. I think we're basically on track, as we thought we would be, to return
about 75% of the products that were previously off the market back onto the market. So our plan is unfolding as we had
predicted it would, and it looks like we're going to see it build up throughout the remainder of the year. There will be
intermittent supply differences between the products. So it's not as if 75% of the entire volume is back in the business,
but 75% of the brands will be on the shelves by the end of the year. We feel pretty confident about that.
In terms of managing margins in that business, I think our team of leaders in Consumer have done a very good job of
managing in a very tough time. And they'll continue to do that, I'm sure, going forward. And as the OTC products
return to the marketplace, they'll continue to build back share. That's obviously a very profitable piece of the business,
so we would expect that they would improve their margins accordingly. I would caution, though, in terms of making
sure you understand that when these products come back to the market, we're going to do whatever we can to gain
share and invest appropriately behind them. So we think that investment now will more than pay off in the future. So
we would expect the return of profitability to be tempered in the Consumer business as we do the right things to bring
the products back to market.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: You're welcome.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: I did have one follow-up, if you don't mind, on INVOKANA. Perhaps you could talk about
the resources you are putting behind that launch. And I know we'll talk about this in a month or so at the PhRMA
[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America] meeting. But where do you see this class in the broader
spectrum of diabetes care? Thank you very much.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Rajeev. Let me defer the comment on the broader class of diabetes care until May 23,
when we have our experts there that, obviously, I hope you'll be there, as will others, to hear from our leaders who have
much more knowledge about that market. But we're obviously very pleased with having this approval of the first in its
class. And the indication, as you know, is broad, and the adverse event profile was very manageable. So we think this is
an important addition to the armamentarium of care for diabetes patients. And I'll let Joaquin Duato and others in our
business talk about the impact that they see overall in marketplace.
I would say that overall the Pharma business is doing well, really well, so we're very pleased with that. And the
launches have done incredibly well despite the fact that we've seen competition, as you all know. You all have written
very vividly about the new products coming to market in various classes like in XARELTO's class and in ZYTIGA's

class, but yet the products do well. So I say that because we have really focused our efforts on clinically differentiating
our products, and I say that about INVOKANA as well. And I think our scientific teams, led by Paul Stoffels and Bill
Hait, have done a great job of selecting the right clinical profile for the marketplace; and then coupled with the
commercial excellence that's led by Joaquin Duato and his team, that's a great combination. So we feel very good about
our progress in the pharmaceutical marketplace.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Thank you.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Did you have one more question?
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: I did, and I apologize. In know I'm dragging on. Just if you take the Pharma business, you
said it's doing quite well. In Consumer there's some opportunity for margin perhaps longer term. How do you feel about
the long-term margin trajectory of the company? And that's it for me, thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure. Rajeev, look; we have good healthy margins today. We're managing through what I
mentioned at our call in January when I was with you all that, as of now, we have $1 billion of cost of U.S. healthcare
legislation embedded in our business, and we're able to manage through that. So I give our business leaders around the
world a lot of credit for being able to manage in the various dynamics of the marketplace, including slower growth
markets and including areas of the business where cost pressures are continuing. So I think we've done a good job at
doing that and I expect we'll continue to do a good job at doing that, and we'll always keep a focus on investing
appropriately for the future. So each time we give guidance, hopefully you will get a clearer picture of how we're doing
that while also investing in the future. But I'll say it is not easy, but I give a lot of credit to the teams of people and
leaders around the world who are expert at being able to manage well in challenging times.

Your next question is from Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Derrick.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: I wanted to go back to procedure volumes, and in particular get some color from you on what
you're seeing in Europe. On the MD&D side, how much did the selling days impacted your European sales? And
maybe you can comment specifically on orthopedics. How much of the slowdown there was selling days versus
procedure volumes?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure. I'll ask Louise to help me with that. But of course in Europe, you have the dynamics
of the Easter holiday season as well that was in the first quarter of this year compared to the second quarter of last year.
And, Louise, maybe you can give some more specifics on the particular question that Derrick is asking.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Sure, so in the U.S. it was about one day, and in Europe it was probably about two days. And
that's rather a rough calculation, but it impacted growth about 1.5% in terms of sales, about 1% in the U.S. and about
2.5% outside the U.S.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay. But generally speaking, is your sense that – are you seeing change say from Q4 in terms
of austerity measures, procedure volumes, or things of that nature, anything noticeable that you'd call out?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: In terms of the austerity measures, it's very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. But
we are still feeling it as everybody else is feeling it. But we are the first company that's out, so we need to wait for the
others to report.

<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay. And while you're going through the numbers, Louise, would you mind giving us the
price/mix breakdown for hips, knees, and spine in the U.S.?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Sure. So hips in the U.S., in the first quarter price was down about 4%, and that's fairly
similar to what it was in the fourth quarter, a little bit less favorable, a little bit more unfavorable. And in terms of mix,
it was actually 1% favorable, so you came out to about 3% unfavorable for the hips.
In terms of knees, it's about 2% unfavorable, 1.5% to 2% unfavorable, and totally offset by favorable mix. We actually
come to about 0.5 point favorable on the knees.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: And what about spine?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: And in terms of spine, we are about 3% negative in price. And again, this is only U.S. And
we are positive in terms of mix by about 4%, so netting about 1% positive.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay, great. Thank you, and maybe just one more quickly for Dominic. I noticed that in your
special items, you increased the accrual due to pending litigation on product liability. I was just wondering if you could
comment there, remind us on the total amount of accruals that you're taking. And maybe also you can comment on how
the pending product litigation might impact your thinking around use of cash as you move forward. Just help us get
comfortable with that.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: With respect to the total accrual comment there, I'm not going to comment specifically, and
I'll just refer you to our 10-K disclosures regarding the status of all the various legal matters.
In terms of use of cash, these litigation accruals obviously sometimes extend for years until the actual cash is disbursed.
So although we contemplate it in our cash planning, I don't necessarily associate the specific accrual in any one quarter
or in any one year with the cash impact in any quarter or any one year. And I'm happy to say, as you know, we generate
substantially strong cash flows year in and year out, and obviously we'll continue to focus on that.

<Q - Tony Butler>: Thanks very much and good morning.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Good morning.
<Q - Tony Butler>: I'd like to focus just for a minute, if we could, within the Pharmaceutical division and particularly
again with ZYTIGA. There was a patient assistance program in Q4. I assume that had concluded and actually led to
fairly substantial sales in Q1. And I'm curious if we can break that apart. That is to say, does that effect continue into
Q2?
The second part of the question is around international demand, which was up 22% sequentially and, again, very, very
strong demand. Was that due to new countries which were added? I realize, Louise, I think you mentioned 70-odd, 79
particular countries which were approved, but still extremely strong growth. And I recognize that there was pre-chemo
approval earlier in the year. Was that the principal driver? And the last question again on the same product really, is
there any attempt to give some consideration or strategy around the patent extension of the product? Thanks very much.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: I'll take the first one on the patient assistance. So we have a patient assistance program in
place and it continues to be in place. It's part of what we do for all of our products. What you saw in the fourth quarter
was a replenishment to the wholesale with certain of the ZYTIGA products, so it has nothing to do with whether or not

we implemented a patient assistance program. We always have patient assistance programs in place for people that
need the products.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: With respect to the balance of the questions on ZYTIGA, I'm going to not comment
currently on the status of patent extension strategies except to say that obviously our teams are working on that.
In terms of the overall impact of ZYTIGA's worldwide sales, other than what Louise mentioned on patient assistance,
which is not really a major impact, the major impacts you did see were the chemo-naïve indication. And you're
absolutely right, Tony; a number of new markets outside the U.S., specifically in Europe, came online during the
quarter and will continue to come online for the balance of the year. So those two factors, pre-chemo and additional
country approvals, are the major drivers of the uptick in ZYTIGA sales.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thanks very much, Dominic.

Your next question is from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Rick.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Good morning, Louise. Good morning, Dominic; a couple things. Dominic, back to the U.S.
weakness question, did you actually expect stronger U.S. performance ex all the noise? And did the acceleration, did
the weakness that you clearly saw and are talking about, did it accelerate or pick up throughout the quarter, or was it
just consistently below fourth quarter trends?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Rick, good morning. Just to clarify your question, the weakness that you're referring to in
the U.S. is in the Medical Device business, not in Pharma and not in Consumer.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Exactly.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: And you're right; there was a lot of noise in the quarter, and we tried to parse through that.
But after parsing through all the noise, including selling days, et cetera, Louise's data indicated – Louise's comments
indicated that overall the Medical Device business is probably flat or modestly increased in the first quarter. The major
driver of that is, in fact, the utilization trends that we did not see accelerate in the first quarter across primarily the
surgery businesses, including outpatient surgeries, et cetera, and some competitive pressures that I mentioned earlier.
So I can't comment specifically month by month in the quarter, but I would say that overall the trends that we saw a
modest uptick in the fourth quarter did not persist into the first quarter. So whether that's seasonality and how people
use their high-deductible insurance plans, we'll have to wait and see as others report, but that may be a contributing
factor. And we expected to see some of that in the first quarter.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: And I think you also mentioned, Dominic, that hospital inventory levels were down, I would say
again because I thought we would be through most of that process. Is there much more to go there, or is that actually
something encouraging for later quarters?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I think that in this particular quarter, from the best information we have is related to system
implementations and other factors in the particular distributors that we deal with and not something that we would
expect to continue happening for the remaining quarters of the year.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Okay, and one last one. At the January Analyst Day, obviously by talking about exploring
strategic alternatives for Diagnostics, it seemed like Alex, both by that statement and just his tone, was signaling a bit
more active stance toward portfolio review. You're always buying and selling and reviewing. But should we expect a

little more active stance now with Alex onboard and given the ongoing challenges? Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Rick. I think as Alex mentioned in his commentary that we always, obviously, look at
our portfolio in a strategic way. I think with changes in the marketplace that we see happening in healthcare, I think it's
even more important for us to be very discerning and very deliberate about the places we will play in, where we can
make a big difference and areas where we may not be able to make a difference or where, in fact, the investment may
not be worth it or the property may be better in someone else's hands. So I don't know that it's precisely related to just
Alex being on board, although that has always been a strategic focus of Alex even before he became CEO. But I think
it's also how we adapt and how our management teams adapt to an ever-changing marketplace. So I think we'll
continue to be deliberate in that regard, and obviously we'll update you along the way.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Thanks so much.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: You're welcome.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Next question, please?
Operator
Your next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Dominic, can you just elaborate a little bit further on the Managed Medicaid true-up?
I'm confused about that. That came out of left field. You had talked about how that impacted immunology and
neurology products. Is that a one-time impact, or do these growth rates reflect the organic growth rates that we should
anticipate going forward? How do we think about that with respect to the numbers going forward for future quarters?
And the other question relates to sequestration. You have a number of products that are reimbursed through Medicare
Part B, including REMICADE. And as you know, there was a 2% reduction to Medicare Part B, which impacts Part B's
ASP plus 6%. So obviously, Q1 didn't reflect this. But are you seeing anything out there that could have some impact
on your Medicare Part B business? Thanks very much.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Jami, thanks for the question. With respect to the adjustment for the Managed
Medicaid rebates, and I'll let Louise provide some additional color here, it's pretty obvious that that level of adjustment
is not really reflective of the current run rate of the product. So Louise in her comments described the fact that,
excluding that adjustment, the Pharmaceutical business in the U.S. and worldwide was – the underlying growth rate
was 8%. So it's not the 14% or 11% that you saw in the numbers because that would be less than transparent if we told
you that. But the underlying growth rate of 8% is something we're very – quite proud of, to be honest. Nonetheless,
even despite that adjustment, the business is doing very well with a very healthy growth rate of 8%.
This adjustment, as I mentioned earlier, relates to a catch-up of Medicaid rebates for Managed Medicaid in the states
under the new legislation. And various states across the United States have provided this information most recently to
all pharmaceutical players and us in particular. We took a look at all that data now that we have it in hand, although it's
not all in hand. There may be some additional adjustments going forward, and we'll be transparent again if that should
happen. Having said that, the level of rebates in the states that we previously had predicted are now predicted to be
lower. That's why we included this adjustment in our sales because we had previously reflected too high a rebate for
example. So going forward, although the adjustment may not be that significant, the overall level of rebates are
expected to be lower than we previously thought.
And with respect to Medicaid (sic) [Medicare] Part B and REMICADE, we're obviously aware of the sequestration
impact. And you're right REMICADE is a significant product that's reimbursed under Medicare Part B. and beginning
in April, we instituted a program with our REMICADE infusion customers under contract to receive a discount on the
continued use of REMICADE to help them deal with and help them offset the impact of this reimbursement that they'll
see.

<A - Louise Mehrotra>: And just for some context, REMICADE is about a third Medicare, and PROCRIT also
impacts it. It's about 60% Medicare.

Your next question is from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Swann.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Danielle.
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Okay, good morning.
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the Synthes integration and how that's
going, particularly on any potential sales force turnover side and if there is any change to when we could see accretion
on the EPS side of things from Synthes. And to follow up on Rick's question about potentially more activity on the
M&A and/or divestiture front, in the context of the med tech markets that we live in today, so specifically the MD&D
business, where do you see potential opportunities? Understanding that you just made this big acquisition of Synthes,
but maybe even something smaller or another big acquisition, where do you see opportunities in med tech for growth
over the next five-plus years? Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right. Danielle, the integration of Synthes is going well. I would say that the challenge, as
we expected, was going to be in the area of integrating the spine sales forces. And you may recall that we converted our
current legacy DePuy Spine business from a distributor based system to a direct selling basis, which is what Synthes
had in mind – was doing. And we had always expected that that would be the way to go in the marketplace. So we've
completed that transition, and I would say there's some disruption that we've seen as a result, not totally unexpected,
but in fact some disruption. But we think that's a short-term issue because we think that the long-term benefit of having
a direct sales force plus the combination of the two portfolios is something that will allow us to compete very
effectively in the spine space.
In terms of accretion, the focus of the business integration now is really on sales synergies, and we're starting to see
some sales synergies. It's too early to give you a specific number on that. The focus is primarily on sales synergies as
opposed to cost synergies. And we expect that that will improve as the integration continues to progress throughout this
year and into next.
And with respect to M&A and divestiture activities, we're very active always in M&A and divestiture activity, as you
know. And with our broad base in healthcare and our broad purview of the medical device sector, we look at all areas
of medical devices to see where we can make a difference. And what enters into our calculus, Danielle, as you've heard
me say before, is not only where we like to play, but where we think the asset is not only better in our hands, but has a
current valuation that's attractive to us and is not, for example, overvalued. So we'll always look at that. I can't give you
any specifics. But with a broad-based medical device business that we have, there are lots of areas for us to look at to
improve on if, in fact, that acquisition would create shareholder value. That's our number one criterion when looking at
the acquisition potential.
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Okay, perfect, one quick follow-up on spine, if I could, any changes to underlying
reimbursement trends there?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I haven't seen anything in particular in the data. Louise, have you seen anything?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Not that I'm aware of.

Operator
And your final question is from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Good morning, thanks so much for squeezing us in. I guess just to follow up, and I'm sorry to
beat this dead horse here on the utilization side. But, Dominic, just to clarify, the comments that you're making about
trends, general surgery trends, in the past sometimes these have been coming out of your suture business and the scope
and visibility you have into surgery, and in the past sometimes that has been a trailing indicator. I'm wondering, just to
be clear, these metrics that you're able to provide color up through March, or is part of this through December? Just a
clarification, and then I have one follow-up.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Let me have Louise answer that. She has the data right in front of her.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So we have good data up until the fourth quarter. And as you know, we're one of the first
ones out in the first quarter, but we do have model market research. We have a very good team that extracts data from
other company reports, from quite frankly analyst reports. So that's an amalgamation of it. It's not precise. It's where we
think it's directional at this point in time. And of course, we'll know a lot more once we get the data from other
companies.
There's some noise in our suture numbers in the quarter. And if I take out that noise in the suture numbers, it's flat on
worldwide basis and it's actually positive about 2% on a U.S. basis, excluding the noise that we had in our own
numbers at that point.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: And how would that compare to the prior quarter?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Similar results, similar.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Okay, so sutures similar sideways, if you will, from a growth standpoint.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Yes.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: And then the other follow-up I had was on – I appreciate all the color on price and mix. You
had given some particular color on spine over the last few quarters, and I guess knees and spine have started to trend
positive on a price plus mix basis. Having lived through the last several years, that's an anomaly a little bit for us, I
think. And I just wanted to get a sense if you have any color as to what's improving there. What's enabling you to
moderate the pricing pressure or get back on the – effectively drive mix?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: I think mix comes from innovation of new products, and that's where the positive mix impact
is coming from.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: That's right, Louise. We can't ever lose track of the fact that innovation is the name of the
game in all these markets. So as we continue to innovate, hopefully we'll get a positive mix equation out of it. And
that's what our leaders and folks in the labs and our engineers, et cetera, are totally focused on, and they do a pretty
good job of it. So we'll just continue to look for that as hopeful in terms of mix being positive because overall price,
regardless of mix, is going to be pretty hard to come by, as you all know. So our focus has always been and needs to
continue to be on innovating in these markets.

Dominic J. Caruso
Sure, Louise, thanks. Thanks, everyone, for tuning in today. As I said earlier, we're off to a very good start in Q1, and
we remain optimistic for the remainder of the year. We see further opportunities to drive growth in this dynamic level
marketplace as our new products, our robust pipelines, and even our core businesses continue to address the critical
unmet healthcare needs of patients and customers.
I would like to again thank the people of Johnson & Johnson for their dedication and commitment, and I look forward
to updating you all on our progress throughout the year, including at our upcoming Pharmaceutical business review on
May 23. So thanks for your time this morning and have a great day.
