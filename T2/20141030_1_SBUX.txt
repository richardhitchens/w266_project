Operator
Good afternoon. My name is Mike and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines

Before I turn the call over to Howard, I want to once again extend an invitation for you to join us here in Seattle on
December 4 for our Biennial Investor Day. The event kicks off Wednesday evening with a reception at our new
Roastery which we're very excited to unveil, followed on Thursday by presentations and on-site experiences here at our
headquarters. Please contact Investor Relations if you need more information, and we hope to see you here in early
December.
With that, let me turn the call over to Howard.
Howard S. Schultz
Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Starbucks' record Q4 and fiscal 2014 financial and
operating results again demonstrate the power and relevancy of the Starbucks brand and the success and scalability of
our operating strategies and global business model.
Meaningful contributions from each of our business units drove a better than 10% increase in Q4 revenues, to a record
$4.2 billion, while improved store operations enabled us to deliver an elevated experience for our customers and our
19th consecutive quarter of comp store sales growth at or above 5%. Sales leverage, increased operating efficiency, and
disciplined expense management each contributed to a 280 basis point increase in operating margin over last year to a
record 20.5%, and a 23% increase in non-GAAP earnings to a Q4 record of $0.74 per share.
For the full fiscal year, Starbucks grew revenues by 11% to a record $16.4 billion, posted global comp store sales
growth of 6%, squarely in line with our targets, and grew non-GAAP EPS by 21% to a record $2.66 per share.
Starbucks performance in fiscal 2014 was extraordinary by any metric or comparison, and results remain even more
stunning by the fact that they were achieved in the face of continued challenging retail and consumer environments, the
accelerating shift in consumer behavior from bricks-and-mortar to e-commerce purchasing, and on the heels of 7%
comp growth in fiscal 2013.
I've spent many of these calls discussing the quarter or year ahead, but today I'm going to leave that to Troy and Scott
and instead layout for you a roadmap that demonstrates how Starbucks is positioned to benefit from the massive
cultural shift in consumer behavior underway, and how we will continue to lead, thrive, and win in fiscal 2015 and
beyond. The most meaningful changes are long-term game changers, but I'll begin with immediate plans that will drive
results this holiday.
For this holiday season, officially starting for millions of consumers in the U.S. and around the world this Saturday
when Starbucks cups turn red, we've completely re-imagined our in-store experience. We have great seasonal offerings
from La Boulange and are introducing an innovative new handcrafted beverage, Chestnut Praline Latte, a beverage that
resonated strongly with customers in test markets and will add incrementality as the next iconic holiday beverage.
And we've reoriented our approach to gifting. Last holiday, Starbucks benefited enormously from the consumer shift
towards gift giving cards instead of traditional physical goods. For us, that translated into our record card sales, roughly
one in eight Americans receiving a Starbucks gift card, and $1.4 billion in Q1 card loads last fiscal year. This holiday,
we will create even more passion and excitement for Starbucks gift cards by offering 100 beautiful, unique, and
proprietary new card designs merchandised on an engaging, freestanding card wall and supported by social media to
encourage engagement and peer-to-peer sharing. And we will have greatly expanded our e-commerce merchandising
offerings as well.

But the big driver this year is our promotional overlay of Starbucks for Life. During the five-week period beginning
December 2, at the heart of the Christmas shopping season, every customer who uses a gift card or their MSR account
to pay can win one of almost 500,000 food and beverage prices. And 13 lucky cardholders in North America will win
Starbucks for Life. Customers have been trying to buy Starbucks for Life for decades, but we have never offered it and
you still can't buy it. But this holiday season, 13 Starbucks cardholders or MSR members will win it. Our Starbucks for
Life promotion and external marketing plans will ignite social media channels through our customers into our stores
and drive significant loyalty into the flywheel of Starbucks.
Today, Starbucks is approaching 1,400 stores in China, and customer engagement with our brand has never been
stronger. We continue to expand and leverage our mobile, digital, and loyalty assets and become an increasing relevant
part of the daily ritual for a rapidly growing customer base. As a result, Starbucks comp growth in China routinely
outpaces segment comp growth in China overall. And with passionate, world-class senior leaders and store partners
drawn from local communities within China and demand for all things Starbucks in China so strong, we are now
opening an average of one new store every day, a pace that would only accelerate for years to come. These are still the
early days of Starbucks' growth and development in China despite the fact that it is one of our strongest markets in the
world.
Turning to Japan. Last month, we entered into an agreement to acquire the shares in Starbucks Japan we did not already
own. Opened in 1996 in our first country market outside of North America, Japan today represents over 1,000 stores.
Besides being EPS-accretive in year one, when completed, the transaction will enable us to increase the pace of new
store openings that have benefited us in the U.S., China, and certainly in other markets around the world, and expand
the availability of Starbucks products in multiple CPG channels. We will also be able to leverage more fully our loyalty
digital mobile and new product development programs in Japan.
Turning to EMEA. I'm pleased to report that our EMEA business has been transformed and turned around, just as we
had promised, and that Q4 represented EMEA's best quarter in years, with particularly strong performance in the UK
As good as Q4 was, you will continue to see the EMEA get even better in the quarters ahead.
Now let me turn to coffee. For years, we have dreamed of a single place where we would capture all the passion, all the
ambition, all the magic of coffee in one extraordinary dynamic space. Those of you who come to Seattle for our
Investor Day in December will see that vision come to life in the most unique and extraordinary consumer experience
ever seen, the Starbucks Roastery and Tasting Room. The Roastery will shine a bright light on everything Starbucks. It
will seamlessly integrate coffee roasting and food, beverage and merchandise retailing into an immersive consumer
experience that showcases Starbucks' coffee heritage, the craft of small-batch roasting, and innovative new coffee
brewing methods, culminating in each cup of coffee being handcrafted right from the roaster. We will combine the
beauty and romance of super-premium micro lot coffees with moments of connection and discovery for our customers.
But perhaps the greatest value of the Roastery is that it will anchor a new Starbucks super-premium coffee sub-brand,
Starbucks Reserve, identified not by the Starbucks brand itself but by a capital R and a star that defines the upper limit
of what is possible in coffee, just as other authentic, super-premium brands have done in other industries and formed
the foundation for an entirely new Starbucks Reserve retail store platform and business unit. The first of 100 or more
Reserve stores we plan to open around the world will be opening in San Francisco very soon. And the Roastery will be
the first of several we plan to open in select markets around the world beginning in fiscal 2016.
Beyond the experience itself, the proprietary design, technology and capacity we have built into the Roastery will
enable us to substantially increase production of rare and limited-availability coffees and to double the number of
Starbucks stores offering packaged Starbucks Reserve coffees to 1,500 worldwide by the end of fiscal 2015. And I can
assure you that no other coffee company in the world will be able to offer a higher quality coffee than a coffee labeled
Starbucks Reserve. With the Roastery and with Starbucks Reserve, Starbucks will further elevate the premium end of
the coffee industry, extend our coffee leadership and authority, and create further separation from every other coffee
company in the world.
Let me turn to Teavana. The Teavana acquisition provided Starbucks with a unique entrée into the $90 billion global
hot and iced tea category, a category we feel strongly is ripe for innovation and reinvention. Last year, we opened our

first Teavana Tea Bar on Manhattan's Upper East Side and we now have a total of six Teavana Tea Bars. I was at the
opening our newest New York City Teavana Tea Bar on 9th Street and Broadway just last week and was taken by the
energy and customer excitement in the store. I urge you all to visit the store yourself and envision the national and
global footprint of Teavana stores that Starbucks will create.
Sales of handcrafted Teavana beverages, such as Teavana Oprah Chai and Teavana Shaken Iced Tea and sale of
Teavana premium loose leaf teas through Starbucks' global store base were always a core strategic focus of the
acquisition. Today, we're already seeing Teavana products drive incrementality at Starbucks stores in North America.
At the same time, they build brand awareness and add new customers for Teavana. In fact, Teavana Shaken Iced Teas
were the single most profitable addition to our menu last year.
Now let me comment on digital, card, mobile, loyalty and payments. I want to talk to you about the intersection of
three powerful consumer trends, the convergence of which bodes extremely well for Starbucks over the long-term. The
shift in consumer behavior that has people spending less time shopping in bricks-and-mortar stores and more time
online that I first discussed with you after Q1. The established, long-term trend of people consuming more and more
food and beverage away from home and the tremendous growth of online activity from mobile devices allowing
consumers to conveniently conduct their lives, including commerce, from wherever they happen to be.
What is actually occurring is a cultural shift in time allocation, away from retail experiences people have felt forced to
undertake and towards retail experiences that people want to enjoy with convenience as the key enabler. Starbucks is
uniquely well positioned to benefit from this convergence as a destination experience. Visiting a Starbucks has always
been an elective choice, a place people choose to frequent and, as a result, a place that is vastly less dependent on
intercepting retail traffic for sales growth. The relevance of the Starbucks experience, the desirability of our coffee and
food and the ambience and feeling of community within our stores sets us apart from our competitors and are unique
drivers that will continue to support our growth. On top of this, we continue to see consumers favor retailers who
improve their customer experience through the integration of convenient mobile technology.
And while Starbucks is today an uncontested leader in mobile, we will continue to innovate and lead around all things
mobile in order to attract additional users of our app and provide an enhanced and simplified experience for our
customers: innovations that will drive traffic and incrementality and create further attachment and customer
engagement. By way of example, in September we launched our new Starbucks app for Android with Shake to Pay
functionality in the U.S., UK, and Canada and also digital tipping in the U.S. And Starbucks' iOS app now has Uber
integration, enabling customers to click on a ride to their local Starbucks.
But perhaps the single most important technology innovation we will introduce this year is Mobile Order and Pay
which debuts in Portland in December and will be rolled out nationwide in 2015. And while many people are talking
about mobile and pay, what Starbucks is going to do and execute is quite different than anyone else in the marketplace.
Consumers today are no longer willing to accept convenience only around the purchase of readily available or
commodity-based products; they want convenience around the purchase of premium products like Starbucks as well.
One way we are addressing that need is through an accelerated expansion of Starbucks' portfolio of high-profitable,
drive-thru stores.
But our research confirms that we can drive even more traffic and incrementality and offer even more customers more
convenience in more locations by allowing them to place orders ahead of time via their mobile devices and pick their
orders up without waiting in line. Starbucks' Mobile Order and Pay is a totally unique technology. It seamlessly
integrates mobile ordering and our proprietary loyalty program with point-of-sale and store operations, enables us to
enhance our customer experience, exceed our customers' expectations of convenience, and extend customer loyalty.
And as you will see in a few weeks, no company in any industry offers any technology remotely like Starbucks' Mobile
Order and Pay; plus, we get the added benefit of increased store throughput and speed of service to all our customers.
And we will drive a further step-change in customer loyalty and engagement by extending express order and pay to
include food and beverage delivery – yes, food and beverage delivery, in select markets during the second half of 2015.
Imagine the ability to create a standing order at Starbucks, delivered hot or iced to your desk daily. That's our version
of e-commerce on steroids. All of this will grow Starbucks Rewards, our loyalty program that now has 8 million active

members, up 23% over Q4 last year, and has been launched in 26 countries. And we will roll out an enhanced My
Starbucks Rewards program, providing even greater benefits to members in 2015, further accelerating MSR
membership growth, and we have several initiatives underway that will grow membership in the short-term and
surprise and delight our customers.
Finally, while we have been investing in the development of our world-class mobile technologies for many years, and
there has been a great deal of activity and speculation around the mobile payment space recently, mobile payment and
consumer adoption of the technology overall is still in its infancy. Please consider this metric. In 2013, payment for
purchases by use of all mobile devices in the U.S. totaled $1.3 billion. That was the entire market. Now listen to this.
With over 90% of those purchases taking place in a Starbucks store, that means we had 90% share of mobile payments
in 2013, while bricks-and-mortar commerce in 2013 totaled more than $4.2 trillion.
Now what you're going to see in the years ahead will be a rapid acceleration in mobile device purchases and a
continued significant migration away from bricks-and-mortar commerce. There's obviously a huge prize there, and
that's why you're seeing so much activity around the payment space from all kinds of companies. That's why every tech
and financial service company in the world is totally – is today chasing the mobile payment opportunity. Yet while
these companies may have vast hardware and software development capabilities, and this is the key point here,
Starbucks is the only local, national, or global business of any kind to succeed in crossing both the most difficult and
the most critical chasm standing between success and failure in mobile payment, transforming consumer behavior.
We've accomplished this by integrating the convenience of mobile payment to a compelling and enjoyable program
that gives our customers rewards. Already, close to 7 million transactions per week, 16% of all transactions conducted
in U.S. Starbucks stores, occurs via a customer's use of a mobile device. No company and no retail store, domestically
or internationally, even comes close. And while that figure has been growing by almost 50% per year, the real growth
is yet to come.
Starbucks Coffee Company has cracked the code at tying mobile payment to loyalty, and we are now receiving great
interest in partnerships from mobile payment companies who see the value of our Rewards program and the mobile
payment behavior we established. But we will play our hand wisely with a long-term view, carefully choosing our
partners and how we leverage our assets to take advantage of the revenue and profit opportunities in loyalty and mobile
payment ahead. But I can assure you that Starbucks will have a major role to play, both inside and outside of our stores,
as the nascent mobile payment industry evolves.
On Veterans Day, November 11, just two weeks from now, in keeping with Starbucks' values and guiding principles
and in conjunction with the publication next week of a book I co-authored with Rajiv Chandrasekaran, "For Love Of
Country: What Our Veterans Can Teach Us About Citizenship, Heroism and Sacrifice," Starbucks, HBO and Chase
will be hosting a free, nationally televised concert on the Mall in Washington, D.C. to honor our veterans of the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan who have given so much so we may enjoy our freedom, our families, and our lives. Over 200,000
people are expected on the Mall with an A-list performer list which includes Bruce Springsteen, Rihanna, Eminem,
Carrie Underwood and many others. Don't miss it.
Lastly, we're looking forward to welcoming many of you, as JoAnn already shared with you, to Seattle for our biannual
Investor Day on December 4, our first conference in our hometown since 2006, and to sharing with you details around
new food and beverage innovations, re-imagined store designs and new store formats, Mobile Order and Pay,
expansion of our Evening program to drive further incrementality, elevation of our partner and customer experiences
and many other initiatives that will demonstrate how Starbucks will continue to grow and to win in fiscal 2015 and long
into the future. And I'm beyond thrilled to share with you the spectacular new Roastery.
I'll now pass the call over to Troy and Scott to discuss our operating and financial performance in Q4 and fiscal 2014
and provide an update of our fiscal 2015 outlook. But before I do, I just want to say one thing. When I look at the
results – and this is not on the script – when I look at the results of this year, the stunning accomplishments on so many
levels, and I hear somebody being disappointed with a 5% comp on a base of over 7,500 stores, I've just got to ask
myself, is there any company in your universe putting up these kinds of numbers? And the answer is no. And I can tell
you, from my point of view and from everyone involved at Starbucks, we are just getting started.

Troy?
Troy Alstead
Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon everyone. 2014 was an incredibly strong record year for Starbucks across the
board. Each of our reportable segments set new fourth quarter records for revenue and operating income. The results
we reported today are that much more significant when considered against the backdrop of the very soft global retail
environment in which they were accomplished. The hard work and dedication of our Starbucks partners have enabled
us to be where we are today and we have the solid foundation needed to continue to profitably grow both emerging and
existing lines of business into the future.
I will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 performance for each reporting business and then turn
the discussion over to Scott for additional details, along with an update on targets for fiscal 2015.
For the total company in the fourth quarter, we produced net revenue of $4.2 billion, up 10% from the same period in
fiscal 2013. In a difficult consumer environment, we delivered comparable store sales growth up 5% in the quarter,
driven by a 4% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in traffic. And new store openings continued at a healthy
pace, with 503 net new stores opened in the fourth quarter.
In terms of segment results, the Americas net revenue for the quarter was $3.0 billion, a 9% increase over the same
period last year. The increase was primarily driven by a 5% increase in comparable store sales, comprised of a 1%
increase in traffic and a 4% increase in average ticket. Incremental revenues from 698 net new store openings over the
past 12 months also contributed to the growth in revenue.
While we delivered comparable store sales growth solidly within our stated target range for the consolidated business
in all segments, both for the quarter and the year, like others in retail, we are feeling the impact of the consumer
uncertainty in today's economic environment. We're not satisfied with 1% traffic growth in the Americas and are taking
immediate steps to grow traffic. I will share with you some specific plans to do just that, including some exciting new
initiatives launching in the next few weeks. I'd like to underscore that we are very encouraged with several key
performance indicators in our fourth quarter results that speak to the health of our business.
First, our new stores are driving incremental traffic, serving untapped demand and, for a second consecutive year,
maintaining record levels of first-year performance. These stores are increasingly contributing to traffic and revenue
growth, a clear indication that we're opening stores in the right places and in the right formats, which provide us with a
solid foundation for future growth.
Second, similar to the third quarter, ticket growth was among the highest in the last several years, with the growth
primarily driven by beverage and food mix and attach. Pricing once again contributed one point to total comp growth,
consistent with the prior four quarters.
Third, all dayparts grew over the prior year. And while more than 45% of our traffic is in the morning before 11 AM,
we saw strong growth in the midday between 11 AM and 3 PM. This is another encouraging sign that our food and
beverage innovations geared toward expanding the afternoon daypart are gaining momentum with customers, which
brings me to another key highlight of our fourth quarter performance – food.
Food again contributed two points to Americas comp growth this quarter, representing double-digit revenue growth
over the prior year. Our expanded breakfast sandwich platform drove the majority of the increase in food comp,
bolstered by significantly higher attach rates. We are very encouraged that our premium breakfast sandwich platform is
performing extremely well. Our bakery and lunch platforms also delivered strong revenue growth. The introduction of
two new lunch sandwiches at the end of last quarter has created new interest in all our warm sandwich offerings, which
indicates that Starbucks is increasingly recognized by our customers as an attractive option for lunch.
In addition to sales growth, we achieved margin enhancement from a variety of supply chain improvements. The
insights we gained from the rollout of La Boulange Bakery and new lunch offerings have enabled us to refine our

execution. The most significant impact we're seeing is a reduction in waste, which flows directly to bottom line. We've
also simplified work routines in our stores with the implementation of a food management tool. Our partners have
responded positively to the changes and we're seeing the benefit in margin improvement.
And finally, we continue to analyze our product offerings and make adjustments to ensure that the items we offer are
those that will truly make a difference to our customers in terms of routine, relevance, and loyalty. Our Teavana,
hand-shaken iced teas helped drive more than 20% growth in our iced tea platform. Overall, we saw double-digit
growth in entire tea category over the fourth quarter last year with the growth coming from across the entire platform
from our base products to our limited-time offerings.
We're very pleased with the strong performance we've seen in the early days of Teavana in Starbucks stores and we
believe that we are at the very nascent stage of what promises to be a tremendous growth opportunity for tea in the
future.
Moving onto our store formats. In the U.S., our highly profitable drive-thru stores, which account for 42% of our
company-operated store portfolio, generated nearly 50% of sales and 55% of total company-operated store profit in Q4.
Drive-thrus achieved comp growth in Q4 that outpaced the overall portfolio with more than 60% coming from
out-the-window sales, reinforcing the importance and relevance of convenience to our customers. We are very
encouraged by these results and expect them to grow as we continue to focus on improving productivity at peak and
delivering an enhanced customer experience. Overall, I'm very pleased with the results from our Americas segment. As
Scott will discuss in further detail, operating margin for this segment increased a phenomenal 260 basis points over the
prior year, a tremendous accomplishment considering the size of the Americas business.
Now turning to EMEA where the momentum that has been building all year culminated in a remarkable finish in the
fourth quarter. The region delivered strong 10% revenue growth in the quarter, attributable to favorable foreign
currency exchange, 5% comp growth, and incremental revenue from 171 net new stores opened in the last 12 months.
This represented the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comps driven by a 2% lift in traffic and a 2% rise in average
ticket. The two-year comp at 7% represents the highest two-year comp in the past three years.
For a second consecutive quarter, the UK comp was slightly higher than the overall segment comp growth of the
quarter. The major driver of this increase was food, once again driven primarily by up-leveling our breakfast and lunch
platforms. Another major market in the EMEA business, Germany, also achieved comp growth that outpaced the
regions for a second consecutive quarter. We are very pleased with this result because it was Germany's sixth
consecutive quarter of positive comp growth.
As the store mix of the EMEA portfolio shifts, it's important to look at how our licensed stores in that segment are
doing. We're very pleased that several license markets comped above the segment results for our company-operated
stores with two markets reaching double-digit comp growth. This further demonstrates the strength of the Starbucks
brand across the region where today 62% of our stores in EMEA are licensed. The turnaround in this region has been
both remarkable and well balanced, from improving the customer experience to up-leveling product offerings to
expanding margin through process and supply chain efficiencies, and profitably restructuring our store portfolio. I'm
very pleased with the ongoing level of improvement from our EMEA business and the rapid pace at which the
improvement is occurring.
Turning to the China, Asia Pacific region. Our fourth quarter results were strong once again. Total net revenue grew
21% to $310 million in Q4, a new all-time record and represents the 17th consecutive quarter with revenue growth in
excess of 20%. The largest drivers of this growth were incremental revenue from 742 net new stores opened over the
past 12 months and 5% comp growth for the quarter. Comp growth was entirely attributable to increased traffic, with
ticket declining in the quarter partially due to lower sales of seasonal packaged food offerings in China. Most
importantly, the region's strong 6% traffic growth sustained the trend from the third quarter, demonstrating the
tremendous strength of the Starbucks brand in the CAP region.
We ended the year with 4,624 stores in this region, including 199 net new stores opened during the fourth quarter. 120
of these new openings were in China, a fourth quarter record. A particular significance is that our new stores in China

are exceeding the year one pro forma sales we projected. These results and the investments we've made across the
region, including our pending acquisition of Starbucks Japan, gives us great confidence and optimism about our future
performance in the CAP segment.
Finally, the Channel Development. The momentum we saw in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. This
segment achieved a new record for quarterly revenue, almost $400 million, resulting in 12% growth over the prior year.
The increase was primarily driven by sales of K-Cups which rose 26% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the strength of
core product sales and success of the product innovation and limited-time offerings. Our flavors platform grew with the
introduction of two new flavors in July, Cinnamon Dolce and Mocha. Our seasonal limited-time offering, Fall Blend,
was also successful.
We're pleased that our diverse portfolio of K-Cup offerings contributes to our leadership position down the aisle in
premium at-home coffee. We're confident we can maintain our market-leading position in premium packaged roast and
ground coffee as well, despite the continued shift in consumer preference towards single-serve coffee and our strong
position in that category, continuing innovation combined with our unique unmatched cross-channel My Starbucks
Rewards program, as the keys driving that continued leadership position. In fiscal 2014, 1.5 million of the 8 million
members of our loyalty program earned stars through the Grocery channel.
And now to recap our full year 2014 results, which were also very impressive. At the consolidated level, we achieved
record revenue, operating income, and operating margin. Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2014 increased 11% to $16.4
billion. The increase was primarily due to a 6% increase in comparable store sales, comprised of a 3% increase in
traffic and a 3% increase in average ticket. Incremental revenues from 1,599 net new stores opened over the past 12
months also contributed to the growth in revenue.
Of the new stores we opened, 1,029 were licensed, demonstrating the strength of the Starbucks brand and the valuable
licensed partnerships we've established around the world. We achieved a number of major milestones in 2014. We
completed the La Boulange Bakery rollout in all company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. We announced the
planned acquisition of Starbucks Japan, our first international market outside North America. And our Channel
Development business delivered both double-digit top and bottom line growth to the year. We shipped approximately
750 million K-Cups during 2014, giving us confidence that we can reach the 1 billion mark in 2015.
As we move into 2015, our priorities for our food program will be to continue to lean in on the success of our breakfast
sandwiches, evolve our lunch program by introducing new items, and add several hundred Evening stores as we move
the program into the full launch phase that thoughtfully leverages the insights we gained during the test period. On the
digital front, we will be intently focused on learning from the Mobile Order and Pay pilot we will be launching in
December, in anticipation of the full U.S. rollout later in calendar 2015. We will demonstrate our commitment to
staying ahead of the shift to e-commerce through a completely re-imagined in-store holiday experience. We will
continue to grow our coffee leadership position in our stores and at home through store formats and product innovation
that is relevant for our customers, including the Roastery and the forthcoming Starbucks Reserve sub-brand in stores.
We will create new occasions through our tea platform. We will grow the store base with innovative store designs and
formats. We will complete the acquisition and the integration of Starbucks Japan and begin unleashing new growth
opportunities in that market. And we will begin rolling out the first phase of a multi-year investment in the partner
experience. This will include higher start rates in all U.S. markets starting in January, a new performance recognition
and reward mechanism, improved shift schedules, the introduction of a food benefit, and continued expansion of the
Starbucks College Achievement Plan through Arizona State University. During our Investor Day in Seattle on
December 4, we'll provide additional depth on these initiatives and much, much more. I look forward to seeing you
here for that event.
I'll now turn the call over to Scott to provide more details on the fourth quarter and full year 2014, as well as our 2015
targets. Scott?

Thanks, Troy, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full year 2014 saw strong financial growth and
profitability for Starbucks. Our results were once again driven by the customer experience, delivered by our partners
around the world.
Q4 revenue grew 10% and our strong comp store sales of 5% once again showed the strength of our brand in a difficult
environment. One of the most significant financial items to highlight is the 280 basis point increase in non-GAAP
operating margin, reflecting our ongoing ability to leverage operating costs and control cost of goods sold. This is the
highest level of non-GAAP operating margin expansion we have driven in nearly four years. Before I go into specifics,
I want to ensure that everyone is clear on what we are including in our non-GAAP adjustments for comparison
purposes. For both 2013 and 2014, we have excluded charges and adjustments related to the Kraft litigation. We have
also excluded the gains, losses, and costs from certain transactions related to equity interests, and retail operations in
specific geographies. You can see the amounts, timing, and description of these items in the detailed reconciliation
table provided at the end of the earnings release. I recommend you review that in conjunction with our results.
Operating income from each of our reportable segments reached new all-time highs contributing to the margin
expansion I mentioned earlier. Our fourth quarter results across the segments drove another quarter of strong growth,
with earnings per share of $0.77 on a GAAP basis. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.74, which
is the highest we have ever achieved in a single quarter. This represents 23% growth over the prior year non-GAAP
EPS. On a segment basis, operating income in the Americas grew to $743 million, up 23% over the prior fourth quarter.
Operating margin expansion of 260 basis points, reaching 24.4%, was primarily driven by significant sales leverage.
Effective inventory management in our stores, primarily the result of reducing product waste and lower commodity
costs also contributed to the margin improvement.
In EMEA, we continue to deliver strong results that demonstrate that the transformation work over the past few years is
truly taking hold. Fourth quarter operating income for this segment was $39 million, a 42% increase over the fourth
quarter, which translated into a 12.1% operating margin. This is EMEA's first quarter ever of double-digit margins.
This resulted in a 280 basis point expansion in operating margin over the prior year, primarily driven by sales leverage
and continued expense management.
Now let's turn to China, Asia Pacific. For a second consecutive quarter, this segment delivered operating income in
excess of $100 million. This was an 8% increase over last year, which translated into a 33.5% operating margin and
was driven by balanced performance across the region.
Operating margin declined 400 basis points primarily due to a 210 basis point favorable impact, the last quarter's fourth
quarter margin, from a reduction in the estimated asset retirement obligations for store leases. The ongoing shift in our
store portfolio composition to more company-operated stores also contributed to the margin decline. Operating profit
for Channel Development grew 34% in Q4 over the prior year to a record $172 million and operating margin was 43%,
a 690 basis point increase over last year. Significant top line growth due to strong sales of single-serve products,
coupled with favorable coffee costs, and other cost of goods sold efficiencies drove the operating income and margin
improvement.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 36.4%. The combined impact of selling our ownership interests in
Malaysia and Australia increased the rate by about 2%. Our full year results for 2014 were equally impressive.
Consolidated global net revenues reached a record $16 billion in fiscal 2014. The 11% revenue growth over fiscal
2013, coupled with our EPS growth this year, represents the third straight year that we have grown revenues
double-digit and non-GAAP EPS over 15%. Our fiscal 2014 consolidated operating income of over $3 billion
represents a 25% increase on a non-GAAP basis from last year, including over 15% operating income growth in all
reportable segments. Relative to the prior year, operating margin increased 210 basis points for fiscal 2014 on a
non-GAAP basis, primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs. We added nearly 1,600 net new stores
in 2014 with about 70% of those stores outside of the U.S., once again, reflecting broad and balanced growth around
the world.
Cash flows from operations remained very strong and we returned a record $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders through
dividends and share repurchases, up 32% from 2013. This reflects our significant cash generation capability and

balance sheet strength. And today we announced that our board has approved a 23% increase to our quarterly dividend
to $0.32 a share. Looking ahead to 2015, we will see significant continued revenue growth including the impact of
Japan, our largest acquisition ever. We expect this acquisition will move our consolidated revenues up over $19 billion
as we take full control of the already successful Japanese market. We will also increase investments in critical areas
such as store partner pay and benefits, coffee leadership and innovation such as the Roastery, and digital capabilities
including Mobile Order and Pay.
Finally, we will have a renewed focus on driving increased leverage in both cost of goods sold and G&A expenses and
all of this will be achieved while we continue the focus on product innovation and customer service that has driven our
industry-leading performance through time.
Before I discuss 2015 targets, I want to highlight certain non-GAAP adjustments related to fiscal 2015 for comparison
purposes. In addition to the 2014 items I mentioned earlier, 2015 non-GAAP earnings numbers will exclude several
adjustments related to the Japan acquisition. Specifically, we've excluded from our comparisons the significant
acquisition related gain we will recognize in Q1 resulting from the fair value adjustment of our current ownership
interest in Starbucks Japan. We expect this gain will be approximately $325 million to $375 million after-tax and will
increase first quarter earnings by $0.43 per share to $0.49 per share. Also, non-GAAP results will exclude the
amortization of acquired intangible assets and deal-related transaction and integration costs, which will flow through
the P&L throughout 2015.
These are all estimates and we will firm up the final amounts related to the gain and the amortization of the intangible
assets in Q1. Again, we have provided a summary of these adjustments in a table at the end of our earnings release.
Also, given the significant financial impact of the Japan acquisition on the CAP segment in consolidated results, we are
holding a separate conference call to address questions related to this on November 5 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
Given this, please limit your questions today on the Starbucks Japan transaction to strategic and business-related items
as we will defer financial and modeling related questions to the call next week. We expect fiscal 2015 revenue growth
will be 16% to 18% including over $1 billion in incremental revenue from the Japan acquisition. We expect Japan will
contribute approximately 6 points to 7 points to revenue growth. Excluding the Japan impact, revenue growth is
consistent with our previous target of 10% plus. Consolidated operating margin next year on a GAAP basis is expected
to decrease slightly due to the impact of the Japan acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect operating margin to be
flat to up slightly in 2015.
This operating margin forecast reflects the impact of consolidating 100% of the Japan revenue for most of 2015 versus
the joint venture accounting approach in 2014, which recognized much lower revenue from Japan while picking up
about 40% of the earnings. In our FY 2015 targets last quarter, I mentioned 10%-plus revenue growth and 15% to 20%
EPS growth over 2014 non-GAAP EPS, which indicated that we would have solid operating margin expansion. The
only significant change to that target is layering in the full impact of the Japan acquisition. We anticipate margin
expansion will have returned in 2016, reflecting the full year impact of 100% ownership of Starbucks Japan and
continued strong operating leverage.
So we expect one year of slightly lower margin followed by a return to consistent annual margin expansion, including
the growth opportunities we see in Japan within our stores and other channels including CPG.
Regarding the CAP segment, we anticipate operating margin will be in the high-teens on a GAAP basis. This again
reflects the change in ownership structure in Japan and the mix shift due to significant growth in China
company-owned stores. It also includes 2 to 3 full points of impact from the amortization of the intangible assets
associated with the Japan acquisition. We expect that this operating margin will move up into the low-20%s over time.
It is important to reiterate that both Japan and China have among the highest store level operating margins in our
system.
Also, market level operating margins are expected to expand in both countries in 2015. We remain very confident in
the decision to acquire all of Japan given the immediate accretion of this transaction on a non-GAAP basis, low funding
costs leveraging offshore cash, significant growth opportunities in our stores and other channels, and an overall high

IRR reflecting strong deal economics.
In the Americas, we expect operating margin to expand modestly from the excellent results posted in 2014, reflecting
the ongoing investment in partners that Troy mentioned, offset by favorable sales leverage. In EMEA, we anticipate
operating margin improving to 10% to 12%, solidly into the double-digit range for the first time, driven by the benefit
of mix shift as well as continued operating improvements across the region. And in Channel Development, sales
leverage will provide modest operating margin expansion in fiscal 2015, improving upon our already outstanding
operating results.
Our strong revenue growth and margin expansion give us the confidence in earnings per share in the range of $3.42 to
$3.54 in fiscal 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect EPS ranging from $3.08 to $3.13, towards the middle of our
long-term range of 15% to 20%, an increase over our initial guidance provided in July.
We are expecting GAAP EPS in Q1 in the range of $1.20 to $1.28, reflecting the large gain on the Starbucks Japan
transaction. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.81 in the first quarter, a bit lower growth than
the full year target, given investments in marketing as we approach the important holiday season, and in our partners,
primarily related to the recent leadership conference earlier this month.
As we mentioned last quarter, commodities favorability added about 4 percentage points of EPS growth in 2014, and
we continue to expect commodity costs to be roughly neutral in 2015. We have two-thirds of our coffee needs priced
and, despite the volatility in the coffee market, we do not expect coffee prices to impact our current EPS target for
2015. As to recent market prices, we see nothing in current supply dynamics that indicates a fundamental market
shortage, including origin-related concerns in Brazil. We have largely stayed out of the market this year when coffee
prices have spiked, and we will continue to be patient as we lock-in the final one-third of our needs in 2015. As a
reminder, coffee only represents about 10% of our total costs, and we have managed through difficult and volatile
markets before. Also, we have never reduced our EPS target range due to the impact of coffee costs.
We now expect to add approximately 1,650 net new stores globally. Of the 1,650, we expect 650 in the Americas, 150
in EMEA, and 850 in China, Asia Pacific. Our effective tax rate should be around 31%, including approximately four
points of favorable impact in Q1 from the planned acquisition of Starbucks Japan. Finally, our expectation for capital
expenditures is $1.4 billion for fiscal 2015. This is somewhat higher than prior years, primarily due to new store growth
and the investments that will be needed as we launch Mobile Order and Pay, add more Evening stores, and make other
important growth investments. We are confident that these investments will continue to fuel the strong earnings growth
that we have experienced over the past several years.
In closing, fiscal 2014 represented another year of strong results for Starbucks. All of our reportable segments delivered
record revenues and operating profits, with significant margin expansion for the total company. Record cash returned to
shareholders and new store economics at an all-time high reflect financial discipline and a keen focus on return on
capital. As we enter the new fiscal year, our company remains positioned for growth with specific investments in
innovation, digital capabilities, and our partners. Funding this growth will come from operating efficiency and a
renewed focus on better leveraging cost of goods sold and overhead. Our financial targets for next year appropriately
balance the need to grow and invest with the financial discipline that leads to long-term earnings growth and margin
expansion. We are confident that the best days for Starbucks still lie ahead as we look to capitalize on the strength of
our global brand and the abundant opportunities that remain in markets and channels around the world.
With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Operator?

<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Hi. Thank you very much. I was interested to hear Howard talk about some of the product
innovation like the Chestnut Praline Latte, and I guess I was wondering if you could put that in the context of maybe
the competitive environment? Because it feels like a lot of companies have tried to replicate what Starbucks is doing,
whether it's Pumpkin Spice Latte or digital and loyalty. And I know that what you're doing is distinct and different, but
is it possible that competition has had something to do with a little bit of the deceleration that we've seen in the traffic?
I ask only because some other parts of the restaurant industry have actually seen a little bit of improvement recently.
And so I'm just trying to sort of understand the divergence there. Thank you.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Thank you. We see no indication whatsoever from any competitive threat in any region in
the country. Specifically, even in those markets where companies were giving away coffee for weeks at a time, we saw
no dilution whatsoever in our customer base. With regard to products, it's clear that over the last 10 years we created a
category that did not exist with Pumpkin Spice Latte. Having said that, PSL did very well for the season. One of the
hallmarks of Starbucks is surprising and delighting our customers with proprietary beverages.
The interesting thing about the beverage we're introducing, Chestnut Praline Latte, this is something we tested, kind of,
under the radar last year. It surprised us at the high-end and this is a product that's coming into the system with as much
enthusiasm internally as anything we've done in the past during the holiday season. And I put it in the same spirit as
when we introduced Eggnog Latte many, many years ago. This is a beverage that's going to do very well. But the short
answer to your question, no competitive attrition whatsoever to our business, we did not see it.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Hi. Great. Thanks. A follow up on that. If we are to kind of isolate competition as not being
an issue in the 1% traffic that I think even in Troy's remarks he said he was not satisfied or you were not satisfied with
1% traffic. I mean what do you think it would have been? I mean, if we were to identify what issue of that led to that
1% being disappointing relative to your own expectations? I'd ask that in the context of have you begun to hit a
throughput wall, maybe temporarily that can be at least partially solved through technology? Is that an issue? And have
you been able to isolate your own impact on comps through possible cannibalization as you have been recently taking
up the store count? If it's not one of those two issues, what might it be? Thanks.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Okay. I think this is the central question of the day. So I really want to make sure we spend
as much time as possible that everyone understands it and we're as transparent as we possibly can. We do not have a
throughput issue and Cliff will talk about that specifically. But a year ago today, we began talking about the macro shift
in the amount of traffic that was going through malls and main streets in America. And as a result of what happened
last year, and that is, less people shopping with bricks-and-mortar stores and much more people shopping online in
their mobile devices as I talked about in my remarks, we began dramatically transforming the holiday season in
anticipation of another holiday season that would even be greater than last year in terms of attrition of people shopping
in physical stores.
What we did see, though, and that we did not expect, is that we saw it come earlier than last year's holiday season. And
so we're ready to go in terms of the fall and holiday season based on what we have re-imagined and Starbucks for Life
is going be a big holiday product and, we believe, going to create incrementality in our stores. But the short answer to
the question is, there's nothing internal about what's going on within a Starbucks store in terms of throughput. There's
nothing external in terms of competitive issues. This is a macro issue and we are addressing it with a vengeance.
And as a result of that, we are well-positioned, as I said in my remarks, to not only, we believe, have the kind of
holiday season that will demonstrate the change, but heading into fiscal – heading into calendar 2015 with Mobile
Order and Pay and all the things we're going to do in terms of technology and delivering the second half of the year, we
are going be the company that is positioned to overcome and navigate through the macro change in the cultural shift of

consumer behavior.
So the net issue – and this is so important, this is not a Starbucks issue, all the companies that you follow and all the
retail companies that are reporting in other spaces are experiencing a downturn in traffic. That is a result of a cultural
macro shift that I spoke about in Q1 of last year. We positioned and addressed it for holiday. We saw it a little earlier
than we expected, but come holiday – Starbucks for Life and what we've done in the store to re-imagine the gift of
choice in terms of card, we are well positioned to take advantage of what we think the situation is all about.
And, Cliff, just hit specifically the issue of throughput and productivity, so there's no misunderstanding.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Yeah, thanks, John, and thanks Howard. In the quarter we've just finished, we saw our
strongest productivity numbers for the year, and it was the greatest improvement on the previous year. The volumes
we're putting through our stores at the moment are in excess of anything we've ever seen. I think the other thing that is
significant, we opened in the final quarter over 200 stores in the U.S. and, for the year, 505 stores, about half of them
being company-operated and half of them licensed. They're all performing at record levels and they continue to
contribute significantly to our growth. So it's all good, very positive about the possibility and the potential to continue
to grow.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Troy.
<A - Troy Alstead>: I'll just add one point to that, John. Thanks, Cliff. We, in the quarter, are growing across all
dayparts. Even the busiest morning daypart is producing nice comp growth. So I think we're demonstrating increased
throughput. As Cliff said, the highest productivity of fiscal 2014 happened in the fourth quarter and was a significant
improvement over productivity in the fourth quarter of the prior year. It's not a throughput issue whatsoever and we
continue to invest in the ability to move the lines more quickly, put more volume through our stores. Digital, with
Mobile Order and Pay is just one example of what's yet to come.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: And if I'm still on, have you been able to isolate the impact, if any, of cannibalization, given
that store growth that's accelerated through the fourth quarter?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: We are seeing nothing in terms of cannibalization. The quality of the new stores and I think
our discipline around opening these new stores while maintaining our operational excellence and focus on the customer
in existing stores, we have never had so much success and strength in this area.
<A - Troy Alstead>: And, John, you heard Howard comment in his prepared remarks about convenience. We know
that convenience is a huge – it's very important driver of the customer experience and of ultimate size of the
opportunity in the business, as we've become increasingly disciplined around market mapping, around store location,
around store formats, around performance of our drive-thrus, about the ability to tap into new trade areas and demand
like never before, as we're opening up accelerated numbers of new stores, basically opening them up almost at mature
volume levels in year one, extremely high performance across all history. As we're able to do that, we are still
performing with strong store results, strong comp growth, and improve the untapped opportunity we have ahead for us
in store growth in the U.S. and around the world.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Thank you.

The next question is from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Good evening. We've seen Starbucks react several times in the last few years to patches of
weakness with marketing pushes, sometimes in social media, and it's worked. Is it safe to say that you might be teeing
up corrective measures such as the ones you've done in the last few years?

<Q - David S. Palmer>: I remember back in the June quarter in 2012, the first quarter where you had a little bit of a
soft patch, and you did some stuff on social media, and in terms of discounts or incentives for people to come back.
And those measures worked then; you employed them later. I'm wondering if you had a soft patch late in this quarter,
you've not had a chance to adjust. And whether you might be thinking about making some pushes like that to help
offset the bricks-and-mortar weakness you're talking about.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Yes. David, thanks for the question. There's no doubt that the work that we have done in
preparing for holiday on the specific promotional overlay of Starbucks for Life is going to have a comprehensive and
significant social and digital media component leveraging all of the learnings we've had in the past. And I think if you
go back in history, we've been able to leverage that and in doing so, lower our cost of customer acquisition versus
traditional media.
And you're going to see that in spades once the holiday season kicks off. Now Starbucks for Life does not start until the
first week in December but we've got a tremendous offering between that. But you're going to see a lot of promotional
material and I think based on people we've talked to and the demand that's already come from people who have heard
about Starbucks for Life this has the potential to be quite a frenzy with regard to being perhaps the number one gift that
only 13 people in America and Canada are going to get.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.

And the next question is from Keith Siegner with UBS.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thank you, and congratulations on the record year. Scott, if I could ask you a question about
the cost saves and efficiencies that you talked about clearly having an impact on the margins. And good job on that.
Could you talk a little bit about -- maybe put all of fiscal 2014 into a – if you could quantify it maybe into some
perspective. And then when we look at the guidance for fiscal 2015, how do the cost saves transition from this year to
next year? In other words, what is built into the guidance on that front? Thanks.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: Yeah, the first thing I'll say is I'll be giving a significant more level of specificity in Investor
Day including specific dollar amounts. But let me sort of frame it up what we're doing. If you look at cost of goods sold
efficiencies, the challenge that we give our supply chain every year, last year the number that we gave them was – and
I'll give this in Investor Day with X. Next year the number we're going give them is two times that. And so what we've
done over the course of two years is doubled the amount of savings that's going through the P&L. And that's what's in
the forecast next year. And what's important to note is last year with that initial target, we drove no cost of goods sold
leverage in the P&L.
This year, particularly in the fourth quarter for the first time, we turned that to cost of goods sold leverage. And next
year that leverage becomes significant. So we'll walk through all of that in Investor Day but that gives you some rough
sense of the numbers.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thanks.

The next question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you. Hey, Howard, could I just clarify. Are you saying you're seeing this shift in
retail that you noted last year starting earlier seasonally this year? Was that the observation?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Yes. Let me try and take another shot at that. If you remember, last year, I spoke very
specifically about the seismic change in consumer behavior. And what I talked about specifically was a downturn in the
kind of traffic that we saw historically that I felt strongly was being displaced by e-commerce and mobile shopping. As

a result of what happened last year, as soon as Christmas ended, we worked diligently to literally transform the entire
Christmas holiday beginning in the middle of November. In anticipation of another year of a downturn in traffic that
could be worse than the year before, and the work that I've outlined in terms of Starbucks for Life and all the plans we
have around the 100 proprietary cards and leveraging the success we've had with card in the last couple of years, most
specifically last year where we sold over $1 billion of cards, all of that is in place beginning for the holiday season.
What we saw though was that downturn in traffic, which literally I think when you think about back-to-school, if you
talk about all the national retailers, back-to-school this year was almost a nonevent for most retailers, physical retailers.
And so once again, we saw the downturn in physical traffic, but we did not anticipate seeing it in the fall. We
anticipated and we prepared for it for the holiday season. That is what I'm saying. This is not a throughput issue and
this is definitely not a competitive space issue. This is a shift, a cultural shift in consumer behavior. I also want to just
reiterate one thing. We strongly believe that the opportunity around convenience leveraging what we've done around
drive-throughs and creating convenient opportunities for customers to get access to Starbucks is going to be another
way in which we're going to win.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you for that clarification. Can I ask one more? Just on the transaction of growth, the
composition of the same-store sales mix, I think there's no question you are executing at all-time record levels. Traffic
was still up. But is the challenge creating the opportunity for that incremental traffic growth? Are the speed-of-service
productivity measures up year-over-year, but is that gap year-over-year starting to narrow that perhaps just makes it
more difficult to drive transactions – incremental transactions?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Joe, let me just be clear, and I think Howard said this. This is not a productivity issue.
Productivity in the fourth quarter was stronger that it's been all year long, and significantly stronger than it was in the
fourth quarter a year ago, productivity as measured by transactions per labor hour, our ability to put more traffic
through those busiest dayparts. So that really isn't the issue. The broader issue is about less traffic out there for us to
capture and bring in, as Howard just described. It fundamentally is not a throughput issue whatsoever. And as we
continue to drive initiatives such as Mobile Order and Pay, and a larger percentage coming through the mobile app and
payment technologies and the whole digital experience, all that does is raise the lid on our ability to increase traffic,
increase traffic to the stores, at all dayparts.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Adam or Matt, go ahead.
<A - Matthew Ryan>: Matt Ryan here. I'll just add to that, that the – when you look at the 42% of our stores that are
drive-through and offering tremendous convenience to our customers, we're seeing some of our strongest performance
there. What we are anticipating in this coming year, is that the same step change in convenience that was offered in
those stores through drive-through, is going to begin to happen through Mobile Order and Pay, so the urban customer
and the metro customer can begin to have that same convenience that people have shown by staying seated in their cars
and quickly grabbing Starbucks on the go. We think it's a step change driver of our business.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you. Appreciate the color.

The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thanks very much. I'm wondering as you think about the role of check that will play in the next
couple of quarters, particularly as you start to anniversary the first big markets you've rolled food out. So can you talk
about how those early markets are performing as they comp? Specifically, could check continue to grow in a year or
two and by the same magnitude? And at the same token, I don't think this is the direction you're heading, but if you talk
about if it's a change in the consumer, what role does increased value play in driving greater transaction counts, if any?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Yeah, John. Hi. It's Cliff here. With regard to food, obviously we've rolled out now the La
Boulange platform to all our stores. We're in about 11,000 stores across the U.S., both company-operated and licensed
stores. And what we are seeing is all the learnings that we got from the early markets we applied to more recent

rollouts, and we are seeing continued improvement in our operation around food, both on the sell side with another 2%
contribution from food growth. We've seen the learnings from Bakery, has really helped us enhance and strengthen our
performance around breakfast sandwiches. We've started to roll out lunch, which is the next important daypart for us
around food.
So we're seeing our ability, our operational ability around food, and also we're being able to refine and improve food
not only in the morning daypart, we've had a record breakfast sandwich year, and that's grown by about 30%. Lunch
has grown by 14% and we've only just started there. So year-on-year, food has grown and it is definitely helping check
as is beverage mix as well.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Adam, you want to add something?
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Yes. And I would just add, in terms of Mobile Order and Pay, our research and our design
indicates that we look to see an improvement in ticket as well through the way we're designing that program as well. So
it's not just traffic; it's not just throughput; it's not just convenience, but we believe it'll hit ticket as well.
<Q - John S. Glass>: And but, let's, just to clarify, in year two, the stores that have had food for 14 months, 15 months,
16 months, they're still seeing an incremental 2% check growth over the year-ago period.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Yeah, I wouldn't break it out as purely check. Some of it is growth of attach, but a mixture of
attach and mix, yes, we are seeing that growth across the system.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thank you.

The next question is from R. J. Hottovy with Morningstar.
<Q - R. J. Hottovy>: Thanks. Just had a question about the logistics around the delivery plans. First, if you've had any
test markets that you've had the delivery plans in place, what kind of learnings you've had there?
And then secondly, will these be facilitated out of existing stores, or will some of these alternative footprint stores
you've talked about play a part in that? Just any color around the delivery plans would be helpful.
<A - Matthew Ryan>: Matt Ryan here. It's very early days on this, but we are moving ahead, full steam ahead. The
pilots are coming soon. We are going to be looking at a number of different options. There will probably be a multiple
number of solutions that we go with in terms of how we operationalize this. And at this point we're not ready to tip our
hand on that but suffice it to say, we have lots of different ways of doing this in front of us and you can expect to see
things in 2015.
Operator
The next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you very much. Just a question on the Americas, I guess, on the
operating margin. But it continues to push new highs. I think we're now in the mid-23% range. It was up close to 200
basis points this year. I know you mentioned we're going to get more modest improvement next year. I'm just
wondering what you'd attribute the greatest drivers or perhaps where you think that could go without changes in the
ownership towards more licensing? But that does lead to my other connected question, which is just, it looks like fiscal
2015 is going to be over roughly half licensed in terms of new openings. I'm just wondering why we wouldn't consider
pushing more heavily licensed or re-licensing existing stores? I think you're at like 40% today. But why wouldn't the
U.S. or the Americas be at 60%, 70% plus licensed just to effectively push that margin even higher and take some of
the onus off of you from an operation standpoint?

<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: So, it's Scott. I'll take the margin question in the U.S. I think the short answer is we think
we can continue to grow operating margin in the U.S. business. If you look at the strength of the comp growth and the
number of drivers we have lined up next year, and you look at how we've been leveraging margin over the past couple
of years through really all up and down the P&L, store operating margin leverage, cost of goods sold leverage and
G&A leverage, I think we can continue to drive more of that. I think we can continue to drive labor productivity, as
Troy talked about. So I don't see a limit to the operating margin growth. I think this year was an extraordinary year, but
I think we see it continue to expand in the future.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Jeffrey, let me speak to your last question. We generate, unlike many others in company-operated
retail, extremely strong return on capital as we deploy capital into company-operated new stores. That's true all around
the world. So our decisions around when to license and when to company-own are not purely driven by simply the
percentage margin. Of course, that's one thing but we very significantly look at the overall size of the P&L; our ability
to deploy capital and generate very, very strong return on capital, which we can do; the ability to use company-operated
formats but in some cases licensed operations to get access to geographies where we're not able to operate specific sites
and real estate where we're not able to operate ourselves. And so there's a wide range of important decisions that lead
us to what we believe to be the optimal mix of ownership, company-operated and licensed in the U.S. and that same
analysis, sometimes a different answer, but that same set of analytics lead us to think about licensed versus JV versus
company-operated all around the world. So we're very pleased with the direction we're going both in terms of our
company-operated development, which will continue to accelerate and our licensed store development, which will also
continue to accelerate.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: I think it's also fair to say that there's been some exciting developments in recent years in
license, which traditionally was transport and grocery, which continues to grow. But we've also had the opportunity,
whether it is in Vegas, in hotels, in entertainment areas, but more recently in Disney, which has just been incredible, to
offer Starbucks to a whole group of new customers in a captive space and we see that continue to grow. So we're
pushing ahead on that as we push ahead on plans to expand our company-operated stores across the U.S., Canada and
Brazil within the Americas.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Thank you. I had a couple: just one question on the modeling side and a clarification. I just
want to understand, when you said the 31% tax rate for 2015, is that a number that you're applying or using for both
earnings numbers? Or is there a normalized tax rate associated with the $3.08 to $3.13?
And then my question was with respect to the marketing. There was a quick reference in 1Q, and I think David asked
also about that, pulling forward or your reaction to the 1% traffic. Are you going to spend more on marketing? Could
you quantify for us maybe how much of a wait on 1Q's earnings that marketing, as well as the partner conference, is
going to have on your growth rate? Thank you.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Let me clarify the marketing issue. There is no additional marketing spend for this quarter than
we previously had in our operating budget. We anticipated how big Starbucks for Life could and would be, and we've
allocated marketing money against that, that is in our AOP and in the guidance that we've already shared with you. So
there's no additional marketing expense beyond the normal course of business.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: But additional for last year.
<A - Troy Alstead>: And that -
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Additional relative to last year, though, it is. Correct?
<A - Troy Alstead>: No.

<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Because you didn't call it out.
<A - Troy Alstead>: No. No, actually, it's – we're not going to get into specifics of how much we exactly spend on
marketing, but I can tell you we're not spending more on marketing for this holiday than we did last year. We're just
reallocating the money against Starbucks for Life.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Okay, and then the partner conference?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Troy, you want it?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Well, I'll just say we won't provide any specifics to that. We have a number of investments that
Scott spoke about, including the partner conference, as we travel through this quarter that led to the guidance we've
initiated for the quarter. But no specifics attached to any one of those items specifically.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: And then on the tax rate, if you think about the guidance I gave on 31%, which included
four points related to the Japan transaction, and the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP, Matt, is all due to the
Japan transaction. And so you can back into what the non-GAAP rate is.
<A - Troy Alstead>: And if I can just wrap up one point on that, not related to tax but related to the previous thing.
Things such as the Leadership Conference, which we've conducted in years past and conducted one just a couple weeks
ago here in Seattle, investments in our partner experience, those are critical investments that you should not view as
costs or margin pressure. On the contrary, those have consistently, in our business, led to a sustained growth in the
partner experience and in the partners' ability in our stores to drive great customer experiences, which is fundamentally
what fuels the kind of comp growth and margin structure and volumes in Starbucks business that nobody else can
replicate. These are investments in the current year and in the future that we're very proud of.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Right. I was just looking at – in the prepared remarks, I think it was cited for 1Q's growth. I
wasn't suggesting it. I thought it was cited in the prepared remarks that marketing and the partner were one of the
reasons why the growth would be slower than the full year. Is there something else?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I understand. I understand. No, just a wide range of investments that we make in the
business constantly. Nothing more specific to provide there.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
The next question is from Andy Barish with Jefferies.
<Q - Andy M. Barish>: Hey, guys. Yeah, I guess I would like to just follow up on that, on the two key investment
areas for 2015 in terms of the partner pay and benefits and then digital. It does sound like those are very strategic
step-ups, though. So I guess any help in terms of quantification in that regard would be useful.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: Yeah, I think I mentioned those in my prepared remarks. I think, though, the way to think
about that is if you look at our long-term EPS growth rate of 15% to 20%, we've guided right in the middle of that.
What's bringing us down a point or two off the top end of that is some of those investments. So we don't have the
commodities favorability this year, and we're going a little bit more forward into some benefits around partner pay and
benefits and around digital. So that's what really brings us down from the upper end towards the middle. So if you add
all the things Troy's referenced across the business together, it's a point or two on the growth rate.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I'll jump in here on your other question, and then Adam can add. Starbucks for Life is the
main core element of holiday. However, holiday gifting and the loyalty program of MSR, the opportunity to begin
launching XOP Mobile Order and Pay in Oregon, and then our mobile payment and app, all of these things are skewed
towards the recognition of the cultural shift we saw last year and what we strongly believe will put us in a position to
win over a long period of time. And that is integrated into what Matt talked about earlier, about taking a page out of our

drive-thru business which has been so strong, and cracking the code on what the analog is of our urban stores, and
using Mobile Order and Pay, and then the second half of the year delivery to accomplish that. And that these
investments are going to pay off big time and we already know that Mobile Order and Pay is going to drive traffic and
comp growth.
Adam, do you want to add anything about the specifics of that?
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Yeah, what's important to call out is both with regard to the Starbucks for Life card
program this holiday as well as the launch of Mobile Order and Pay is that we have a significant competitive
advantage. We're not starting from scratch. We are rolling out Mobile Order and Pay. We're doing Starbucks for Life
on the back of them leveraging, already having built a world-class mobile commerce and loyalty platform. So we have
12 million customers that are highly active on our mobile app, 8 million active MSR loyalty members, one of the most
successful, if not the most successful, gift card program in the world. We're integrating every one of these programs:
card for life, Mobile Order and Pay and eventually delivery right into that seamlessly. That's going to give us a huge
competitive advantage going forward and gives us the belief that this is going to significantly drive throughput and
incremental transactions.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Okay. Let me have the last word and just share with you that we are playing offense here.
We understand that there is a macro issue and a consumer shift. We are playing offense and we began that last year
right after holiday. And come this holiday in calendar 2015, we are going to be in a position to win. End of story.
JoAnn, I think that's it.

Yes, guys, thank you, Howard. Thank you all for joining us today and sticking with a little bit longer this afternoon. We
