Thanks, Paula and good morning everyone. 2013 was a good year, considering everything we set out to do and what
was before us. Importantly, we maintained low rates for our customers, our employees had a great safety year, we
contributed to our communities and we put in place a platform of lower costs and improved risk profile and
simplification of our business while delivering strong financial results.
Moreover, our strategic imperatives positioned us to execute on our strategy, to aggressively grow our utility business
driven primarily by the economic renaissance that is unique to the Gulf South, while we preserve the optionality and
manage the risk in our merchant operations, Entergy Wholesale Commodities.
So, starting with the results, I'm pleased to report after beginning the year with higher than expected pension cost
pushing us towards the lower part of our guidance range, we delivered operational earnings of $5.36 per share; that's
near the top of our guidance range of $5.40.
We returned nearly $600 million in common stock dividends and maintained solid credit metrics for our owners. Our
residential, commercial and industrial rates remain among the lowest in the nation. Our residential rates are in the
lowest cost quartile in four of our six retail jurisdictions and our low industrial rates are contributing to the regional
industrial growth we're experiencing.
In addition, our residential customers viewed us more favorably in 2013 than the year before. Overall, the percent
reporting favorable views grew by 12 points to 78%. Also for our communities, Entergy and the Entergy Charitable
Foundation invested more than $15 million of cash contributions to non-profit partners and our employees and
volunteers logged more than 85,000 hours of volunteer service valued at approximately $2 million.
What matters most to us is safety. Our employees reduced the OSHA recordable accident index by more than 30% for
2012 to a record low level. Our contractor safety did not match our employee results. We can and must do better as
nothing is more important.
Resolution of major strategic issues, our corporate reorganization and strong results set the stage for execution on our
strategy for 2014 and beyond. I want to take the next few minutes to talk about what we mean by that. As I mentioned,
our utility strategy is to aggressively grow our business. Sales growth and productivity improvements have always been
the most effective way to grow our utility and keep customer bills low.
For Entergy, we believe we can sustain this traditional utility model for the foreseeable future. It starts with the top line.
Today, economic development activity is far beyond anything we have seen in a long time. Just last November the
International Energy Agency released its 2013 edition of the World Energy Outlook. In it the IEA points out that the
significant regional disparity of global energy prices clearly favors the United States against rival industrial giants. Oil
prices are more than 20 times higher internationally than the equivalent U.S. natural gas price, and natural gas prices
around the world are more than double what we pay here in the U.S. These spreads make new or expanded
energy-intensive industrial production located in the U.S. competitive globally.
Shale gas also contributes to our low industrial electricity rates, also helping industrial businesses to better compete.
Combine these commodity price levels with business-minded state and local governments, communities that are
receptive to industrial development as well as the infrastructure in place to support it, and we see a great environment
for economic development to flourish in our four-state service territory.
Over the next three years, we project 2% to 2.25% compound average annual sales growth simply based on those new
or expansion industrial projects we have line of sight on, either through signed electric service agreements, or those in
late stage negotiations. While opportunities exist across our service territory, the most identified to date are centered
along the Louisiana Gulf Coast region.
Drew will update you on recent efforts to serve this industrial load, but to give you a sense of the magnitude of the
opportunity and why it is central to our utility strategy, if we serve them all, it would increase the sum of the operating
company's peak load by almost 10%. The utility operating company's objective, in conjunction with our state economic
development agencies, is to attract these opportunities to our region and to serve them all reliably and cost effectively.
Even as our sales grow, we can continue to provide electricity from the fleet that has average emission rates well below

the national average in both conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases. We also now have better access to a broader
pool of resources to serve existing and new customers through our integration with the Midcontinent Independent
System Operator.
At midnight Eastern on December 19, the six utility operating companies cut over to operations in the MISO regional
transmission organization. Joining MISO marks completion of a decade-long objective. It was the largest RTO
integration ever. MISO's ability to optimize unit commitment and dispatch across our regions projected to save our
customers hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming decade.
In addition to energy cost benefits, the result from the Day 2 market utility operating companies reserve margins
collectively are now 1,000 megawatts lower real savings to customers every year. The move to MISO also gives us
improved flexibility to serve incremental sales growth. Serving these new customers may require additional investment
in transmission. Regarding transmission, as you know, we jointly terminated the proposed transaction with ITC
Holdings Corp. in December.
While we believe that the transaction offered a way to lower delivered energy cost for our customers over the
long-term, simply put, we did not get the regulatory support we needed to close the deal. Our objective has always been
to provide safe and reliable transmission service to our customers at a reasonable cost. We have a 100 year history of
doing just that.
Going forward, utility operating companies will continue to maintain the existing transmission infrastructure and
alongside MISO and under its independent oversight, plan for new transmission facilities as needed to meet reliability
standards.
We will also participate actively in the MISO planning process to identify and build additional transmission projects to
support public policy goals or provide congestion relief where economic for customers and other benefits consistent
with the MISO planning criteria. Our transmission capital plan over the next three years reflects spending to implement
the construction plan incorporated into the MISO planning process upon our entry. Joining MISO and the
implementation of per quarter 1,000 add a new dynamic.
For example, our transmission spending in the coming years could increase for potential market efficiency projects, or
multi-value projects, which are economically driven projects and preclude by MISO because of the economic or public
policy types of benefits they provide to our customers or projects identified through inter-regional planning, evolving
industry reliability standards, [ph] load in (8:35) economic conditions again to the benefit of our customers or future
transmission investments to meet requirements to serve the approximately $65 billion of potential economic
development projects in our region. We could also see additional generation investment needs over time both to replace
aging resources and to meet sales growth.
As we invest for the future and the growth of our business, productivity improvements that help manage customer rates
will also be critical. This is the reason for our HCM initiative. HCM was necessary to advance the utility and EWC
strategies. This required a complete reorganization and restructuring of our company. It was an arduous process for our
employees. We re-staffed the entire organization after designing a new structure to improve efficiency and
effectiveness across the company.
In the end, we eliminated approximately 800 positions and the majority of the affected employees separated from the
company last year. We also introduced changes to our employee benefits programs in late 2013. These types of changes
are never easy for anyone but they are necessary to maintain reasonable cost for our customers and position employees
and the company to excel in the coming years.
Now HCM was not just about cutting cost, it was also about expanding resources dedicated to functions central to our
strategy. At the utility, for example, economic development was elevated in the company, expanding the staff and
resources dedicated to this effort. Working hand-in-hand with state and local government offices, the economic
development teams are charged with attracting new projects to the region and removing barriers in the development
process.

At nuclear, we determined we needed more specific governance and oversight of the various functions as a method to
help us improve performance at the plants. So we added operations oversight personnel at each site to ensure that the
behaviors and performance at the plants meet our standards. Improving performance was a major goal for the nuclear
organization's HCM effort.
At the corporate level, we developed new shared services model to improve efficiency, better support business
operations and have a more engaged organization. In addition to growing sales through our economic development
activities and improving productivity through programs like HCM and our transition to MISO, our regulatory
constructs must support our efforts to grow the economies of our service territory.
Constructive regulatory mechanisms such as riders from the rate plans and the securitized recovery of storm cost and
the establishment of storm reserves also improved the ability for utility to reliably serve customers, make investments
and maintain reasonable costs. We will continue to work with our retail regulators who have recognized the benefit of
such constructive approaches in many ways over the years.
The settlements of the two Louisiana rate cases approved by the LPSC in December were structured around our
execution of these building blocks of our strategy. But we have more work to do to demonstrate to all of our retail
regulators the value and progressive mechanisms. We need to collaboratively pursue mechanisms that will support
prudent investment to the benefit of all stakeholders. Working together with our regulators, we need to continue to
serve in advance for the public interest. We also need to make sure that the traditional rate setting mechanisms are
functioning properly. While the Arkansas Public Service Commission's rate case decision did give us some tools to
prepare for the future, particularly those mechanisms designed to help us operate in MISO and facilitate Entergy
Arkansas' exit from the system agreement, we are very disappointed in other portions of the decision that will make it
more challenging for EAI to invest in expansion opportunities and technologies that foster the state's economic growth
and public policy objectives.
Clearly, one of the disappointments was the 9.3% authorized ROE, the lowest ROE of all southern U.S. utilities. We
are already seeing a negative customer impact of the order after Moody's upgraded the credit ratings of our other major
operating companies in mostly in the utility space, but not Entergy Arkansas. The upgrades came out of Moody's more
favorable view of the relative credit supportiveness of the U.S. regulatory environment.
Entergy Arkansas was one of the handful of companies whose ratings did not change despite being on review for
possible upgrade. In its report, Moody's specifically pointed to the less than favorable rate case outcomes in May of
2010 and December of 2013. Moody's also pointed to more credit supportive FRPs in other jurisdictions versus this
traditional rate case framework. This obviously disadvantages EAI against other companies in the quest for growth and
the capital to support that growth.
At the end of January, we filed for rehearing and/or clarification of some of the issues to better understand how to
address them going forward. While we are trying to resolve the [ph] other rehearing requests, (13:30) the issues created
by the current rate order, Entergy Arkansas intends to work constructively with the APSE to find a way to advance the
regulatory environment, which strengthens EAI's ability to service customers in the post-System Agreement
environment and fosters with the type of investment that helps grow the economy.
We have a long history of FRPs in Mississippi and New Orleans. The FRP in Mississippi has served all stakeholders
well over the years linking return levels to performance on customer service, reliability, and customer rate metrics. The
potential need for a rate case in 2014 rises from Entergy Mississippi's exit from the System Agreement next year
among other reasons and they also gave us the opportunity to explore other regulatory mechanisms such as formula rate
plans that allow adjustments for known and measurable changes occurring in the rate effective period to better facilitate
the coming investment needs.
In Texas last week, Entergy Texas, staff and the parties notified the administrative law judges of significant progress
towards settlement in the rate case. As a result, the schedule was suspended. Tomorrow, the parties will file a report
regarding the status of the settlement and settlement documents. The rate case filing also seeks to set base lines for
using the authorized capacity, distribution and transmission riders in coming years. These three riders provide a

regulatory regime that addresses certain cost drivers without the need for a full base rate proceeding.
Turning to EWC, our strategy is to preserve optionality and manage risks through our operations, our hedging strategy,
our regulatory efforts most notably license renewable, our asset decisions and our advocacy for wholesale market
policies that adequately price the value of reliability, field diversity and environmental benefits. Take hedging, for
example. Several years ago, we expanded our use of options in collars that provide a downside protection and offered
some ability to receive higher prices if the market moves up consistent with our analysis of the markets.
As a result, last winter and again this winter, we are able to capitalize on the run-up in power crises. This strategy
contributed to our strong 2013 earnings performance and current position within the 2014 guidance range and Drew
will review that shortly.
While this winter is much colder than normal weather, it has been a primary driver and was not an expected outcome in
advance the way we structured our hedge portfolio, preserved optionality and it's helping us to realize upside in the
volatile energy market consistent with our overall EWC strategy. Higher capacity price is also reflected in our strong
2013 results as supply and demand in the New York market began to tighten.
Going into 2014, the new Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone is the source of potential uplift, proving the point. More
importantly, having it should contribute to improved reliability in New York, the new capacity zone is designed to
create proper market incentives that encourage needed new resources in this constrained zone.
FERC issued its decision on January 28 on the New York Independent System Operators demand curve filing.
Essentially, this demand curve is with separate capacity price in each spot option based on the level of demand built-in.
Although, we did not agree with some of the assumptions underlying the demand curves, the decision overall including
the rejection of a phase-in of the new zone is a step in the right direction that will increase the market's ability to meet
the region's goals. With this decision in hand, the LHV zone will be fully implemented effective May 1, 2014.
Last week in New England, the 2017 to 2018 capacity auction cleared over $7 per kilowatt month rest of pool, below
new build, but better than the sub $3 clearing price in the last auction. Pilgrim and Rhode Island combined cycle plant
both cleared the auction as rest of pool resources. Despite these constructive capacity market outcomes, our market
design challenges remain and we're now seeing their seeds take root with more announced shutdowns. This shutdown
of generation that would otherwise be economic in a well-functioning market will create a future point of disconnect,
something will have to give. In the meantime, we'll continue to champion power market reform and in the long run, we
remain generally bullish on Northeast energy and capacity prices. And Drew will address in more detail this during his
discussion.
For Indian Point, we continue to preserve the option to operate the plant through our pursuit of the multi-stage,
multi-layer license renewal process. This process is likely to continue through at least 2018. A recap of recent
developments is provided on slide 28. For Vermont Yankee, the value of the option was not sufficient to maintain its
operation, which led us to the difficult decision to close the plant.
To manage the risks associated with the shutdown, we reached a settlement in December with the State of Vermont.
We believe that Vermont Yankee settlement agreement is in the best interest of VY employees, the local community,
our owners and the state. It resolves short-term issues and establishes a foundation for longer term dialogue. Just
signing the agreement resolved most of our pending litigations with the state. The remaining terms of the agreement are
contingent upon the Vermont Public Service Board approval by the end of March of the Certificate of Public Good to
operate through the end of 2014. Closing one of our plants is the last thing we wanted to do and the economics drove
the decision in Vermont. However, even with the closure, we preserved 85% of the optionality in the fleet.
Despite the recent weather driven run-up and near term prices, long-term sustained low power and capacity prices
continue to weigh on FitzPatrick and Pilgrim and with it Palisades, if not for the power purchase agreement through
early 2022 that supports the plant's operating costs. We continue to believe the rationale for separating merchant risk
from the utility holding company remains valid. To that end, we have looked at a number of alternatives to accomplish
this over the last several years.

Our conclusion based on what we know today is that we intend to own and operate this fleet for the foreseeable future.
We know there's a lot of uncertainty on this point, so we felt it was important to let you know that based on our current
point of view, we have made no decisions closing the other plants and are not actively considering selling any at this
time. While this is our assessment today, our point of view is an [ph] ever-growing (20:15) process that will continue to
evolve based on conditions in the commodity markets and operational and regulatory developments.
2013 had its challenges. We feel like we've taken a significant step forward. If 2013 was the year of transition, 2014 is
the year of clarity. Entering today's call, I know many of you had questions about what our strategy is; my hope is I've
cleared some of that up.
To recap, we have put a platform and organizational structure in place to execute on our strategy and our strategy is to
aggressively grow the utility business, driven primarily by the economic renaissance that is unique to the Gulf South,
while we preserve the optionality and manage the risks associated with EWC. And as always, we're on the lookout for
actions we can take to do better for our stakeholders. But I know you have more questions about what we are trying to
do and what it all means financially and operationally into the future. We will give you a comprehensive update at our
2014 Analyst Day, which we're announcing today. It will be held on June 5 in New York City. We hope you mark your
calendars; we want to see you all there.
And now I'll turn the call over to Drew.
Andrew Marsh
Thank you, Leo and good morning everyone. Today I'll review the financial results for the quarter, highlights from the
full year and I'll spend some time discussing our forward outlook. Starting with slide two, our fourth quarter 2013
results are shown on an as-reported and an operational basis. Fourth quarter operational earnings per share were $1 in
2013 compared to $1.72 in 2012. The decline was largely due to income tax benefits recorded in the prior period. There
were other largely offsetting items, which I'll discuss momentarily.
Operational earnings excluded special items from the ITC transaction, the Vermont Yankee closure decision and HCM
implementation. Regarding HCM, the net charge was $60 million on a pre-tax basis. This included about $110 million
from pre-tax expenses, net of approximately $50 million for regulatory assets.
Turning to operational results by segment on slide three, earnings per share at the utility, and parent & other decreased,
while EWC results were higher. Starting with utility, operational earnings per share were $0.86, this was lower than the
$1.63 earned in fourth quarter 2012. As expected, income tax expense was a driver due to the prior period benefit.
Recall in fourth quarter 2012, income tax expense was reduced approximately $155 million as a result of an IRS
settlement. Partially offsetting in 2013 results was an approximate $0.08 per share of income tax benefit, including the
reversal of previously accrued interest after resolving an IRS audit.
Utility also saw strong results in net revenue. Talked about pricing factors throughout the year, the benefits from
productive 2012 investments were realized in 2013 results. Utility retail sales were also higher this quarter on both an
as-reported and a weather-adjusted basis. Weather-adjusted sales increased 1.5% quarter-over-quarter driven by strong
industrial growth, which was 3.2% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012 period. The increased sales came largely from
existing refining chemicals and small industrial customers, and very little was a direct result of expansions. Generally
improving economic conditions in the U.S. and aboard, bolstered by the persistent strong spread between natural gas
and oil, as well as U.S. gas to global gas, helped drive the industrial customer performance.
Although, weather in the fourth quarter was helpful, residential sales continued to reflect challenges from uneven
regional economic growth, and a continued emphasis on energy efficiency and demand side management programs.
Now let's quickly cover parent & other: P&O had an operational loss of $0.34 per share compared to a loss of $0.24 per
share in the same quarter last year. The decline results from tax on the sale of EWC's District Energy business being
recognized as a tax-paying entity, which is in parent & other.

At EWC, operational earnings were $0.48 per share, higher than the $0.33 in the prior period. Outside of EBITDA, the
increase was due largely to changes in consolidated tax benefits and realized gains from routine rebalancing of
decommissioning trust funds.
Turning to EWC EBITDA drivers on slide four, the $28 million decrease was due to several factors, some of which
offset. First, we closed on the District Energy sale for a $44 million pre-tax gain. Next, we recognized a
mark-to-market loss of approximately $45 million due to rising prices. Nuclear volumes improved, while overall prices
were largely flat. O&M was also higher, due primarily to compensation and benefits drivers such as pension and an
adjustment of fourth quarter 2012, following resolution of litigation on spent fuel.
Regarding the mark-to-market recognition, as you know, we have a comprehensive hedging strategy; we manage
commodity, operational and liquidity risks, while providing asymmetrical upside opportunity and downside protection.
During December, forward prices moved above our protective call strikes and with better visibility of operational and
liquidity risk, we made forward sales against those options, locking in incremental margins for early 2014. Unlike the
majority of our commercial activity that is accounted for under hedge accounting, when we hedged our hedge, these
forward sales did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Market prices continued to increase after the forward sales were completed, which drove the negative mark. When
these positions settle in the first quarter, we've realized both the reversal of this mark-to-market loss as well as the
locked-in margin from these transactions. At the end of the day, our activities have been consistent with the hedging
strategy we've talked about for the past several years. The only difference is the late 2013 increase in market prices,
which highlights the option value inherent to the EWC business and our ability to capture it through our hedging
strategy, while still managing risks.
Moving to operating cash flow on slide five, OCF was $990 million in the current quarter, $270 million higher than
2012. The increase reflected higher utility net revenue, lower spending on nuclear refueling outages and lower storm
spending. On the flip side, higher pension funding partially offset the increases.
Now, I'll review highlights from the full-year results starting on slide six. On an operational basis, as Leo said, 2013
earnings per share ended the year $5.36 down from $6.23. The year-over-year drivers are similar to our quarterly
discussion, the largest driver was income tax expense, especially at the utility in 2012 and partially offset by customer
sharing. In 2013, we also saw an increase in utility net revenue, a portion of the net revenue increase was to recover
higher operating expenses.
On slide seven, EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA declined year-over-year, due mainly to higher non-fuel O&M.
Again, the gain on the sale of District Energy was largely offset by the mark-to-market recognition.
Our year-on-year operating cash flow is summarized on slide eight. OCF was about $3.2 billion in 2013, up
approximately $250 million. Full-year drivers were similar to the quarter. In addition, receipt of proceeds from spent
fuel litigation and higher income tax payments were also factors for the full year.
Moving away from results, I'll now turn to our forward-looking financial updates starting on slide nine. Keeping with
past practice, we updated a few line items in the guidance table from late 2013 variances, including final results,
weather, the District Entergy sale and utility income tax.
We've affirmed our operational earnings guidance range, the things have changed as we initiated in October. This year,
the final pension and OPEB discount rates are higher than the 4.75% previously assumed. Pension expense will be
lower, resulting in a benefit of $0.09 per share relative to the guidance assumption. Also, as of December 31, average
revenue in 2014 for EWC's nuclear fleet has increased to approximately $55 per megawatt hour, $4 higher than
assumed in guidance. This $4 does not include the turnaround of the fourth quarter mark-to-market recognition.
Offsetting we're seeing headwinds to our capacity price assumption. Our current full-year estimates for the new LHV
zone is now lower than we expected in October, by a little over $1 per-kW-month. You can see the anticipated effect of
these changes in EWC's EBITDA outlook on slide 10. We also recently identified additional work that must be
completed during Palisades' refueling outage that will increase both the duration and cost of the outage.

Also the Arkansas rate case outcome was clearly disappointing for earnings. Overall, however, indications for the year
are positive, and with current expectations we are near the top of the range. Beyond that is our goal and our goal is
achievable, but not everything is within our control, mainly, weather and market prices but there are still 11 months to
go in the year. We'll be able to better assess changes to 2014 guidance range with more confidence once we are further
into year.
Looking beyond 2014, Leo reviewed our strategy to position the utility and EWC for potential upturns. I would like to
touch on how that strategy aligns with our financial outlook. As Leo said, one key element of our strategy is managing
our cost structure. Previously, we provided a three year O&M outlook of 1.5% to 2.5% compound annual growth rate
off of 2013 base year, including VY direct cost that is shown on slide 11.
Today we are affirming our O&M outlook, and we'd also like to provide some additional clarification. We previously
indicated that we did not expect to reach the top of the range under normal operating conditions. Assuming normal
operations, we expect to be near the bottom end of our outlook. Obviously, there is still potential for variability from
typical drivers or unanticipated changes, such as changes in plant operating needs or even acquisitions, which we
previously noted.
For EWC, with the exception of LHV, we use market force, market prices beyond 2014 have not yet moved as much
with the recent cold, but our outlook remains bullish, and we know the irony between triggering the cap, the ISO New
England forward capacity option for 2017 and 2018, and a backward dated heat rate curves to that point. Another
important component of our growth strategy is our utility sales growth outlook. We talked a lot about the unique
economic development opportunity we have in the Gulf region.
To help you better understand and track this opportunity, we're providing slide 12, which we will update periodically.
As you can see, as of December 31, we had approximately 85 projects totaling 2,400 megawatts in our potential
pipeline. Potential means that the project has been announced, signed or is in underdevelopment with strong possibility
of being completed in our service area and served by Entergy.
Some of these projects will materialize within our three year outlook, some are longer term. On the 2,400 megawatts
we've signed contracts to serve over 1,000 megawatts, and just under 500 megawatts are under construction. One
example of a high potential project under contract is Sasol's planned ethane cracker. In December, Entergy Gulf State
Louisiana entered into a six year up to 200 megawatt electric service agreement. Power Sasol's planned ethane cracker,
the fourth such agreement announced in 2013. Also, none of our potential pipeline projects have been cancelled or
completed since [indiscernible] (32:36).
Slide 13 recaps the three year outlook for each of our business segments. Note that the utility three year outlook of 5%
to 7% is based on the 2013 estimate in November, which translates the $950 million to a $1 billion net income by 2016,
and that assumes the statutory tax rate in 2016. From a financing perspective, the current outlook continues to solidly
support the dividend at its current $3.32 per share level. Planned investment can be funded through an estimated $3.2
billion to $3.4 billion per year operating cash flow and incremental debt capacity afforded through retained earnings.
Finally, investment-grade credit continues to be a priority for us. In late January, as Leo said, several of our operating
companies benefited from Moody's new regulatory view and received upgrades. For productive investments, those
companies should have improved access to capital at attractive terms that will benefit customers. Executing on our
strategy, to achieve or even surpass our three-year outlook, enabled us to maintain solid credit metrics and continue to
provide a competitive return of capital to our owners. And now, the Entergy team is available for questions.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So first, just going back to the rate case strategy, you've talked a lot about load growth
here, you've also alluded to O&M inflation, could you perhaps just talk Arkansas, Mississippi, just rate case filing
expectations over the next couple of years and the ability to hit the 5% to 7%, what are you thinking right now in terms
of going back in, re-hearings et cetera, if you could kind of delineate that?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Leo, you ...
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Yes. I'll start. Hey, Julien. This is Leo. Start with Arkansas, obviously, we've made filing for
our petition for rehearing and we'll see how that goes. And that will obviously inform us in terms of what we do going
forward. In Mississippi, we're still evaluating whether we need to file a rate case, but we do know that 2013 test year
FRP filing is suspended. And if we do file a case, it'll be to prepare Entergy Mississippi for a post-system agreement
timing and also to move some of our power management riders that we recover certain cost around capacity cost
around plants today into base rates. We also had a depreciation rate filing that we did or studied, I believe that was done
in 2011, that could be incorporated in a rate case in Mississippi. But I think also, it allows the opportunity to explore
some alternatives to unknown and measurable changes that could occur during the rate effective period, as Leo talked
about in his opening comments.
As you go forward, obviously, whether we file additional rate cases will be impacted by a couple of things you
mentioned, where we see ourselves in terms of sales growth, the various regulatory mechanisms we have in play within
some of these jurisdictions that might allow us to change dollars we're recovering without necessarily following a base
rate case. For instance, in Texas, where we have rider opportunities. We have rider opportunities in other jurisdictions
as well, Louisiana and in case, I just mentioned Mississippi, in certain cases you can get recovery through riders,
primarily around capacity without filing base rate cases. So, as to where we go past the case that I just discussed, that'll
have a lot to do with the cost structure, with the sales growth, with the investment opportunities that we have overall
and the mechanisms that are in play that will allow us to recover that without necessarily having to make a base rate
case filing.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And I suppose just following up on the ITC deal a little bit here, just thinking
about ability to reinvest in the system, specifically on transmission, I'd be curious, is there any ability to ramp up
spending there or is this more about a wait-and-see in terms of what MISO opportunities might be forthcoming. Could
you perhaps give us a little bit more context for what that opportunity might be if it exists?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Julien, where our transmission is today, we do have in – as we said, over the next three years
$1.7 billion in our plan for transmission expenditures. As I mentioned in my comments, there are several things out
there that could increase that if there are projects that are beneficial to customers that reduce congestion that improves
reliability that we provide access to generation within the MISO equipment et cetera, where they – any PMBP projects
that would be out there part of the order 1,000 megawatts.
So there are things out there just in the system as it stands. The other aspect is, as we start to get more line of sight on
this economic development front, certainly if 2,400 megawatt show up or more that's just what has been announced
today and there is nothing in the commodity strips that would lead you to believe that, that renaissance is over. That's
going to provide a situation where there might be more in transmission investment as well, if you start adding like the
Sasol example that Drew gave, 200 megawatts in one facility. Those sorts of things are going to have an impact. So,
there is the opportunity for that transmission investment to be larger if there are things that we can do to benefit
customers or to hook up new customers and it would appear that the market is right to have some of that happen, but
it's a little early to tell you right now.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kit Konolige with BGC.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Good morning, Kit.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Just a couple of somewhat unrelated questions. On the impacts that have been increased the
expectations for 2014 EPS to the top end of the range. I think you mentioned pension was $0.09 positive and then the –
it appeared that a significant driver was higher expected prices at the nuclear fleet, the EWC nuclear fleet. Did you
quantify that or did I miss that?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Well, I think, Kit, if you look at the slide that shows the EBITDA for EWC, you can see where
most of that is, particularly if you compare to the last update we gave last quarter with the same slide. And so it's up
considerably and, I don't know, eyeballing it $150 million, $175 million.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: $150 million, $175 million. And this is due to just higher prices as a result of higher gas prices
and cold weather and generally the 2014 commodity prices being very robust recently?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Yeah, and part of it is, what we've seen very recently, there's still a good bit of it that is still to
come. This is a mark of current expectations using forward prices as of December 31 and so this includes – and at that
point, it included the entire year of forward prices. So obviously, we've experienced some of that in January, some of
that's been realized early this month but then we have the full year still ahead of us.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Right. And then to switch to your discussion of strategic outlook for the nuclear plant to EWC, it
sounds as though there's a little bit of a change in tone, whereas previously I think, for example, at EEI you had said, if
you own ETR you should expect to own Indian Point. Now it sounds like if you own ETR you should expect to own all
the currently held nuclear plants with the exception of Vermont Yankee obviously. What's been the change there, was
that the capacity pricing in New England that really made the difference or am I seeing a change where there really
hasn't been one?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: No, I think you're seeing a change, Kit. [ph] It doesn't have (41:53) anything to do with the
near-term pricing, it's really a function of, we've been telling you for a while that we were exploring opportunities and
in the exploration of those opportunities we didn't find anything that we liked. And we like owning them better. So
that's where we are at this point and we still own Vermont Yankee also, and we'll continue to own it even when it's
being decommissioned.
So there is a change. We still believe that the separation of the risks would make sense, but we also believe in creating
value and if we can't do it without the right amount of value then we're going to continue to hold those plants and, as
you see, our strategy is to preserve optionality in those plants and we do that through operating and through our
hedging strategy and through the relicensing process and then, obviously, to manage the risk as best we can. So you did
pick up on a change.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Very good. Thank you very much.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you, Kit.

<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: I wanted to follow up on Julien's question on transmission and, Leo, you talked about a
couple of categories of potential spend over time. Could you talk a little bit to the process at MISO and just what we
should be looking for thinking/about in terms of, for example, as customers start to show up, as MISO continues its
planning, how we should expect to start to see some of these plans come forward in terms of further spending on
transmission?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, the majority of it is going is what's in our base plan. And then the next layers of it will be
what comes about through just normal business. It's just such that our normal business includes some significant
potential load, as it were, as if they're industrial customers as opposed to residential customers and industrial customers
of size. So a lot of that, while it's in MISO and there's a planning process and it becomes part of the plan, it's not – in
the realm of outcome, I don't think it's significantly different than what we have in general and have traditionally had.
We just might have an opportunity bigger than the $1.7 billion. And then as it relates to the process, once we start to
move in over the next few years with the multi-value projects, the MVP projects and more FERC Order 1000 things,
then we'll have to compete in that arena and we would expect to do so and to be successful.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay, great. And wanted to shift gears over to Indian Point, you had on slide 28 given an
update on the status. I wondered on the Coastal Zone Management paths, if you could just speak to next steps we
should be looking for. You gave an update on all three elements of the Coastal Zone process, but wondering if you
could just give us a sense for next steps on those different paths?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Sure. Yeah. Stephen, a couple things here; so first is the consistency filing itself has been
extended to the end of 2014, that's simply due to the need for the parties to work together, share more information,
further that issues. So, that was previously set for March; it was moved back to the end of the year.
As it relates to our other option on grandfathering, I think you're well aware of the fact we lost the initial decision on
that. We are in the process of appealing that decision through the state courts and we may have further appeals
depending on the outcome of that case. That will probably take us through the end of 2014 as well.
And then of course, we have the previous review argument, which is held in the background as another option, that the
NRC has not yet ruled on and is also being considered by the State of New York. So, we think through all these various
processes that this will go on for a period of time. And eventually we plan to be successful with it, but obviously a lot
of uncertainty now with the various cases that are ongoing.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Yeah. Excuse me. Hi, good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: A couple questions. On the EWC outlook, it looked like 2015, 2016 was a little lower – if I
my ruler was correct – than at EEI, is that just updating this New York capacity assumption?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: That's certainly in there, Steven. Yeah, I don't know that we're as precise with rulers, but yes,
that's baked in there, that's part of it.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. So, I mean it's about flattish I guess overall, so it's not that different, okay.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Yeah, I mean I think that's the way I would describe it. And we haven't seen the energy
markets really move upward in any material fashion since then, a little bit in 2015, but the capacity prices is clearly,
and we've said that's offsetting.

<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay, because the 2015, 2016 kind of switched a little bit, 2016 looks like it's stepping
down a little bit. I assume that's the capacity and then the energy hasn't moved. Okay.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: [ph] That's correct. (47:45)
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: And on your utility sales growth and the – all this new industrial load and potential, I know
you've probably answered this but just how can we track what is in your forecast and what is not? And if you do better
in terms of getting more load and customers is that something that definitely benefits the bottom line or is there like a
lag issue in terms of spending money to serve it? Just how should we think about kind of when you update this, what's
in there what's not, and it is doing better just definitely an upside?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah, Steve, this is Theo. I think when you think about what's in it, what's not, primarily
I think we did talk about this a little bit at EEI, if I recall. What's in, in the forecast is basically the things that we felt
had a clear line of sight on, felt good about it at that time which primarily are things we've had signed agreements or
arrangements in place. I was very clear we were going to have such an arrangement, so that's what you have in the
forecast.
As we move forward, you see on Drew's slide, I believe it's on page 12, contracts signed, a lot of that will show up in
that particular category. And basically I believe maybe about a third of that maybe shows up through 2016. So there is
still amounts post the years 2016, so I think that's how you think about it.
In terms of how it affects the bottom line, obviously, as the sales take place depending on where you are within the
process of your various regulatory mechanisms in those jurisdictions, we'll inform as to the impacts those will have. If
there is investment associated with it, as Leo talked about the transmission opportunity, obviously that investment
would be incorporated and you would have the sales, you would have the cost. As rates get reset, obviously, the sales
become a part of your revenue requirements, the cost become a part of your investment. And the investment, obviously,
and the returns on it flow to the bottom line, the sales become a part of that process of resetting rates.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Steve, this is Leo, just to kind of add to that. If you think about it for the near-term in
particularly primarily the transmission investment to the extent these are large loads, you would anticipate that sales
level would be significant enough to make it positive to the bottom line even though there could be some lag in the
recovery of the transmission investment in the areas we've got FRPs, you're going to have some catch-up in the next
year and then in the case of Texas, for example, you've got the transmission rider which could help in some respects.
But we're trying to put the regulatory mechanism in place to mitigate any lag, but at some point in time the size of these
could make a big difference in how this turns out as well.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. Just one other clarification, if you announce another kind of new customer contract,
let's say tomorrow, that could be already in your backlog if not necessarily incremental, like not all these have already
been announced.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: That's correct, yeah.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Yeah, so that would move something from the potential pipeline maybe into the contracts
signed line.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay, great. Thank you.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Paul.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: The expectations for the new capacity zone in New York. I was wondering if you could just
sort of give us a little bit more flavor as to what they might be and the impact of Danskammer if it's there or not there,
do you guys have any sensitivity about that or any sense you could tell us about that?
<A - William M. Mohl>: Sure. This is Bill. As it relates to – I think Drew mentioned in his script that as it relates to
Lower Hudson Valley zone, we saw a decrease there from the plan that we had announced last fall, probably a little
over a $1 a KW a month. For LHV, we've seen – our point of view for the rest of the state perhaps increased a little bit,
so if you think about it in doing your analytics, you might want to think about it. As right now, we're at probably at $2 a
KW a month uplift for all of our New York ISO capacity whereas previously we had indicated a $3 a KW a month
uplift for the LHV zone itself. Right now, that estimate does not assume that Danskammer is in service for this
summer. My understanding of that right now is that that is a issue which will be evaluated in March of this year and we
will know better than as to whether or not that plant will be able to operate and qualify as capacity for that zone.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And any sense as to what that would be if it does show up?
<A - William M. Mohl>: I do not have that at this point in time.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Okay, great. And then just finally with the mark-to-market loss reversal, I thought the
explanation was really great. I just wasn't clear on the quantitative impact that that had in terms of the impact for 2014
versus 2013 as a result of it.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Okay. So the mark-to-market loss in 2013 was around $45 million pre-tax and then we would
see that uplift in 2014. So it's in that EBITDA number that you're seeing in that chart on EWC.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And so that's not going to be there probably in 2015. So, that's probably part of the
reason why it goes down as well, right?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: That's correct, that's correct. And actually some of it's at VY [Vermont Yankee] as well, that's
for some of the hedges there. So that's one of the reasons why VY looks much larger than expected.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Great. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys, a couple of questions a little bit unrelated to each other here, and thank you for
obviously taking my questions on the call. First, residential demand, as I understand that you get a lot more of your
utility margin from the residential and small commercial customers than you do on the industrial side. Can you just talk
a little bit about what you're seeing in residential demand, I mean, it's lagged industrial significantly, the major startups
you're seeing in your service territory would imply a growth in job levels and improvement in unemployment rates, but
it doesn't seem to be reflected in residential load levels.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Theo?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Sure, Michael. I think what you're seeing, I believe, would be consistent with what
you're seeing with other companies across country, you're starting to see the effects of energy efficiency. And I think as
we started the year of 2013 on our first call, we talked about our views of the impacts that had and we would expect to
see residential sales growth tempered. And as you can see from our results for the year, are actually slightly down a

little bit, that's not inconsistent with our expectations. I will say that the degree of which it's down is probably maybe a
little more than we had expected, but not much. As it relates to the economic change, I think what you see obviously is
a net effect. We do see, still see positive customer growth, if you look at our customer account numbers, but what we're
starting to see again I think is a phenomenon that you see across the industry, which is usage per customer is going
down. So, while I think you do are seeing some positive economic effects through actual increase in customer accounts,
energy efficiency obviously is having an impact on what you would see incrementally relative to those increased
customer accounts.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Can you talk a little bit about the utility margin, meaning how much as a percent of total
comes from the three big customer classes, just trying to kind of, I don't know, get my arms around demand levels,
customer growth and megawatt levels on industrial customer side versus what's actually happening to the Entergy
utilities margins?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah. Just in ballpark numbers, I think what you see residential maybe is maybe margin,
maybe around $0.04 or so, commercial is $0.03 and maybe industrial maybe somewhere around $0.02 generally
speaking.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Okay. Drew, a question for you just real quick. On cash versus GAAP taxes, what
do you expect to be in the way of a cash taxpayer over the next few years, what's embedded in 2014 guidance?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Well, we haven't – from a guidance perspective on earnings, we've put in, I think it was about
36% for an effective tax rate. Given our NOL position, we would expect our cash tax rate to be lower than that, but we
haven't put any guidance out for that specifically.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Materially lower, like do you expect to be a cash taxpayer or are you likely in non-cash
taxpaying status for few years?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: I wouldn't say we're in non-cash taxpaying status because we actually make deposits and those
types of things as we go forward. So we will be paying some taxes, but it will be materially lower I would expect to the
effective tax rate, at least for 2014.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And how big is the NOL at the end of the year?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Well, that'll be out in the K. Right now, I think it was at – as of last year, it was still around a
little over $12 billion, most of that was tied up in the decommissioning election as cost of goods sold, about
three-quarters of it was there.

changed. As we look at the dividend, we would be looking at that as we grow – as the utility grows as we look at the
overall risk profile of the company, we'll look at the investment needs that we have based on just how quickly the
utility grows and what happens with the need for capital there, if it were to be above, for example, the three-year plan
that we have now, if the load growth shows up the way we would like it to which would be higher than the 2% to
2.25% range then certainly that may increase the need for capital within the utility impact. Not only earnings growth
that would give us the opportunity to pay a higher dividend, but also the reinvestments we need in the near-term to
make it. So, all of that's going to go into the mix pretty much like it always has, but the bottom line of the – the utility
pays the dividend and the merchant business cash flow is distributed differently is still the order of the day.
