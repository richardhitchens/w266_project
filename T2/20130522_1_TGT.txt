MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Release
Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you
to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being
recorded Wednesday, May 22, 2013.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Gregg W. Steinhafel
Good morning, and welcome to our 2013 first quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Kathee
Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer.
This morning, I'll provide a high level summary of our first quarter results and strategic priorities for the rest of the
year. Then Kathee will discuss category results, guest insights, and upcoming initiatives; and finally, John will provide
more detail on our financial performance along with our outlook for second quarter and the full year. Following John's
remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via
webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to
answer any follow-up questions you may have.

Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A
reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.
Our first quarter earnings fell short of our expectations as we faced a choppy and challenging environment caused by
unfavorable weather and this year's payroll tax increase. Our U.S. business generated softer than expected sales and
traffic, particularly in our seasonal categories as we experienced one of the coldest spring seasons on record following
record warmth a year ago. While we are not satisfied with this quarter's performance, we remain highly confident in our
strategy and our team's ability to deliver strong results going forward across a broad range of conditions.
In the first quarter, our U.S. segment generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, down 5% from last year's
outstanding performance. Our first quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.77, $0.28 lower than adjusted EPS,
driven primarily by $0.24 of dilution attributable to our Canadian segment. As we mentioned in our fourth quarter call,
this year there are several notable changes affecting our financial reporting, which John will cover in detail in a few
minutes.
In the quarter, comparable store sales declined 0.6% from last year's 5.3% increase. First quarter comparable
transactions were down 1.9% following last year's increase of 2% keeping us essentially flat on two year basis.
In much of the U.S., traffic in our seasonal categories was unexpectedly soft as guests held off purchasing spring items
in the face of cold and wet weather. Our merchandising teams did a great job reacting to the pace of sales in these
categories, retiming receipts and adjusting them downward, so we are still in a healthy inventory position today.
Despite the weather impact on seasonal categories, sales and traffic in our digital channels continue to grow at a robust
pace. Overall, first quarter digital sales grew in the high teens and increased more than 20% net of our most seasonally
sensitive categories.
Target's mobile traffic and sales continue to grow at a triple digit pace with mobile traffic representing more than 30%
of our digital traffic in the first quarter. We're pleased with these results as mobile is rapidly becoming the key platform
for digital commerce across all of retail and we know that Target guests have a particular affinity for mobile
engagement.
After two years of preparation, in March, we opened our first 24 Canadian stores in the greater Toronto area and we are
very pleased with the reception we received from our new Canadian guests. We experienced an unexpectedly strong
surge in sales, as guests were eager to see their newly opened Target store. The mix of sales in home and apparel was
even higher than expected as guests shopped our assortment of stylish own brands and national brands, responding to
the outstanding value we provide on both.
Now that we are beyond the grand opening surge in this first cycle of stores, we are encouraging our new Canadian
guests to make Target a preferred destination for categories throughout the store, including food, health, beauty and
household essentials, as these categories play a key role in driving trip frequency over time.
As it is already in the U.S., REDcard Rewards will be a key differentiator for Target in Canada and we're encouraged
that REDcard penetration of sales in our Canadian segment was ahead of plan in the first quarter. Two weeks ago, we
opened our second wave of 24 Canadian stores in British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba and we're very pleased with
the initial guest response in these markets and the ability of our teams and systems to accommodate the increasing
volume of traffic and sales.
We plan to open another 20 stores in Canada later in the quarter, on the way to operating 124 Canadian stores by the
end of the year. This means we expect to open more Target stores in our first year in Canada than we opened in our
first 10 years in the United States, an incredible accomplishment that has required unprecedented effort by teams
throughout the company.
In the U.S. we opened six new stores in the first quarter, including an additional CityTarget location in Los Angeles.
We now operate six CityTarget locations in four cities and we continue to be pleased with the results in these stores.
Sales have essentially met our expectations and the mix of home and apparel has been better than expected. Similar to
our Canadian stores, we are focused on our CityTarget stores on driving sales and visits in our frequency and

commodity categories. changing guest habits and inspiring them to visit us more often for both wants and needs.
In the first quarter, we also closed the sale of our U.S. credit card receivable portfolio to TD Bank Group and began
deploying proceeds to reduce debt and repurchase shares. We're very pleased to have reached the right agreement with
the right partner in a transaction that removes these more volatile assets from our balance sheet. The portfolio continues
to perform well generating meaningful income for Target through our profit-sharing arrangement with TD.
As we look ahead to the second quarter and the remainder of the year, we remain cautiously optimistic about both the
macroeconomic environment and consumer behavior. Both of these business drivers continue to reflect slow, uneven
growth and ongoing cross currents of positive and negative indicators, just as they have for the past few years. For
example, while we are pleased that the housing market has stabilized and jobless claims have been declining, we are
mindful that household formation and job growth remain particularly weak among younger demographic groups.
In addition, guests continue to face the headwinds of this year's payroll tax increase and a meaningful lack of income
growth. With these considerations in mind, we remain focused on strategies that position our business for profitable
growth, both today and in the long-term. We continue to invest in initiatives that integrate multiple channels, like our
recent beta launch of Cartwheel, the result of our collaboration with Facebook along with tests of same-day delivery
with Google and eBay.
And we're testing opportunities within our own supply chain that will leverage our existing store and distribution assets
to provide additional services and capabilities our guests value most. We're investing to drive adoption of our 5%
REDcard Rewards and Pharmacy Rewards loyalty programs, which have proven to be unique and powerful
differentiators and sales drivers for Target. Both of these programs offer guests the opportunity for even greater
savings, leading them to shop more merchandise categories more often.
We're investing in efforts to better serve all of our guests, driving traffic and sales by segmenting our stores and
assortments to match local taste and preferences, and we continue to offer digital innovations that create a link between
our stores and social media. We're continuing to pursue new and differentiated merchandise in all of our assortments,
including our recently announced partnership with Warner Brothers and DC Entertainment to feature Justice League
merchandise across multiple categories. Kathee will provide more detail on programs like these that create a sense of
discovery for our guests, while deepening their loyalty for Target.
Beyond the value we provide on exclusive well-designed merchandise, we continue to invest in everyday low prices,
which we reduce even further in our weekly ad. In addition, we stand behind our prices with policy to match local
competitor print ads, as well as our largest online competitors and through REDcard Rewards and Pharmacy Rewards
our most loyal guests have the opportunity to save even more.
Throughout the company, we take a disciplined approach to the deployment of cash, combining strong financial rigor
in capital investment decisions with a focus on returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share
repurchase. And, of course, none of our efforts would be possible without the outstanding work of our more than
360,000 team members who greet and serve our guests every day, carefully manage inventory and expenses in this
challenging environment and proudly represent our brand in the communities where they live.
In spite of first quarter tax increases, unseasonably cold weather and challenging prior-year comparisons, our
underlying business continues to be stable and healthy. Our team is focused on driving outstanding results across
categories, channels, regions and guest segments every day, even while we continue to position our business for
success with investments in new stores and formats and more flexible ways of serving our guests. We believe that our
outstanding team aligned in support of a well-defined strategy will drive strong performance both this year and over
time.
Before I turn the call over to Kathee, I want to take a moment to thank Terry Scully who retired from his role as
President of Target's Financial and Retail Services team in April. Terry has been a valuable member of the Target team
for nearly 35 years and under his leadership, the Financial and Retail Services team has played a key role in
strengthening guest loyalty and delivering substantial profitable growth for Target. Over the last few years, Terry and
his team have worked tirelessly to find the right partner to purchase our credit card receivables portfolio culminating in

this quarter's sale.
And finally, I want to pause to express our condolences to the residents of Moore, Oklahoma, including Target team
members, guests and their families who were affected by this week's devastating tornado. We have been working with
emergency responders, community organizations and local schools to evaluate immediate needs and ways that Target
can help. And yesterday we announced that Target is donating $250,000 in support of relief effort, $200,000 of cash
and in-kind donations to emergency responders and community organizations including the Red Cross and the
Salvation Army and $50,000 to support rebuilding efforts at the two elementary schools that were badly damaged by
the tornado.
Now, Kathee will provide more detail on first quarter results and outline initiatives for the second quarter and beyond.
Kathee?
Kathryn A. Tesija
Thanks, Gregg. Those of you who have listened to our conference calls over time know that often when we're asked
about weather impacts, we point out that on average the weather is average. This has certainly proven true in the last
two spring seasons. Last year with an unusually early and warm spring across much of the country, we saw very strong
sales in our seasonal and weather-sensitive categories.
This year, in the face of a cold and late spring, sales were quite soft in those same categories and while we are
committed to delivering strong results in all types of environments, we believe it's important to understand the impact
of this year's weather on our first quarter sales results. Specifically, first quarter comparable store sales in
weather-dependent categories like seasonal apparel, lawn, patio and sporting goods lagged the rest of our assortments
by 6 to 7 percentage points. This sales gap was even wider in areas of the country which experienced below average
temperatures and which was much smaller in areas that experienced much more normal spring temperatures like the
Western U.S.
Looking more broadly at our category results, first quarter comparable store sales continued to be strongest in less
discretionary categories such as food, health, beauty and household essentials, all of which experienced low single digit
increases. Our home and apparel categories were both down in the low single digits, and hardlines saw a mid-single
digit decline in comps. Within hardlines, electronics continues to see softness in video games along with televisions,
particularly early in the quarter, as last year's 53rd accounting week moved Super Bowl related sales out of the quarter.
As Gregg mentioned, our guests continue to shop cautiously, planning their spending and sticking to shopping lists as
they continue to feel the burden of economic pressures. Recent guest surveys indicate that three quarters of our guests
are aware of this year's payroll tax increase, and among those, the majority have noticed the impact of the tax increase
on their paychecks and indicate that it's affected their spending.
Basket data confirms that needs-based trips have been increasing, while wants-based trips focused on discretionary
categories have been declining. And notably, recent data from The Conference Board indicates that while sentiment
among consumers regarding their current situation has been improving since late last year, consumer sentiment
regarding the future has been declining in recent months. To drive traffic and sales in this environment, we know it's
more important than ever to provide value to our guests on a high quality, differentiated assortment delivered through a
convenient shopping experience.
In the digital space, we continue to apply a test and learn approach when rolling out applications and capabilities so we
can determine what works best for our guests. We're pleased that our digital traffic grew faster than industry
benchmarks again this quarter. We continue to explore ways to integrate digital technologies with social media and our
stores to provide a unique shopping experience for our guests.
This quarter's beta launch of Cartwheel, which we developed in collaboration with Facebook, is a perfect example. This
first-of-a-kind experience gives guests a fun way to save on hundreds of items throughout our stores. Upon
authenticating this application through their Facebook profile, guests receive 10 spots to fill with deals of their choice

from among hundreds of items throughout our store. Depending on the product, the deals feature a range of discounts
and expiration dates and guests can switch between offers at any time. Deals are redeemed at checkout in our stores
either by scanning a single barcode on a mobile device or a printout from our desktop computer.
Guests can share Cartwheel with friends on Facebook to show off their latest finds and see what their friends are
buying. And the more guests interact with Cartwheel by choosing and redeeming deals and sharing those deals with
friends, the more offers they unlock for themselves. We launched Cartwheel in beta and we're encouraging guests to
provide feedback so you can make ongoing real-time enhancements to the Cartwheel experience.
Initial sign-ups for Cartwheel have exceeded expectations. Thousands of guests signed up in the first week and we saw
a meaningful increase when we added a link to Cartwheel on Target.com. More than 10% of guests who have signed up
already have redeemed Cartwheel offers in one of our stores.
Also this quarter, we launched a Beauty Box test to understand our guests' appetite to pay for samples of beauty
products. We tested this offer on Target's Facebook Style page and sold through our inventory within a week. In
addition, the offer generated favorable media coverage and positive feedback in social media. Based on these results,
we will continue to explore ways to surprise and delight guests with box-based offers that support our Expect More,
Pay Less brand promise.
In March, we were very pleased to announce agreement to acquire CHEFS Catalog and assets of Cooking.com in two
separate transactions. These e-commerce acquisitions are aimed at expanding Target's presence in the growing cooking
and kitchenware market. We've combined the assets of Cooking.com with CHEFS Catalog to create a new,
wholly-owned subsidiary which will continue to operate the two brands under their current names. We believe these
transactions present a strategic growth opportunity to serve guests who are increasingly looking online for cooking
solutions to make their lives easier, from utensils and cookware to recipes. These strategic transactions provide us a
great way to address this growing opportunity and provide expanded online options for our guests.
In select markets, we're continuing to test same-day delivery in partnership with Google and eBay. Our focus, in these
tests, is to understand the level of guest engagement and this fulfillment opportunity. These projects, which are still in
the test phase, continue to provide valuable information on the store backroom capabilities and processes needed to
support this offering.
And as we mentioned last quarter, this year we're launching our own test of fulfillment – flexible fulfillment in the
Minneapolis market. This month, we launched a test in which team members are given the opportunity to order online
and pickup in store. We will use our team members' feedback to improve the process and experience before the pilot
becomes guest-facing later in the year. Two other team member pilots, pay in store to pickup at another store and pay
online and ship from store, are planned for late in the year.
In both our stores and online, we feature great designers and brands, and continue to roll out new, unique merchandise
that creates a sense of discovery for our guests. Our goal is to show guests that design means more than fashion and
that great design doesn't have to mean high prices.
In home, we continue to be pleased with results from our partnership with Nate Berkus. The collection includes a
growing list of products in a wide range of categories including bedding, bath, accessories, lighting, rugs and
stationary.
We also continue to see great results from the roll out of Threshold brand, which is replacing Target Home, our largest
owned brand. We debuted Threshold last fall and guests continue to respond to this fully re-designed, high-quality
collection that's inspiring them to update their homes. To celebrate this new brand, earlier this month Target
constructed a life-sized dollhouse in New York's iconic Grand Central Terminal, where guests could explore a
two-story seven-room dollhouse decorated with more than 3,500 pieces from the Threshold collection. Select
furnishings were tagged with QR codes to be shoppable right from the dollhouse.
In our stationary category, we're excited about our collaboration with Todd Oldham on the Kid Made Modern
collection, which offers creative activity kits and supplies to inspire kids through art. The collection has a clean, simple

and fresh design that's gender neutral and age appropriate to inspire all children and parents. We launched this
collection of creative design tools late last year and set a new collection this spring.
Following our successful first quarter partnership with Prabal Gurung and Kate Young, we recently announced our
latest design collaboration with Lauren Bush Lauren and the roll out of the FEED USA + Target collection.
In late June, we'll feature a lifestyle collection of stylish products in home, sporting goods, stationary, apparel and
accessories. The collection, which reflects a modern Americana aesthetic, while supporting an important cause,
includes more than 50 products across a range of price points with most items less than $25. Each item in the collection
has an associated number of meals listed with it and with each sale Target will donate the monetary equivalent of that
number of meals to Feeding America, the nation's leading domestic hunger relief charity and a partner of Target since
2001. During the times that the products will be available, we expect to provide more than ten million meals for
families across the U.S.
In Canada, we've been very pleased with results from our partnership with Roots Outfitters, an iconic Canadian brand
that offers quality craftsmanship and comfortable styling on a line of apparel for men, women and kids. And we're very
excited that we recently announced a fall partnership with Beaver Canoe, a member of the Roots Canada family, to
offer an exclusive collection of cabin-chic apparel and home items in our Canadian stores this fall.
Entertainment had a great first quarter, including the release of our exclusive deluxe version of The 20/20 Experience
from Justin Timberlake. The strength of the guest response put this release among the top three at Target in the last ten
years. We followed the success with releases of exclusive albums from The Band Perry and Michael Buble in April.
In electronics, we've partnered with WIRED magazine to offer a custom curated assortment of consumer electronics
and gadgets tested by their editors, featuring their expert tips on usage and key features. And in April, Target became
the exclusive mass retailer to debut the Beats by Dr. Dre Neon Mixr Headphones, available in eye-catching green,
orange, pink, yellow and blue.
We've long known the value we can create through segmentation of our stores and assortments based on store location
and demographics. We continue to develop tools and processes that allow us to further localize assortments and
experiences to match the specific markets where our stores are located. We are focused of providing a deeper presence
of locally relevant products and brands across the store including categories like food, beauty, home and entertainment
and continue to invest in unique multi-channel experiences like Cartwheel that allow guests to choose their own offers
and further integrate their Target experience into their social networks.
Now, John will share his insights on our first quarter financial performance and our outlook for the second quarter and
full year. John?
John J. Mulligan
Thanks, Kathee. As Gregg mentioned, we're disappointed with our first quarter financial performance. Sales in the U.S.
were softer than expected even relative to updated guidance we provided in April, causing our reported earnings per
share to fall short of our updated guidance as well. Adjusted earnings per share, which measures the results of our U.S.
operations, were $1.05. Representing a 5% decrease from last year. First quarter GAAP earnings per share were $0.77,
reflecting losses on early retirement of debt, which reduced our EPS by $0.41. EPS dilution related to our Canadian
segment of $0.24 and net accounting gains of $0.36 related to the sale of our credit card portfolio.
Before I turn to our segment results, I want to remind you of a couple of factors that will be affecting our financial
reporting this year. First, with the sale of our receivables, beginning with first quarter, we are no longer reporting a
credit card segment and we now have two reportable segments; a new U.S. segment and a Canadian segment. In the
first quarter, we began recognizing profit sharing payments from TD net of operating expenses within SG&A expense
in the U.S. segment.

To provide context, in April 16, 8-K we provided revised quarterly segment reporting for fiscal years 2010 through
2012 in which credit card revenues net of expenses from our former U.S. credit card segment were recognized within
SG&A expenses in the new U.S. segment. In this year's financial reporting, revised 2012 U.S. segment results will be
presented as prior-year results. To provide additional context, this year's rate analysis includes a comparison to last
year's performance in historical U.S. retail segment.
For simplicity, to the extent that's possible, in my discussions today I will focus only on this year's U.S. segment results
compared with last year's revised U.S. segment results. Second, as I mentioned in our conference call – last conference
call, we've made changes to our vendor agreements regarding payments received in support of our marketing programs.
As a result, in fiscal 2013, these payments will be recognized as a reduction in our cost of sales rather than a reduction
to SG&A expense. This change is expected to create equivalent year-over-year increases in our U.S. segment gross
margin and SG&A expense rates of 20 to 25 basis points without affecting EBITDA and EBIT margin rates.
With that as context, I'll turn to first quarter performance in our new U.S. segment. Total sales increased 0.5% on a
0.6% decline in comparable store sales combined with the contribution from new stores. Among the drivers of
comparable store sales, traffic was down 1.9%, partially offset by a 1.3% increase in average ticket. Our first quarter
traffic decline essentially offset a 2% increase a year ago. As we told you at the time, we believed first quarter 2012
traffic was unusually strong due to the warm weather and that proved to be the case as full year 2012 traffic was up
0.5%. While we expect traffic will continue to be challenging given our near-term outlook for the economy and the
consumer, we don't expect to continue to see traffic declines of the magnitude we saw in the first quarter.
With the added pressure on household budgets from the recent payroll tax increase, the simplicity and compelling
nature of our 5% REDcard Rewards discount, it's clearly attracting an increasing number of guests. The penetration of
sales on REDcards reached 17.1% in the first quarter up from less than 12% a year ago. While discounts from this
program continue to put pressure on our gross margin rate, this investment paid back through the benefit of increased
loyalty and sales. We continue to see households increase their spending more than 50% on average when they began
using a REDcard. And in Kansas City, which is a year ahead of the rest of the country, penetration is above 20% and
the rate of increase has shown no sign of slowing down.
Our U.S. segment gross margin rate was 30.7% in the first quarter, up about 50 basis points from a year ago. The
change in recognition of vendor payments explained about 20 basis points of this increase. The remainder of the
improvement was driven by rate increases within categories, which more than offset continuing gross margin rate
pressure from our sales driving REDcard Rewards and remodel programs.
Every year, Kathee's team works hard to incrementally improve gross margin rates within categories, and the
year-over-year benefit from these efforts can vary meaningful from quarter-to-quarter. In the first quarter, the
magnitude of category rate improvement was stronger than normal, and we're expecting to see a more modest benefit in
upcoming quarters.
Our first quarter U.S. segment SG&A rate of 20.3% was about 130 basis points higher than last year's revised U.S.
segment rate. The primary drivers of this variance are about 50 basis points resulting from lower earnings on the credit
card portfolio and about 40 basis points related to technology, including our multi-channel efforts. In addition, the
change in vendor payments drove the rate higher by about 20 basis points and of course, with lower than expected
sales, we saw less overall expense leverage than we anticipated.
On this last point, it's important to note that our first quarter results reflected meaningful store productivity
improvements and the entire organization did a great job controlling expenses. As I mentioned in the last call, we're
anticipating incremental expense pressure from technology investments throughout 2013. And we plan to offset that
pressure through disciplined expense management across the enterprise as the year progresses.
Also, I think it's important to provide more context for the decline in our earnings from the credit card portfolio,
because the portfolio continues to experience outstanding performance. However, there are three separate reasons,
which drove lower earnings from the credit card portfolio in the first quarter. First, the asset is smaller than a year ago.
Second, we're annualizing a $35 million reserve release in the first quarter 2012. And finally, we began sharing

portfolio profits with TD after the sale closed in March. Notably, among these three reasons, profit sharing drove less
than half of the year-over-year reduction in Target's earnings from the credit card portfolio, and we expect all of these
pressures will continue for the next several quarters.
Moving down the U.S. segment P&L, we reported a first quarter EBITDA rate of 10.4%, about 80 basis points lower
than last year's revised U.S. segment rate. With about 50 basis points related to our credit card portfolio, that means our
U.S. retail operations accounted for only a 30 basis point decline in the EBIT rate compared with last year, which is
relatively stable when one considers that sales were unexpectedly soft this year and we were annualizing a 5.3% comp
last year.
In our Canadian segment, we generated $86 million in sales from 24 stores that were open, on average, a little more
than half the quarter. Whenever we open a new store in the U.S., there is a rush of traffic and sales as curious guests
shop it for the first time, but the rush in Canada exceeded our expectations.
The first quarter gross margin rate in Canada was more than 38%, which is much stronger than our long-term
expectations for a couple of reasons. First, in new stores we experienced a strong initial mix of home and apparel sales,
as guests tend to shop these categories on their first trip to these stores. In addition, given the short time these stores
have been open; they have not yet experienced any meaningful transitions or clearance activity. So this quarter's
Canadian gross margin rate didn't reflect the impact of markdowns we'd expect to see over time.
First quarter Canadian segment P&L was dominated by start-up expenses related to the 100 additional stores we're
preparing to open later in the quarter. For the quarter, Canadian segment operations drove $0.24 of dilution to our
consolidated earnings per share.
With the sale of our credit card portfolio in March, we recognized a pre-tax accounting gain of $391 million, of which
$166 million was cash received in excess of book value and $225 million was related to a beneficial interest asset. This
asset effectively represents a receivable for the present value of future profit sharing payments we expect to receive
from TD on the credit card balances transferred at the time of the sale.
Going forward, a portion of the profit sharing payments from TD will be applied to unwind the beneficial interest
assets. We expect to fully unwind it in three to four years and expect to reduce its size by about 50% in the first 12
months following the sale. Also following the portfolio sale, we began deploying proceeds to retire debt and repurchase
shares. Concurrent with the sale, we repaid at par $1.5 billion in funding that was previously backed by the receivables.
We also launched debt tender offers to repurchase another $1 billion in high coupon debt, which led to losses recorded
in interest expense of $445 million in the quarter. Of course these tender offers created a meaningful economic benefit
not reflected in the accounting for these losses. During the quarter, we also paid off commercial paper that we had used
to provide short-term funding following the $2 billion in debt maturities last January.
Finally, there's another $500 million maturity in June, which we expect to fund with proceeds from the sale. We're
pleased that with the completion of the sale, we were able to remove these more volatile assets from our balance sheet
and quickly reduce a meaningful amount of debt that was funding them. Over time, we expect to apply the remainder of
the proceeds from the portfolio sale to repurchase shares. In the first quarter, we invested $547 million to repurchase
8.5 million Target shares at an average price of just over $64. For the full year, we continue to expect to invest more
than $2 billion to retire shares. And we'll continue to govern the pace of execution in support of our goal to maintain
our strong investment-grade credit ratings.
We paid first quarter dividends of $232 million marking the 182nd consecutive quarterly dividend we've paid since
becoming a public company. We will recommend that the board approve an increase in the dividend later this year,
which would make 2013 our 42nd straight year in which we increased the annual dividend.
Now let's turn to our expectations for the second quarter and the year. In the U.S., we remain cautious about the near
term sales environment given the economic and consumer challenges Kathee and Gregg just mentioned earlier. Yet
with the recent weather challenge behind us and an easier comparison from last year, we expect second quarter
comparable store sales will recover into the 2% to 3% range. So far in May, we've continued to see cautious buying
behavior from our guests but the pace of sale has supported our view of the quarter.

In the U.S. segment, we expect the second quarter gross margin rate will be up slightly from last year, driven entirely
by the change in recognition of vendor payments. We expect our second quarter SG&A expense rate will be just over
21%, nearly a four percentage point higher than last year's revised U.S. segment rate, driven primarily by a smaller
benefit in credit card income and the change in recognition of vendor payments. This will put our second quarter
EBITDA margin rate at about 10.5% and with expected leverage on D&A, an EBIT margin rate of 7.5%.
In Canada, second quarter sales will ramp up meaningfully from first quarter pace, yet start-up expenses will continue
to dominate the P&L. As a result, for the quarter, we anticipate expenses from our Canadian operations, including
interest expense measured outside the segment, will create $0.16 of dilution to our earnings per share. We continue to
expect Canadian dilution will come down further in the third quarter and by the fourth quarter we expect our Canadian
operations will be slightly accretive to our consolidated earnings. All together, we expect second quarter adjusted EPS
of $1.09 to $1.19. We expect our GAAP EPS will be $0.19 lower than adjusted EPS in the range of $0.90 to $1.00
reflecting $0.16 of dilution due to Canada and $0.03 of dilution related to the unwind of the beneficial interest asset
related to the receivables sale.
For the year, we have an even more tempered view of sales than we did three months ago. Without some unexpected
improvement in the economy and the consumer, our full year comparable store sales will likely grow in the 2% to 2.5%
range. Somewhat below the 2.7% we outlined at the beginning of the year. This updated view of sales has also
tempered our view of full year earnings per share, costing us to take our expected range for adjusted EPS down $0.15
to the $4.70 to $4.90 range. We expect full year GAAP EPS to be $0.58 lower than adjusted EPS in the $4.12 to $4.32
range, reflecting Canadian segment dilution, losses on early debt retirement and net gains from the credit card portfolio
sale.
Longer term, we continue to feel very good about the health of our business and the steps we are taking to keep our
business relevant over time. We continue to invest in our remodel program, loyalty initiatives, technology, the
integration of our store and digital experience, the new CityTarget format and our Canadian segment.
Yet, even with those initiatives, we continue to expect to generate far more cash than we need to invest in our business,
giving us the opportunity to return billions of dollars to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. As a
result, we continue to expect Target will deliver earnings per share of $8 or more by 2017, combined with the dividend
of $3 or more that same year.
That concludes today's prepared remarks. Now Gregg, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Benedict of Robert Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Great. Thanks, guys. Just a couple questions. Just on the U.S. gross margin performance, can
you give us a sense of maybe what that REDcard impact was in the quarter?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: The rate impact of the REDcard, Peter?
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Yeah, John.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, the combination of that with the store remodel program, very consist with what we've
seen over the past several quarters, somewhere between 25 to 30 basis points of impact.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a longer-term question, I mean you kind of said for the
year you're now thinking 2% to 2.5%. I assume that still has a pretty modest view for comping in the fourth quarter. A,
is that correct? And then secondly, just when you think out beyond, I mean do you guys think that maybe 2% to 3% is
the longer-term comp profile for the business? Or do you think it could still be north of 3%, just when you think of a

more normalized environment on an annual basis. Thanks.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, I think your view of Q4 is right. I think, in particular, this Q4 will be particularly
difficult given the 53rd week and the way the calendar shifts this year. You'll recall, we're going to lose six business
days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, which will make the comp feel much more difficult than it
otherwise might.
I think over the longer term, we continue to think a 3% comp is about the right place to be. If you look, again, at our
company over 15 years or 20 years, if you net out the contribution of new store annualization, we essentially ran pretty
consistently a 3% comp over time through good times and tougher times. So, we think in an economic environment that
might just be a little better than today, doesn't have to improve drastically, but a little better than today, we think a 3%
comp makes sense.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. That's helpful. And just one last housekeeping, on the Canadian D&A, what do you
think the run rate is for that, once you get out, you've opened a bunch of the stores. Once you get towards the end of the
year, what kind of run rates were you thinking about for Canadian D&A? Thank you.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: I think you'll continue to see D&A grow throughout this year, as we continue to put
significant assets into service. And we'll provide a little bit more color, I think, as we get later into the year and have a
little bit more clarity about sales, margin and the entire P&L, we'll provide a little bit more clarity about the entire P&L
for Canada.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line Sean Naughton of Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. In terms of just dissecting the comp in Q1, transaction
trends as you mentioned were relatively stable on a two-year basis and did improve from Q4. But the units per
transaction were down 60 basis points and I think that's the first time since 2009. Just wondering what would explain
that decline, given the increase in the remodel program from Q1 last year.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Actually, Sean, I'm not clear – quite clear on your question. Units per transaction in the first
quarter were up year-over-year. So help me with that, again.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Oh, I thought that was the – I thought they were down 60 basis points. Maybe I'm missing
something here.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: No. Selling price per unit was down 60 basis points.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: That was mix related.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Right. Entirely mix. But units were up consistently for some of the reasons you described.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. Got it. And then I guess, Gregg, you touched briefly on the price matching. Just
curious if you are seeing the number of requests for the price match change at all and has there been any competitive
response to that in the marketplace?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Both the stores, with the matching of competitors' physical ads and the online match has
been fairly stable and has not grown materially over the last quarter. So it still represents a very small portion of our
transaction. That's because our everyday price and our promotional prices are so strong. There's generally not much of
a gap, if any. So we continue to watch our competitive prices on a day-in and day-out basis and move where we have to
be competitive in the marketplace, and so we expect over time this not to change all that much.

<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay, great. And then just lastly on digital, you're obviously seeing some nice traction, nice
growth outside of the seasonal categories. Can you talk about just the impact on margin for that sale today? Is it dilutive
or is it accretive to the margin, and what do you think that can – how are you planning that over time?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, I think first, I'd start with how we think about this longer-term. And we think about
from a longer-term perspective sales through all of our channels regardless of the channel, need to generate a return. I
think – and a return on investment that's similar to what we see in our current U.S. store base. What we see today is
honestly we're learning a lot about that channel and a lot of this depends on how we're going to ultimately settle on a
supply chain that our guest wants to interact with us. How much is ship from store. How much is ship to store. That
will have a significant impact ultimately on the EBITDA margin rates of that particular channel. But I think once again,
depending on where those EBITDA margin rates land, sales or capital will move around and we feel very confident that
we'll get back to a return that makes sense. Having said all that, I think as it relates to the rates embedded within that
channel, we feel very comfortable that ultimately, we'll get back and operate at that 10% EBITDA rate that we've said
is part of our long-range plan.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks and best of luck in Q2.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matt Nemer>: Thanks for taking my questions. First, I'm wondering if you could comment on sales in
geographic areas that had more neutral weather like Florida; were the transactions and the comps positive in those
markets?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: We did see better results in areas that had more normal weather, so that would primarily be
the West Coast. And they were toughest in those seasonal categories where we saw weather off the most. And that
would be primarily in the Midwest. So, we did see quite a swing between the different geographies.
<Q - Matt Nemer>: And then in terms of the second quarter guidance, do we assume that there's some incremental
markdown risk in seasonal categories? You did mention that within categories the rate improvement would be a little
softer in the second quarter than the first quarter, so just wondering what the markdown risk is in seasonal categories.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Yeah, like we said, the teams did a very good job of responding to the sales shortfall and
retiming receipts and making cancellations. We're going to know a heck of a lot more in the next 30 days as we see
what happens and how the sales of these categories play out before we have to take markdowns in the 4th of July. And
if we get really good weather and we have good sell-through, then we're going to be right back on plan. If things stay
damp and cool for an extended period of time, there might be some risk, but we don't expect to see a significant risk
whatsoever. So we're talking about things on the edges right now.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, Matt, the other thing I'd add is – it's a little bit hard to see with the inventory on the
balance sheet. The inventory per store in the U.S. is essentially flat to last year. All of the inventory build
year-over-year is attributable to Canada. So we feel really good about where the inventory positions are in aggregate.
<Q - Matt Nemer>: That's very helpful. And then just lastly, if we look at your operating expenses in the U.S. retail
segment, growth – dollar growth accelerated a little bit versus last few quarters. Assuming a lot of that is technology
investments. But given the more moderated view of comps for the full year, could we see the dollar growth potentially
come back down a little bit?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, I think, you're right. First of all the vast majority of that is multi-channel technology
and we've said – a little bit of mis-timing here. We expect to offset that on the year with expense savings and
improvements we're making in our business, but the investment coming a little bit ahead of that. To your second point,
I think that's absolutely right and it's interesting, we said this last year when our sales accelerate or decelerate rapidly

from our expectations, we tend to see our SG&A lag in both directions. It doesn't climb as fast when sales go up like
last year, and it doesn't come down quite as quickly when we see sales decelerate. Ans as we adapt to wherever sales
are going to be, you'll see our SG&A settle in at a more appropriate level.
<Q - Matt Nemer>: Great. That's helpful. Good luck this quarter.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan of Bernstein.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Good morning. Thank you. First question on Canada, understand that the gross margin
rate of 38%'s not the long-run rate. But where do you think that settles out? And was the 38% above where you had
expected, even kind of adjusting for the mix that you saw?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Yeah, I would say out of the block 38% was a little higher than we had expected because
the mix was a little bit better than we expected out of the block. Now, whether it's in Canada or the U.S., clearly when
we open a new store, we get a higher gross margin rate. But the mix was even higher than the higher that we expected.
So we do expect that to settle down and be slightly higher than what it is in the U.S. because we expect the mix to be a
little bit better than it is here in the U.S.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Of course. And as the consumables business ramps up, mix is down. But from a
productivity perspective, can you tell anything yet on these first stores that are open in terms of opening expectations
relative to what you had thought? Or was it just too much hoopla that you can't discern anything yet?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Well, I wouldn't call it hoopla. I would just say that the guests were very, very excited
and we experienced tremendous surges in sales, and it's just very, very early to draw any conclusions. And we really
wanted to deliver a great experience and so, to a certain extent, we went in with staffing levels to make sure that we
were taking care of the guests at the front end. And we had the right team members there for the supply chain, and we
had the right teams on the sales floor.
So we know that over time and in our run state condition, we have to work hard at making sure that we get our
productivity levels where the business model dictates them to be. And we know our gross margins will settle in and
we've got to become more productive and run the business. Over time, our consumables share will grow because that's
the hardest trip to change with the guest. And so we're going to continue to focus on those frequency-oriented
categories so that we can not only get the good mix that we're getting, but we want to now start driving more trip
frequency into the store. And we didn't want to come out of the blocks by hitting those categories too hard because we
wanted to make sure that we led with our strength. And we wanted to make sure that all the supply chains and the
operational disciplines were in place. We feel very confident now that they are. So we're ready to start making those
kinds of adjustments in merchandising and supply chain and store operations to start refining the model.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Okay. That's helpful. By the way, hoopla is a technical term we use here on Wall
Street.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: We use that sometimes here, too.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Secondly, on the credit. I actually thought the contribution, $105 million, while you
said it was – you explained it was lower, it seemed to me it was higher than I would have expected, especially given the
bad debt reserve release last year. Is there anything there that reflects the $105 million profit share?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: I think the one thing I'd remind you is we only had half a quarter's worth of profit sharing
with TD. Next quarter, we'll have a full quarter's worth of profit sharing with TD.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: So the $105 million was really a $210 million quarterly run rate?

<A - John J. Mulligan>: No, no, no. Because – that's net of our operating expenses as well.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: All right. I'll follow-up offline with you on that, John.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: We can take that offline and walk through that in detail, Colin.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: And then finally, just coming back to SG&A. The dollars were up I think $233 million.
If I ex out the credit difference of $36 million, the vendor allowance of $13 million, the technology spend, it still looks
like the growth was pretty healthy. John, I know you mentioned that there's a lag just in terms of how quickly you can
get after that if sales are disappointing. Would you also expect some of the expense things you're doing on a
longer-term basis to impact that? And I guess my question is, can we see better performance out of that line because it
sounds like 2Q guidance doesn't get us there?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, no question. And what we're seeing, I think we talked about this a little bit three or
four or five weeks ago when we were together. You'll see the ramp-up in our expense initiatives throughout the year,
and through next year actually. Many of them are a little bit longer lead times to pull out expense. All the easy stuff
we've done a long, long time ago. So we do expect, through time, SG&A will come down and manage to a level that is
more appropriate.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul of Barclays.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: I guess the question that I have for you is a two-fold, but it revolves around traffic. When you
look at the initiatives that you have in place, REDcard and PFresh, and you consider – I understand the sort of the
seasonal piece Q1 this year versus last year. But when you think conceptually, traffic was down in the fourth quarter
and that was down again in the first quarter, how do you sort of get us comfortable with essentially the efficiency and
the effectiveness of these initiatives over the longer-term period? And the second question that I have is when you – the
lower comp assumption for this year, can you maybe just break down the traffic component in that new 2% to 2.5%
expectation?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: I'll take the first one. I think the traffic – this was a disappointing quarter for us. We had
very, very strong traffic last year. There was pluses and minuses throughout 2012 and we expect traffic trends to get
stronger as the year goes on. And we have all of our initiatives designed to not only deepen the relationship but build
frequency. So we'll perhaps be a little bit more aggressive on price. You have to look at the competitive environment. It
was a little bit more aggressive than it had been in the past where there was more emphasis on price and that I think
impacted it a little bit, but, overall, we really expect to be able to generate traffic levels that are flattish, give or take,
over normalized period of time.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, Bob, and the other thing I'd add, I don't think we need to run traffic numbers like we
did last year in first quarter to generate that 3% comp. I think if you look over the past several years, about a half a
point of traffic combined with ticket gets us to a 3% comp and that's about the formula that we feel really good about.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: The only other thing that I would add is this time of year, our seasonal categories can be a
big traffic driver for Target and clearly they weren't in the quarter. And they were last year. So all of the things you
mentioned, 5% PFresh help us all year long, but during key seasonal categories – key seasonal timeframes we need
those categories to drive traffic as well.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig of Citigroup.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Thank you so much and appreciate all the color. A lot of conversation regarding mobile
and digital traffic, can you also talk about what conversion was like during the quarter?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Yeah, conversion has been improving over the past year Deb and we were up slightly in this
quarter as well. So we're really pleased with the improvements that we've made on the site, but I'll tell you we still feel
we have a long way to go with conversion and we are very committed to continuing to work on our navigation and our
search function and basic functionality of our site to continue to make big improvements there.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: I think the other thing I'd add Deb, is we have a little bit of a mixed headwind which is
positive from our perspective. Mobile in general has a much lower conversion rate than the site. And our mobile is
growing much, much faster than the site. We think that's good because we think that's where things are going and it
also shows that she is spending a lot of time with us on the mobile applications we have. But conversion is just
naturally lower there and so it creates a little bit of a mix number as we look at the aggregate.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: So if you look at conversion on our site, it's up to last year. If you look at conversion on
mobile, it's up to last year. But because of the big growth in mobile, to John's point, conversion comes down slightly in
aggregate.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: All right and then maybe just a broader question. Can you just talk about how you're
positioning yourself in terms of taking advantage of the Affordable Care Act?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: I think we've said a couple of times, the Affordable Care Act, the changes for us will be
relatively – well they won't be relatively, they will not be material externally. We're still continuing to work through all
the regulations and what we will exactly do, but it won't be material changes to what we're doing today or financially
from a financial perspective.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Okay. And I think Gregg touched on segmentation and how you're looking to match
local taste and preferences. Where are you? I know there was a lot of work done in Canada, but where are you
domestically in terms of that?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: We feel good about where we are, I mean we've been working on this for a long time and
we continue to deploy resources to get better and better at that. So this is just a long-term initiative that we have to
continue to focus on whether it's in food; whether it's demographics; whether it is ethnic groups. We've just got to
continue to get better at our localization efforts and we think we've made progress there and we are going to continue to
focus on it.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: But was there anything that you learned from Canada that you could go back and apply
to the U.S. or was it exactly what you expected and you're just continuing on the path?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: I would just say, Deb, I think it's a little early to learn from Canada and bring that back to
the U.S. I will tell you though we learned a lot from CityTarget that we applied to Canada. So as you know those stores
are in dense urban areas and so are our Canada stores. So we took a lot of that learning and the testing that we did last
year and applied that to what we're doing in Canada. And throughout this year of course we'll be reading the Canada
results and bringing that back to the U.S. But the same teams work on localization for both countries.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Great. Thanks you so much and best of luck.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Thank you. We have time for one more question.

<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Good morning. Couple of questions; first on the top line, can you – in the home and apparel
categories can talk about the stack comps that you had in the first quarter and broadly how that has trended, those
categories have trended over time, past few quarters?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Well, when we look at the stack comps we feel a lot better about it, [ph] and (59:23) just
looking at this quarter, both were positive if we look on a stack basis. Going forward, our compare in second quarter is
not as nearly as difficult as our first quarter, so we would expect our comps to improve. And over time, we want that
two-year stack to improve. We're not happy with flat or up slightly. We want to make sure that we're making progress
there. But it was on a two-year basis, better.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: I think I just add a little color to that. I think apparel for instance, the two-year stack is around
a two. Running that consistently through time, we'd feel really good about running twos in apparel. And as Kathee said,
home is positive and that's a big improvement from where home has been over the past several years. So on a two-year
basis, we feel good about both those businesses.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: That's great. And then also – in thinking about the EPS pressure from Canada, can you talk
about how much of the expense in the first quarter, are one time in nature, pre-opens and so forth? And as you think
about the guide for the second quarter, a similar question, how much of that expense pressure is actually something that
goes away in future quarters?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, that's difficult to parse out. The example I would give you is exactly what Gregg said;
where we started with the stores staffed very heavily, we know through time we have to refine that model. Is that
one-time expense or operating expense? Certainly the expenses related to hiring team members early and training them
as the next cycle of stores will open up. That is all one-time and will drift away. What I'd tell you through time, we
expect ultimately, well down the road, to get to an SG&A rate that make sense and productivities that are very similar
to the U.S. So as I said before, as we get a little bit more clarity right now, expense dominates the P&L in Canada. And
as we get more clarity on sales, margin, operations later in the year we'll provide a lot more color about how we expect
those stores to operate.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: And then one final one. Just in terms of being in the stores, it seems like at times you're
actually too thin on inventory in some of the discretionary categories, whether that's home and apparel. What's the
internal discussion around balancing rate versus balancing sales? And do you think that you've leaned too far towards
the rate side? Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: This is something that we are always looking at and adjusting. But I guess I would tell you I
don't feel like we've gone too far. Our inventory as John mentioned, our average inventory per store is flat to last year.
It's actually up a bit in apparel given the softer sales in the first quarter. So we're always looking at that. We look as
much at out of stock as we do in stock and trying to improve those stores. So it's a constant focus for us and we can
always improve but I feel pretty good about where we are right now in terms of in stocks.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Thank you.
