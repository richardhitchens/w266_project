MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is
scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question and
answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the
conclusion of the questions from the investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice
President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli
Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our
2014 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we'll be
talking about results for the first quarter 2014 and comparing them to the same period in 2013, unless otherwise stated.
References to PMI volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are PMI estimates based on the
latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating
Companies Income, or OCI, is defined as operating income, excluding general corporate expenses, and the
amortization of intangibles, plus equity income or loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries net. OCI growth rates are on an
adjusted basis, which excludes asset impairment, exit and other costs. Data tables showing adjustments to net revenues
in OCI for currency, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per
share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are
posted on our website.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the
forward-looking cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my
pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek.

Jacek Olczak
Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Our business results in the first quarter are in line with the 2014
annual guidance that we shared with you in February. The quarter was impacted by a number of distortions that marked
a much better performance at the net revenue and OCI level. Our business fundamentals remain solid and we are
making progress in addressing the issues that we highlighted in February.
Today, we are increasing our reported diluted earnings per share guidance for 2014 at prevailing exchange rates, to a
range of $5.09 to $5.19, versus $5.26 in 2013. Our revised guidance includes $0.61 of unfavorable currency at
prevailing exchange rates, compared to the $0.71 previously disclosed, and the $0.03 restructuring charge related to the
closure of our manufacturing facility in Australia. We have taken $0.01 of this charge this quarter to cover the cost of
employee separation, and expect to subsequently incur an estimated $0.02 of additional anticipated restructuring
charges.
Our 2014 guidance represents a growth rate, excluding currency and this restructuring charge, of approximately 6% to
8%, compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.40 in 2013. During the first quarter, cigarette volume
declined by 4.4%, driven primarily by total industry volume contraction and unfavorable inventory movements. We
estimate that, absent these inventory distortions, our underlying volume was down by around 2%.
Net revenues and adjusted OCI, both excluding currency, declined by 1.6% and 3.1% respectively. The lower revenues
and OCI were attributable to Japan and the Philippines, both of which were also impacted by timing distortions. Net
revenues and OCI, excluding these unfavorable distortions, as well as the impact of the change to PMI's new business
structure in Egypt, were essentially stable. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 4.7%, excluding currency.
Pricing was the key driver of our solid performance and a key reason why profits were impacted by a difficult
year-on-year comparison. Our pricing volumes reached $406 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $531
million during the same period last year, when we benefited from favorable pricing related to inventory movements in a
number of markets and, in particular, in the Philippines, following the very large January 2013 excise tax increase.
Since December of last year, we have taken price increases in a wide range of markets, including Argentina, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Egypt, France, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Turkey and the UK. We recently announced
to the trade in Germany that we will take a €0.20 per pack price increase in June, essentially, across our entire cigarette
portfolio.
Let me now turn to an update on the key regions and markets. In the EU region, we witnessed a 5.6% decline in
cigarette industry volume, in line with the decrease that occurred during the second half of last year. This confirms a
moderation in the unfavorable trend, despite persistently high unemployment levels. We attribute these moderations to
an apparent overall stabilization in illicit trade during 2013, a significant slowdown in the growth of e-vapor products
in many markets, and the reduced down-trading to fine cut products. However, we should remember that the
comparisons with 2013 are easier in the first half of this year. Consequently, we still forecast that cigarette industry
volume may decline within a range of 6% to 7% for the full year 2014, though we expect it to be closer to 6% than 7%.
We continue to outperform the industry in the EU region. Our regional market share increased by 0.9 points in the first
quarter to 38.9%. We achieved share growth in five out of the six largest markets in the region and expect our
momentum to continue throughout the year. Our strong share performance is driven by the strength of our key
international brands. Marlboro gained 0.4 points to reach a 19.1% regional share, despite continued weak consumer
purchasing power. L&M grew by 0.3 share points to 6.9%. And Chesterfield performed particularly well, gaining 0.6
points in the quarter to reach a regional share of 4.9%.
In the first quarter, cigarette industry volume in Italy remained very resilient with a decline of just 0.5%. This is
attributable to a significant decline in the sales of e-vapor products, a stabilization of illicit trade, and lower fine-cut
volumes. The key issue in Italy is the ineffective excise tax structure. The country has the lowest specific-to-total excise
tax ratios in the EU at 7.5%. This has encouraged competitors to introduce or reposition brand to the super-low €4 per
pack price segment, and has resulted in an increase in the price gap to premium brands to €1 per pack, which is a much
wider gap than in markets such as France and Germany. Consequently, the super-low segment grew from 0.5% in the

first quarter of last year to 11.9% this year, driven primarily by down trading from the low and the mid-price segments,
as well as an in switching from e-vapor products.
We successfully entered the super-low segment this year by repositioning Chesterfield, which has already grown by 1.5
points to reach the level of 5.1% in the first quarter, while Marlboro's share remained resilient at 25.6%. In 2013, the
state incurred a decrease in excise tax revenues for the first time in over a decade, and the decline accelerated in the
first quarter. We therefore hope that the government will soon address the issue of excise tax reform.
Let me now move to the Asia region. As foreseen, the Japanese government increased the consumption tax from 5% to
8% on April 1. The resulting pass-on at retail was about 14 yen per pack. We received approval to increase our average
retail prices only in line with the tax increase. As previously mentioned, we expect a slight acceleration in the rate of
decline in cigarette industry volume from the last year's level of 2% to between 3% and 3.5% due to the impact of the
consumption tax-driven price increases on the overall economy.
During the first quarter of this year, however, cigarette industry volume increased by 9.6% in Japan, driven by trade
and consumer purchases ahead of the April tax-driven price increases. Our volume during this period was 9.1% lower,
principally due to the adverse timing of PMI shipments and the lower market share. Our reported market share declined
by two points to 25.5% during the first quarter. However, this partly reflected the greater degree of trade inventory
buildup by competition which distorted market shares. Our estimated share of 25.9% on an adjusted basis was in line
with our 2013 fourth quarter share.
During the quarter, we rolled out the Be Marlboro marketing campaign that has been an integral part of the brand
success in European and other markets. The initial feedback has been very positive. We believe that this campaign,
along with the Marlboro's resilience and our future new product initiative, should enable us to stabilize our share and
eventually generate sequential gains.
Let me now move to the Philippines, where tax paid cigarette industry volume increased by 25.9% during the first
quarter. This was mainly due to a lower buildup of inventories by the trade at the end of 2013 compared to the same
period in 2012, due to a more moderate excise tax increases in January 2014. There are strong indications that Mighty
Corporation continues to declare about half of its production volume for tax purposes. The company's coming under
increasing scrutiny from the Bureau of Internal Revenue. We hope that the introduction of tax stamps in June will
further reinforce these efforts.
While the price of the Mighty brand has gone up at retail from MEX$1 to MEX$1.50 per stick, Marvels still retails at
MEX$1.25 per stick and currently wholesales at the price that does not cover the full taxes due. We have responded
with Jackpot at the same stick price as Marvels and Champion matching Mighty, while maintaining the price of
Fortune slightly below MEX$2 per stick. We were able to reach a share of the super-low price segment of over 50% in
the first quarter. Our overall market share of 83.7% was higher than both our 2013 full year and fourth quarter shares,
but lower than our share in the first quarter of 2013. Importantly, the total share of the super low price segment has
been declining recently. Going forward, the price increases that have occurred at the bottom of the market and our
marketing efforts behind Marvel and Fortune should enable us to further improve our market share and product mix
trends.
In Indonesia during the first quarter of the year, cigarette industry volume declined by 1% and there was an acceleration
of certain segment trends. The industry volume decline was driven by a sharp contraction of the low-price segment,
which was down by 12.7%. This was attributable to the impact of Decree 131, the legislation that eliminated the
preferential excise tax for so-called sister companies of large manufacturers, which resulted in significantly higher
prices for a wide range of brands at the low end of the market. In addition, the reduction in fuel subsidies last year and
food inflation significantly impacted low income adult smokers. In the quarter, this particularly benefited the mid-price
segment where we have a strong position with U Mild, which gained 1.1 points to reach a share of 5.2%. Although
inflation has increased and the overall economy situation has somewhat softened, GDP growth remains over 5%. This
together with the positive demographic trends and the overall stable political environment leads us to forecast total
market growth of up to 1% in Indonesia for the full year.

During the first quarter, our market share Indonesia declined by 1.6 share points to 34.6%, reflecting unfavorable price
points and the impact of segment trends. There was an acceleration in the decline in the hand-rolled, or SKT segment,
which incurred a volume erosion of 16.1% in the quarter. The decline was particularly evident at the premium price end
of the segment, and this unfavorably impacted the volume and overall share of our Dji Sam Soe brand. While we have
lost segment share in SKT due to an unfavorable price point for Dji Sam Soe and the widening in the brand's price gap
with competitive brands, PMI's performing well in the other taste segments. We will be investing more heavily this
year to further boost the equity of brands such as machine-made Sampoerna A, Dji Sam Soe Magnum. We therefore
expected an improved market share performance during the second half of the year.
I will now turn to Russia, where profit growth remains strong despite the impact of large tax-driven price increases.
Cigarette industry volume declined by an estimated 6.7% in the first quarter to 66.9 billion units, so our announced
price increases of RUB6 to RUB9 per pack only started to impact adult smokers as of February 2014. For the full year,
we are forecasting an industry volume decline of between 9% and 11%, mainly reflecting the impact of higher prices
and a foreseen increase in illicit trade; this despite the growing efforts of the authorities to stamp out counterfeit
production and stop the import of contraband and illicit whites. Our brand's performance in the first quarter was strong.
Our market share of 26.7% for the end of February was up by 0.5 points versus a year earlier, and up by 0.4 points
compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Our segment share was higher in the premium and low-price segments, notably
behind the success of Parliament and Bond Street. Our profits in the quarter grew at a double digit rate excluding
currency, and this is before the contribution of our 20% shareholding in Megapolis, an investment that is bringing about
gradual improvements in our market penetration, as well as providing an attractive financial return. We remain
optimistic about the prospects of our business this year and beyond in Russia.
Looking at our top 30 OCI markets worldwide, our share in the first quarter of 2014 declined by 0.2 points, to 36.5%,
driven notably by a lower share in Indonesia and Japan, but largely offset by a strong performance in the EU region.
Marlboro has been a key driver of our good share performance. During the first quarter, Marlboro progressed to reach
an international share of 9.2%. It gained share in three out of our four regions with a particularly strong performance in
the EU region. Sharp decline in the Latin America and Canada regions reflects customer down trading and distorted
shipment patterns in Mexico, while the brands performed well in other markets in the region.
We continue to be focused on cost and productivity to further drive the expansion of our profits. We have an annual
cost saving and productivity target of $300 million this year. We have implemented a number of initiatives across our
supply chain to achieve this objective. We are also continuing to optimize our global footprint and announced the
closure at the end of this year of our manufacturing facility in Melbourne, Australia. Production will be consolidated in
our factory in South Korea. We have entered into consultations with employee representatives in the Netherlands on a
proposal to discontinue cigarette production at our Bergen op Zoom facility. The proposal is subject to consultations
with the Dutch Works Council and approval by the Philip Morris Holland Supervisory Board. Consultation with the
European Works Council is also required. Subject to the final outcome of the consultation and fulfillment of certain
other conditions, we would anticipate to implement the contemplated decision by October, 2014. We remain committed
to generously rewarding our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our target
dividend payout ratio remains an attractive 65%, and our dividend yield last Friday was 4.5%. During the first quarter,
we spent $1.2 billion to repurchase 15.4 million shares at an average price of $81.12, and are targeting to spend $4
billion during the full year.
In conclusion, our guidance reflects a full year growth rate of approximately 6% to 8% in an adjusted diluted earnings
per share, excluding currency and the restructuring charge. Our overall business is in good shape, though the
unfavorable volume mix remains a key challenge due to cigarette industry volume trends. Our performance in the EU
region is improving with our leading brands all gaining market share. Furthermore, trends in the first quarter confirm
the slight moderation in cigarette industry volume decline. We are starting to see signs of a stabilization in our
underlying share performance in Japan and the Philippines. The accelerated decline of the hand-rolled segment and
unfavorable price points in Indonesia have impacted our overall market share, but we are performing well in the
machine-made segment. We are growing share and profits in Russia and our business across the EEMA region is
performing well. Our pricing remains the key driver of our performance. This is being complemented by cost savings
and productivity progress.

Finally, we are ramping up our organization ahead of our exciting city tests later this year and our first national
commercial launch in 2015 of Reduce-Risk Products. This is the term we use to refer to products that have the potential
to reduce individual risk and population harm. We will complete our eight clinical trials this year and are continuing
our perception and behavioral studies. We are preparing the packaging and the labeling of the products, and as
previously stated, the increased investments this year will be around $100 million. Finally, we are moving forward with
the constructions of a 30-billion unit HeatStick tobacco stick factory in Bologna, Italy, which will be completed by
2016. Thank you and I will be now happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Our
first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Jacek, just on Japan, I'm trying to reconcile the 9% decline in your shipments in the second
quarter, and the inventory movement that we saw, the market share losses. So, can you just bridge that 9% decline for
Japan in the quarter? And then, as you think about then the upcoming quarter, do we then see some of that benefit, so
you actually would see a positive shipments in Japan as you go through the inventory movement the other way?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we have two things for Japan. One is, as we said, our in-market sales actually for the
quarter was about 300 million units higher than the first quarter of last year. This was still a little bit lower participation
in the trade purchases ahead of the price increases than our principle competitors and our share came a little bit lower
on the reported basis, and on a restated adjusted basis, we think it was flat versus Q4 last year. Our shipments, and this
is how we recognize the revenue on the market, essentially, the purchases by our distributors to Japan. So this is one
step lower than the in-market sales, and the shipments to the distributor were lower by about 1.3 billion units. And this
is where the distortions which we had for Japan. When it comes to the next quarters, although we see the market to go
down for the full year in the range of a 3% to 3.5%, the question is, how much trade we'll need to de-stock or unwind
the higher purchases, which have happened at the end of the last quarter. I don't think we should have a debt magnitude
of the inventory adjustment, and also, obviously there was a function of how our share is going to develop going
forward. So far, we see the first two quarters sequentially, when our share comes flat. If that obviously would remain
for the remaining part of the years, we would have a much less of the distortions on the shipment.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And just on that note, so the underlying market share performance, Jacek, you sound like
you're seeing a little bit of stabilization there and may be cautiously optimistic that things will improve as the year
progresses. Can you just give us some color, just in terms of what's driving that confidence at this point?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we're encouraged that, as I said, on an adjusted basis, the share came flat versus Q4. So is
the first sequential quarters, which we have over the last – good few quarters when we have not lost share. The
Marlboro came relatively strong. Lark continues to be under pressure. There's a program in place to address the Lark
performance. And I think, also, the "Be Marlboro" campaign, which we started to roll out in Japan in Q1 of this year
get the very positive response at the consumer level. The number of parameters of brand attributes which the campaign
has helped us to address in the other regions, mainly in the European region, we start seeing the same sort of impact in
Japan, particularly when the campaign is rolled out, but this is even more encouraging. So let's stay cautiously
optimistic for the year. But it is still the long way for us to fully stabilize and to return to growth in the Japanese
market.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then secondly just on Indonesia, just the market share movement there. You called
out unfavorable price points. Can you just talk about what drove that unfavorable price points? And then how are you

addressing that issue? And how would you characterize your performance in Indonesia in the context of some of the
other markets, like Japan or Philippines, where obviously you've had some market share challenges? Is this a little bit
more one-off situation, or what do you think about the market share performance in Indonesia, and how you think
about that going forward?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I think there were the two factors which, first of all, impacted the total industry, impacting
the industry performance. One is, some sort of pressure coming still from the last year media removal partially of the
fuel subsidies. There's some pressure on the inflation. So this has an impact on the total market, especially on the lower
price points. This is where the consumers presumably are most impacted by the pressure on the – from the disposable
income.
Second thing is the market had the underlying trend of the consumers switching from the hand-rolled cigarettes to
machine made cigarettes. Obviously, we're present in those segments, but our main brand, Dji Sam Soe, is the
handmade kretek cigarette. That brand sits at a premium price point of the segment. Actually is one of the most
expensive brands in the market. The brands that we started to sell after the price increases last year, as about middle of
last year, the brand price per pack was about Rp12,000 for the pack of 12. So we crossed at the retail level the stick
price of the Rp1,000. Other main competitors are behind us in terms of the price gap, so I think it's going to take some
time until they will cross – the market will cross the price points with another brand. I would expect some moderations
in the share pressure in Indonesia in the second half of the year, and we just have to be, I think, patient. We also
addressing this consumer taste preferences, going from the handmade cigarettes to machine made, by a line extending
Dji Sam Soe. So we have one very well performing variant and we're coming with the second variant, Dji Sam Soe
Magnum, which is a filter kretek machine-made kretek cigarette. So overall I think we can get to the decent share
performance, but we have to wait a little.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay; great. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, David.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: First, a broader question, Jacek. So this quarter, local currency, OCI was down 3%, EPS
was up 5%. How do you envision the balance of the year unfolding? Clearly, the results need to be better than this to
hit the full-year target.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: The OCI on an ex-currency basis for the full year should obviously have the positive growth,
right?
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Right.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Otherwise, it would be difficult to get to the 6% to 8% on the EPS level or ex-currency [ph]
outlook. (29:38)
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: [indiscernible] (29:40) you need to look into this think that these distortions which we had on a
shipment basis this year. I'm sorry, in the first quarter. They put the pressure on the overall OCI growth. But as I said in
my remarks, if I would exclude the distortions which we had in the first quarter, my revenues and OCI would be
flattish, at least flattish for the quarter on ex-currency basis.

<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. And then second, Jacek, what are you seeing in the market in Russia now that the
price increases are starting to come through at retail?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: It's very still early because the prices have started to appear at the retail level around second half
of February. I think, as in the past, we were at the beginning of the price changes in Philip Morris. The competition, I
can see that they following. There is one competitor which is slow, but they usually were slow. So I think we need still
a few weeks to see the full impact on the market.
The market was less than a 7%, 6.7% at least down for the quarter. We still hold the forecast for the full year for the
full market to be in a decline rate of 9% to 11%. One thing which we have to watch, that the current situation with the
ruble having some pressure, GDP growth forecast for Russia is coming a little bit lower than the previous forecast. The
whole situation around that region is a little bit – not extremely helpful, but we just have to see how this going to unfold
during the year. But, as our forecast for the market is at the 9% to 11% decline, we don't see actually that we should
revise anything else in our estimate for this year at this stage.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Morning, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: I just have – my first question a quick follow-on on Japan. Given the expected price
increases in the market, how much do you think this will increase the total profit pool? And then do you envision
capturing I guess more than your fair share over the next few years?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I can talk about this year. As you know, we have ended up and what I see generally the
industry has ended up with the price increase, which essentially just passed on the [indiscernible] (32:24) increase. So I
don't see much of the profit pool enhancement in the market. If you deduct the estimated market decline for the year,
actually coming slightly negative rather than a positive. That's for this year. And I think talking about outer year would
be a pure speculation because we also need to see what the decision of the government with regards to the planned
second step of the sales package increase from 8% to 10%.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. That's fair. And then my second question is on Marlboro; and the volume
performance was relatively weak during the quarter. So I guess in light of this, could you talk a little bit about Marlboro
2.0, the next generation brand, and how this might reaccelerate growth for total Marlboro? And then possibly which
markets Marlboro has the most opportunity or upside this year?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we essentially post the test market in three locations for the Marlboro 2.0 architecture. The
old test, all three locations reported very encouraging results. I mean, the perception on the Marlboro Red really start
changing. This is what the brand needed. We think this is the right thing to do to reinvigorate Marlboro Red and
somehow replicate the, I think, a tremendous success which we have achieved with the Marlboro Gold a few years ago
when we launched Marlboro Gold. So I think it's overall been moving the right directions. We will be rolling these out
sequentially in a number of markets. To actually give you a one – single out one or group of markets where Marlboro
has the best of the potential? You know, if I am looking at the last couple of years Marlboro performance, frankly
speaking, Marlboro has the potential in every geography. And I think the Marlboro performance in the EU against all
of this negative macroeconomic trend is just confirming that the brand can surf the very stormy waters, regardless of
the situation. The brand is and I think it's going to be in better shape than it used to be in the past. I will not volunteer to
single one market when a Marlboro would benefit. Obviously, we can talk about Russia, but Marlboro Russia is more
than just the Marlboro architecture. It's a product propositions and a couple of other factors.

<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay, that's helpful. And then my final question is on your dividend. Given your negative
EPS growth this year, due primarily of course to the currency headwind, could you share with us how you're thinking
about your dividend and then how comfortable or willing you are to let your payout ratio be above your target 65%?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we're currently above the current ratio, the target payout ratio. Listen, the dividend as you
know is the decision of our board. So I think we need to be patient and await until the September board and then see
what decisions the board will make. What I can say at this stage is that I think we have, in every single year since we've
become independent, we've been rewarding shareholders irregardless of the, you know, some headwinds which we had
on our reported results and I can't say anything more at this stage. But I think we have a track record of generously
rewarding shareholders.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. I just had two questions for you. I wanted to ask a little bit more detail on the EU. I
just noticed – and I don't recall seeing this of late – but the Marlboro brand was down in quarter, but you had growth in
L&M, Chesterfield, and Philip Morris brand, more mid-tier type brands. Was there any change in the mix if you will,
the product mix in that market? Anything that worried you about any kind of trading down in some markets?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. I think L&M continues to perform well in all markets. Actually our total share and the
Marlboro share was pretty strong in many markets. You have – and I think Marlboro actually for the quarter went up by
four-tenths of a point if I am not mistaken, in the segment, in the EU segment. Chesterfield's got a bit of acceleration. I
think Italy has contributed to that. We had some situation in Italy when the former Euro price segment has doubled up
towards the end of the last year. I have said it in my other remarks the tax system in Italy is pretty inefficient. Actually,
I would characterize it as one of the most inefficient systems within the European Union region. We have entered that
segment by repositioning Chesterfield. The brand picked up very nicely, so I think it also contributed to the overall
performance of Chesterfield. And I think another large market, volume wise when the Chesterfield picked up very
nicely, I think recently was Poland. So I don't think it's much of the mix or brands, irregardless of the price segment's
positioning of delivering a very strong share growth.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, thank you. And I just had a follow-up question for you on the Philippines as
well. I guess to be clear, there was another tax increase at the start of the year, so it seemed like across at least some of
your volume you're absorbing that today. Have you taken pricing maybe on Marlboro but not on Fortune or Jackpot or
one of the lower price brands?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, we have said that we need to restore the competitiveness and put our grip on all key price
points in the market, and this entailed that we had to absorb it at the top. [indiscernible] (38:26) Marlboro continues
selling at the equivalent of the MEX$3 per stick. Fortune we're now trading I think at the retail at slightly below the
two, and we have much the key brands of Mighty and our key competitor there with the Marlboros and as always the
Jackpot and Champion. And I think this is very much behind our market share performance, but it's the part of our
strategy. And we have made it very clear I believe as of November or so last year that we need to regain our
competitiveness in the market, and this is one of the key elements of restoring the sort of level playing field also in this
market.

<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: So I had a related question to that, which is you're chasing some of this really low-end
volume, very unprofitable and maybe not at all profitable volume. Is there a view that you could then trade that
consumer up in the future or that you'll benefit if you hold onto that share as prices go higher? Is that the view point, or
is it better to manage for profitability given your already high share?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: That's exactly the plan.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, gotcha. Thanks so much for your time.

Our next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of UBS.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Hi. Good morning, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Morning.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Couple of questions. First of all on the underlying volume growth down 2%, which
inventory distortions are you including? Because it seemed to me that the Philippines was probably the largest swing. Is
that not included in that sort of underlying 2% down?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, I think the major was down from the Japan and you'll have some movements across a
number of the markets. I think there was Russia slightly contributing end of things. Yeah, this would be the main one.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: So it doesn't include the impact of the Philippines, which was a sort of positive sort of
move?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: No. Okay. And the big question on pricing. You mentioned obviously the inventory
movements added a lot to pricing in the first quarter of 2013 and that's not going to recur. So could we assume
therefore that pricing for 2014 in general, the overall mix, the variance, is likely to prove to be less than 2013?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I think with the very high pricing variant last year to some extent is driven also by the
one-off in Bolivia and the Philippines, right? So that thing will not repeat if you like this year. But by comparing
apples-to-apples, frankly speaking, the pricing variance this year, we don't see why this shouldn't be in line with our
historical average sort of annual pricing volumes.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Right. Okay. And usually you sort of make some comment about how much of the
pricing you've already got through in terms of the market. Is that something you're prepared to comment on at the
moment, or...?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we have now made an advancement versus what we have announced in February. So we're
approaching much higher number, and, frankly speaking, we have a more advancement in terms of announced and
realized pricing than we had in February.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: And very quickly lastly. Is there any signs that the Italian government is actually moving
on the tax system?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I think the decline in the governmental tax revenue in the last year and a continuing for Q1
is something which I believe makes the government looking more closely at what had led to that situation. As I said,
the system is inefficient. It's a very heavily – most heavily in the European Union scaled towards ad valorem
component and many other markets. Also during the crisis, if you look at Spain to some extent, not fully, but France, I
mean, they're typical higher ad valorem markets. They have recognized the weakness of the structure and the system
and they have moved ahead. Italy, you know, Italian government is closely looking and they will reach the same
conclusion. The more specific component is actually better system also from the governmental revenue's perspective.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Back to Indonesia, I just wanted to try to see if I could clarify a little better or
understand it better. My understanding is that Djarum Super and Gudang Garam International have also hit those same
price points. I think it was late in the quarter, so obviously it wouldn't have had much impact in these numbers. But just
in terms of outlook for the rest of the year, is the issue that there's a segment shift away from their brands and Dji Sam
Soe because of the higher price point? Or is it that those two were gaining from you and that you should be able to get
some of that back? Or how does that work?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I think the price points is one of the key elements to play there. As I said, Dji Sam Soe
now, and most of the packs sold in the market, the Rp13,000 per pack of 12. So they're clearly well above the Rp1 price
point that retailers will try to even round up that price to Rp1,500 if not more. While the Djarum and the GG, I think if I
am not mistaking, the key brands competing with Dji Sam Soe now still have sound volumes below Rp12,000. And I
would think about half of the volumes, maybe slightly more than half of the volumes, at the Rp12,000 per pack. So
they're just now hitting the round price point. [ph] I think the issue (44:31) is the market when you have a pretty
frequent sort a price increases. So I think it's just a matter of time when the pressure on the Dji Sam Soe is going
forward. This is from a price point perspective.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: So just to make sure I understand that, you're saying some of the competitive pricing is
scattered, like, within the country so that some markets, probably the bigger cities, have the higher price points but for
the competitive brands, but it's not everywhere?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well you're going to have – I think it is due to the size and the structure of the trade of the
country. You don't have the price increases which would keep the retail consumers in one given point in time. So you
announce the prices, you introduce the prices per [ph] tray (45:16) and you might have in a given point, in any given
point, a co-existence of the prices two or three different price points per pack.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Gotcha, okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: [indiscernible] (45:26) as part of the rolling price increases, you rather work for the average price
in the market, at the retail level in order to assess the competitors. Now one thing to add may be that historically the
Djarum brand and the GG brand, they were always trading, or retailing, below Dji Sam Soe, right? So there is maybe
some element of the price cap, but it is more the element of the round price point of the Rp12,000 per pack and
Rp1,000 per stick.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Well and so in terms of the – I guess it's almost two months now since they've
announced those prices, and to your point, it may not have flowed through very widely. But have you seen any
improvement in your trends on Dji Sam Soe just sort of into April so far?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we have been announcing the prices as well. So, this is like sort of a moving curve
situation, if you like, right?
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Right, okay.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: The market in a given one moment, in a given moment will cross the round price point. We had
the same situation with Dji Sam Soe, when the Dji Sam Soe was crossing the Rp500 per stick. So it's not that we have
not up-sell with Dji Sam Soe, that the brand was nicely growing; were the first one to cross the round price point, at
that time, as I said Rp500 per stick. And we'll get that little bit of a share pressure and then we'll recover. So let's see
how this going to play this time.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: And can you give any sense of what you expect for the second half or any part of the
rest of the year, just in terms of what your share position might look like? Given just that obviously it came down, but it
was also down versus 4Q, do you expect it to stabilize, or do you think it might get worse before it picks up again?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I think that we should be expect some [ph] length (47:22) of the share pressure moderation
or flattening of the share actually towards the second half, or in the second half of this year. Philip Morris in Indonesia
had a little bit of pressure on the share if you look at the Q3/Q4 last year. Okay? So we tended to grow at the much
faster rate until about the middle of the last year. Then, okay, Dji Sam Soe again crossed this Rp12,000 price point. We
start observing the pressure. I think we need to just let this period somehow lapse.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then, in Japan, you mentioned you have some
programs in place, or starting, I guess, to become in place on Lark. Can you give a little color on what those are?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think we will have to stay a little bit of patient until everything is revealed in the market. Where
we talk about the future programs, I can't actually tell you much more in detail than what is in the market that they
announced. But, obviously, there is the things which drives, the datament which drives the market and innovation,
modernization of the product perception, et cetera, and it is something which is in the toolbox.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay; thanks. And then just lastly, I know you mentioned the next generation products.
Is there any other details you can give us on those?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Not at this stage. I think that the last week of June, the investor's day, which we'll have here for
the investors' community, is the great opportunity for us to disclose more details, how and when we're going to go into
the test market. But we're very excited about it.

Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Morning, guys.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: And a couple of questions, if I may. Firstly, I was just wondering if you could give some
more details on what could be perceived as weaker pricing in EU. What is driving this? Is it the mix in Italy, and is this
likely to continue into the rest of the year? Secondly, could you please give some more color on the business building
initiatives in Brazil, and what these entail exactly, and also how your share development is looking in Brazil? Thanks.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay. I think behind the pricing in EU – it is actually Italy, right? Because Italy is lacking some
prices. I have said this earlier that Italy has this significantly inefficient tax system. It was somehow compounded by
the fact that they've increased the VET. There was no offset on ad valorem rate. So that puts the pressure on the pricing
in the region. As I said, let's remain hopeful that the government sees what is a driver of the entire – their revenues also
collection performance, and how this going to be addressed.
Meanwhile, we concentrated on holding a strong market share. Our share, essentially, came flat. Marlboro came flat.
This is despite the fact that we've seen some down trading between a medium and a low segment to this full euro price

segment. Chesterfield now is the significant player, or key player, actually, in the full euro price segment. I think we
have some grip in the market. But that's essentially what is behind the pricing in EU, which I think I said that we have
recently announced a price increase in Germany of a €0.20 per pack. So I think this should also change the bigger
pictures going forward.
And when it comes to Brazil, I believe you asked the question. I think the market in Brazil for the quarter, if I
remember, was about 2.6% down. I think the market was about 17.3 billion, and our market shares nicely grew to about
15.7%. So I think it was like 1.4 points, about 1.4 points for the quarter was our share.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Okay, and just on the business building initiatives. I'm just wondering what that is exactly?
Is that significant, or...?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We're very much strong and focused in the south of Brazil, and we have a plan of enlarging our
presence there, and we're going from the south slowly to the north of Brazil. And this was also where the attractive
volumes are. So step by step, I think we're making a very good progress in Brazil as we did for the last couple of years.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Felberbaum, of The Associated Press.
<Q - Michael Felberbaum>: Hello, Jacek. I had a question on – you had mentioned in the commentary for France, the
growth of e-vapor products and their impact on combustible volumes. And I wondered if you could provide any color
on any overall trends you're seeing as far as the impact on volumes and the growth of e-vapor products.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes. In terms of the color, I believe in the beginning of last year, we observed – 2013, we
observed that sort of a phenomena in Italy and not even four quarters later, the products actually, or the attractiveness
of this product is fading out and there's no volume, no impact on the market. Based on my knowledge of that category,
I don't see why France shouldn't play the same way. We know the negatives and the like of e-cigarettes in terms of the
satisfaction, meeting the consumers' expectations, et cetera. So we now see this in France. As I said, I saw it last year in
Italy. I saw it some time ago in Germany. I saw it some time ago in Greece. I can start mentioning the markets and,
essentially, the trend is very much being repeated across the country. So it goes through the rapid sort of growth. It
confirms that there is an interest and I think for a good reason. We want consumers to look into this alternative, but the
product as it is today in the market is not delivering on the consumer expectations.
