Now, I'd like to turn it over to Don.
Donald Thompson
Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As we embark on a new year, our System's focused on leveraging our
competitive advantages to deliver great tasting and high quality food and beverages at the speed and at the convenience
that only McDonald's can provide. We have high expectations for ourselves and we have high expectations for our
brand. And we will not waver in our commitment to delivering an exceptional experience for the 70 million customers
who visit us every day.
Given the challenging year that we had in 2013, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to adapting to keep pace
with changing markets. We remain committed to investing to meet future demand and we remain committed to
addressing performance opportunities in the current environment. As we shared at the November investor meeting, our
primary focus is on resetting and strengthening the relationship that we have with our customers. They're the driving
force behind our mission and we continue to place them front and center in all that we do. We continue to execute
against our three global growth priorities: to optimize our menu; modernize the customer experience; and to broaden
accessibility, because these are the areas where we have the most significant opportunities to differentiate ourselves.
Our near-term opportunities revolve around optimizing current initiatives for greater customer relevance, broader
consumer reach and better restaurant execution. In addition, we prioritized our near-term efforts on improvements in
key opportunity markets. These include: Germany and Japan, which are experiencing sustained negative trends; and the
U.S. and Australia, which are significant contributors to consolidated performance. Specifically, the leadership teams in
these markets are developing more locally-relevant solutions, based on stronger consumer insights and more recent
market learnings. This will help us to make the appropriate adjustments to regain momentum, as we more clearly align
with our customers' needs.
Now, let's turn to 2013 global results. In constant currencies, operating income was up 1% for the quarter and 3% for
the year. Earnings per share growth increased 2% for the quarter and was up 4% for the full year in constant currencies.
For the full year, global System-wide sales grew 3% in constant currencies, and global comparable sales were up 20
basis points. Comparable sales were down 10 basis points for the quarter. Guest traffic was down across major
segments, reflecting initiatives that didn't resonate as strongly with consumers amid a sluggish IEO industry.
2013 was a difficult year and we're keenly aware of our short-term challenges. Future economic predictions are mixed,
but most assume some limited global improvement in 2014. However, we don't expect significant changes in market
dynamics, given modest growth projections for the IEO industry. Looking to January, global comparable sales are
expected to be relatively flat.
Now, let's shift to the markets. U.S. comparable sales decreased 140 basis points for the fourth quarter and 20 basis
points for the entire year. Operating income was up 1% for both periods. Our U.S. 2013 results fell short of our
expectations. We introduced a number of significant new products and limited-time offers at a quick pace that
challenged more effective restaurant and marketing execution. Our 2014 menu and marketing strategies better balance
affordability with core products, new choices and limited-time offers.
For example, the recent evolution to Dollar Menu & More is intended to drive customer visits, by offering greater value
and variety, while improving restaurant profitability. And to-date, results are in line with initial expectations. We've
also adjusted the sequencing of product introductions, making it easier for restaurant teams to execute, especially when
it comes to training and staffing. So customers can truly enjoy an even better experience.
Now, these adjustments are complemented by a consistent focus on core equities, like breakfast, where unique
competitive advantage exists for McDonald's. We're enhancing the breakfast experience by creating more of a coffee
culture through high quality McCafé products that pair very well with delicious foods, both existing and new. An
additional change that's underway hones in on our brand strategies as we work to better resonate with our customers.

In concert with other changes that we've made in the Marketing organization, yesterday, we announced that Deborah
Wahl will be joining our U.S. business as Chief Marketing Officer. We look forward to the fresh perspective that
Deborah will bring as she leads the team, as we refine our marketing strategies and our execution plans.
Now, let's move to Europe, where comparable sales were up 1% for the quarter and flat for the year. In constant
currencies, operating income was flat for the quarter and up 4% for the year. Despite persistently low consumer
confidence across the zone, the U.K., Russia and France generated positive comparable sales for the quarter, partially
offset by negative comparable sales in Germany and Southern Europe. The U.K. and Russia continue to grow.
Promotions like Russia's American Classics generated excitement, and the introduction of appealing menu platforms,
including Blended Ice in the U.K., created additional reasons for our customers to visit McDonald's. The U.K. also
remains committed to daypart expansion. Efforts centered on extended hours, breakfast and the family business are
driving momentum throughout the day.
In France, December marked five consecutive months of positive comparable sales. Strong promotional activity and an
ongoing emphasis on relevant value offers, like Casse-Croûte, helped fuel our momentum. Given uncertainty around
consumer reaction to recent VAT increases and current economic indicators that do not reflect improvements in market
dynamics, we remain cautiously optimistic about France.
Let's turn to Germany, where we see significant opportunities for improvement, with new Company leadership in place
and fresh perspectives among our franchisee leadership team. The market's goal is to stabilize its trends and begin
rebuilding brand relevance. Driven by deeper insights, we're refining our plans to focus on fewer, yet better, tactics that
more closely align with local customer needs. For example, October's launch of the McBaguette, a two-item value
bundle that mirrors the very successful Casse-Croûte in France, however, with a German influence, exceeded
expectations because it's a high quality product at a price point where we previously had a gap to consumer
expectations.
Let's now shift to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, or APMEA, where comparable sales were down 2.4% for the
quarter and down 1.9% for the full year. In constant currencies, operating income was relatively flat for both the fourth
quarter and the year. Japan comprises roughly a third of APMEA's comparable sales, though the market contributed
less than 15% to the segment's operating income. Amid a highly competitive environment, Japan continued to
experience significant comparable sales in guest count declines. Along with new leadership in this market, Japan is
taking the steps necessary to strengthen the McDonald's brand connection with consumers. This includes repositioning
its affordability strategy, in concert with additional emphasis on hospitality and more relevant menu news, for both the
new and core foods and beverages.
In Australia, comparable sales were relatively flat for the quarter. The appeal of new McWraps and salads did help to
build average check. Looking ahead, the market's plans are anchored around being even more relevant with local
consumers. We're emphasizing value across all price tiers and we're launching more premium products to create
excitement across the menu.
In China, comparable sales decreased 40 basis points for the quarter, a sequential improvement over the last nine
months and we're down 3.6% for the full year. Our enhanced all day Value platform is generating improvement and
we'll continue to expand convenience initiatives, including dessert, kiosk and delivery. And we'll work to grow the
family business across the market. Given the opportunities inherent in a growing, more prosperous, middle class, we
also continue to grow through expansion in China. We opened 275 restaurants last year.
Around the world, our holistic approach, which begins with the customer experience, is guiding our actions. And as our
business continues to generate significant levels of cash, our first priority is making disciplined investments in the
opportunities that will grow the business over the long-term. In 2013, we opened more than 1,400 new restaurants and
reinvested in our base of existing restaurants, including our reimaging efforts.
After capital expenditures, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long-term to our shareholders through
a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Last September, our Board of Directors announced a 5% increase in
our quarterly cash dividend to $0.81 per share in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2013, we returned a total of $4.9

billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And in 2014, we expect to return approximately $5
billion.
In closing, I remain confident in McDonald's future and, more specifically, our ability to strengthen our relationships
with our customers. My confidence is grounded in the fact that we are targeting the opportunities that exist within our
three global growth priorities to optimize the menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility
to Brand McDonald's. Our plans are supported by a comprehensive execution approach, which leverages all three legs
of the System to satisfy customer expectations and drive improved business performance.
The alignment of franchisees, supplier partners and employees is strong and critical to our success. And our strong
local market structures enable us to more deeply understand and better execute those initiatives which are most
important to our customers in their local markets. These distinct competitive advantages are the reason we're well
positioned to deliver enduring profitable growth today and for the long-term.
Thanks again, everyone, and I'll now turn it over to Pete.
Peter J. Bensen
Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. Though McDonald's grew revenues, operating income and earnings per share in
2013, our financial performance did not meet our high expectations. However, I am confident in the underlying
strength of our System, our business model, and competitive advantages to deliver strong performance over the
long-term.
We enter the year with a renewed energy around engaging more deeply with our customers. We place the customer at
the center of everything we do and we have the resources and infrastructure to meet our goal of becoming our
customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink.
So how will we do this and what will be different in 2014? We are leveraging consumer insights to better understand
how we can deliver on evolving consumer needs. This includes enhancing our value-based messaging and reengaging
with customers in more compelling ways, from our marketing and promotions to the order points at our restaurants. We
have identified areas where we can improve and are prioritizing the initiatives that are most impactful to our customers.
And we continue to move forward with investments that will drive long-term growth and returns.
Turning to 2013 performance, though revenues grew modestly at 2%, we prudently managed our expenses and
maintained full year combined operating margin of 31.2%. Our operating margin continues to compare quite favorably
to other large global consumer companies and restaurant businesses. Our profitability is driven by restaurant margins.
Franchising remains core to our business model, with 81% of our global restaurants operated by local businessmen and
women.
Franchise margins account for about 70% of total restaurant margins. In constant currencies, consolidated franchise
margins increased 2% to $1.9 billion for the quarter and 3% to $7.6 billion for the full year. Our franchise business
model is resilient, ultimately dependent upon top-line growth to maintain or expand margins over time. As a result of
relatively flat comparable sales and higher occupancy costs, the consolidated franchise margin percent declined 90
basis points for the quarter to 82% and declined 60 basis points for the full year to 82.4%.
Consolidated Company-operated margins declined 60 basis points to 17.2% for the quarter and fell 70 basis points to
17.5% for the year. Higher operating costs in both periods amid weak comparable sales contributed to the margin
declines. We're diligently managing restaurant expenses, but we expect cost increases to continue pressuring margins in
2014.
Looking at segment performance, in the U.S., negative comparable sales in fourth quarter, combined with 2% higher
commodity costs and increased labor costs, resulted in a 50 basis point decline in Company-operated margins to 19%.
For the full year, margins declined 110 basis points to 18.4%, primarily due to higher labor, commodity and other
expenses, coupled with weak comparable sales. From a pricing standpoint, we ended the year with a 3.1% increase in

the U.S. This is the result of several smaller menu board increases taken throughout 2013 and an effective 50 basis
point increase in November, due to the introduction of the Dollar Menu & More.
The Food-Away-From-Home Inflation Index ended the year up 2.1%, which was at the low end of the expected 2% to
3% range. For comparison, the Food-At-Home Inflation Index was significantly lower at 0.4%, well below the
expected range of 1% to 2%. Over time, we seek to price in line with food-away-from-home. As we look to 2014, both
food-away-from-home and food-athome
inflation is currently projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5%, although updated forecasts are due in the coming days. We
will continue to monitor these two indices closely, balancing our desire to drive traffic to our restaurants with
strategically managing margins and cash flow. On the expense side, we expect 2014 U.S. commodity cost increases of
1% to 2%, with more pressure in the first half of the year.
Turning to Europe, in fourth quarter, the segment increased Company-operated margins 30 basis points to 19.4%, as
positive comparable sales performance offset 1% higher commodity costs and increased occupancy expenses. For the
full year, margins increased 10 basis points to 19.2%.
Europe's Company-operated margins benefited from strong performance in France, as well as Russia and the U.K.
Combined, these markets contribute over 60% of Europe's Company-operated margin dollars. At year end, Europe's
price increase, excluding Russia, was about 1.5%. We remain very deliberate with our pricing, given cautious
consumer sentiment, VAT increases in markets like France, and ongoing austerity measures, all of which pressure
disposable income.
Europe's 2014 commodity costs are also expected to increase about 1% to 2%, with more pressure in the second half of
the year. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, our three largest markets experienced negative comparable sales in
both fourth quarter and the full year, with Japan having the most significant impact. Though the challenges differ across
markets, we believe that emphasizing McDonald's key advantages of value, convenience and service will be critical to
long-term growth in this segment. We tailor these advantages in different ways within each local market, from
providing affordable entry points through dessert kiosks in China, to enhancing Everyday Value platforms in China and
Australia, to expanding our web ordering and delivery service in Japan.
Markets across APMEA have some of our best Customer Service Scores and we are encouraged by their continued
progress. Quite simply, we want more customers to visit McDonald's more often. We will continue to innovate and
invest across a diversified portfolio of markets within this promising area of the world. Relative to profitability,
APMEA's Company-operated margins declined 180 basis points for the quarter to 12.6% and declined 170 basis points
to 14.2% for the full year, as higher labor, occupancy and other costs pressured margins. New store openings in China
continued to negatively impact APMEA's margins in both periods, as well.
Consolidated G&A was flat in fourth quarter and down about 3% for the full year in constant currencies. The full year
decrease was driven primarily by lower incentive-based compensation. As discussed at the November investor meeting,
we expect 2014 G&A to increase about $200 million, or 8% in constant currencies, reflecting the impact of below
target 2013 incentive pay, expenses associated with our worldwide owner/operator convention in April, and
sponsorship of the upcoming Winter Olympics games in Sochi and costs to support restaurant growth, capacity
enhancements and digital initiatives.
Our full year 2014 effective tax rate guidance is 31% to 33%, although we do expect volatility between quarters, given
our global business. As a reminder, first quarter 2013 results reflected a one-time tax benefit of nearly $50 million
related to the retroactive impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. This contributed $0.05 to EPS in first
quarter last year, which we will be lapping this quarter.
McDonald's resilient business model continues to generate significant cash from operations. As Don mentioned, our
first use of that cash is to reinvest in our business. We are the global market leader and we intend to continue
leveraging this competitive advantage. We will accomplish this through a balanced, measured approach to investing in
new and existing restaurants to drive future growth and returns.

Looking to 2014, over half of our $2.9 billion to $3 billion of capital expenditures will be used to open between 1,500
and 1,600 new restaurants. We will grow to the opportunity in both established and emerging markets, further
enhancing our diversified portfolio. The breakout for openings in our geographic segments is as follows: 250 in the
U.S.; 320 in Europe; and 830 in APMEA, including about 300 new restaurants in China.
We also continue to modernize our brand through reimaging. We updated 1,529 locations in 2013, a little shy of our
projection of over 1,600. This shortfall was spread fairly evenly across the segments. As we make continued progress
and some markets reach completion, our pace of reimaging is naturally slowing. This is reflected in 2014 plans that call
for over 1,000 total reimages. This reduction is also the result of planned kitchen investments in the U.S. that are being
prioritized in 2014. These new high-density kitchen prep tables are designed to deliver enhanced service capabilities
and menu choice to our customers.
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by $0.01 and the
full year by $0.05. At current exchange rates, we expect first quarter EPS to be negatively impacted by $0.02 to $0.03,
with a full year negative impact of $0.05 to $0.06. As always, take this as directional guidance only, because rates will
change as we move throughout 2014.
We begin 2014 energized by our opportunities, yet mindful of the challenges in front of us. We are the global leader in
a $1.2 trillion highly fragmented industry. We have one of the strongest brands in the world with significant
competitive advantages. Together, with our outstanding owner/operators and suppliers, whom we believe are the best in
the business, we proudly serve 70 million customers every day. And we are aligned to drive enduring profitable growth
for the McDonald's System and our shareholders in the years to come. Thanks.
Now, I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A session.
Q&A
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Thanks, Pete. I'm going to now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator
Instructions] Our first question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: Thank you. Kind of big picture thoughts question here, I just think back over a decade, for the
last decade up until 2012, you guys really averaged a same-store sales increase around that 5% range. And, over time,
and, Don, you're at the heart of this, but you guys had such compelling bottoms-up drivers in the business and just were
executing against much lower sales per unit than you sit at today. But as you sit here today, it seems the bottoms-up
drivers have just faded a bit from what they used to drive. And the bottom-line, I guess, is comps have hit this sluggish
cycle, and the question here is, is there anything that you see, from a new platform perspective or new business layer
perspective, that you can go after to get back to those mid-single digit comps across the System or do you really sit here
and look at your business is at today and think about it much more as being reliant on the macro and much less about
specific things that you can do to drive it?
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hey, thanks for the question, Brian. We really believe, Brian, that the areas, the strategic
areas, that we need to focus on to grow this business into the future, those are somewhat consistent and we still have
opportunities, and those being around our menu and the menu being relevant, really enhancing the customer
experience. And you guys have heard quite a bit about the execution focus and getting back to a stronger customer
relationship this year, as well as accessibility and affordability. Those areas are the right strategies. This affordability
aspect is a very, very key component of our growth as we move forward. So we think we're in the right area with those
strategies.
The key is going to really be to reestablish the trust of customers. When we look across the broader range, that is one of
the consistent things that we see. And that means basic execution at a restaurant level, marketing engagement at a much
stronger level and also to make sure that our menu is relevant. There are some other aspects of that we've talked about
being digital engagement. We have really not played in that arena in a strong way. And, clearly, you all know, based
upon them and some of our conversations, that our intent is to be much stronger with regard to our digital outreach and
digital engagement focus.

So we're focused really – you mentioned macro economics. We're focused on those things within our control to drive
our performance. This is going be a market share battle and a market share battle game in order for us to move the
business, but we believe we have the right strategies and the right focus at local levels in the markets to achieve the
goals that we have.
One of the things we've all discussed is that we've got to really get back to a much stronger focus on what we call 5P
execution. When we talk about the Plan to Win, people, product, place, price, promotion, those five areas, we've got to
make sure that we're maxing out our execution strategies for whatever initiative that we implement in any market
around the world. That's going to help us create that relevance again with our customers. So those focal points, along
with the priority focus on the key markets that we know we have challenges in, in an even stronger fashion which Tim
and the teams are doing, I believe will get us the growth that we need, not only for the current year, but as we move
forward, Brian.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right. Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco, Buckingham Research.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Thank you very much. My question's with respect to margins. I think you alluded when you
talked about APMEA, specifically about China having a little bit of a drag, obviously, because it's a Company-owned
mix versus a franchise mix, but I wonder if you can comment on China, the Company-owned margins. Is there
deleverage there, as well I'd assume with the slower comp? And then if you could sort of tie that in also, how we should
think, Pete, of the direction of the comp – I'm sorry, the margin in the U.S., when you roll out and we start to see the
kitchen equipment being put in there? Absent a comp lift, would we be seeing also a margin benefit from that initiative
of new equipment coming into the stores?
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: All right, Matt. I'll give it a shot. China, as you mentioned, we saw both. Our comparable
stores did have a decline in margin, as well as the impact of the new restaurants coming online, although the impact of
the new restaurants was less than it was a year ago. And as I think to the extent you listened or were at our investor
conference, you heard Dave Hoffmann talk about some of the initiatives they have underway, with their go-to-market
strategy, to look at bringing costs out of that development, the new development there, which will further lessen the
impact of the new openings on the margins going forward there.
So that piece of it is moving in the right direction, but, as you mentioned, you know, China, as well as all the markets
around the world, margins are a top-line game. And to the extent that we aren't driving the comp sales that we need
there, the margins will continue to be a little bit pressured.
In the U.S., specifically, you asked around the kitchen equipment, but, more broadly, one of the positives, if you will,
out of the fourth quarter was we saw some margin benefit from the Dollar Menu & More pricing aspect. So we did see
a little bit of positive impact to the check there. As we roll this new kitchen equipment out, it's going to have a couple
of different impacts. One, obviously, some of what we've talked about is designed to improve our throughput, improve
our order accuracy, offer more choice and variety to the consumer. So from that standpoint, obviously, that's a – should
be a positive for the business. On the negative side of that, so to speak, it will be additional investment. It will have
additional depreciation associated with that, some additional training.
So, in and of itself, it's not a one single piece that's going to make or break the margins next year. We'll continue to see
commodity pressure. We had about 14 states raise minimum wage here effective January 1, with others making noise
about doing the same thing, commodities, healthcare costs. So costs will continue to be a challenge for us in 2014 as we
think about the margins.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Okay, our next question is John Glass from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thanks very much. More broadly, Don or Pete, we're in a tougher operating environment than
you've been in a while. Your advantage versus the peers seem to have shrunk and these are things we've known for a
while. Maybe sales get better because you've continued to push on these initiatives, but it may also be they were just in
a lower sales environment. So as that as a backdrop, what are the other things that you consider in looking at how to
enhance the performance? So, for example, many of your peers over the last several years have gone through more

significant refranchising rounds. Is there an opportunity there? We've talked in the past about looking at your balance
sheet. It doesn't seem like that's something you're inclined to do, but maybe willingness to revisit that. Looking at even
corporate cost cutting, are there opportunities there to create a leaner organization, given these leaner economic times
or leaner performance times? Any thoughts there would be helpful.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Yeah, John, thanks much for the question. Let's go back to how we view and look at
performance and some of the data and what we actually see. If we look in the U.S. particularly, one of the things that
we see today is a bit of a bifurcation on a consumer base. So some of the fast casuals are performing a bit better and
customers are skewing that way a little bit more, as a result of a bit more discretionary income in that economic class of
individuals. So we also know that those customers that tend to come to us aren't faring quite as well in the current
economy in the U.S. Having said that, what we have to do, John, in the nearer-term, is focus on the value base, focus on
some of the things that we know are going be critical in terms of the execution of our menu.
I'm going ask Tim in a moment to kind of speak a little bit to the key markets, because I don't want to just pass over
that too briefly. There are a lot of opportunities we feel we have in the key markets. So Tim will give an update there.
Relative to looking at things like refranchising opportunities, we are constantly looking at that, John. And, yes, we do
have a longer-term plan relative to where we refranchise and the opportunities there, along with optimizing the
portfolio in our major markets. G&A-wise, we're continuously looking at that. And, clearly, as a pay-for-performance
culture, when we don't perform, as Pete mentioned, the incentive-based compensation and that part of G&A comes
down, there are other areas that we reduce G&A and it's because we're continuing to focus on some strategic changes to
our structures and our efficiency and effectiveness.
So we're going continue to look at those areas. But I will tell you, we have to be customer-relevant. The way to drive
the business is going to be through the top-line and growth, which means the execution in the restaurants. It means the
product focus that we have and it means the way that we're addressing customers and engaging them. And so with that,
Tim, if you wouldn't mind speaking a little bit to some of the key markets that you see and opportunities.
<A - Tim Fenton>: Yeah, sure. Hi, John. The key markets that we're looking at, obviously, the U.S., Germany and
Japan, and relatively new leadership in the U.S., Germany and Japan, as well, and each team is focused on making
those adjustments necessary to regain the momentum, specifically in the U.S., energizing consumer messaging and
market execution. We stumbled a little bit last year with too many new products, too fast, and created a lot of
complexity.
As we mentioned in November, reestablishing our breakfast, with a lot of emphasis on beverage and coffee, we know
that coffee drives the visits at our breakfast time. And I guess one of the biggest things that we're looking at in the U.S.
is focusing on peak hour execution. That goes hand-in-hand with the enhancements of our prep table. It gives us more
capacity in those peak hours, and, of course, menu choice.
In Germany, we're going to focus on fewer, but better, tactics, built around deeper insights behind what really addresses
Germany's needs. We're responding to the cafe and bakery offers that really kind of impacted McDonald's affordability
and relevance by introducing such products as the McBaguette to fill that price point gap. And, of course, strengthening
our Value program and focus more on core, and continuing to push breakfast. Even though it is a low base it, is
growing for us there. Japan, taking steps to reframe what the brand represents to our customers and repositioning the
market's affordability strategy. We can't go head-to-head with the 45,000 convenience stores on price alone. We realize
that. So we really have to put emphasis on our hospitality, our new menu news, both new and core.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right. Our next question is from Joe Buckley, Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you. I know you mentioned the Dollar Menu & More was meeting your internal
expectations so far, but could you talk about the Extra Value Menu experience in 2012 versus the early Dollars & More
experience in the latter part of 2013 and how they compare and contrast? I know you had to back away from the Extra
Value Menu. And just kind of curious, the reaction to Dollar Menu & More, why you're encouraged by it? And do you
think it has staying power and can it kind of move the customer traffic needle, as you suggested was the goal?

<A - Tim Fenton>: Hi, Joe. This is Tim. First of all, if you look back at 2012, we had Extra Value Menu. We had
Extra Value Meals, plus we had Dollar Menu, rather confusing, not only to customers, but actually kind of confusing to
us. With the Dollar Menu & More, it's meeting our expectations during the test. It was designed to really stretch out our
products' variety and give us flexibility in pricing. It's simpler. It's easier. It's only been in stores for a couple months
and that couple months was through the holiday period. We're seeing slight gains in guest counts and, of course, as Pete
mentioned earlier, it's margin-friendly. So, so far so good and it was a good transition and evolution for where we had
to go with our Value Menus and Dollar Menu.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hey, Joe, if I might, one thing, and I mentioned this in the comments, to get back to a
stronger relationship with customers, to be very honest, Extra Value Menu, while a very solid attempt, was based in
mining out additional profitability. The consumer part of that, from a consumer benefit, was not as strong as Dollar
Menu & More. Dollar Menu & More is customer-focused, customer-based, builds off the core equity and yields that
value to customers in that way. Extra Value Menu was really a reformulation of certain products, adding some others
just to build profitability. So this is what we mean by getting closer and getting back to a stronger relationship with the
customers.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right. Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good morning. Don and Pete, I actually have a follow-up to maybe that last comment,
where you've talked a lot about using consumer insights to drive the business more so than you've done in the past. And
I think Pete mentioned in his remarks that you've identified some areas where you need to improve. And I know you've
alluded to a lot of it so far, but maybe it would be helpful if you could give some specific examples, especially in the
U.S., where it looks like the relative performance has been pretty soft in the recent months. What have you learned
from consumers where McDonald's brand is currently missing the mark and maybe how does that translate to the
tactics you're going to use going forward?
<A - Donald Thompson>: I tell you what, David. What I'll do is I'll talk through a part of this and I want Tim to talk a
little bit to the operations piece of it, because that's a big part, too. So, again, and I know it's going to sound like, Don,
you continue to mention the same thing, but I'm going to go back to customer relevance. In the U.S., one of the
challenges we have is we've lost some of our customer relevance and we've lost it across several parts of the day.
So relative to the breakfast part, which Tim just mentioned, this notion on coffee is not just about coffee. It's about our
breakfast business coffee tends to be part of the lead for breakfast, but we have great tasting food. If we lose relevance
in coffee, then we're going to lose a transaction which yields a food purchase.
And so we've got to make sure that the food is relevant and that the awareness around McDonald's, as a kitchen and a
restaurant that cooks and prepares fresh, high quality food, is strong and pronounced in our marketing and our
messaging. So we've got to get back to that on food. We've got to get back to an energy and excitement in our
marketing balance and the execution of it. And that's something that all of us have noted. Jeff Stratton and the team in
the U.S. have noted and you've seen some of the changes which, again, Tim can update you on relative to even
personnel changes in the U.S. So that's one of the specifics in the U.S. that I could speak to. We talked about value.
But, Tim, maybe on this operations front, because that's another big one.
<A - Tim Fenton>: Yeah, one of the things we did last year, David, we over-complicated the restaurants. If you
remember, we introduced the McWraps. We introduced Egg White Delight. We introduced Quarter Pounder Toppers
and really didn't give the restaurants an opportunity to breathe. We instituted a gatekeeper, really with the intent of
doing fewer products, but better execution. We mentioned a little bit earlier the capacity on the prep table. That allows
us really to have more capacity during our peak hours, where we haven't been able to, particularly in some of our
drive-thru restaurants, serve as quickly and fulfill the capacity that we wanted, so fewer product is better.
One other thing when you talk about insights, and I want to mention Germany, historically, we lost some share, based
on our insights, to nontraditional competitors, cafes and bakeries. At the same time, when we were pulling off some of
our value offerings, bakeries stepped up with value offerings and some of our trade went to nontraditional QSRs, as I
said, bakeries and cafes. We've learned about that. We're designing our strategies how we can go back to mitigate that,

but a deeper understanding of consumer insights market-by-market-by-market.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from David Palmer, RBC Capital.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks. In the past, McDonald's would have operations upgrades like the Made for You or
the beverage station and it would allow your marketing machine to get cranking over several years oftentimes, driving
the sales layer. I'm trying to figure out if this – if some of these changes that you're doing with the prep tables could be
an enabler, from an innovation and marketing standpoint, as well as something that helps you with peak hour capacity
and execution. Could you comment on that, please?
<A - Donald Thompson>: Yeah. I'll make one comment on the marketing piece and there's, again, there's another
capacity piece to this. On the marketing end, David, you know, you're right. One of the things that we've done – and
actually we didn't do it nearly as strongly with Made for You back in 1998. We implemented Made for You, but we
really didn't come out with a strong marketing campaign that was correlated to it. We had individual markets that did
and saw benefit, but we didn't hit it as strong.
To that point, even today, customers don't realize, to the greatest extent, that at McDonald's, we're making that
sandwich, preparing that in the back of the house, after you place that order. What does this mean? It means that there's
a notion of that, again, that relationship and the awareness that customers have about who we really are as McDonald's
and what we're able to deliver in that kitchen, which is a customized sandwich for you, is something that we really need
to be able to advance in our marketing messages more. Now, the challenge has been, there's been a little concern as to
whether or not and how hard we could go with that messaging if we didn't think we had more capacity headroom. So
with that in mind, we've done some things with the kitchen and, Tim, maybe a little bit on high density.
<A - Tim Fenton>: Yeah, the high density UHC cabinets that we have allows us more capacity. And the prep table
enhancements not only gives us flexibility in customization with other toppings, it gives us the capacity on some of the
existing products that we had, that we had, not to get really operationally technical, but we had a lot of crossover. And
replenishing during peak hours was the last thing you want to do. But with the refrigerated rail that we're adding, and
we should have this all into the System between the May, June timeframe, it allows us some flexibility with different
variety of toppings: jalapenos, avocado, pico de gallo, and different spice sauces, if you will, that allows the flexibility
on more customization, so it's capacity on existing. It gives us flexibility for new products and new toppings as we go
forward.
<A - Donald Thompson>: And then we've got to tie those together, David. To your point, we've got to tie the
marketing messages and awareness into driving this. That's one of the things that you all reference quite a bit when you
talk about coffee. We reference PR, the marketing and the operational pieces together to drive that category, and we'll
do it again.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Jeff Farmer, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeff D. Farmer>: Great, thanks. Just following up on that, on the throughput side, you've discussed the high
density, the prep tables, a lot of other plans, but are you guys planning to add labor to these restaurants? How should
we think about that moving forward?
<A - Tim Fenton>: Yeah, that's another priority that we have. In fact, our field service teams are right now working
with all of our operators on just that, staffing, positioning, and scheduling, as far as putting the right people on at the
right time, particularly during our peak hours. We have to have the additional staffing required for some of the
complexity that we have. That was, I think, one of the stumblings we had last year with all the new products we
brought in all at the same time or within close proximity, so definitely is a priority for us on beefing up staffing,
particularly on peak hours and weekends.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question's from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Great, thank you very much. Just a question on kind of broader Europe, and I think
we've talked about this a few quarters ago, but France seems to have joined the U.K. and Russia perhaps in recent
months. I know, Don, you mentioned the string of positive comps there, and it leaves, I guess, Germany as the weak

major market. One, I'm just wondering if that's fair. And two, I'm just wondering how we should think about 2014,
whether or not Europe could be the silver lining for the broader Company. It does seem like, at least from the macro
data that we see, that the trends are stabilizing or perhaps improving across broader Europe. I'm wondering if that is the
case, whether Brand McDonald's is seeing that and, therefore, would be a good way to play the improving European
macro and if there's anything specific to talk about in Germany. I know you mentioned new leadership, but anything
else that we should expect to help to send that comp to the positive side.
<A - Donald Thompson>: I think Tim mentioned some of the things that are taking place in Germany right now. And
I believe that what's different about the Germany aspect is that we had a refocusing before. We put some things in place
that were customer-focused. We only executed them for a shorter period of time and we pulled them out. I think there's
been a lot of learnings relative to what we should do in Germany, along with the fact that whenever you execute a "best
practice", it can't be adopted. It has to be adapted, which is also the difference between McBaguette and Casse-Croûte.
So relative to a Germany, that's one of the things that we knew we had to be able to do.
France, I want to echo a comment I made around cautiously optimistic. I think our French team, as are we, we've seen a
trend of positive results. France is still an economy that's got some troubles to it. There's a VAT increase that I
mentioned. We also have some – there's some decisions that will be made soon relative to the French Government from
a social charge and austerity-based perspective that we'll have to take a look at. We hope that it will stimulate the
economy, which would be good for everyone, but, right now, France is still at a point where the 2014 IEO projection is
to be down 10 basis points. And so it is not a market that has come out yet, but we've seen some positive things and, in
the face of all of those, our teams have done a fabulous job.
Southern Europe is a area that still has some challenges and those are macroeconomic challenges and we've just got to
make sure we maintain relevance in that area. So Europe, as we always say, Europe is not a country. And so when you
divide it across the various segments, we see some positive areas and then we see some areas that are still difficult. So
we are optimistically looking at performance across Europe, but there's still some challenges there.
<A - Tim Fenton>: And just to add, Jeff, the IEO projections are really modest going forward: the U.K., plus 50 basis
points; and Germany, plus 50 to 80 basis points.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right. Our next question is from Howard Penney from Hedgeye.
<Q - Howard W. Penney>: Hi. Thanks very much. I have two questions for you, if you don't mind. The first one's on
the high density tables and when I hear additional capacity or additional customization, it just kind of occurs to me or I
think slower service times, more than I do faster service times. And I apologize for this question, because I actually
haven't seen those tables in use, so I don't really understand how they work. So how does additional customization not
equal slower service times?
And then two, can you maybe provide a definition of what net internal expectations means? Just because you've used it
a couple times relative to initiatives in 2014 that really haven't delivered, whether it's wraps or Mighty Wings that
haven't – while they may have met internal expectations, they didn't really drive the business forward. And you're also
now using that term associated with the new Dollar Menu & More. Thank you.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hey, Howard. I'll take the piece on internal expectations and then I'll ask Tim to talk more
about the high density kitchen and impact on operations. When we say internal expectations, we have clearly a business
case for each and every individual initiative that we implement. We have certain criteria that we establish, whether that
be based upon guest count growth. It might be sales growth, profitability aspects. So we look at those business cases
and we have internal expectations set around certain targets.
We also have expectations set around the overall accretive nature of an initiative to the broader business. And so when
we look, as we measure whether or not something was effective, and whether or not it was successful, we measure it
against those internal criteria. You guys typically hear us talk about the consolidation of all of the initiatives, which
then roll up into an incremental benefit in the comp sales or something that might be associated with our operating
income at a total level.

<A - Tim Fenton>: Howard, on the capacity, any time during our peak hours, if I can keep people in place and not
have their feet moving to restock or to get something else or have crossover. Last year, we deleted Angus, because it
was a slow moving product for us. So we're working with two proteins of beef in the kitchen. When I can have the
capacity in the prep table where people don't have to move, I'm just putting different toppings on. You've got the
protein coming down the prep table like an assembly line, if you will, and we're just adding different condiments on.
And, again, monitoring the pace and the rate of new products that we bring in, giving our crews and management
ample time to train and get used to before we switch it up and change it on them.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right. Our next question is Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.
<Q - Gregory Robert Badishkanian>: Across your biggest markets, have you noticed any change in the competitive
environment over the, let's say, the last month or two that's kind of a deviation from the trend?
<A - Tim Fenton>: Well, in the U.S., last month, in the fourth quarter, we had, I guess, a higher competition as it
pertains to value and discounts and so on. And I would say maybe a little bit more in China in the fourth quarter and
maybe specifically in Australia, but it's a very competitive market out there, a lot of price going on. And it's a fight for
market share. It's a street fight and we're getting at it.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question comes from Sara Senatore, Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you. I actually wanted to follow-up on margins, because the restaurant,
Company-operated restaurant, margins were better, broadly speaking, than I would've expected, given some of the
sluggish top-line and what you've said about your leverage points. So the two questions are, can you just talk a little bit
more about where there might be opportunities there on that line item going forward? You said costs are going be a
headwind, but just how well you can manage that line. And then a related note, the outlook for food-away-from-home
and food-at-home inflation implies an acceleration, but I don't think we're really seeing that in the commodity markets.
Can you talk about what you think of as kind of your sweet spot for inflation where you have the ability to take price,
but it's not so much that it's a real drag on margins, just specifically with the U.S., but then broadly? Thanks.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Yeah, Sara. In talking about margins, the fourth quarter actually did exceed our own internal
expectations when we started the quarter. So if you recall, I gave some guidance that implied we expected margins to
be down a little bit more in the fourth quarter than they really were. And if you look – as we look at the reasons for that,
it was really France and Russia outperformed in the fourth quarter relative to their initial expectations. And actually
Germany didn't decline as much as they had originally expected. So Europe was a big piece of that, but also the U.S., as
I alluded to earlier, some of the check benefit that we got from the Dollar Menu & More in the two months it was in
was to the positive side of the ledger. And also their costs came in just slightly under where they had expected for the
quarter.
So it was a combination of factors in different markets that led to that. When we think about 2014,
food-away-from-home projection of 2.5% to 3.5%, the reason I said in my remarks that we expect an update shortly is
with the commodity trends and everything else that's going on, that number might come down a little bit. Now,
certainly, it does also include labor in the restaurants and I mentioned minimum wage increases in 14 states is a piece
of impacting that as well. But right now, we're going to continue to monitor that indice. We're also going to look at
food-at-home. Again, that only grew 40 basis points this year. I doubt it will grow 2.5% to 3.5%, which is the current
forecast, based on where commodity trends are. But at the end of the day, we're going to look at the pricing, as we
always do, to try to balance growing traffic in the restaurants, but also looking at profitability all through that screen
that Don mentioned of continuing to improve our relevance with our customers and value is also one area where
relevance to customers matters.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right. We're running a little low on time. We're getting close so, we're going take a couple
more. Next is Andy Barish from Jefferies.
<Q - Alexandra Chan>: Hey, guys. This is Alex Chan for Andy. I wanted to go back to talking about APMEA.
During 2012, it seemed like check was really down and traffic kind of held up and this year, you know, this past year in
2013, that kind of reversed. I guess, how do you find the balance there? And when you look at that, how do you think

about China and kind of avoiding that same issue?
<A - Tim Fenton>: Well, China, specifically, they got, as an industry, hit the QSR and IEO with the chicken situation
that happened in December of 2012, and then the re-hit of the avian influenza, and then a downturn on just the
macroeconomics. Something not unlike what we saw back in 2008, and we bounced back in 2009 and 2010 and 2011.
So we, in China specifically, we stick to our strategy. We feel we've got a sound strategy. We're being strategic on our
openings. We're being strategic on our menu pricing and our points of distribution.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Okay. Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Sorry.
<Q - Will E. Slabaugh>: Yeah, thank you. I had follow-up question on margins and at the restaurant level in
particular. At the analyst day, you talked about the three straight years of margin compression. And so I wonder if you
could speak more specifically to that past in margin stabilization. Could that occur this year and then maybe more
specifics around that, what that expansion might look like and how that might take place from here?
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Hey, Will. As we looked at the margins over the last couple of years, actually just recently
looking at a kind of a detail breakdown by quarter-by-quarter by the line items, one thing that was consistent across the
years is the cost pressures kind of, in general, were in a fairly tight range. It wasn't a huge spike one way or the other,
absent commodities, which could have more of a significant impact, but they weren't a significant driver of the margin
decline as much as the variation in the top-line.
And I know we sound a bit like a broken record, but the importance of driving comps in our business to margin
profitability is so important. And it's getting back to that relationship with the customer, improving our relevance is
going to lead to that improving top-line, which then has that margin flow-through benefit and restaurant level cash flow
growth. It's really the key to getting the economic engine moving in the right direction again.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right. Then this will be our last question, Keith Siegner from UBS.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Strengthening the brand to differentiate it was one of the stated intents and another one was
the primary focus of the cash flow is to reinvest in the business. I'm just wondering, given that strength in underlying
cash flow generation and a balance sheet that I think could clearly provide incremental capital should you want it to,
why not accelerate investments now, both reimaging and kitchen investments simultaneously? Is there an operational
hurdle to doing so? Because it feels like this is a major competitive advantage that McDonald's has. Could an
acceleration of this reinvestment in this environment be one of the ways to rekindle or re-ignite that relationship with
the consumer? Thanks.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, Keith. I'm going to speak to part of this and I'll ask Pete to speak to the other part. The
notion of accelerating reinvestment, one of the things that we've found across the business, and history has dictated to
us, is that you have to have a balanced focus as we grow the business. So one of the reasons that you haven't seen us
just say we're going put all of our dollars right into China and let's just go hard, because we also have other emerging
markets that we also want to grow and we want to grow consistently. By growing consistently, it allows us to build up
the associated infrastructure from a supply chain perspective, the talent that we need to manage the market and build
out the real estate development, as well as our ability to be able to put dollars into a market and create awareness within
those markets to build comparable sales to be able to be a sustaining business model.
And so as we look at some of the areas around our capital investment and deployment, we want to be balanced and
measured. If it's something like a kitchen-based reinvestment, there's a pace that you can go at in the restaurants and, at
the same time, make sure that you're maintaining the penultimate focus, which is the focus on customer satisfaction and
expectations. If we change all of a market at one time and went out and got a bunch of general contractors, what we
would find is that we would lessen our ability to satisfy customers and we wouldn't spread out these activities and
execute an effective plan.
And so this is one of the reasons you hear us talk about we want to have a moderate and a steady pace, but on a base as
large as ours, our steady pace is pretty aggressive for other people. And so this is the reason we say that. There are
some other implications and Pete could probably talk about a couple of those from a financial perspective.

<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Yeah, Keith. I mean, it is much less about the capital, because, as you know, we have the
ability to throw more at it, but you alluded to operational. It is sequencing and getting these things done in a way. It
takes a lot of planning and resources, both internal and external contractors, to change out the kitchen equipment in
14,000 restaurants around the U.S. So all of the time and energy you need to focus on that, to the extent you also try to
focus on accelerating reimaging and a lot of the same kind of contractors or internal people are needed for both types of
projects, you do start to dilute the effect and not get the desired outcome.
In addition, we have over 2,000 franchisees in the U.S. So this has to also be done through them, considering their
individual capacity, their individual cash flows, their individual organization strengths. So while I agree with you on
paper, it sounds like going faster could be a quicker path to getting some of these relevancy issues dealt with that Don
mentioned, the reality and practical nature of a large franchise system with somewhat limited resources, in terms of the
competencies to work on these kind of projects, gets us to kind of the pace that we're at. And to Don's point, I think it is
a fairly aggressive pace, in and of itself.
Kathy H. Martin
All right. We'll close out with some final thoughts from Don.
Donald Thompson
So, once again, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate that. And we appreciate your
interest in McDonald's. Our confidence in our brand and the competitive advantages of our System are truly a reflection
of our ability to learn from our past, to be quite purposeful and agile in the present conditions and environments that we
operate in, and the strategic plan can evolve with our customers as we look to the future. As we've mentioned from the
onset, we are confident in the McDonald's business and we're confident that we have the right information, data and
business acumen to address the key markets and the other opportunities that we have going forward.
So thank you all, once again, and have a great day.
