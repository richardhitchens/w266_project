And now, it is my pleasure to introduce QUALCOMM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Paul Jacobs.
Paul E. Jacobs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. I think it's fair to say I'm extremely pleased with QUALCOMM's
performance this past fiscal year. We delivered record revenues of $19 billion, up 28% versus last year. Earnings, total
reported device sales and MSM chipset shipments were also records was driven by the increasing global consumption
of wireless data across a diverse range of devices and particularly smartphones. We also increased our dividend for the
10th consecutive year and returned $2.9 billion to stockholders in the form of buybacks and cash dividends.
As to the fourth quarter, we are above the high-end of our previous revenue and earnings guidance as demand and 28
nanometer supply improved as the quarter progressed. This gives us a strong base to build off of and looking forward in
next year, we expect double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth again in fiscal 2013.
For the year, we had a number of highlights. We delivered double-digit growth in our licensing business with record
revenues and earnings. We now have over 220 royalty-bearing 3G licensees and this year we added more than 20 new
Chinese licensees and our first license agreements with major Brazilian consumer electronics suppliers.
We've also continued to grow our single-mode OFDM licensees. We now have over 30 single-mode OFDM licensees
around the world and believe our 4G portfolio is the most widely licensed in the industry. Through our licensing
program we continue to foster innovation and enable a large and growing ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers
worldwide.
Our semiconductor business had double-digit growth as well delivering record revenues and earnings. During the year,
we continued to lead in LTE with our integrated modem solutions.
We delivered significant product enhancements across all key technology vectors including the modem, processor,
graphics and connectivity with world-class integration and we executed the fastest ramp of a new process node in our
history. Now, this is not without its challenges, but the teams consistently executed to an accelerated schedule over the
last nine months.
We believe the breadth and depth of our product roadmap is unparalleled and our Snapdragon and Gobi family of
chipsets has established the industry standard in integrated mobile semiconductors allowing us to continue to extend
our partnerships with key OEMs. On the display front, we continue to believe MEMS based displays will provide key
differentiating features such as low power consumption and outdoor viewability.
As we previously indicated, we are increasing our focus on licensing our display technologies including our next
generation mirasol display technology while at the same time directly commercializing certain current generation
mirasol displays. We're also evaluating various options for our display manufacturing facility in Taiwan.

Shifting to our spectrum related initiatives, we achieved many significant milestones this year. In United States we
completed the sale of our 700-megahertz spectrum to AT&T and we're working closely with them to enable their
deployment of supplemental downlink using our carrier aggregation technology on this unpaired spectrum to improve
download speeds and capacity.
In Europe, the regulatory group CEPT decided to harmonize the L-Band at 1.4 gigahertz for supplemental downlink.
This by the way is the same band that we own in the UK and this opens up the potential to have supplemental downlink
deployed widely across Europe.
And finally in India, we received our license and the assignment of the 2.3 gigahertz spectrum we won in India's BWA
auction and Bharti Airtel, a leading Indian wireless operator acquired a 49% interest in our Indian BWA entities and we
expect they will take full ownership of those entities in calendar 2014. Bharti's acquisition added an operator partner
with the scale, experience, and resources to rollout and operate on LTE TDD network on this spectrum.
Turing to calendar 2013, despite a somewhat cautious macroeconomic outlook, we expect 3G, 4G device shipments to
grow approximately 14% year-over-year based on the midpoint of our forecast. We believe our long-term growth
drivers remain intact. Smartphone adoption continues at a rapid pace with many increasingly capable devices at a
variety of price points being launched on a global basis.
According to industry analysts, more than 300 million smartphones were shipped in the first half of calendar 2012,
representing approximately 45% year-over-year growth. To put this in perspective, according to Gartner, this was over
two-thirds higher than the volume of PCs that shipped during the same period.
Further, the demand for data on mobile networks continues to grow, which is driving the need for continued
technological innovation and we're seeing a fundamental shift towards mobile computing. We'll explore these and other
opportunities in more detail during our upcoming Analyst Day and I look forward to seeing many of you there. As
you've heard, due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy we were unfortunately forced to move the Analyst Day to San
Diego, but our thoughts are with all of those that were affected by this tragedy.
So, to wrap up, we have completed another outstanding year at QUALCOMM. I would once again like to thank all of
our employees and partners for their innovation, effort and leadership. Looking forward, I'm pleased with our outlook
for continued double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth in fiscal 2013.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to QUALCOMM's President and Chief Operating Officer,
Steve Mollenkopf.
Steve Mollenkopf, President and Chief Operating Officer
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. QCT had another strong year with record revenues, up 37%
year-over-year driven by record shipments of 590 million MSM chipsets, which were up 22% year-over-year. In the
fiscal fourth quarter, we shipped approximately 141 million MSM chipsets, above the midpoint of our prior guidance.
Revenue per MSM was up approximately 9% sequentially driven by a greater mix of multimode 3G LTE devices,
which more than doubled quarter-over-quarter and made up approximately one-third of our shipments exiting the
quarter as expected.
Similarly, shipments of our new dual-core MSM8960 tripled quarter-over-quarter, as demand for integrated application
processors continues to grow.
Demand for our 28 nanometer products remained strong, including significant design activity on our follow-on
chipsets. As expected, we ramped our 28 nanometer supply significantly in the fiscal fourth quarter, and we remain on
track to match our current 28 nanometer demand profile exiting the December quarter.

Our industry-leading modem technology continues to be a tremendous differentiator for us. As modem complexity
continues to increase with multimode and multiband requirements, we are well-positioned with a single solution offers
a true global modem, supporting all cellular modes, including CDMA, WCDMA, TD-SCDMA, and both LTE TDD
and LTE FDD, as well as the approximately 40 related RF bands.
In addition, we recently sampled our third-generation multimode 3G LTE chipset, the MDM9x25, which is also a
global modem that add support for LTE Category four and carrier aggregation. We believe our first 28 nanometer
Snapdragon product, the dual-core MSM8960 with integrated 3G LTE, has become the global standard for combined
performance and battery life, powering recent flagship devices, such as the Samsung Galaxy S3, the HTC 8X, the
Motorola RAZR M, and the new Nokia Lumia phones.
As carriers deploy LTE networks, they are looking to QUALCOMM as the leader in multi-node LTE for smartphones.
For example, KDDI, NTT DOCOMO and SoftBank announced 27 new smartphones in Japan in October, and 24 of
those were powered by QUALCOMM's Snapdragon processors.
Since releasing the MSM8960, 15 OEMs have launched devices with this chipset across 19 carriers around the globe.
The 8960 was our fastest integrated product to ship 100 million units.
Our OEM customers have also moved quickly to adopt the Snapdragon S4 Pro, which includes our latest Adreno 320
GPU. Four Krait CPU cores and is paired with an MDM9x15 multimode LTE modem.
Early reviews show that this product has set a new bar for multitasking and graphics performance. The first OEM
devices based on this platform include the Google Nexus 4, LG Optimus G and Xiaomi MI-2, and we expect more
leading devices on this platform to be announced soon.
Smartphone demand in emerging regions is growing rapidly, and we continued to invest in our QUALCOMM
Reference Designs program to help service a new group of emerging customer accounts. The program now has over 40
OEM customers and 100 commercially launched devices, and this quarter we expanded our roadmap to include the new
Snapdragon Quad-Core MSM8x25Q and our new 28 nanometer based MSM8930 with an integrated global modem.
We are pleased to see the initial launch of Windows RT devices, including the Snapdragon based Samsung ATIV Tab
and the Dell XPS 10. While it is early, we are positioned to benefit from this new category, as our QUALCOMM
Snapdragon chipsets are the only chipsets to power both Windows smartphones and these new mobile computing
devices.
Our Mobile Connectivity Solutions, which include integrated Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and FM, continued to be used by
the vast majority of our customers designs for their 28 nanometer S4 devices. As we mentioned on the last call, we
expect a strong December quarter for QCT, as our supply 28 nanometer chipsets continues to ramp and our partners
launch a broad lineup of handsets for the holiday quarter. We are expecting record MSM shipments of between 168
million and 178 million units in the first fiscal quarter, up approximately 19% to 26% sequentially, with revenue per
MSM also up sequentially.
In fiscal 2013, we expect multi-mode 3G LTE shipments for smartphones to constitute a much greater percentage of
our mix, which we estimate will significantly increase our average revenue per MSM versus fiscal 2012. We also
expect our 3G LTE leadership and broad-tiered roadmap to help increase our design traction within key customer
accounts.
Leadership across multiple technologies required to succeed in mobile remains our strategic priority for our business
and we are increasing our R&D investments in fiscal 2013, including investments in our modem, the application
processor, and driving new process technologies, as well as our reference design effort.
That concludes my remarks. I look forward to seeing many of you in San Diego at our upcoming analyst event. I will
now turn the call over to Bill Keitel.

William E. Keitel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have strong financial results and guidance to report to you today.
Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $4.87 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share were
$0.89, up 11% year-over-year, both above the high end of our prior guidance range. QTL revenues grew 16%
year-over-year and total reported device sales by our licensees were approximately $46.5 billion, up 19%
year-over-year.
We estimate that approximately 210 million to 214 million subscriber units were shipped by our licensees in the June
quarter, up 12% year-over-year at the midpoint at an average selling price of approximately $216 to $222.
QCT fiscal fourth quarter revenues were a new record growing 21% year-over-year and QCT's operating margin was
16%, above our prior guidance reflecting strong shipments of our multimode 3G LTE solutions. We returned $1.27
billion to stockholders in the fiscal fourth quarter, including $426 million in cash dividends and $841 million through
stock repurchases.
In addition, since the end of fiscal 2012 and through yesterday's market close, we repurchased another 4.1 million
shares of our stock for $240 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.89 for the quarter, $0.08 better than our
prior guidance midpoint.
QTL was $0.02 better driven by strong 3G, 4G device shipments and QCT added $0.07 driven by higher MSM
shipments and favorable multimode 3G LTE product mix. The net of higher operating expenses and impairment charge
and higher investment income accounted for one penny reduction.
Turning to our results for fiscal year 2012, revenues were a record $19.1 billion, up 28% from last year. GAAP
earnings were a record $3.51 per share, up 39% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating income was a record $7.1
billion, up 17% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share were a record $3.71, up approximately 16%
year-over-year.
QTL's fiscal 2012 revenues were a record $6.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year and QTL's operating margin was 88%.
We estimate that the fiscal 2012 3G, 4G device average selling price as reported by our licensees was approximately
$216 to $222, up 6% compared to fiscal 2011 and we're expecting strong adoption of smartphones in multiple tiers in
both developed and emerging regions.
QCT's fiscal 2012 revenues were a record $12.1 billion, up 37% year-over-year with operating margin of 19%. Our
fiscal 2012 operating cash flow was $6 billion and 31% of revenues. We returned approximately $2.9 billion to
stockholders during fiscal 2012, including $1.6 billion of cash dividends and $1.3 billion through stock repurchases.
We are reaffirming our 905 million unit midpoint estimate for calendar 2012 3G, 4G device shipments by our licensees,
up approximately 14% year-over-year.
Now, I'm turning to next year. We estimate calendar 2013 3G, 4G device shipments by our licensees will be
approximately 1 billion to 1.07 billion units, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our economic
outlook is largely aligned with consensus worldwide GDP forecast except that we have less optimism in developed
economies. The midpoint of our guidance is based on 3.0% world GDP growth in 2013 compared to consensus of
3.4%. We expect fiscal 2013 revenues to be in the range of approximately $23 billion to $24 billion, up approximately
23% year-over-year at the midpoint.
We expect our non-GAAP operating income will be in the range of approximately $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion, an
increase of approximately 18% at the midpoint. While we anticipate strong growth in both our chip and licensing
businesses, we expect the higher mix of multimode 3G LTE and 28 nanometer chipsets to drive growth in QCT's
revenue and operating income at a comparatively faster pace than QTL.
We expect fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $4.12 to $4.32, an increase of approximately
14% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate that the 3G, 4G device ASP will be approximately $214 to $226 in

fiscal 2013, a slight increase year-over-year at the midpoint.
We anticipate that combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will grow approximately 19% year-over-year,
primarily driven by increased R&D investments and those R&D investments focused on furthering QCT's leadership
position.
Absent U.S. corporate tax reform, we expect both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in fiscal 2013 to be
approximately 18% to 19%. As a reminder, we do not include estimates for realized investment gains or losses on our
cash and marketable securities portfolio in our financial guidance unless they are reasonably certain.
Now, looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we estimate revenues to be approximately $5.6 billion to $6.1
billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year at the midpoint. We anticipate that non-GAAP earnings per share will be
approximately $1.08 to $1.16 a share, an increase of 15% year-over-year at the midpoint.
This estimate includes expected total reported device sales of approximately $46 billion to $51 billion by our licensees
for shipments in the September quarter, up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. We estimate that QCT will ship
approximately 168 million to 178 million MSM chipsets during the December quarter with revenue per MSM higher
sequentially reflecting strong demand for a multimode 3G LTE solutions and improved 28 nanometer supply.
We expect a modest build in the 3G, 4G inventory channel in the December quarter as is typical for the holiday season,
and we estimate that 3G, 4G inventory channel will remain towards the low end of the 13 to 18-week band throughout
the remainder of 2013. We expect combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to decrease approximately 2%
sequentially.
We hope to see many of you at our November 15th Analyst Day where we will share additional data points regarding
our fiscal 2013 guidance, including segment operating margins, ASP trends and 3G, 4G regional breakouts. The event
will be webcast live on our QUALCOMM Investor Relations' website, which also includes a slide presentation on the
data points included on today's call.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back over to Warren.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with our question.
Tim Long, Analyst
Thank you very much. Just a two-parter on the chipset ASPs if I could. It sounds like a lot of LTE and good
smartphone shipments in the quarter and expecting the same next quarter. Two things; one, could you talk a little bit
about what's going on with ASP at the lower end, obviously MediaTek is starting to do a little bit better, are you seeing
more price pressure there? And secondly, I'm calculating a little bit better gross margin profile for the chipset business
in the quarter, is that accurate? Have you seen -- starting to see gross margin benefits from the move to 28 nanometer or
from the higher ASPs? Thank you.

Tim, I'll take the second part of your question on the gross margins. Let me just say for our first fiscal quarter of 2013,
we do expect a nice increase in QCT's operating margin. I won't comment on the gross margin and I won't give
specifics on the Q1 operating margin for QCT, but I think we'll share a little more color next week at the analyst
meeting. But again, we do expect a nice pick up in QCT's operating margin in fiscal Q1.
Tim Long, Analyst
Could I maybe -- the impact at low-end?
Steve Mollenkopf, President and Chief Operating Officer
Tim. This is Steve. On the low-end, it's pretty much playing out the way that we've discussed it or described it over the
last year or so, which is, it's pretty competitive market at the low-end. It's very -- crowded a bit competitively and
people are really pricing aggressively in order to get share or to maintain share. So we expect that to continue to some
degree as we talked about for some time.
One thing I should mention to, earlier I misspoke a bit, I said that the MSM8960 was our fastest product to 100 million
units, actually it should have been 10 million units. So, I apologize for that. It's 10 million units.
Tim Long, Analyst
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Mike Walkley with Canaccord. Please go ahead with your question.
Mike Walkley, Analyst
Hi. Thank you. Bill, on QTL or the CDMA device market ASPs are flat to even improving next year, especially with
your GDP comments about lower mix maybe from mature markets. Can you just walk us through some of the factors
that are keeping ASPs flat to up next year and when you might think longer-term with more growth from emerging
markets that might put a downward pressure on QTL ASPs longer term? Thank you.
Derek Aberle, Executive Vice President and Group President
This is Derek. Let me go ahead and take that one. I think as we've said in the past, over the longer term we should see
some amount of erosion in the ASP. I think as you look ahead to next year and we'll provide some more color on this
next week, I think there's going to be somewhat offsetting trends. I think we are expecting to see more volume come
from the emerging regions, but then sort of offsetting that to some extent we're seeing more -- higher percentage of
devices at the highest tier in some of the developed regions and also we expect, as we've in the past, ASPs in some of
the emerging regions that have been quite low to continue to increase with more smartphone penetration cannibalizing
the future phone.
So, I think all that kind of nets out together to relatively flat picture going forward next year.

Fine, thank you. Derek, the follow-on question is, connected tablets becoming a bigger impact in terms of ASP trends
that you report?
Derek Aberle, Executive Vice President and Group President
I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?
Mike Walkley, Analyst
Sorry. Just wondering if connected tablets works more with LTE shipping and 3G are the connected tablets becoming
more meaningful to your ASP calculations?
Operator
I think we've been -- as the volume goes up and down quarterly, the volumes themselves have changed, but I think the
percentage of total units that are coming from tablets have been relatively constant. I think we'll kind of have to wait
and see how things play out going forward with Windows RT and some of the other Android tablets coming into the
market over the next year.
Mike Walkley, Analyst
Yes. Thank you very much.
Operator
Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Simona Jankowski, Analyst
Yes, hi. Thanks so much. Just wanted to clarify, when you talk about expecting a significant increase in the MSM
ASPs, now it's interesting to that you're not also expecting an increase in QTL ASPs to match that, so that would seem
to imply that directionally your market share is increasing more at the high end of the total device opportunity. Is that a
reasonable conclusion?
William E. Keitel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think it's a combination of things, Simona. One, you are going to get a timing difference between the MSM shipment
and the impact into our licensing business. So that would be number one. But number two, we are -- as Derek said, the
high-end of the market seems to be playing out pretty strongly here in the near-term. So you are going to see more of
effect of that initially.
Later through the year though, as Derek did say, we do expect the emerging markets to be growing at a faster pace than
the developed market, so I think some of it's -- a lot of what you are seeing there is just timing, Simona.

And, I also wanted to follow-up on the guidance for fiscal '13 within QTL. Can you just be a little more specific on
what you are assuming there on the success for Windows RT with 3G, 4G connectivity attached, is that a meaningful
assumption as part of your guidance or is that platform more to be successful, would that imply upside?
William E. Keitel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I would say on Windows RT, in our guidance here, we've been cautious, but looking out in time we're cautiously
optimistic.
Simona Jankowski, Analyst

Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead with your question.
Brian Modoff, Analyst
Hi, yeah. Couple of questions. Steve, on the LTE side you talked about your MSM ASPs going up because of the shift
towards more of the LTE product and more of the advanced Snapdragon product. Can you talk a little about LTE
competition, our own checks indicate the competitors are getting -- continuing to see delays in getting their products
out, can you talk about when you expect to see merchant silicon out from some of the competitors? And then Bill,
question around, you guide revenues next year 23% and EPS 14%, why such a gap between the two? Thanks.
Steve Mollenkopf, President and Chief Operating Officer
Brian, this is Steve. On your first question about LTE, yeah, LTEs become really a table stakes feature at the high end
and it's something that we have not only in our modem product line but also in the application processor line as you
know, and it's become tiered now when you look at our 28 nanometer shipments, meaning that we have multiple tiers
of AP shipping LTE now integrated.
Moving into next year, we expect that feature set to turnover, meaning that the LTE solutions that we're shipping today
will add additional bands, they'll also add different data rates, as well as carrier aggregation, I talked about how we had
been sampling our new design as well which is our third-generation.
So, we think that's moving quite fast and we think it's going to be a very difficult situation to come into that market. But
as you know, everyone is trying to do that. So, we expect a number of competitors to go after portions of that market,
but I think getting the worldwide SKU, we're going to try to make it very difficult.

William E. Keitel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And Brian, to your second question, the reason that revenue growth is greater than earnings per share growth is simply
the difference in margins between QCT and QTL and we're expecting QCT next year to grow at a substantially higher
rate than QTL. That is the primary difference.
There is a small amount difference as well, because we don't forecast realized gains on our cash and marketable
securities portfolio beyond what we have clear visibility on. That tends to be a very near-term picture.
So, those are the two factors. The great majority that will be in the fact that QCT we expect to be growing at a much
faster pace than QTL albeit both businesses we expect to grow double-digit.
Operator
Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead with your question.
Ehud Gelblum, Analyst
Hi. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. A couple of quick questions. One is, if you look at your guidance for QTL market
size, you said the market size in June that you got royalty revenues on in September was 46.5 billion, and you're saying
that's going to go to 46 billion to 51 billion. The midpoint of that is up 4%. Most of what we've seen, I think you've
probably seen the same things from all of your licensees, which show that smartphone growth from calendar Q2 to
calendar Q3 was a lot more than 4.5%, or 4%. I think most of the numbers are showing well into the double digits.
How did you get to your 46 billion to 51 billion range? I would have thought it would have been higher than that. And
then just wanted to see what you did or didn't bake into that, and then I have a follow-up on royalty rate. Thanks.
William E. Keitel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Ehud, this is Bill. We monitor the OEMs as you do. Obviously, we are able to engage probably at a more
detailed level. As we mentioned, we're seeing -- Steve Mollenkopf and Paul described in this way, that the OEM
market is kind of getting to be a barbell, where you have one end of the barbell with names that we all recognize, but
the other end of the barbell there's a lot of names that very few people recognize, concentrated in Asia.
And it's that visible name in one end of the barbell that people tend to focus on and where data is more readily
available. The other end of the barbell, the data can be hard to come by. So I think that's probably a key difference
between what you're rolling up and what we're rolling up.
Ehud Gelblum, Analyst
So I'm guessing it's more that you can't see it either and so you're going conservative there versus you actually know
more than we do there, or do you know more than we do? Then my extra question is on the royalty rate, it came back to
3.4%. Obviously, it has to do with couple of your providers or couple of your licensees that have some fixed
components to their rate structure, and when they are up or down, it does fluctuate a little bit. But as you look into
2013, do you expect the same 3.4% to hold, and at what point do you expect your single-mode LTE licensees, who
presumably have a lower royalty rate than 3.4%, to start dragging on that?

On the TRDS question, total reported device sales, I hope that we have more visibility than you or others do. We have
tended to do reasonably well with our forecasts; I'm hopeful that we are going to hold that pattern here going forward.
Derek Aberle, Executive Vice President and Group President
Ehud, this is Derek. Let me try to answer your question on the rate. As we've pointed out kind of repeatedly, we do tend
to see quarterly fluctuations in the rate and it's for a variety of factors that can move it around. And last quarter,
obviously, the TRDS was a bit higher than it came in this quarter, so that's an impact and we actually saw with some of
this growth at the high-end of the market, larger percentage of devices hitting the caps that we have in place, so that's
going to have an impact on the rate.
I think we're not prepared today to talk about what we see going forward, but hopefully we can give you some color on
that next week. What we did say a couple quarters ago is we expected to finish up the year towards the low end of the
3.4% to 3.5% indicator we gave at the outset of the year, and I think we're pretty close to that is where we ended up.

Rod Hall with JPMorgan, please go ahead with your question.
Rod Hall, Analyst
Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks to taking my question. Just a question on R&D maybe for you, Bill. If you could talk a little bit
about, R&D was a little bit higher than we thought it would be in fiscal Q4, how much of that was related to 28
nanometer? And then I also wanted to ask about next year the fiscal 2013 guidance.
I mean, the R&D is -- or the overall OpEx is kind of pacing in terms of growth a little bit below expected revenue
growth, and I wonder if you could talk a little bit -- put that in context with Paul's commentary about R&D investments
increasing next year. Should we expect the OpEx to shift more toward R&D next year, or how is that going to play out
as we move through the year? Thanks.
William E. Keitel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Rod. Yeah, next year we expect R&D to grow at a rate substantially higher than SG&A. We're pretty excited
about the R&D investment opportunity ahead. And at the same time I think we're pretty pleased that we think we will
be able to get a lot of leverage, operating leverage out of the SG&A we got in place.
So, we expect R&D to grow at a rate substantially higher than SG&A. What you're seeing in fiscal Q4 is just we're on
that ramp. The expenses came in a little bit higher. We did point out that we did have an impairment charge in the
quarter. It was a $54 million impairment charge related to our display business, which, as I think you're basically
aware, we've shifted our focus there a bit and that impairment follows on that shift in focus. But other than that, we're
on a ramp here that there is a fast growth in R&D because of the exciting opportunities ahead.
Rod Hall, Analyst
Bill, would you -- would your R&D have ended up in the quarter around 850 or something like that without the
impairment in the 28 nanometer, or can you give us any idea of kind of where it would be normalized?

The impairment was charged to SG&A, so I brought that up in the context of our overall operating expenses. Okay?
Rod Hall, Analyst
So, with your R&D underlying, can you give us any idea of where that might have been or?
William E. Keitel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, I would say there weren't that many -- I don't see a lot of nonrecurring elements in our fourth quarter R&D. The
largest R&D program in QUALCOMM today is 4G LTE along with 28 nanometer; that is our largest program in
QUALCOMM today.
Operator
Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse, please go ahead with your question.
Kulbinder Garcha, Analyst
Thanks. Yeah, I have one question for Steve, I guess. With the rising ASPs you are talking about in the QCT business,
is it fair to say that -- how do you think about QCT margins over the next year, maybe over the long-term? Can we get
back to historic levels? Is there a level of investment you are needing to make or pricing pressure or competitive
environment you're breaking into a next fiscal year so margins don't expand?
Any color there would be -- specifically in QCT, will be helpful. And I guess, Bill, just going back to the whole issue
of OpEx, and I think where all the questions are really getting is just, you had like fairly decent R&D throughout last
year, very decent OpEx growth. This year it's going to grow slightly a touch slower than sales, but you are not
necessarily giving, especially in the R&D line, as much leverage I guess as you've spoke about. I thought there has
been a number of investments and heavy levels of investments in recent years. And so at what point do you think you
could get actual significant operating leverage of R&D, is that still a three to five-year discussion, or could we actually
start seeing that towards the end of the next fiscal year, for example? Many thanks.
Steve Mollenkopf, President and Chief Operating Officer
Kulbinder, this is Steve. On the first question, what you're seeing in the QCT business is we have the strategy, and it's
particularly true on the high end, of trying to set the design -- essentially the design point for the industry really create
an integrated product that leads in multiple dimensions.
Those dimensions; graphics, modem, connectivity, what have you, we continue to invest pretty heavily in. And we
think that that strategy is working, particularly as you look at the outlook in '13, we feel that we'll be able to really see
significant year-over-year growth because of that, as Bill mentioned. The other thing that you are seeing as well is we
are transitioning through nodes at a faster pace than we have done historically. So we have, probably on a historical
basis, a bit more VLSI investment consistent with transitioning through nodes quickly. We think that over time it will
be very difficult for people to continue to keep up with that level of technology innovation.
That's essentially our strategy on the high-end and it seems to be paying off right now. We're going to continue it
through the next year. And as Bill said, we're pretty excited about where we think that's going to lead, particularly at a
time when the smartphone and the tablet are converging we think long-term.

In terms of getting leverage on the R&D investments outside of, the thing Steve has been talking about, obviously we
have a pretty significant investment in supporting multiple operating systems and being, I'd say, cautiously optimistic
about kind of the revenue growth derived from that in the near-term, but I think those are great growth opportunities
looking out.
Then we're also doing reasonable amount of R&D in new areas to deal with the data growth and really satisfying
customer demand there, and then finally new R&D and other growth markets that are adjacent and we'll get into some
of those discussions in the Analyst Meeting on where we see the opportunities.

Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein, please go ahead with your question.
Stacy Rasgon, Analyst
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, with QCT growing significantly more than QTL, it sounds like a lot
of this is going to be pricing, but do you see share gains as well, and to the extent you see that, is it more customer
exposure versus new SoCs that you see driving it.
For second question, a question on mirasol, you are moving that to a licensing business, so this last year I think it lost
more than $300 million, which is probably $0.15 or $0.20 of EPS. Do you have upside in your annual guidance for next
year from that mirasol transition to licensing or is there potential further upside once you figure out what to do with it
or is it already in there in your spending, the savings on the OpEx lift?
William E. Keitel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Stacy, it's Bill. I'll take the mirasol one first. There are savings built into our guidance. We had indicated earlier this
year that we would be -- we're executing on our plan that would deliver savings and those are built into our guidance.
On the question on share gains, we are targeting to do better in QCT. We've got both a richer mix and we're targeting to
capture more design wins as we go forward here. So, it's a combination of the two, Stacy.

that? And do you have thoughts on how much of the China market can actually migrate to 3G and 4G? There is a bit of
a negative case out there that EDGE plus Wi-Fi is a sufficient smartphone experience for some given the density of
Wi-Fi hotspot in China and even like iPhone is already on the China Mobile network? Thanks.
William E. Keitel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Ian, this is Bill. On the first question for 2012, yes, we did increase our estimates. It's disclosed on our website
estimates as we saw, for 2012 China and India by 15 million units and then that was offset with some reductions that

we think are occurring elsewhere.
Between that emerging market estimate, it's primarily China and that's really extrapolating off the trends we're seeing, I
think many are seeing -- it's a very, very active smartphone market, both the consumers are -- high consumer take rate
and we think a good operator experiences as well.
Paul E. Jacobs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
If we look at the EDGE smartphone market, we believe that's a transitional step. Obviously people aren't going to be
satisfied with the EDGE experience when it comes to the kind of content that many people are consuming on their
smartphones, high bandwidth content like video.
The other thing is Wi-Fi is going to -- it's going to tap out, because it's going to be interference limited. And the nice
thing about the license band technology is that you can cause the base stations to manage interference among
themselves and that's the kind of technologies that we're bringing to the market over the next few years. And those I
think will drive the kind of capacities in the network at very, very much decreased cost point.
So, the wireless operators are going to be in a position to really supply a lot better data experience, lot better quality of
service, over the 3G and 4G networks. So while we love Wi-Fi and we sell awful lot of Wi-Fi through Atheros, we
believe it for offload, it's not going to be the solution for the mass of smartphones and tablets going forward.

Tal Liani with Bank of America, please go ahead with your question.
Tal Liani, Analyst
Hi. I have a question on MSM ASPs. If I increase the ASPs for MSMs by 9% in the fourth quarter, which is -- I think
puts an assumption here I think is a fair assumption. And from that point, from this quarter point I keep it flat
completely for the following year, I'm still getting 14% growth in ASPs year-over-year.
So when you spoke about growth in ASPs for MSM, do you mean that it's going to stay flat and that's going to imply
during -- according to my math, 14% or do you mean it's going to further increase from the current fourth quarter level?
Thank you.
Steve Mollenkopf, President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. It's really referencing the fourth quarter that we just reported on. So we believe it's going to increase through the
year. And as I said, there will be sequential increase for Q1 as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, fairly significant
sequential increase.

Could you talk about why it is that those phones have done so well and what the implications of that are on the apps
processors market? Just do you believe that your market share will go back up again? Is that what you were referencing
in your prior statement?
And then Steve, perhaps for you on the seasonality. You had said earlier that you would expect supply to only match
demand later in the second half of the December quarter, does that mean that you will still be working off demand in
the March quarter, is that the implication of that statement? Thank you.
Steve Mollenkopf, President and Chief Operating Officer
Sure. So on your first question, what we've continued to believe and it's been our strategy for some time is that we
believe that for mobile you have to have expertise across multiple areas. You have to be able to innovate across
multiple dimensions, the modem, the application processor, graphics, connectivity and probably even more
importantly, you need to be able to put those together in some sort of integrated product where you control the
architecture, because there are a number of different trade-offs that are required and we've been able to do that over the
years and significantly here over the last several years, 8960 being a great example of an area where we've had -- and
we are the first people to come out with the new micro architecture for the ARM CPU as well as integrated LTE and
brand new graphics core.
It's really important for mobile, we think to put those all together in one package and really optimize the architecture
for what's required for mobile. And we've benefited from that and you've seen that in the benchmark. So, that's our
strategy. We're going to continue that moving forward. We're pretty happy with where the roadmap goes to be able to
do that moving forward.
Incidentally, I think that's also one of the reasons why you're seeing some people who have expertise in one area, let's
say, CPU or GPU, try to add the other expertise areas because it's very difficult to compete unless you have them all.
With respect to seasonality, let me clarify my comments. For the fourth quarter, we have been talking about how we
thought that exiting the fourth quarter we thought supply and demand of 28 nanometer would be matched. By
implication, the starting point or the beginning part of the quarter, meaning the October and September timeframe, we
are still burning off excess -- or not enough supply.
And by the way, these are calendar quarters, so, I'm taking about the December quarter. Now, going into March, we
feel that we have supply and demand imbalance and we think that that will be the case really exiting the December
month. So, hopefully that clarifies it.

contingency plans, I mean, depending on how their legal outcome plays out? Thank you.

the high-end of anybody's smartphone portfolio to absorb technology very quickly, but it's technology that's really the
union of all the technologies, all the modem technologies, for example, across the world.
And what we've seen is that we've been able to leverage to some degree a design win in one geography and be able to
move that to another geography and I think that's just consistent with the way the high-end of the market is moving. It's
very fast paced in terms of the means of which or the speed at which it's taking technology.
Mark McKechnie, Analyst
Okay, great. That's helpful. And one other question as a follow-up, Steve, if you don't mind. Your chip ASPs ticked up
a bit. You talked a little bit about connectivity, but could you comment at all on your attach rate of the Wi-Fi piece, the
Bluetooth piece, the connectivity with your 8960 solution?
Steve Mollenkopf, President and Chief Operating Officer
Sure. The ASP uptick is really a combination of better modem features as well as better application processor features
and really selling more and more of the integrated products. On connectivity, what we've really added throughout fiscal
year '12 was the ability to attach wireless LAN to our solutions.
As you know, we've had very strong attach on GPS and GLONASS here recently Bluetooth and FM. With the
integration strategy that we have, we've added wireless LAN, and as I've mentioned really throughout the year and
reiterated here today, the vast majority of our 28 nanometer S4 designs use our integrated wireless LAN. So we're very
pleased at how that's going right now and we're really trying to deliver on the fan-out that we've been able to get. In our
view, we think the integration strategy really works across all of these technologies.

James Faucette with Pacific Crest, please go ahead with your question.
James Faucette, Analyst
Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. First, I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question related to device
ASPs, I think Mike Walkley has asked about when we might expect to see the growth in emerging markets start to have
downward pressure on ASPs at least, how we should think about that qualitatively?
And the second question that I had was related to cash, you highlighted very well the use of cash and returning of cash
to shareholders over the last little while. How should we think about your outlook for buybacks and dividend policy
going forward? Thank you.
William E. Keitel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
James, this is Bill. On the device ASP, emerging markets having a larger effect on the total average. Although
emerging market units are growing faster than the developed markets are, the total dollar value of the developed TRDS
is far greater than the emerging market TRDS.
And so, we are ways away from that crossing over where an emerging market dollar value is equal to or greater than a
developed market. But I think we're planning a little more color on this next week. So, I'll leave that point there and
maybe Paul, you want to talk about it?

Yeah. So, I think you've seen that we're focused on returning capital to shareholders and we're going to continue to be
focused on doing that as well as investing into research and development, because we see the opportunities ahead of us
as being sort of great. But the Board obviously looks at the cash flows when they determine the dividend policy and
we'll continue to look to be opportunistic on the buybacks as well. So, I think the one thing that could make a stop
function difference in these things is, hopefully we'll some corporate tax reform and good territorial system going
forward and that would have a significant impact on that as well.

And Just a follow-up on ASPs. My understanding is that the strong smartphone adoption that's happening in the
emerging market has been driven in part because the smartphone ASPs have come down. I think Paul you were talking
recently about the price points getting to 100 and at some point maybe going down as low as 50. And I'm just trying to
reconcile that with the comments around ASPs at the low end running up and supporting the outlook of flat-to-up ASPs
in 2013?
Derek Aberle, Executive Vice President and Group President
This is Derek. Let me try to take part of that and Paul wants to add on. I think there's still -- even though the pricing
from smartphones is coming down to here, which obviously is a positive for driving growth, there still is a meaningful
gap between sort of the lower-end smartphone and the low-end 2G or 3G feature phones that have been sold before
those became available. So as we look out, and we see the trends, I think we do continue to expect even as the prices
come down, a combination of more people buying at a higher price than they were historically on a feature phone, as
well as people migrating to even the higher tier devices will provide some stability there.

Thanks for taking my question. Just based on your next fiscal year revenue guidance and operating profit, it seems like
you expect gross margins to go down at least a little bit and that seems somewhat counterintuitive to your higher
content for chipset commentary, so can you just explain kind of how you are looking at gross margins for next year and
then the emerging market impacts as well? Thanks.
William E. Keitel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Craig, the primary driver when you are looking year-over-year at -- you are estimating gross margin or looking at our
guidance on the operating margin, it's really the facts that we see the QCT business growing at a significantly higher
rate than the QTL business. And obviously, QTL gross margins and operating margins are much higher than they are
for QCT, but both businesses were looking to grow double-digit next year, it's just QCT at a much higher rate. And for
both businesses we'll get a little more into operating margin discussion next week, but both of them we expect to
perform a very good and healthy operating margin next year.

This concludes today's allotted time for question and answers. Dr. Jacobs, do you have anything further to add before
adjourning the call?
Paul E. Jacobs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I just want to say I'm really happy that the year turned out so well. It was a little harder year than I had
anticipated. Obviously, at the very beginning of the year we had our engineering teams working feverously to get
chipsets done. They did that so well and then we ran into supply constraints and had talked to customers about not
being able to give them everything that they wanted and you add that to a somewhat uncertain macroeconomic
environment.
But in the end of the day, global demand for data and for mobile data and smartphones and tablets and all these devices
just pulled it really through, and I think that's a testament to the employee-based focus that they had and just the
worldwide excitement around mobile technology. And looking forward, just continue to execute with great team of
people. We've got some great products coming out that we're already getting good traction on, a lot of new
technologies, lot of very interesting markets that are expanding. I mean, I'm very, very excited by the opportunities that
lie in front of us.
So, I hope to see you all next week and we'll get a chance to go into a little bit more detail on that. I just want to say
thanks everybody for the support.
