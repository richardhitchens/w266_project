Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Today's call will
contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the
comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings
release, which is available on our website.
Now I'll turn the call over to Marty.
Martin J. Barrington
Thanks, Sarah. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call. Our companies are delivering well against their
strategies, and our business results are on track. In the first nine months of 2014 Altria delivered solid adjusted diluted
EPS growth of 5.5%. During the third quarter the Board increased our dividend by 8.3% and authorized a new $1
billion share repurchase program. And earlier this morning we reaffirmed our adjusted EPS guidance of 7% to 9% for
the full year 2014.
Here are the highlights for the third quarter and the nine months of 2014. The Smokeable Product segment performance
this year has been outstanding. We delivered strong adjusted operating companies income growth of 9% in the third
quarter and 6.3% year-to-date driven by solid pricing. Adjusted operating companies income margins also [inaudible]
(3:10) both in the quarter and the first nine months. Marlboro continues to show modest share momentum as it gained
0.1 of a share point in both the third quarter and year-to-date in line with our strategy in the Smokeable segment. It's
apparent that the investments made in the Marlboro architecture are paying dividends, and we're excited about the
brand's strong equity and momentum.
In Smokeless USSTC continues its strategy to grow income by growing volume at or ahead of the category, and
maintaining modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal combined. In the first nine months the Smokeless
segment delivered 4.4% adjusted OCI growth in a competitive environment with lower industry volume growth.
USSTC strengthened its leadership position behind the combined performance of Copenhagen and Skoal. For the third
quarter of 2014 these two premium brands achieved their highest combined share since the acquisition of UST at 51.3
share points.
Turning to Innovative Tobacco Products Nu Mark continued its national expansion of MarkTen e-vapor products and is
developing a robust product pipeline. MarkTen achieved distribution in nearly 80,000 retail stores. As of September 30,
2014, MarkTen continued to be ranked in the top three e-vapor brands in the Western U.S. based on retail market share.
Nu Mark plans to further expand MarkTen in the Eastern half of the U.S. and complete its national expansion in the
fourth quarter.
Our diverse business model and strong balance sheet support our strong and growing dividend and our ability to
enhance shareholder returns through share repurchases. In August 2014 Altria's board increased the regular quarterly
dividend by 8.3% to $0.52 per share. Altria paid shareholders almost $1 billion in dividends in the quarter and nearly
$3 billion in the first nine months. We remain focused on our target dividend payout ratio of 80% of adjusted diluted
EPS. And we expect to continue to raise the dividend in line with adjusted diluted EPS growth.
In the third quarter Altria completed the prior $1 billion share repurchase program. In July 2014 the board authorized a
new $1 billion program, which Altria expects to complete by the end of 2015. During the third quarter of 2014 Altria
repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $42.87, for a total cost of
approximately $275 million. As of the end of the third quarter of 2014 Altria had approximately $778 million
remaining in the current $1 billion share repurchase program.
In summary we're very pleased with our year-to-date business performance and strong execution. Our core tobacco
businesses are performing well, and we are making disciplined investments in innovation for the future. Together we
are managing our diverse business model and strong balance sheet with the objective of delivering consistent earnings
growth and shareholder returns year after year.
Howard will now provide additional details on the quarter and for the first nine months

Howard A. Willard
Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. Altria grew third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by 6.2%. And today we
reaffirmed guidance for both adjusted and reported diluted EPS. Altria expects to deliver adjusted diluted EPS growth
of 7% to 9% in a range of $2.54 to $2.59, off an adjusted base of $2.38 per share in 2013.
We expect stronger adjusted diluted EPS growth in the fourth quarter driven by several factors, including a
significantly lower fourth quarter effective tax rate on operations resulting from Altria's 2013 debt tender offer and
lower fourth quarter costs in the Smokeable Products segment due to the end of the federal tobacco quota buyout
payments.
Turning to the Smokeable Products segment, we delivered strong adjusted OCI and adjusted OCI margin growth in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2014, primarily through higher pricing. Adjusted OCI margins expanded two
percentage points in the first nine months of 2014.
PM USA grew Marlboros and its total cigarette category retail share in the third quarter and nine months year-to-date.
After adjusting for trade inventory fluctuation and other factors, PM USA estimates that its third quarter and first nine
months cigarette shipment volume declined approximately 3% and 3.5%, respectively, and that total industry volumes
declined approximately 3.5% and 4%, respectively. The 2014 year-to-date industry cigarette decline of 4% continues to
be in the range of the decline rate we've seen in the last few years.
Middleton's reported cigar shipment volume increased 8.4% for the third quarter and 6.8% year-to-date, driven by
Black & Mild's strong performance in the tipped cigar segment including Black & Mild Jazz.
In the Smokeless Product segment, adjusted OCI grew 0.7% in the third quarter and 4.4% year-to-date. Adjusted
operating margins grew 3.1 percentage points in the third quarter to 64.9% and 2.4 percentage points to 64.6%
year-to-date.
After adjusting for calendar differences and trade inventory changes, USSTC and PM USA estimate that their
combined domestic Smokeless Product shipment volume grew approximately 2.5% in the third quarter and 3% in the
first nine months of 2014. USSTC and PM USA estimate that the Smokeless Products category volume grew
approximately 3% over the last 12 months, reflecting slower industry volume growth in the past two quarters.
Copenhagen and Skoal delivered third quarter retail share of 51.3 share points, up 0.4 from last year driven by
Copenhagen's retail share growth of 1.4 share points. USSTC is investing both in Skoal's equity and to narrow price
gaps on Skoal Classic. These investments are designed to enhance the long-term combined performance of Copenhagen
and Skoal.
The Wine segment continued to deliver solid results. Ste. Michelle grew OCI by 10.7% for the third quarter and 11%
for the first nine months. Shipments increased 4.2% in the quarter and 2.5% year-to-date.
That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, let
me cover a few housekeeping items. As a reminder, comparisons when made are against the third quarter of 2013
unless noted otherwise.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 33%, down one percentage point. Marlboro's net
pack price was $5.98, up $0.12. The lowest effective priced cigarette was $4.51, up $0.15. The Cigarette Discount
segment's retail share was 24.9%, down from 25.3%.
Wholesale inventory changes are one factor PM USA uses to estimate adjusted PM USA and industry volumes. PM
USA estimates that for 2014 wholesale inventories were approximately 2.3 billion units at the end of the third quarter
and 2.1 billion units at the end of the second quarter. Last year PM USA's wholesale inventories were estimated to be
approximately 2.5 billion units at the end of the third quarter and 2.2 billion units at the end of the second quarter.

The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax was $1.48 per pack, up $0.01. Copenhagen's price gap versus
the leading discount brand was 30%, down 6 percentage points. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.15, up $0.08. The
price of the leading discount brand was $3.19, up $0.20. In the third quarter CapEx was $56 million and ongoing
depreciation and amortization was $49 million.
Operator, do we have any questions?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Investors, analysts and media representatives are now invited to participate in the
question-and-answer session. We will take questions from the investment community first. Our first question comes
from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So, Marty, I guess you had a very strong cigarette profitability, or the Smokeless division had
very strong profitability with very strong pricing, margin expansion. Just curious if you can talk about the competitive
landscape and the ability to sustain this kind of very profitable growth in the segment? And especially as you get into
the fourth quarter where you've been – obviously will have another favorable tailwind in terms of your cost standpoint.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well thanks for your question and thanks for your comment. There was very strong
performance over at the Smokeable segment. When you look at the numbers that we've reported this morning, you see
income growth 9% and margin expansion, very good pricing realization, very good steady momentum on Marlboro in
line with our strategy. And then of course the volume declines have moderated below what the industry estimate is
from us. So that's a very strong performance.
I think what it represents, Judy, is the coming together of some of the work that we've done. The Marlboro architecture
is clearly paying back dividends. Our strategy is to maximize income. That's how we're trying to execute our plan this
year, and that's what we should expect going forward. They change a little bit over time quarter to quarter, but over
time that's the strategy. And we're trying to be consistent in that regard.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then, Howard, any help you can give us just in terms of just really dissecting a bit
more on the All Other segment performance from a sales and profitability perspective? Understand there's a lot of noise
around the Financial Services business, but you've also making investments on the MarkTen.
So just curious how we should think about that business? And then are we done in terms of all the investments related
to the MarkTen national launch? Does this step up again in the fourth quarter? Or is this sort of the peak investment
quarter as we think about that business?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yes, I think as we've indicated previously we're not going to break down the detail in that
Other segment any more than is indicated in the release.
But as we've said since the beginning of the year, our results this year are impacted by the fact that we are both making
investments in Nu Mark throughout the year and at the same time the comparisons of our PMCC operating companies
income are affected by lower asset sales this year than last year. And both of those create a negative year-over-year
comparison in the Other segment.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. But sequentially is there anything you can talk about just in terms of how much the
national expansion of the Nu Mark would have helped the revenue line? Just to get a sense of if we're actually seeing
progression on the MarkTen sales side. I understand there's a lot of investment that's going on. But just trying to sort of
reconcile with what we're seeing from a Nielsen market share data perspective and sizing the MarkTen number from

that data to kind of what you're actually reporting from a shipment perspective.
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yes, I'm not going to provide any further detail on a quarterly comparison basis.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. All right. And then just my last question, Marty, just the Smokeless Tobacco segment. I
mean clearly you had the one less shipping day that impacted the reported shipment. The category seems a little bit
slower though if you adjust for the shipment days. So...
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Just can you talk about what's happening from a category perspective? And obviously you've
had some investments you're making to tweak some of the pricing around Skoal. How do you think that that's going in
terms of the context of your market share performance?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. Let me talk about those in turn. As you know we try to estimate the category
growth in Smokeless on a 12-month trailing basis. And using that metric over the last several years I guess I would say,
it has been in the range of about 5%. And then you see that our estimate today is about 3%, because it has slowed down
in the last two quarters, which has that effect.
We're analyzing what's going on with the growth rate right now carefully. It goes I think without saying that as
categories get bigger, the growth gets harder as they get bigger. And I think everyone also recognizes that tobacco
consumers have choices today as they choose their products.
So we're looking at that carefully. I think it's important probably to say what we've said with respect to that growth rate,
what we say with respect to the cigarette decline rate, which is it's really best measured over time. And so we have two
quarters of data here which are taking us in this direction. But we'll look at it carefully over time.
With respect to Skoal I always start out by reminding folks that while Skoal has its challenges, it is a top three brand
with 20 share points in a segment for us that has 65% operating margins. So it's a big brand with good profitability. Its
challenge though is that it competes both with its competition, but it competes with Copenhagen, which is the iconic
brand in the category of ours that continues to grow very strongly.
So we're trying to work on that. As you know this takes place over time. Howard has already made reference to the fact
that we've worked on its equity positioning. We have a new equity campaign. You've seen the ads in print I'm sure. We
have very good new equity based promotions for Skoal in the marketplace that have been very well received.
And then with respect to Skoal Classic, which remember is at the premium price point, we're trying to get that price
point adjusted for price gap management purposes so that it compete more effectively against its principal competitor.
And we've been able to do that. We do that tactically by state, because it makes a difference in terms of the excise tax
rates.
So it takes place over time. But we are encouraged by where we're going with Skoal. We manage our premium brands
for the long term, and we are patient.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Judy, thanks for calling in.

<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: So, Marty, you called out on the success of the Marlboro architecture, and that's clearly
evident in the continued momentum that you have on the Marlboro brand. I know you guys don't like to talk about
individual product lines within the Marlboro family. But maybe could you talk about Marlboro Black in totality, where
you've called that out as a good share gainer over time in previous discussions.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, I do think that the Marlboro architecture is best understood in context of the four
families. But it is true that the addition of the Marlboro Black flavor family has been a terrific boost for Marlboro.
That brand continues to perform very well. I think we're now in our 15th consecutive quarter of growth for that. And
it's highly relevant to adult competitive smokers. It's a terrific product in a great pack.
But I do think that apart from Black, the best understanding of the Marlboro architecture as we've discussed previously
as you know is to understand that it has opened up the marketing freedom to speak to people who are in the franchise
and adult competitive smokers in different ways and to market to them in different ways. And I think in totality that's
why you see Marlboro performing as well as it has done.
That and many other things by the way. Marlboro.com has been improved. How we go to market has improved. So I
think the team's done a really great job with Marlboro.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: That's terrific. Thank you. In terms of the cigarette industry volume declines, and I heard
you loud and clear on the work that you're doing on MST. And I'm sure there's some cigarette analysis involved there
as you think about kind of the [ph] cross elasticities (21:48) of demand. But I know you guys also focus a lot on the
health of the consumer. And can you give us just an update on how you're seeing your consumer trending, in particular
in light of lower gas prices?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: You're talking about the economic conditions?
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Yes.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, we had in our 2014 plan that while the U.S. economy was improving, that we
assumed that it was not going to show up quite as strongly for our adult tobacco consumers. And I think that has proven
to be the case throughout the year.
Unemployment rates obviously are down, but they're not down where they should be. Underemployment is down, but
it's not down to where it should be. And on those two measures in particular, our adult tobacco consumers over index.
There's pretty tepid year-over-year wage gains.
But then you do see these shoots of other good economic activity. Housing starts are up. Consumer confidence some
months are up. And then we have seen lower gas prices, although that's less of a factor in our view.
So I think for 2014 while we're encouraged and we hope that it gets traction, our continuing assumption is that our
adult tobacco consumer is going be under some pressure.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: That's very helpful. And Howard, just one last one for you. As we think about the fourth
quarter, anything that we should kind of keep in mind in terms of SAB? Because the SAB number came in higher than
I had been anticipating given I guess the casino sale.
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I mean I think that's – the only thing I would point out is the third quarter was
impacted by an extra gain related to the sale of their casino business in Africa. And I think that's the only thing I would
point out from an SABMiller perspective.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Terrific. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: When you give your market share updates, is that on the adjusted category numbers that
you mentioned, or on just an adjusted sort of pure number?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I mean I think our market share comes from our syndicated panel that essentially
measures market share at retail. So I think there's obviously a relationship between shipments and retail. But it really
comes out of a different system that we've invested a fair amount in to get an accurate read of the mainstream retail
outlets.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And do you have a sense of what – I guess if you cited the
adjusted shipment category number, do you know what the retail number for the category is that you look at for the
third quarter? Just for context of what the share gain was against?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I don't think we really look at it that way. I mean if you think about it when we look
at our shipments, we're shipping out to wholesale. And obviously when we read retail market share, there's a bit of
space between our shipments to wholesale and what happens at retail. So that is why we provide both the actual and
adjusted shipment numbers to give you perspective on that, as well as then going further downstream and providing
you with retail share figures that allow you to understand how we're doing in the overall retail market.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just looking back a little bit actually just for context, when
you look at your 2009 market share loss of about a percentage point or slightly more, do you know – do you have an
ability to estimate how much of that might have been related to your integration of UST as sort of a disruption? Or was
it in your view more related to economic pressures or trading down or other things like that?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I'll be honest with you. I'm a bit uncomfortable analyzing the 2009 numbers at this
stage. But certainly if you want to have some conversation about 2009, you can speak to the IR group.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Well or I guess maybe let me put it a different way. You have experience with integrations
of your own that obviously are a major effort. How much of a distraction do you feel like that could have been in that
particular timeframe I guess? Or just in terms of focus or managing through that?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I mean I think our experience in the UST integration was that given the size and
professionalism of our sales force, certainly there was some incremental work placed on the sales force when we took
over UST. But remembering back to that time I think it went pretty smoothly. So I don't have a recollection that there
were significant disruptions in the cigarette category related to that.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. No, that's helpful context. And then just last question on PMCC. Obviously the
finance assets is down pretty dramatically from where it would have been even just a couple years ago. Is it still kind of
your approach to do opportunistic sales? Or is there some degree of plateauing that the sales you think make the most
sense to make have probably been done? Or what's kind of the run rate looking ahead this quarter? The asset balance
there didn't change very much from 2Q. Is it leveled off? Or what should we expect looking ahead in that segment
there?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I mean I think as you know we're trying to wind that business down completely.
And so essentially looking at the cash flow impact and the profit impact of selling assets in any given year, our bias is
towards selling them if we can sell them for a reasonable financial outcome.
But we've been in that mode for quite some time. So I would say that we are probably reaching a period where we're
going to see a slowdown in some of those asset sales. Certainly that is what is driving the negative year-over-year
comparison at PMCC this year compared to last year was we had very good asset sales last year.

Now that said in the leasing business there is a sweet spot, at which it becomes more favorable to sell assets in the life
of the lease. And so in any given year I think we do expect to have some asset sales that could potentially occur as we
get closer to the end of some of those leases. So we're managing through that.
But I think the most important point was the one you made, which was the net finance receivable on that business has
come down tremendously. We're now down below $2 billion. And so we're well on our way to completely exiting that
business.

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: I have a follow-on question from earlier one asked a little differently. In terms of how you're
balancing your business in the short and long term. Marty, as you mentioned you're generating strong volume and
pricing. And then your Smokeable margins have expanded quite a bit.
So if you back out your other segment, which includes MarkTen, you would have reported double digit EPS growth in
the quarter. So I guess I'm trying to understand why you believe the e-cig or vapor category warrants the level of
spending right now. And how big this opportunity can truly be in the long-term? And essentially how you're balancing
this versus rewarding shareholders right now?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yes. Good question. Let me try to give you some context about how we think of that at
the strategic level. And I think you and I have discussed this previously, which is we've tried to maximize our core
business while we innovate for our future.
And we have tremendous core businesses. We have the leading positions. We have the leading brands. We have high
margins. They generate enormous amounts of cash, most of which we give back to the shareholder through the
dividend, periodic share repurchase. We keep those businesses relevant and growing by investing in them
appropriately. I think that's how to think about the core.
However we also know that consumers change and businesses change and markets change. And so you always have to
be looking ahead about what you need to be doing today to be ready for tomorrow. That's how we think about
innovation in e-vapor and other categories. For example heat not burn, which as you know we have the license from for
PMI.
As consumers evolve we want to have products for them. We want them to be premium. We want them to be branded.
And of course we aspire to have the good margins that we do in our tobacco businesses today.
The way to do that in our view is with discipline. You learn your way in. You do it wisely. And you do it over time.
And I think you can see that's the approach we're trying to take in e-vapor. So I hope that context may be helpful about
how we think about that.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Very much. I appreciate that. And then speaking of heat not burn, the iQOS platform is
being rolled out now in two countries by Philip Morris. And as you mentioned you have access to this. Could you
update us on the process? And have you filed for substantial [ph] equivalence (31:50), timeframe, where you're at with
this in terms of eventually rolling that out here in the U.S.?

<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, I'd refer you to the comments that PMI has made about this for further context.
But obviously you know the deal is we struck an arrangement with PMI where we will sell them our e-vapor products
per sale through their distribution network internationally. And we continue to work with them on that, and we're
excited about that.
And then on heat not burn we're cooperating with PMI as it goes through the process at the Food and Drug
Administration in pursuit of a reduced harm claim. You might expect that we would be working on ideas about how to
commercialize that project when it becomes successful.
These are longer term projects, but our strategy is to offer consumers alternatives for those who want them. And we're
very excited to be working with PMI on that. I think they would say and I would certainly say it's going quite well.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. And I just have one final quick question on MarkTen and the consumer behavior.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: How has this been? What are you seeing in terms of repeat purchases? We've seen maybe
some share losses on a sequential basis in Nielsen. So maybe you could address that.
And then I'd be curious to hear your robust product pipeline behind MarkTen. You mentioned that. So how soon would
you be able to roll out your next-generation product?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. So I'll start I guess by talking about shares. And it's just a word of caution in the
e-vapor category. I think if you look back over last three years, you've had at least five brands at one time or another
have claimed share leadership.
And what in fact you see is a lot of dynamism among the shares as consumers continue to try products. You've heard us
speak about this before. Consumers are continuing to shop for the product that they want in the e-vapor space. Brands
have sort of come and gone and up and down and it continues to evolve.
Our long-term aspiration is leadership in the category, which means we will offer consumers in this space superior
products. We will build brand equity, and we'll build share over time.
With respect to MarkTen we're very happy with the start that we have. We believe we have a very good product. It's
differentiated by its technology. But there's no denying that consumers are continuing to shop for our products and
others. We'll continue to roll products out as we have them. I'm obviously not going to tip my hand about what's
coming. But I can tell you that Nu Mark has a lot of great ideas, and we're working very hard on a whole range of
products to offer to consumers in this space.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: All right. Makes sense. Thank you so much, Marty.

<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Morning, guys.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Owen.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Thanks for taking my question. I was just hoping for a bit more commentary on price mix in
Smokeable. And I guess I'm really just playing devil's advocate on this one. Although strong in the quarter it was below
that of one of your competitors. I was just wondering if you were seeing any ongoing specific mix pressures, especially
as you continue to see strong share momentum with L&M? Thank you.

<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Okay. Thanks for your question. I wouldn't characterize that way. I think again when I
look at the Smokeable performance for the quarter and certainly for the year-to-date, we've got income up 9% and
margin growth and strong pricing realization and the volumes are below the estimated industry decline. Again we look
at this over time.
But when you look at the year-to-date for PM USA in the Smokeable segment, it's nothing short of an outstanding
performance, and we're very happy with it.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Just two quick questions if I could. I wanted to ask – you gave some data, I believe
it was at the back to school conference, about the vapor category. And you have a better kind of – better tracking
mechanism for that. So I'm just curious in relation to the cigarette category, have you seen any slowdown in vapor? Is
that in part what's driving better volumes in cigarettes? Or do you have some other explanation for what has been a
better category growth condition here in the quarter?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Again, Chris, if you look at it over time, we've got a model that we use that's a secular
decline rate of about 2% to 3%. And then you've got of course your pricing elasticities. And in our secular model
includes adult consumers trying other kinds of products, including vapor. So we don't see anything remarkable there to
call out.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then just one other question on MarkTen. And the way that product has
gone, at least where I've seen it, it's within your cigarette shelf set. Is that what you expect for the new products going
forward? [ph] I know you're always (36:47) be careful to talk about new products, but are you trying to fit those within
your existing shelf set? Are you looking for space on the back counter, on the counter at the convenience store? Just
curious how we should think about new products as they reach the shelves.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, that's an excellent question. I think that the merchandising of innovative products
into the traditional categories is going to have to be resolved over time. I think clearly in the short run what you're
trying to do is you're trying to get awareness of your product to the adult consumer at retail.
And because PM USA has space that it could provide to Nu Mark on appropriate terms, that's the approach we took. It
will depend I suppose on how large the categories get to be. What we would expect is for retailers to adjust their
merchandising approach and their scale with the size of the category. And we're working closely with retailers to try to
help them in thinking through that. I think that's the best way to think about it.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you for the time.

<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. So I have couple questions. Marty, first just to revisit Vivien's earlier question about
the economic health of the smoker, you echoed what others in the industry have talked about this quarter with cigarette
volumes – with the decline in cigarette volumes moderating from down 4% or 4.5% during the first half to down only
perhaps 3.5% or a bit less in the third quarter. And you commented that you have not seen a material improvement in
economic conditions or behavior among core smokers. So I'm just curious if it's not macro driven, what other factors
would have played the most meaningful role in this sequential improvement?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, I think there's two answers to it, Matt. One is actually when you look at the decline
rate that we're estimating for the quarter, it's spot in the middle of the range that we've been estimating for some time
now. So I don't think it represents a deviation from curve as much as it represents a data point best understood over
time. So I guess that's the first thing I'd say.
The second thing I'd say to be clear about the macro environment is that it simply is uneven. It clearly is improving at a
macro level for the reasons I called out. It's just that it's uneven over time. And it also appears to be somewhat uneven
in its distribution. And so the adult tobacco consumer is not participating in the recovery to the same degree in many
instances as is the general public.
So we'll have to see going forward. But I think that's honestly the answer, which is we're trying to be mindful of what
the macro environment is and in particular for our consumer set.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. But just to be clear you wouldn't necessarily attribute changes in cigarette
volumes to sequential changes through the year in cross category dynamics or retailer working capital dynamics?
Anything along those lines?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No, I don't think we would.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: And, Howard, just on SABMiller. Last quarter you addressed some of the speculation
there and how you might evaluate a cash transaction from the perspective of shareholders. Just to take the other side of
that hypothetical, I'm just curious how you would assess the potential impact or attractiveness of taking on a less than
20% stake in another publicly-traded company in an equity transaction, and whether you felt in that circumstance it
might be possible to justify the continuation of equity method accounting?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I think the answer to a detailed scenario is probably best answered in the moment
when the details are available.
I think our view, though, has been that we continue to view the SABMiller asset as an attractive asset that has
contributed strongly to our earnings growth and to cash flow through dividends. And at this point our view hasn't
changed, which is we think it's in the best interest of our shareholders to retain that asset.
But as always we're doing a lot of analysis. We're doing a lot of future scenario planning to make sure we're prepared
for whatever the future brings. And I think we're open minded, but we continue to view the asset as a positive
contributor to the business.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Understood. I had to give it a shot. And you answered it last quarter.
And then lastly just on the interest expense, I believe you – I think you exercised a make whole provision on one of
your outstanding bonds during the quarter. Should we expect to see some sequential favorability on interest expense?
And do you see additional refinancing opportunities going forward over the next six months to 12 months?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, we did call some bonds. It was about $300 million worth of UST debt. It was
actually the only debt we had that wasn't at the parent level. And so we thought to clean that up. Not only helped our

maturity towers but had some compliance and some operational benefits.
It will have some positive impact on interest in this quarter. It actually was the impact will really be felt in the fourth
quarter, and certainly we'll some have impact next year. But the scale of that was actually quite small compared to
some of the activity we've done in the past.
And I think as indicated by this transaction we're always looking at how to best manage our debt load. And I think
we're opportunistic going forward. But I have to say that I think the significant activity that's occurred over the last
couple of years is probably going to represent the biggest opportunity there.
