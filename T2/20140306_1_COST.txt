To begin with, our 12-week second quarter. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $1.05 a share. This compared to
last year's second quarter earnings reported at $1.24. As noted in this morning's release, our last year's earnings figure
was positively impacted by a $62 million or $0.14 per share income tax benefit. That was in connection with the
portion of the special cash dividend we paid in December of 2012 to the company 401(k) plan participants.
Several factors impacting our second quarter earnings beyond that. These included: lower sales and gross margins in
hardlines, most particularly during the four-week holiday period between Thanksgiving and Christmas; lower
year-over-year gross margins in fresh foods; the FX impact of weaker foreign exchange rates year-over-year when
reporting profits from our international operations. This represented, if you assumed, no change year-over-year in the
currency exchange rates, about $23 million pre-tax or a little over $0.03 a share. For example, this year in Q2 versus a
year ago, the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar is down 8% and Japan about 15%.
In addition, income tax rate, even after excluding that tax benefit I just mentioned, was still 1.5 percentage points
higher year-over-year in second quarter. Last year, in Q2, as I mentioned then, there were a couple of positive discrete
items that lowered last year's rate by about $10 million or $0.02 a share. As well, in both this year's and last year's
second fiscal quarter, there were a few other discrete items that in the aggregate represented a year-over-year negative
swing to our SG&A expenses by about 5 basis points or $0.02 a share.
So while earnings results for the first four weeks of Q2 were very weak, our earnings in subsequent eight weeks of the
second quarter showed improvement. In terms of sales for the quarter, total sales were up 6%, and on a comp basis, up
3%. For the quarter, our sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation as well, and a bigger impact by
weakening foreign currencies relative to the dollar year-over-year. That alone was about 200 basis points. Excluding
gas, the reported 4% U.S. comp in Q2 would have been plus 5%. And the reported flat international comp, assuming
flat year-over-year FX rates, would have been plus 7%, such that the total company reported, which we reported, again,
a 3% comp for the quarter excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 5%.
For the four-week month of February, which included the last two weeks of the fiscal second quarter, comps came in at
a plus 2%. This consisted of a plus 3% reported in the U.S., and a minus 1% internationally. Again, gas deflation and
FX had an impact such that the 3% reported U.S. comp increase for February would have been a plus 4%. And the
minus 1% international, excluding same FX exchange rates year-over-year, would have been plus 5%. And the total
company, the plus 2% that we reported, would have been a plus 4%.
I now mention, which I haven't in a quite a while, weather. It's been all over, particularly in the U.S. Snow, rain, just
crazy weather. We estimate that the weather impact to February sales results represented about a 1 percentage point hit
to the four-week reporting period.
In terms of new openings, after opening 13 new locations in the first quarter, as well as closing our Acapulco, Mexico,
location due to the hurricane damage, we opened three new locations in the second quarter; two in the U.S., one each in
Illinois and Texas, and one also in Ontario, Canada. All told, that puts our fiscal 2014 openings through the second
quarter at 16 new locations. And we now operate 649 locations around the world. And between now and the end of
fiscal 2014, we expect to open an additional 14 locations, three in the third quarter and 11 in the fourth quarter. These
14, which again, this will be before fiscal year-end on August 31st, six were planned for the U.S., two additional
locations in each of Japan and Korea, and one each in Canada, U.K., Australia; and, of course, our first location
opening in Spain in Seville this spring, such that we'd expect to end the year with 30 new openings for the year.
This morning, I'll review with you, of course, our membership trends and renewal rates, our e-commerce activity and,
of course, additional discussion about margins and SG&A.
To start off, again, sales; total sales were up to $25.76 billion, up 6% year-over-year and comps, again, was a reported
3% – a plus 3%, and a plus 5% excluding gas and FX. In terms of the plus 3% reported comp sales, the average
transaction was minus 1% for the quarter on a reported basis; again, FX is an impact to that as well. It would have been
a little over 1% plus on a flat currency year-over-year. And average frequency was a little over 4%. For the three recent
months, frequency was just under 4%, just under 5%, and just under 3% for December, January and February. And,
year-to-date, shopping frequency continues to be in the 4.25% range.

In terms of sales by geographic region, both for the 12-week quarter and the four weeks of February, geographically,
Southeast, Midwest and San Diego regions were strongest. Internationally, as well, both for the quarter and the four
weeks of February, the strongest regions in local currencies were Mexico and Canada. For the second quarter, in terms
of merchandise categories within food and sundries, overall, in the low-single-digits. For hardlines, overall, in the
mid-single-digits. Within that, we are asked about consumer electronics that were slightly positive for the quarter
overall. Within the mid-single-digit comp range for softlines, and then in fresh foods up in the mid- to
high-single-digits, overall, with produce being strongest.
For February, again, the traffic was up just under 3% shopping frequency. And, again, the reported average transaction
was down about a little over 1%, but again, big impact from gas and FX. In fact, just during the month of February,
year-over-year, the average sale price for gasoline was down about 10% for the month, per gallon. From a
merchandising category standpoint, food and sundries, overall, was in the low-single-digit range. Hardlines, overall,
came in slightly negative with electronics being down in the mid-single-digit range. Softlines was the strongest area in
the mid- to high- single-digit-range. And finally, fresh foods, mid-single-digit range overall. And, again, produce being
particularly strong.
In terms of moving down the income statement, in terms of membership fees, $550 million, up 4% or $22 million from
a year earlier, $528 million. Again, you've got the impact of FX. If we assumed flat year-over-year FX, that reported
$550 million membership fee number would have been $563 million or up 7% year-over-year. In terms of membership,
our renewal rates continue at record levels and we continue to see increasing penetration of the Executive Membership.
New membership signups in the second quarter, company-wide, were up 13% year-over-year; again, mostly reflective
of very strong signups at some of our international openings including recent new openings in Japan and Australia. In
terms of number of members: Gold Star, we ended the first quarter three-month, 12 weeks ago at 29.6 million. At Q2
end, it was 30.1 million. Business Primary, rounded both at Q1 end and Q2 end at 6.7 million. Business Add-on at 3.5
million each. So all told, 39.8 million at Q1 end, up to 40.3 million at Q2 end, and including the additional card, 72.5
million at Q1 end. That was up about 900,000 to 73.4 million at Q2 end.
Also, at second quarter end, paid Executive Memberships were just over 14 million, an increase of almost 200,000
since Q1 end or about 16,000 a week in the quarter. And, again, Executive Members are roughly 35% of sales (sic)
[members] and a little over two-thirds of our sales – 35% of our membership base, a little over two-thirds of our sales.
And in terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, it continue to tweak up a little bit. At Q1 end, business memberships
renewal rates were 94.1%. At Q2 end, it was 94.3%. Gold Star, 89.3% went to 89.6%. So all told, 90.2% up to 90.4%.
And, of course, that's U.S. and Canada are 80% of our company and our most mature markets. Worldwide, including
all the new countries, over the last several years, 86.5% went to 86.8%. So again, continuing good trends in
membership renewal rates.
Going down to the gross margin line, we were down year-over-year 6 basis points in the quarter from a 10.59% down
to a 10.53%. Again, I always do ask you to jot down the following four columns and six line items to give you a little
explanation of components of margin.
The first two columns would be the Q1 2014 reported and Q1 2014 excluding gas deflation. Columns three and four
would be Q2 reported. And column four would be without gas deflation Q2. Going across, merchandise core, reported
in Q1 was up 12 basis points year-over-year but excluding gas deflation was up 3 basis points. Going again continuing
across, reported in Q2 was plus 1 basis point and without gas deflation minus 1 basis point. Ancillary plus 5 basis
points and plus 2 basis points reported and without gas in Q1. And zero and zero in columns three and four. 2%
Reward, minus 3 basis points and minus 2 basis points, and then in the second quarter, minus 1 basis point and minus 1
basis point. LIFO, minus 1 basis point and minus 1 basis point, and in the second quarter, minus 6 basis points and
minus 6 basis points.
Other, which I didn't need to add here, was zeros across the columns there. And all told, in total, in Q1 2014, we
reported year-over-year gross margin up 13 basis points but taking out the effective gas deflation, it was up 2 basis
points. Again, today, we reported plus 6 basis points – I'm sorry minus 6 basis points in lower margins year-over-year

in the second quarter. Without gas deflation, it would have been minus 8 basis points. So, as you can see, again, minus
6 basis points, minus 8 basis points without gas deflation, and our core was essentially flat, plus 1 basis point, minus 1
basis point, with and without gas deflation. For the second quarter year-over-year, food and sundries and softline gross
margins were up in the second quarter year-over-year in the 5 basis point to 20 basis point range. While hardlines and
fresh foods margins were lower year-over-year in the minus 30 basis points to minus 50 basis points range.
Ancillary business gross margins, percentages were essentially flat year-over-year but again you've got the sales impact
of 10% year-over-year lower, the gallonage comp – gallonage in terms of price of gas. The impact of the increasing
Executive Membership, again, 1 basis point hit just meaning more dollars are going to the Rewards-based Executive
Membership program.
In terms of LIFO, in the second quarter, we recorded a $5 million pre-tax charge this year in the quarter. That compares
to a $9 million pre-tax credit last year. So, year-over-year, a $14 million or $0.02 a share swing or now as the six basis
points year-over-year negative. As I said, when there's either a LIFO credit or a LIFO charge or this type of swing,
positive or negative, the fact is, is we really look at that as part of our core given that they work in tandem.
Moving down to reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentages Q2-over-Q2 were higher, or worse by 13 basis points,
coming in at 9.83% as a percent of sales compared to 9.70% last year. The minus 13 basis points translates to minus 10
basis points ex gas deflation and, again, we'll put down – ask you to put down the four columns and, in this case, five
line items. Again, Q1 – for two columns, Q1, both reported and ex gas deflation, and then Q2, reported an ex gas
deflation. Going across, core operations was a minus nine basis point in Q1 reported – I mean, higher by nine point
points, zero basis points without gas deflation, in Q2 was a minus 12 basis points and a minus nine basis points. Central
in Q1 was a minus three basis points and a minus two basis points, both zero basis point and zero basis point in Q2.
RSUs, or stock compensation, minus five basis points and minus five basis points in Q1, and minus one basis point and
minus one basis point in Q2. Quarterly adjustments were zeros across the board and then total was a minus 17 basis
points year-over-year higher SG&A in Q1 reported. But again, ex gas deflation was a minus seven basis points and in
Q2 reported minus 13 basis points comes to minus 10 basis points that I just mentioned.
In terms of these SG&A figures, the core operations, again, was at minus 12 basis points but minus nine basis points ex
gas deflation. Within core, our payroll as a percent of sales was higher year-over-year by two basis points. Payroll
benefits and workers' comp combined hit SG&A by about 1 basis point. And utilities, of course, a lot of cold weather,
was higher by two basis points.
Again, as I mentioned early, in both this year's and last year's second fiscal quarter, we had a few discrete items that in
the aggregate represented a year-over-year swing in our SG&A expense by five basis points or $14 million or $0.02 a
share. That generally is the luck of the draw, sometimes that helps us, sometimes that hurts us, but it was a net negative
year-over-year swing. And Central was flat year-over-year, notwithstanding ongoing IT monetization costs which will
continue, which represented about a three basis point higher year-over-year hit to SG&A.
Next on the income statement line is preopening. Last year, it was $6 million; it's up $2 million to $8 million this year.
Even though last year we had five openings and this year we had three, but some of that's the timing of openings,
preopening impacts several months. A big chunk of it also is the more significant preopening expense related to our
upcoming opening in Spain as we essentially are opening in a new country.
All told, operating income in the second quarter came in at $724 million year-over-year, down 2% from last year's $738
million. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher year-over-year by $1 million, coming in
at $26 million this year versus $25 million last year. Virtually all of that is interest expense related to not only the $1.1
billion fixed rate 5.6% interest debt that we have that will mature in March of 2017, but also the $3.5 billion debt that
we issued last December which has a weighted average in the low 1% range.
Interest income and other was higher year-over-year by $4 million in the quarter, coming in at $30 million this year
versus $26 million last year. Actual interest income was about half of that $4 million increase, $2 million higher
year-over-year, and the other component was a $2 million swing, $5 million plus last year versus $3 million plus this
year, so that's $2 million better year-over-year.

Overall, pre-tax income was down 1.6% or $11 million in the second quarter, down from $739 million to $728 million
this year. Our tax rate for the quarter came in at 35.0%. Last year, it was 25.1%. And, as discussed earlier, a big chunk
of that was the income tax benefit from that $62 million benefit in conjunction with a special cash dividend. Excluding
that one-time benefit, our tax rate last year in Q2, that 25.1%, would have been a 33.5%, still lower when compared to
this year's 35.0%. Again, as I mentioned in last year's second quarter conference call, there were a couple of positive
discrete items that went our way in Q2 last year, again, to the tune of about $10 million. After-tax benefits at the tax
line were $0.02 a share last year that we didn't have the benefit of this year.
Overall, reported net income of $547 million last year in Q2, excluding that $62 million income tax benefit, it would
have been $485 million, and that compares to our $463 million this year, down a little bit.
Next, in terms of balance sheet, which is included in this morning's press release, I will note a couple of balance sheet
items. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $240 million and $471 million year-to-date. Accounts
payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis year-over-year is down from 98% to 93%, although some
amount of that in the payables calculation is non-merchandise payables, such as, most importantly, construction
payables. So, looking at merchandise payables as a percent of inventories, the 87% last year would have been 83%.
Average inventory per warehouse is up about 4%, about $500,000 from $12.2 million to $12.7 million. This increase
was pretty much spread over all the departments, nothing that really stood out. Overall, our inventories are in good
shape. As well, our mid-year physical inventories, which we do at the end of the second quarter, were essentially tied
with last year's best-ever results in terms of low shrinkage results. So I think, in our view, a good indication of the
inventories being managed pretty well.
In terms of capital expenditures, in the first quarter of 2014, we had spent $574 million. In the quarter just ended, we
spent an additional $447 million. So all told, just a little over $1 billion year-to-date. Total CapEx for fiscal 2014, we
would expect to be approximately $2.3 billion, and I think it's a little up from what I mentioned a quarter ago, reflect up
from $2.1 billion last year and again reflecting a little ramp-up in openings.
In terms of e-commerce operations, we are in four countries: U.S., Canada, U.K., and most recently a few months ago
we entered – e-commerce – we began e-commerce operations in Mexico. For the second quarter, sales and profits were
up over last year. While we don't share the profit stuff, specifically, the sales were up 20%. In fact, a little higher in
local currencies given Canada, about 20% year-over-year
Over the past one, one-and-a-half years, as you know, we've re-platformed the site. We've added some overlaps. We've
combined some e-commerce merchandise efforts with our in-line efforts. We've added a few categories to e-commerce,
most recently apparel and some health and beauty aids. We've improved the timing of shipments by shipping out of
three depots instead of one. We're currently testing – not that it's specifically related to our e-commerce operations, but
we're testing, in the Bay Area, one of several retailers with the Google Express. And we're also testing a few other
things that we'll let you know more about as we do it.
Next on discussion is expansion. Again, we opened 13 in Q1. We had that close in Acapulco with the hurricane, so a
net of 12. In Q2, three; in Q3, three; in Q4, 11. So, 30 openings less the Acapulco closing so far. That will put us a net
increase for the year of 29 which would be about a 4.5% square footage growth – 4.5% to 5%. New locations by
country for the 30 openings: 17 in the U.S., three in Canada, one in the U.K., two each in Korea and Japan, three in
Australia, and one each in Mexico and Spain.
As of second quarter end, square footage stood at 93,098,000 square feet. In terms of dividends, our current quarterly
dividend stands at $0.31 a share, this $1.24 a share annualized dividend represents a total cost to the company of about
$540 million.
Lastly, our third quarter scheduled earnings release date will be Thursday, May 29. That will be for the 12-week quarter
ending on May 11th. Before I turn it back to Jody, one comment about Q3 I do want to make. Last year, in Q3, we had
mentioned that there was a litigation settlement that benefited last year's third quarter gross margin results by about $17
million pre-tax or about $0.025 a share and so we'll be up against that comparison of course.

Let me just say that, overall, hopefully I've helped you understand a little bit about the factors impacting our results this
fiscal quarter, how the earnings performance trended positively during the quarter from a very tough first four-week
period, and the continuing strength in sales, comps, shopping frequency and the like.
With that, Jody, I'll turn it back over to you.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Binder from Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi. Good morning, Richard. I was wondering if you could just discuss a little bit of your
current thoughts on buyback. And then separate question, any thoughts on international membership fees and whether
or not they due for a hike or not?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, in terms of buyback, again, while we let you guys know once a quarter when we
have our quarterly earnings announcement, our intention is to start buying back some stock this quarter. We continue to
look at it but I think it's a good statement to say that we will be buying something this quarter. As it relates to
international, we're always looking at membership fees. Given that we – you know us, we tend to be long-term focused
and when things are very strong over there, we want to keep pushing for even more memberships. We have the added
benefit in most countries of being the only club operator and we'll continue to use that benefit to look at it but we're not
in any hurry to do that.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: And then just lastly on the expense leverage or expense deleverage in the quarter, I mean
obviously FX is hurting you a little bit but where do you think sort of the level is this year for expense leverage in terms
of the comp where you need to be on a reported basis? Is it still closer to 5%?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I mean, I think – I think so, recognizing nothing's perfect. I mean you take those
things that I pointed out and that in the aggregate were 5 basis points. I mean, and not trying to be cute here but there's
always those things that add up or offset each other and this quarter year-over-year they didn't. That's 5 bps of it. The
other thing is, is the biggest impact to our numbers were in those first four weeks. It's a combination of things. I think
probably we budgeted a little aggressively. Our numbers were still not bad for December for that four-week period but
there was four, five less Christmas shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas just based on how
Thanksgiving falls – that fell this year.
The other thing is, is some of the – FX had a little less to do with it because that affects all the line items both the sales
and the margin dollars. But I think some of it also is, is while sales overall were satisfactory, they were a little less than
satisfactory in things like certain non-food seasonal categories and the like and a little stronger in fresh foods. So again,
as we mentioned, fresh foods margins were down more and then had the double whammy in some of the non-food
categories. So on this level of sales we have now, those types of things make a big difference. And again, I think
overall, our margins were a little lower than we had planned but some of it we're very conscious of as you know in
some of the fresh foods areas.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Right.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And get back to the leverage question, yes, I think a 4% to 5% should be able to do it but
we had a few anomalies this quarter as well.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay, thanks.

<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So, Richard, I want to drill down a little bit on the fresh food category. That margin
pressure, is that – how broad-based is that or is that a handful of items? And what could you call out among items? And
then is that more you making proactive investments or delaying price pass-through?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's more – almost all us. I want to say, it's – aggressively, it is all us. And in terms of
where it is, as you might expect, it's particularly in the proteins. We talked about chickens before. We've held the price
on that chicken and those 65 million or 70 million rotisserie chickens are just part of the chicken. I mean it's also frozen
and fresh. And we are seeing a little relief in some of the pricing there, and in some of the costing. And that's just
starting. I think it's starting a little later than we anticipated six months ago but we should see a little bit of relief there.
Really beyond that, I don't hear – meat's very competitive. And beef's at an all-time high in some categories but – and
that's raining on everybody. Beyond that, sometimes in produce we have a little issue. Even though produce was the
strongest, it depends when it hits and with some of the shortages that's impacted us a little bit. But, overall, I'd say,
meat, pork and poultry is the biggest culprit there and it's mostly us.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: And as a follow up to that, when you look at having some more consistent markups than
others, how do you guys think about strategically because of your strength in perishables? We can or should operate
with a somewhat lower margin because we get that traffic, right, which then feeds into all of the higher ticket non-foods
that you might sell? Is that holistic of an approach or not really?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, that's part of the approach. But again, without trying to be too granular here, clearly,
the comment about how the impact of margins and P&L, of course, in the first four weeks versus the subsequent eight
weeks, that was dramatic. And part of that, again, was seasonal markdowns, both being aggressive and proactive, and
then a little less sales in some areas. While TVs, overall, I think, in the quarter were good, you've got other areas.
Cameras, industry-wise, are down quite a bit as you might expect with everybody using smartphones, laptops and
desktops as well. So there's some of that pressure.
And then I really think that we probably budgeted a little off given the five days fewer – five fewer days. But at the end
of the day, it's hard to know what it is, other than I can tell you is a heck of a lot more of it was in those first four
weeks. And so trend-wise, that's good. But that doesn't tell you anything about the upcoming quarter, other than what
we know that February was a little impacted by weather. So we're starting off the quarter in those first two weeks, the
last two weeks of February, the first two weeks of Q3, we're just thrilled.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: And then lastly, would you say when you look at either gross margin or fresh food or
some of the individual categories, I imagine there is a fair bit of difference country to country, or not, and is there more
pressure outside the U.S. or less?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'd say overall there's a lot less pressure outside the U.S. I mean the U.S. is clearly the most
competitive with regard to the club business.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Yeah.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: As well as competitive with, supermarkets are probably the most competitive in the U.S.
compared to major chains everywhere. So certainly that's the case. But, U.S. is a little over 70% of our company.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom from Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Hey, good morning, Richard. Just to follow up on that last question, when you think about
the progression of your margin performance and it getting better throughout the quarter, the hardline margins getting
better I guess intuitively makes sense as you move away from the holiday markdowns. But I was wondering if you

could discuss, I guess, if that's the case? And then, two, was the same true for fresh foods? Did margins in that category
also improve as you progressed throughout 2Q?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I believe they did a little bit. But again, we're all – as you know, we're all about being
competitive out there and being proactive in that – but we're also want to make money, and we want to hopefully show
some improving margins. But we're going to do what's right each day on pricing irrespective of how it's going to
impact margins that day. But overall, clearly we looked at the first four weeks, and we took some actions. I'm not going
to tell you where. But it's shown some relative improvement. And that we feel good about.
But again, this quarter is a new quarter, and other than sales starting off a little weaker, we'll see where it goes. And a
lot of that I think is weather. I mean we all got crammed in the Midwest and the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic. The
rain last week, I'm not trying to make excuses but it's been unbelievable. Japan, we had several locations actually
closed for a few days with the snow, the worst snow they've ever had. So, lots of little things. And I'll try to not remind
you next year when it shows a little better compared to those things.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: All right. And just as a follow up to Dan's question earlier. When you sit down with the
board every month and every quarter, I guess, what exactly is the pushback to unleashing your balance sheet and
getting more aggressive? And what's the thought process currently amongst the board?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think it's a topic that we always talk about. I don't think there's a pushback either
way. As you know, we did a little over $3 billion payout to the shareholders via the special dividend last year, as the
stock was ever-increasingly strong. As I noted in a couple of the analysts' before the market open, comments, we've
been a little under consensus expectations, although that's not our direction. And, clearly, Q2 was a larger gap there. So,
again, I think my comment that we plan to buy some this quarter is a step in that direction. I don't want to be coy or
cute about it, but we'll let you know in a quarter. But we will be buying some and we'll go from there. There's – the
board is – as you know, we've never looked at it as let's do this because it will be a positive message to the market. But
long-term, I think the board, as I am, are positive about our company and certainly it is accretive, but, at the same
token, we try to be judicious about it. And perhaps we've been a little conservative, but we also had the $3 billion
dividend that we did last December that helped us be a little conservative. And I think you'll see that change some.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Okay, good. And then just, this is my last question and I'll pass it on. On the price
investments and I know you guys have been doing it religiously for as long as I can remember. I'm wondering with
some of the new technologies you're putting in place, are you studying it a little bit more closely? Do you feel like the
elasticity is there to justify the increase in price investments by you guys?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We would never look at it that way. We're out there – I think – again, getting back to the
simple [ph] turkey (34:40) example. It's not unlike the hot dog example of years gone by. When prices went up, we just
saw that as the strength of that and the growth and the number of chickens we're selling, that gets people in. We don't
study it and, say, what if we took it to $5.49 and we have this many fewer shops or whatever, we know it's the right
thing to do. And again, I think Q4 – I mean, Q2, and that first four-week period, it exacerbates everything because you
had all those things, some weaker sales in some bigger ticket items, some margins on top of the ongoing fresh foods
margins. And I'm very emphatic about the fact that our fresh foods margins are us, our pricing, and mostly some
improvement there but we'll do it when we feel good about it.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Okay, thanks a lot.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, on IT, I think now it's been about six quarters that I've mentioned it and it's probably
on average [indiscernible] (36:14) I don't have the number in front of me, about a 4 basis point. And so, quarters 5 and
6 in this process are 4 bps on top of 4 bps, and 3 bps on top of 5 bps or whatever. So, and that will probably continue
for another half dozen quarters. It's a five or so year effort with at least a three-year buildup in those types of things.
There will be some quarters on the year-over-year basis when it's a couple of basis points. And there'll be some when
it's 4 basis points or 5 basis points, depending on when systems are being put.
But we have a lot going on. We're excited about – the user groups are excited about some of the things they're seeing.
We're going to just start implementing some of the components of it, starting in early summer to late summer. And
again, I'm not going to try to be cute or coy here, it will take some time but we've got a lot going on. And again, part of
that is the fact for 25 years we've prided ourselves with having very simple systems and they're still simple probably
relative to others. For us, it's an entire effort. And, again, so far so good, but we're a year and a half into it and so that's
going to still hit us for at least another year, maybe a little longer on that line.
Beyond that, in terms of SG&A, something – it's just how the numbers work in terms of the fact that you've got FX, a
lower weighted average of countries where some of the payroll as a percent of sales in those respective countries and
certainly the healthcare as a percent of sales in those countries is a little lower weighted average when you've got the
Canada rate down 8% year-over-year, the Canada exchange rate. You've got Japan in Q2 down 15% with Japan yen. In
Australia, it's down 14.5% year-over-year in the same quarter. So, all those things add a little insult to injury. The
underlying numbers, they were a little worse in terms of expense percentages but big chunks of this were the things that
I mentioned.
And, again, there's a lots of little things and they all seem to hit at the same time. On top of the fact that in the quarter
where you get a lot of leverage, in the four-week period where you get a lot of leverage, was a little weaker than
planned.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Understood. And then if you can just comment on kind of inflation, deflation, what you're
seeing across various categories, just how we should think about LIFO, if you think that will still be a factor in 3Q, like
we saw here in the second quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, if I look at the – compared to year-end, just our entire LIFO pool, at mid-year it's up
about 0.25%, so just light cost of all items. There was a $100 item that we paid for – $100 for it, at September 1st, if
you will. At February 16th, we were paying on average $100.25. As you'd expect, there're some deflationary pools like
computers and what have you. You've got probably the most inflation in food and sundries, a little over 1%. You've got
a shade of gas inflation, although that's ticking down right now a little bit. So it doesn't seem, overall, there doesn't
seem to be a lot of inflation, but on a $4-billion-plus LIFO – and LIFO is a U.S. concept only – so on a $4-billion-plus,
probably $5 billion LIFO pool, 1% would be $50 million and 0.25% would be $12.5 million. I don't think it's going be
a lot and I don't have in front of me last year's LIFO numbers for Q3 and Q4. I thought I did [ph] right there (39:50).
Not that this tells you anything but in Q3 and Q4 [indiscernible] (39:57). Last year, in Q3 and Q4, LIFO was a credit, a
benefit of about $8 million, $7.5 million, $8 million in each of Qs, three and four. So if it is a little inflationary, we'll
see that a similar kind of swing that we saw in Q2, but we'll wait and see. Mind you, when there's a LIFO charge,
there's probably a little that – again, I look at the combination of that with a quarter two because they tend to work – not
always, but in tandem, one opposing the other, but not a lot of inflation.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: That's helpful. Thank you.

comps?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That is – I don't know, and I'm not even a student of some of this foreign exchange stuff.
But when you see, as an example, in Japan, first quarter year-over-year was down 20%, second quarter year-over-year
was down 15% for us in terms of the Japanese yen, so there's been a lot of weakening. At some point, it's going to
bounce back a little bit but I can't tell you when. Canada has been awfully strong for many years and it's now subsiding
a little bit. But who knows?
And then add to that the craziness in the world events that impact these numbers. Usually when there's issues going on,
world issues going on, the dollar strengthens, and I think that's a little bit of what's happening now. But also,
particularly in the case of Canada, I remember 20 years ago when the Canadian dollar was C$0.65 on the U.S. dollar
and it had actually gotten above $1.00 on the U.S. dollar and it's come down a little bit so kind of bounced off of that
peak. But I can't tell you when that's going to be.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Okay. And then just as a follow up, the ancillary business, the margins in that
business have been a positive for quite some time and it looks like, if I got the numbers right, it was flat this quarter.
What piece of the business is changing? And is there anything you could say about the outlook?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: A lot of it has to do with the gas deflation, just the weighted average of that chunk. Mind
you, gasoline sales as a percent of our company total sales is 11% or 12%, and so it's a huge chunk and when you've
got gas deflation, that alone – and gas, needless to say, our reported gross margin is in the whatever 10.5% plus range,
10% to 11% range, within that number, gas is in the 1% to 5% range every quarter. So that weighted average coming
down has an impact on that number. So you've got to look at it both ways. Overall, ancillary businesses were fine. Our
pharmacy business continues strong. Our hearing aid business although smaller is very strong. One-hour photo, as
you'd expect, continues to be a little weaker because nobody takes as many pictures but we've been a little creative over
there to try to do a few other things. But it's still very profitable but not as profitable as it used to be. So you add it all
up, gas deflation was probably the biggest reason.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Okay, perfect. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller from William Blair.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hey. Good morning, Richard. You gave us some additional detail this quarter on the four-week
versus the eight-week and I want to make sure we've got the right impression from this. Given you said that the
margins, if I heard this right, on hardlines and fresh foods being down 30 basis points to 50 basis points, does that mean
in the remaining eight weeks of the quarter you would have actually had gross margins overall? And is it a fair
impression that without those first four weeks your earnings are closer to the double-digit type growth range?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It was – in the first four weeks – well, one of the things we talked about in the press release
was is, those hardline categories, that was more impactful in the first four weeks whereas fresh foods is more, again, us
and continuing through the quarter. But the 30 basis points to 50 basis points range for those types of categories that
we're down year-over-year was for the entire quarter. I don't have the detail by period here but, directionally, I would
think given the first four weeks was worse, it clearly showed some improvement.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: All right. Has Costco done market research looking at the number of your members that also
have an Amazon Prime membership? And do your merchants have any sense for how much this might be impacting
spending at Costco? But do you think that might have been a bigger factor in the holidays with gift giving or do you
think it's not a material change?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Actually, I think some of you guys out there do more surveying of that than we do.
Honestly, I've read some research out there that talk about the overlap. There is overlap. My guess is, clearly, in areas
like the books and CDs that changed business over the last many years. TVs frankly were not bad overall. And

particularly if you add our e-commerce to our in-line, we're up a shade for the quarter. I can't tell you what happened in
the four weeks of February because they were, what we call, majors or electronics was down in the mid-single-digits
year-over-year, but, for overall, we probably fared better than most in-line, and all that stuff takes a way a little bit.
We're looking at ways to get as we have now for a while, to get younger people in here as well. We recognize that. And
we'll continue to do that. But, I know the answer is no, there's not a lot of discernible concern at this point in that.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Okay, thanks, Richard.

Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll start by just jumping off from the last question about
trying to get younger people into the warehouses. Can you talk a little bit about what it is you have done or would
consider doing to make that happen? What tools do you have?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first and foremost, we're not going to do anything rash but we're also not going to
have our head in the sand here. I mean one of the things, the test as an example with Google among several retailers but
in the Bay Area, has been interesting. I'm not going to, again, talk about any detail yet. We've done a few things with
some of the social media things out there. One of the impacts which is, what we do, is the rise in organic. It's a big
business. It's growing fast. We can actually show a better savings on those bigger ticket price point items and we've
seen that time and again, whether it's organic ground beef or those giant packs of kale or you name it, and in milk. I
mean, we're doing huge business in that. That I think also is driving in some younger people.
Some of the – one of the first systems go in our modernization effort is a new membership system which we will start
rolling out in the U.S. I believe June, July. And again, there will be a lot more bells and whistles. But, as you know, our
systems have been pretty basic and primitive. And we're not going to go crazy overnight on it, but we're doing a few
things. And it works, and we'll keep doing some of those things. So that's what I can tell you at this point.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay, thank you. And then I just have a sort of bigger picture question. It's obvious that it's
your philosophy to provide very great value, especially in fresh foods, to your customers and you'll absorb some
inflation. But what do you do? I mean everything I've seen – meat has been inflationary for a while, especially beef. Do
you have to sit down and think about your strategy if it looks like there are items that are just going to be inflationary
for the long-term?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, part of the answer is no. We do what we do. And part of it, though, is we also
recognize that we need to – our goal is just to maximize shareholder value. And ultimately that comes into long-term
driving earnings. And, but we're not going to necessarily do something in the short-term or in a given quarter to do that.
Again, looking at Q2, it was a combination. We – I think I probably said six or nine months ago using the simple
chicken example, that there seemed to be in the few months looking forward six to nine months ago, that poultry
pricing costing was going to improve, which would improve our margins because we're not lowering the price, we've
just not raised it prior to that.
That's finally starting to happen. So those are the kinds of things that we'll do. Strategically, at the end of the day, we've
got to show improvement in bottom line. Ultimately, it's not going to come from 10% and 15% comps for a company.
We're going to have good comps but at the levels that we have, and assuming there's still going to be better than others,
it's still going to require some margin over time. And we look at that. But we're not terribly concerned about how it
impacts the given quarter. And so, organic helps.
The fact of the matter is, is I think I mentioned this as an example and one of the things that, again, talks about the
younger member as well, what we found is when we tried fresh organic ground beef, I think in the first year, we did
$25-million-plus in an item or two. This is at a higher price point, and a greater savings, and a fair margin for us, a
better margin for us relative to a more competitive regular ground beef. The cool thing was is that 80% of those sales
were members that had not bought ground beef with us before. They love Costco, but they are organic. On average, I

would say they tend to be little younger. That's my guess. And so those are the kinds of things that I think are going to
help us a little, too. The fact that increasing penetration of our company is overseas, over time, notwithstanding the
weak exchange rates this quarter. We generally tend to have a little higher margin overseas where you don't have, even
in the U.S. when you don't have a direct competitor in the market a mile away or less, you're going to have a little better
margin. And so all those things I think will – should impact us positively. And, but we're not going to change what we
do in terms of occasionally identifying those key items that we're just not going to budge on.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. And then – thank you for that, a one final question, which is kind of related. But you
obviously felt softness in some hardline categories; electronics has been bad for a while. Do you think at all you have to
rethink how you, the products that you're offering, because of that? Is there something else that you would be more
aggressive on? Would you take space away? How are you thinking about that longer term?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, as you know, electronics is what greets you when you walk into a Costco. Certainly,
the online is part of that. We do a strong business online. Part of it is, is because they're bigger, not only bigger ticket
but bulkier, physical bulky items. We have a White Glove alternative installation as well. And so that business is
growing. But getting people in the door at Costco, we sell a heck of a lot of TVs as well that way. But again, you have a
few unusual things happening right now. Cameras, I understand cameras are down 30%-plus in the industry. We're not
that different. In fact, we've got a lot – that was a very successful, and still a big volume business, but that's been weak
year-over-year in a bigger way for the first time. Desktops and laptops, we're starting to get some traction on pads, on
tablets of late, but I think that's a business and we – I don't think we're necessarily rethinking allocation of space if
anything, it's still a strong area for us but we got hammered a little bit over that Christmas selling season.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Again, a lot of it wasn't TVs, it was some of those other items.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Good morning, Richard.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Hi.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Hey. Two follow-up questions. The first, just on the gas deflation that you're now starting to
see, can you remind us, historically, does it impact your traffic trends as gas in general, if it does get very deflationary
and come down a lot, do you have to find other ways to keep drive that traffic comp?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Interestingly, when prices are coming down we actually, historically, save the member a
little more because we turn it so fast and so we're buying every day, if you will, and the guy down the street's buying it
every six or eight days or nine days. And so when it's going up, it's costing us a little more and we're competitive –
we're still the lowest price, hopefully, but there's a little less savings. There's a little less news about it out there and so I
think, overall, on a macro basis, when prices are coming down, even though we're saving the customer a little more, it's
less newsworthy, the fact it's not on the nightly news, and so there's probably a little less positive there. But given how
big we are in that business now, it's not as impactful either way.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Got you. And just a different question, could you remind us, with your international
business, how you're thinking about new markets? I think France you've mentioned before. Any update on timing of
when you could open a new country?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, Spain is April or May? May. And France is hopefully about a year ahead. And
beyond that, we haven't disclosed anything. In terms of how, there's generally the – I mean the three likely areas in no
order is other parts of Europe, South America and China, and we haven't really stated beyond France and Spain what

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Stephen V. Tanal>: Thanks a lot. This is Steve Tanal on for Matt Fassler. Just a quick one on gross margins. It
sounds like much of the year-on-year decrease was sort of intentional or through price investments, if you will, and we
just wondered how to think about that going forward. In the next few quarters, at a minimum, do you think the trend's
likely to sort of stay this way? Or how are you guys thinking about that near-term?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, let me correct – maybe I, with all the different numbers going around here
– in terms of Q2, fresh was intentional. The rest of it was not intentional. And some of it is promotional, and some of it
is we do what we do to have clean inventories, took some extra seasonal markdowns in some areas, including a little bit
of electronics and some of it – so, some of it was that. So in terms of the trends going forward, again, I've alluded to the
fact that we're starting to see a little better costing on the poultry side. Meat continues to be competitive and rising. And
then beyond that, I can't tell you a whole lot.
<Q - Stephen V. Tanal>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: But a big chunk – again, produce – meat, not produce, fresh foods was our proactive
aggressiveness, the rest of it is doing what we do and responding to competition and responding to weak sales being a
little weaker and getting rid of stuff.
<Q - Stephen V. Tanal>: Understood. That's very helpful, actually. And then just on the membership fees, we seem to
underestimate the impact of FX there, but it also does seem like, if I think about FX in the overall comp, you guys
talked about sort of a two percentage point drag; it looks like it was more like three percentage points on member fees.
Is there anything you could sort of help us as we think about the split there, international versus U.S. and how to get
that right going forward?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's – I think the biggest impact FX-wise was in Canada which was 10%, 12% of our
company. And I think a strong penetration of Executive Memberships, which is the higher fee. So those things
probably pushed it a little bit.
<Q - Stephen V. Tanal>: Got it.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: In terms of guessing in the future, your guess is as good as mine.
<Q - Stephen V. Tanal>: Understood, understood. And just to confirm, there were no buybacks in the second quarter,
correct? And you guys are intending to buy back in the third quarter.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Correct.
<Q - Stephen V. Tanal>: All right. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Nomura.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Good morning, Richard. I've just got two questions for you. The first is can you comment a little
bit – Canada was strong for you fundamentally, can you just talk a little bit about the market and what's going on there
with Costco's positioning? And the second question is can you just give us an update us on the private label initiative
and Kirkland Signature and sort of new products or new categories that you guys are excited about looking forward?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Canada is strong. I mean Canada thankfully is – not only we're the only club in town,
which is a positive – it has everything – historically, in the last several years, everything good about it. It has a good
economy. It didn't have the financial crisis issues that the U.S. had. It's got a, of course, a – part of its economy is
natural resource space which has been on fire. So those are all positive things. It has lower healthcare expenses as a
percent of sales; it's just part of the nature of the healthcare up there versus here. And so all those things that have been
positive for us. And, again, though, when we've got an 8% decline year-over-year in currency, I mean, that washes that
away in terms of how we report it for the company.
In terms of private label, I think some of the areas, apparel has been one that continues, I think, to be exciting. I've
talked ad nauseam in the past about – in the last year, about the wool slack. We've got a great gabardine slack now
that's I think $19.99. We – I know we have some additional women's athletic items. And so we're doing – that will be
an area I think that will continue to grow for us. On the food side, organic. We're doing some – a few more items and
[indiscernible] (1:00:48) in a lot of places, it'll continue to grow. And I think what probably, over time, we haven't
appreciated is the strength of it not only in the U.S. or Canada, but these items being able to take them to other
countries where when we take a regular branded international item to that country, we showed incredible savings where
prices have always been high. On these items, given the quality level and the pricing, that strength is I think
exacerbated even more and that's a positive.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict from Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, Richard. Most of my questions have been asked, but just a quick one on February. Just
you made the decision to call out weather and the impact there. Was the weather materially different than what you saw
in January? And I mean, I know you kind of said there was some stuff that happened in Japan. Is that what kind of
tipped it? Because in the U.S. it just feels like kind of January, February were basically pretty similar.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, you live in – you probably live in that area. No, it was more severe in February. As
an example, in just the last week of February, the Southwest got hammered with rain four or five days. Japan, to the
company, was just another insult to injury, if you will. I think we have, what, 18 units in Japan? I don't have the exact
detail in front of me, let's assume that half a dozen or six or eight of them were impacted in the Tokyo market. So,
again, that was just a little bit more. But, overall, yes, it was more extensive than we've seen before.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: That's good color. Thanks. Just on the club openings, it looks like you're going to kind of get
to that 30 kind of gross number this year that you guys were hoping for. What about as we look to next year? I mean
you think you can – you're still confident you can get that number north of 30?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes. Yeah, I mean, Craig's goal – Craig and Jeff Brotman's goal are to get into low-30,
30-plus range. I'm sure now that I've said it, we'll get 28 or 29. But at the end of the day, we're shooting for 30 to 35 a
year for the next five years.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, sounds good. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks. I just had two questions. First on electronics and then on membership. You've
mentioned it was up but then you listed categories like cameras and stuff that were all down. Was it just TVs that drove
CE? Or was that ASP or volume?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Tablets were part of it. Also, the quarter overall was different than February. February was
a little weaker in electronics.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: So if we look at the...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The biggest chunk is TVs just by volume. And so that's partly why TVs were weaker in
February, relatively speaking, than they were for the quarter and they were actually about flat. And I think the average
sale price is about flat. It had been up – it's, oh, Bob's saying it's up. I have a sheet out here. Hold on, I have to tell you.
In the second quarter, the average price point looks like it was up a couple of percent, and that's partly because we're
selling bigger ticket, bigger TVs, smarter TVs.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Is that inflation mix?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No, no. By the way, one of the comments that I heard at the budget meeting last week was
that the roll-out of the next-generation of technology in TVs has been a little bit delayed and it's going to be in a few
months; April instead of January. I'm being coached here. And so again, that should help it a little bit, but we'll see.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay, great. Well, I don't think you need any coaching for the next question. On memberships,
just want to make sure I'm getting this right. We finally have a quarter [indiscernible] (1:05:14) in terms of the fee
increase.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: So if we're up 7%...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: In local currency...
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Is it fair to say that in the U.S., while membership renewals are great and you have that, the
mix towards Executive, that memberships per club in the U.S. is actually trending down a little bit? And if that's the
case, has that shifted at all?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No, I don't have that detail here. I'd have to look. To the extent that we've opened 14 or so
U.S. warehouses and may be a little bit. But actually it's – I don't know if I'm correct on that. I'll have to look.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. We can follow up on it. But conceptually you still have the mix shift going on to
Executive...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, and by the way, one of the things is – I'll give you example, we opened just a couple
or three years ago in Huntington Beach, California, in L.A., we have 50%-plus of the households or more in that
Greater L.A. market where we've got 40 or so locations. We may open up in a new market there, with the eight to 15
weeks prior to opening, you signup the tabling activities. As of opening day we might have 5,000 or less new members.
New members. In the meantime, that's a unit that may very well – will exceed our company average for the first week
year, with – do $150 million, $100 million of which is new and $50 million which is cannibalized. So you've got
numbers that are closer that are going to shop more frequently for the first time. Contrast that in Asia where, again,
during those eight to 15 weeks prior to opening, as of opening day we've seen numbers in the 25,000 to 50,000 new
member signups with a bigger non-renewal – a lower renewal rate the year hence, but nonetheless. So that should be a
big difference.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: So my guess is that yes, they could be flat or down slightly, but that would be expected in
that example.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Given the cannibalization. Got it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Budd, your lines is open.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: My questions have been all asked. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. I'll be quick. It's the end of the call. Just wanted to follow up on the inflation
question and produce inflation, deflation and whatnot with the potential of some inflation working into produce, you
guys are investing in price there. How is that going to work through as we work through the next, say, quarter or two if
we do get some spikes in produce inflation? How does that work through your numbers?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: My guess, it would help a little, unlike – meat is so much more – as an example, meat is so
much more [indiscernible] (1:08:16) out there. Produce, everybody's got different items, different pack sizes, different
qualities, and we can still show great savings but it's just not – in my view, it's just not the same type of level of
competition. So I don't think that that's going impact us as more – that that will impact us as much. The biggest thing in
produce is, is when there's a drought or a freeze, and when we're doing hundreds of millions of dollars of items, be it
strawberries or blueberries, and when in a given month you did $5 million in an item instead of $15 million during a
holiday item for that produce because of a the freeze, that's more impactful than competition.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: And then just one last one. And it's more – a little bit more strategic. And if you don't want
to, you can always talk offline. But as you guys expand internationally that becomes much more a focus of the growth.
And we've seen other retailers try this, and it hasn't worked well. It's working well for you guys. Can you just talk about
the structure a little bit you're putting in place to make sure that you can kind of keep the momentum up overseas?
Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first and foremost, we start in any country with existing employees that are from our
company. The woman running Spain is a seasoned operations person executive from Canada for many, many years.
The guy running Taiwan goes back to the Price Club days in Southern California. And the guy running Korea started as
a warehouse manager at Costco and before that I believe [indiscernible] (1:09:55). So but when we go over there to –
when we go over, we send a core group of a half a dozen people, three or four people to merchandising and operations.
I think the biggest thing to make sure everybody's on the same page is, is these individuals travel to Seattle every four
weeks, so 13 times a year for a day-and-a-half budget meeting, and they're typically here for an extra day and doing
some other operations and merchandising specific meetings. And then like, Jim, for many years, Craig and others, are
traveling to those countries often. Craig's out of the country today. And so the biggest way we do it, I think, is
everybody being on the same page.
The other thing is – I'll give you a good example, when asked before why have we been so successful in several
countries including some of these countries in Asia, we think part of it is, is not only does our value proposition more
extreme over there, and also that people actually do like big American stuff, the fact is that some of these private label
items that we're developing now have been huge successes in some of these other countries, and those U.S. sourced
goods. And so I think all those things play well into our hand. But that's going to change over time. And so we do what
we do best, is we're constantly focused on it.
When these heads of countries and the merchants of countries come to Seattle every four weeks, one of the things that
each of the senior VPs of operations in every country has one, Canada has two, and U.S. has eight, but all those foreign
ones, they come here. And one of the things that they report on is what initiatives in terms of global sourcing, procuring
goods from a multinational manufacturer, where the U.S. buys a heck of a lot from, perhaps Canada does, because
we're big and have been around a long time. But because of whatever it is, a licensing arrangement or regional pressure
on their side, it's a work in progress. And we're making good success there.

All those things, the little things, but they help us every day. So I think that will continue. It's really a lot of that
blocking and tackling. And we had – just like we did when we went to Alaska for the first time and to Hawaii for the
first time. We feel that we've really lowered prices in those markets and made it more competitive. But we still shine
better competitively versus other retail formats, given the fact that in some of these countries, pricing has been a lot
higher, and I think that has helped us. And then bringing goods, whether it's the jumbo cashews or the fresh blueberries
to countries where they're buying a lot more of it.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Perfect. Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'm going take just two more questions.
Operator
Okay. Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Sandra Barker with Montag & Caldwell.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Hi, Richard. I just wanted to clarify. Maybe you said this and I missed it. But when you
talked about the 30 basis points to 50 basis points of gross margin impact, how much of that would have been sort of
the responsive price cuts versus proactive?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I guess there's three things you're talking about, but I can't tell you exactly. I know in
fresh foods, it's us just wanting to keep the price where it is on key items and doing what we do. If you think about –
let's take hardlines, let's take – whether it's electronics or toys or whatever, again, if sales are a little soft, we're
proactive to mark things down to get rid of them before the season ends. Structurally, we have the benefit I think of
being in and out of seasons early but that doesn't mean we still don't have to take some excess markdowns sometimes.
In terms of responsive, I would say proactive is more impactful than responsive, the issue of needing to be responsive.
But I'm not – there's some responsive too out there.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Is that – do you see any changes in the competitive landscape? And where is it coming
from?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No, we really haven't. I mean, there's still a lot of tough competition out there. We wish
that part of the challenge with the Internet and delivery, does delivery included and what extra things, I think we've –
we're getting a little better of communicating what's the value in our product in terms of that extra controller or
whatever it is or the shipping because where we do price shops, the least competitive ones are some of those that are on
the Internet. Now I don't need to name names.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Yeah, okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman from Telsey.
<Q - Joseph Feldman>: Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and sorry for prolonging this call but just
wanted to ask you competitively, I've seen a lot from your other big major club competitor out there lately in terms of
testing and stuff with online membership or being a little more aggressive in different countries. I'm just wondering if
you guys are seeing any impact to that or any pressure or just how you're dealing with kind of the competitive issues?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, in terms of direct club competition, no. I mean, they did – I believe, Sam's did a fee
increase that they tested originally in Texas and they've rolled that out now in the U.S. They're only by the way in the
U.S. and Mexico. But we have not seen any – Sam's is very competitive but we haven't seen any giant changes in that
or us needing to respond to something that they have done.
<Q - Joseph Feldman>: Got it. Thanks, guys. Good luck with this quarter.
