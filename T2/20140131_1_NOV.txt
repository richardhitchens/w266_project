Now, let me turn the call over to Pete.
Merrill A. Miller, Jr.
Thank you, Loren, and good morning, everyone.
Earlier today, National Oilwell Varco announced fourth quarter 2013 earnings of $658 million or $1.53 per share on
revenues of $6.2 billion and full year earnings of $2.33 billion of $5.44 per share on revenues of $22.8 billion.
Factoring in pre-tax transaction costs and pre-tax gains, the quarterly results were $670 million or $1.56 per share and
for the full year, it was $2.36 billion or $5.52 per share. Clay and Jeremy will expand on these results later on the call.
Additionally, we announced new capital equipment orders of $3.61 billion to raise our backlog to a record level of
$16.24 billion. Our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was over 1.4:1. This backlog is continuing proof of the
industry-wide demand for the great products and services we provide.
I would like to thank all of our employees around the world for the continued professionalism and dedication to provide
our customers with the best equipment and support in the industry.
I will now turn the call over to Clay for more color on our quarter and year.
Clay C. Williams
Thank you, Pete.
National Oilwell Varco posted $5.52 per fully diluted share, excluding extraordinary gains and transaction-related
charges, in 2013. Earnings declined 7% from 2012 on a same pro forma basis as did operating margins, and 7% lower
North American rig counts, rising competition and high customer inventories of drill pipe, downhole tools and other
consumables we manufacture were not fully offset by strengthening international markets.
Additionally, high volumes of equipment destined for the offshore moving through our plants at higher marginal cost,
new rig floor layouts, which negated learning curve effects from past years and a strained supply chain together with
low demand for pressure pumping equipment took a toll on Rig Technology margins for the year. Rig Technology
margins bottomed in the second quarter and began to move up slightly through the second half of the year.
Despite these challenges, National Oilwell Varco accomplished a great deal in 2013. All three segments posted record
revenues for the year. NOV posted a record level of cash flow from operations of $3.4 billion, buoyed by strong
improvements in working capital efficiency. We made good progress divesting certain real estate and non-core assets
acquired with our Ameron and Robbins & Myers acquisitions to free up additional cash, in fact, late in the fourth
quarter, we executed an agreement to divest an industrial aggregates business to a strategic buyer which will yield
another roughly $1 million.
Our strong outlook for cash flow prompted NOV to double its dividend last May, and we expect another significant
increase again in 2014. We have steadily increased our allocation of the capital we generate back to our shareholders
while still successfully executing our strategic plans, and we expect this trend to continue through the coming year.
Operationally, our Rig Technology segment won a record $13.1 billion in orders for capital equipment, half again
higher than the revenue we shipped out last year, lifting our backlog to a record $16.2 billion. We made great progress
expanding our capacity in numerous drilling rig product categories in the face unprecedented demand this year. We
also achieved better payment and pricing terms on 2013 projects, contributing to better working capital performance.
Our FPSO businesses posted over $1 billion in new orders this year: again, a new record. We saw margins for our
FPSO businesses increase 760 basis points year-on-year as volumes and better pricing began to get traction. We expect
to do well in 2014 given our recent capacity expansion in Brazil and backlog growth in this area.

We completed the integration of key businesses acquired over the past several quarters – Robbins & Myers, Fiberspar,
Wilson, C.E. Franklin, NKT Flexibles – into our existing infrastructure. While some of these strategic moves were
executed shortly before market conditions in North America began to slide, all cemented National Oilwell Varco's
market leadership and, importantly, leadership economics for NOV for the long term in products such as composite
tubulars, progressing cavity pumps, downhole drilling motors, sucker rod services, flow iron, and chokes.
We believe leadership economics provide real competitive advantage and higher margins in oilfield services, owing to
scale efficiencies, purchasing power, installed base, reputation effect, and lower risk to buyers. Further, we tend to
invest aggressively in technology leadership, which we view as an obligation of market leaders, to further enhance our
competitive advantage.
NOV was built on systematic application of these principles of competitive advantage in the oilfield and we continue to
deploy resources to enhance positioning of our businesses.
Scale economies are enabling us to spin off our distribution business. Our acquisitions of Wilson Supply and C.E.
Franklin, together with NOV's distribution services business, has created an upstream distribution services business of
unequal capability, which will become an independent standalone company next quarter. We are very excited about the
prospects of distribution now and we believe that it will unlock additional value for our shareholders while creating
exciting new opportunities for our employees.
In short, though challenging, 2013 was also a very productive year for our organization, and we accomplished much to
position NOV for future growth and competitive advantage, principally in the four key areas I discussed last quarter.
One, deepwater drilling rigs; two, floating production technologies; three, jackup rig fleet retooling; and four, shale
technology expansion, which leads me to our outlook for 2014.
First, deepwater drilling rigs. Following 26 floater drilling equipment package wins by NOV in 2013, much has been
written lately about falling demand in 2014. We certainly concur that fewer E&P tenders for deepwater drilling rigs
lately in the face of 39 uncontracted floaters to come to market in the next few years should point to a more restrained
outlook for newbuild deepwater rig demand in 2014.
The only problem is: we just don't see it yet. Those who know most about the market continue to place orders. Demand
actually looks to be holding up well so far, and we expect Rig Technology book-to-bill to land close to one or maybe
even exceed one for the first quarter. We're off to a good start in 2014.
Lately, demand for rigs appears to be shifting towards less traditional entrepreneurs and less traditional shipyards.
Nevertheless, some large well-capitalized drilling contractors are continuing to look at placing more floater orders.
It may be that they continue to find the low all-in cost of these high-quality drilling assets, aggressive shipyard terms,
availability of financing, and drilling contractor organizations already geared to finance, build, staff and execute these
projects, simply too compelling to pass up.
It may be that they see two-thirds of a planet which can only be explored with floating rigs driving a much bigger fleet
in the future. It may be that they see development drilling demand rising around the globe, given the 200-plus new
deepwater discoveries made that are in need of development drilling. I don't know. I'm just happy to take orders.
Within this space, we are very glad that over the last two years we deployed significant capital into our capacity to
build 2-million-pound plus top drives and drilling riser deepwater BOP stacks and other critical components to outfit
these floaters.
For instance, our record level of subsea BOPs made in 2013 will be eclipsed in 2014, and probably again in 2015, given
our record backlog and expanded capacity in this arena. We continue to invest capital in new game-changing subsea
BOP technology, which we expect to test this year, along with the 20,000 PSI rig design and other innovations we
continue to evolve in the deepwater drilling world.
Growth initiative number two, our floating production systems, which produce subsea developments, where we saw
great progress in 2013 and we expect more in 2014. In short, we believe we are offering a differentiated value

proposition to an industry segment, FPSO construction, that frequently sees cost overruns of a third and tends to deliver
vessels a year or more late.
A 30% cost overrun on a $1 billion dollar project is serious money. A 14-month delay in first production on a
multibillion dollar NPV project is serious money. As the number of deepwater rigs rise, more discoveries are made, oil
companies seek to actually produce these fields and generate cash flow from them and more floating production vessel
projects are launched, the inherent inefficiency in the system will be compounded.
The status quo has not worked very well, in our view. We think we have a better way. We are very excited about
pioneering a new model based upon a packaged offering and we hope to land our first packaged contract in this arena
in late 2014.
Our acquisitions of NKT Flexibles, APL turret mooring systems, Itasco, TechDrill, Petrex, Forth Valley, Ameron and
other investments have uniquely positioned NOV as a major supplier of key components in the deepwater floating
production projects. We believe NOV's successful execution of a similar game plan for offshore drilling rig
construction, our manufacturing and project management expertise, coupled with shipyard relationships, supply-chain
management, M&A and integration skills, leave NOV uniquely well-positioned to pursue better ideas in this space.
Critics, notably engineering firms who sell engineering by the hour, argue that different fuel conditions necessitate
highly customized designs that require lots of – well, engineering hours. Production vessels must be precisely
optimized to the expected float characteristics of the field.
That's great, except that nobody knows exactly what that will look like. Oil companies move forward on development
with one, maybe two, well control points and at best limited flow tests and initial flow characteristics, water-cut gas-oil
ratios, et cetera, always change over time, oil companies always get smarter about a field as time and drilling and
production progresses. Optimizing around a point solution, an early glimpse of what production might look like is false
precision in our view.
We think we have a better way, targeting more robust designs, more modularity, more configurable systems, which can
be constructed repeatedly and at lower risk. Fewer suppliers with each supplying more kit limits cross company
equipment interfaces and permits better management of interface consistency between products, reducing risk and
complexity. Oil companies, FPSO operators and shipyards would all benefit. That's our vision.
The third growth area, jackup fleet rejuvenation, is underway in earnest and helped contribute to our strong level of
orders in 2013. We won a record 66 drilling equipment packages for new jackups in 2013. Like the deepwater space,
we may see a pause in 2014. But in the short run, customer interest remains high.
Our application of capital into this overlaps to some degree with what we do for our deepwater customers, bigger BP or
top drives, better control systems, et cetera, but it also includes investment in cranes and jacking systems in places like
Nantes, France where we are doubling our productive capacity within our BLM unit.
At the risk of boring you once again with jackup fleet demographics, I'll again report that the jackup fleet remains old
and rusty. 45% of the fleet is more than 30 years old and steel vessels which sit in salt water every day of their lives do
not live forever.
Finally, the growth opportunity, which spans nearly every other area of NOV, centers on unconventional shale
technologies. As we discussed last quarter, shale development is transformative and touches almost everything we do,
at least onshore. It starts with new land rigs which utilize AC power, electronic controls, robotic pipe handling, quick
move attributes, and now walking or skidding capabilities.
North American drilling contractors get this and are investing in earnest to upgrade land fleets to this standard.
International drilling contractors will certainly follow.
Next, we outfit the rig with premium drill pipe and downhole drilling motors used to turn fixed cutter bits to efficiently
drill long laterals and horizontal wells. NOV provides these along with fluids, generator sets, drill cuttings, and water
management services.

We saw critical components into hydraulic fracture stimulation operations, coiled tubing and units, flow iron pumps,
mixing and blending equipment also required to produce economic results from these projects.
The extraordinary production growth in the United States over the past three years is exhibit A of how remarkable this
shale technology is. There is no doubt that it will migrate to other regions. This takes time and NOV equipment to
make happen. And NOV remains uniquely well positioned for this opportunity, which is still in the very early innings
of moving forward steadily.
Specifically, in Latin America and the Middle East, we are seeing a gradual increase in demand for new Tier 1 rigs, a
shift to premium drill pipe, rise in demand for drilling motors and even pressure pumping equipment. In North
America, we expect oilfield service companies to begin to deplete some their stocks of inventory and a few early green
shoots made portend improving business a little later in the year. Higher gas prices would certainly help.
Logic dictates that demand will rebound as consumables are consumed by a pad drilling juggernaut furiously pursuing
footage and efficiency 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
As we've said many times, drilling consumes rigs and equipment. NOV's business model is that shale acreage plus
NOV technology, rigs, equipment pipe and bits going one into the machine, oil and wealth flow out the other.
In short, we expect four major trends in energy, deepwater rig fleet buildout, deepwater floating production and subsea
development, jackup rig replacement and retooling and growth and diffusion of shale technologies to shape our
fortunes and provide interesting and profitable reinvestment opportunities.
Our success in these areas has provided NOV with exceptional cash flow which is more likely to exceed our
opportunity set more years than not going forward. Therefore, we expect to fund these opportunities while continuing
to increase our dividend, probably substantially, later this spring.
Our strong performance would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our more than 60,000
employees. Many, many thanks to all of you for taking such great care of our customers in 2013 and for making NOV
such a special team. Jeremy.
Jeremy D. Thigpen
Thanks, Clay.
Since Clay already summarized the 2013 highlights, I'll try to focus the majority of my commentary around our fourth
quarter performance and our expectations for 2014. As Pete and Clay previously mentioned, it was another
record-breaking quarter and year for National Oilwell Varco.
For the fourth quarter 2013, the company posted net income of $658 million or $1.53 per fully diluted share. Excluding
$16 million in pre-tax transaction charges, fourth quarter 2013 earnings were a record of $1.56 per fully diluted share,
up $0.22 per share or 16% from the third quarter 2013 and up $0.07 per share or 5% from the fourth quarter 2012.
Quarterly revenue of $6.2 billion which was also a record, improved 8% sequentially and 8.6% year-over-year despite a
challenging rig count environment which was relatively flat sequentially and down 3% from the fourth quarter of 2012.
Excluding transaction charges from all periods and the gains resulting from the outstanding legal claim in the third
quarter of 2013, operating profit for the quarter was $973 million, up 14% sequentially, and up 2% from the fourth
quarter of last year. Operating margins on this basis were 15.8% for the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 15% for the
third quarter of 2013 and 16.8% for the fourth quarter of last year. Sequentially, operating profit flow through leverage
on the 8.5% growth was a solid 25%.
Now, let's turn to our segment operating results. The Rig Technology segment generated record revenues of $3.3
billion in the fourth quarter, up 16% sequentially and up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Operating profit
for the segment was $697 million and operating margins were 21.1% essentially flat with the prior quarter.

On the Q3 conference call, we expected Rig Tech revenues to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range as
continued declines in the sale of intervention and stimulation equipment would be more than offset by an increase in
land-related revenue associated with our third quarter bookings, plus higher offshore project revenues as we redoubled
our efforts with the shipyards to bring some projects back on schedule and continued growth in our aftermarket
business.
Well to a very pleasant surprise, revenues for intervention and stimulation equipment actually improved sequentially as
we were able to opportunistically utilize existing inventory to fill unexpected demand that surfaced in the quarter.
Additionally, revenue out of backlog increased more than expected, up 20% sequentially to $2.5 billion, primarily
driven by a number of completed contracts which included 4 drill ships, 9 jackups and 9 land rigs in the quarter. Also,
we were encouraged to see strong sequential growth from our APL and NKT offering of products.
And finally, our aftermarket business grew 9% sequentially to a new quarterly record of $682 million. For the full year,
Rig Tech generated $11.6 billion in revenues which surpassed the segment's 2012 record by 15%.
Turning to Rig Tech margins, given the incremental cost required to support record levels of installation and
commissioning activity on the quarter and the continuing expense associated with numerous strategic growth initiatives
and capacity expansions, we were pleased that margins remained relatively flat with Q3.
Still, we remain as committed as ever to improving our already industry-leading margins by one, continuing to push
pricing when and where possible; and two, optimizing our supply chain through the expansion of our capacity and the
streamlining of our processes.
Now, let's transition to the Q4 capital equipment orders and our resulting backlog. As evidenced by the $3.6 billion in
new orders, industry demand for our equipment remains very strong and our customers continue to recognize National
Oilwell Varco of our industry-leading technology, our proven track record of delivering projects on time and our
unmatched ability to support our equipment globally.
For the quarter, we booked four drillships and 25 jackups, bringing our total for the year to 26 floaters and 66 jackups.
For the four floaters that we booked in Q4, we secured the subsea BOP stacks on three of the vessels, two of which
purchased dual stacks.
We also secured two spare stacks in the quarter, giving us a quarterly total of seven subsea stacks. And of the 25 total
jackups that we booked in Q4, we secured 23 of the stacks, proving that the investments in capacity and technology that
Clay previously referenced are indeed paying off.
In addition to the strong orders for offshore drilling equipment, we also secured a number of orders for our APL
loading systems and our NKT flexible flowline and riser technology, which enabled us to exceed our 2013 bookings
target of $1 billion.
And finally, we secured a number of drilling equipment packages destined for both the U.S. and international land
markets, as well as a number of complete work-over rigs destined for Russia. All of these new orders were partly offset
by revenues out of backlog of more than $2.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 times.
For the year, orders totaled $13.1 billion, which eclipsed the 2011 record by 21% and resulted in a record year-ending
backlog of $16.2 billion, up 7% from Q3 and up 37% year-over-year. Of the total backlog, approximately 93% is
offshore and 94% is destined for international markets.
Based on what we had in backlog as of December 31, 2013, we expect approximately $8.5 billion to flow out as
revenue throughout the year with just over $2 billion of that total flowing out in the first quarter. Please note that this
estimate does not include any capital equipment that we might book and turn during the year.
Looking into the first quarter of 2014, we expect orders for new offshore drilling equipment packages and floating
production equipment to remain strong and we expect to see continued demand for new land drilling rigs in Latin
America, the Middle East, and Russia, as well as some new land rigs and equipment packages for North America.

While we do not expect a fifth consecutive quarter of bookings in excess of $3 billion and we're not currently
anticipating that we will duplicate the record booking activity of 2013, we have enjoyed a very strong start to the year
and we're in the middle of some very encouraging and constructive discussions that could soon materialize into new
orders. Time will tell, but we think that it could be another good year for orders.
For Q1, we expect Rig Tech revenues to decline sequentially as the large year-end shipments for both land rigs and
stimulation equipment which boosted our fourth quarter results will not repeat. And we expect for margins to continue
to be challenged to expand above the 21% due to the sequential decline in land rigs and stimulation equipment, the
continued high levels of installation and commissioning activity, and a slight delay in the startup of our flexibles plant
in Brazil, which has now slipped firmly into the second quarter.
But for the full year 2014, we expect for Rig Tech revenues to grow in a high single-digit percentage range as we
execute against our record backlog and continue to benefit from our ever-expanding aftermarket business. We also
expect for margins to expand as we move throughout the year, but at a slow and steady pace.
The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment posted revenues of $1.9 billion, up 6% sequentially and up 9% from the
previous year. Operating profit improved 13% sequentially to $366 million and operating margins were 19%, up 110
basis points from the third quarter of 2013.
On the third quarter call, we suggested that revenues in this segment could improve in the low to mid-single digit
percentage range as a strengthening Canadian market and some large end of year project shipments into international
markets would be partially offset by a U.S. market that typically slows during the holiday season.
We also forecasted for margins to move modestly higher on the incremental volume. Well, as expected, our U.S.
revenue declined slightly. Our Canadian revenue improved slightly and our international business improved almost
18% sequentially.
While on the subject of international growth, since 2010, the international rig – the average international rig count has
increased 202 rigs or 18.5%. Over that same time period, our PS&S segment international revenues have grown 62%
and represented 49.5% of the segment's total revenue in the fourth quarter. Needless to say, we are pleased that our
investments are paying off and we look forward to continued growth in key international markets.
From a margin perspective, the quarter played out a little better than expected as well, with 36% leverage or
flow-through on the 6% sequential increase in revenue. For the full-year 2013, PS&S segment revenues of $7.2 billion
surpassed the 2012 record by 3% despite a 3% decline in the worldwide rig count over that time.
As we enter the first quarter of 2014, we believe that the Petroleum Services & Supplies segment should receive some
benefit from heightened activity in Canada. However, this increase will be more than offset by the loss of the large
year-end international projects that benefited us in the fourth quarter of 2013. As such, we're forecasting revenues to
decline in the mid-single digit percentage range sequentially and for margins to contract with the volume.
But for the full year 2014, we're planning for revenues to improve in the mid-single digit percentage range as we
benefit from the fact that most of our U.S. land customers have worked through their inventories for most products,
with the exception of drill pipe, and we continue to build upon the success that we've experienced in international
markets.
Naturally, we expect margins to improve with the incremental volume. However, with the potential for additional
pricing pressures in North America land, we are concerned that our historical 30% flow-through target may be overly
ambitious for this year.
The Distribution & Transmission segment posted revenues of $1.25 billion, down almost 7% sequentially and down
1% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. On the lower volumes, operating profit dollars declined at 23%
sequentially to $60 million, and operating margins dropped 100 basis points from Q3 to 4.8%.
On the third quarter earnings call, we expected revenues within the D&T segment to decline in the low single-digit
percentage range as increasing activity in Canada would be more than offset by reductions in the U.S., where the

holiday season would result in fewer billing days.
Unfortunately, we did not fully appreciate the impact that a mid-week Christmas holiday would have on operations,
and we did not factor in the potential loss of billing days due to severe weather. In total, we estimate that the
combination of holidays and weather disruptions resulted in six fewer billing days in the quarter, which more than
explains the 7% sequential decline in revenue. And because of the rather steep and unexpected decline in revenue, in
addition to some incremental costs associated with our ERP implementation, our decremental flow through of 20% was
somewhat worse than we would typically expect, but understandable.
For the full year 2013, the Distribution & Transmission segment posted revenues of $5.1 billion, which was a new
record and exceeded our full-year 2012 results by over 30%.
Looking into the first quarter of 2014, we expect the Distribution & Transmission segment to benefit from increasing
Canadian activity and, hopefully, a few more billing days in the U.S., so we're forecasting revenues to improve
modestly sequentially. However, we expect margins to be challenged to expand as we begin the rollout of our ERP
platform to the legacy Wilson and C.E. Franklin organizations.
For the full year 2014, much like our PS&S segment, we're planning for revenues to improve in the mid-single-digit
percentage range as we, one, benefit from the fact that most of our U.S. land customers have worked through their
inventories, and two, we continue to grow our international business, which, like PS&S, has significantly outpaced the
growth in the international rig count.
For our Distribution & Transmission segment, international revenues have improved 194% from 2010.
Unfortunately, because of the heavy lifting that we're doing this year, which includes the ERP rollout, continued
facility consolidations, and preparations for the spinoff, we're only forecasting slight year-over-year margin expansion.
So in summary, 2013 was certainly a challenging but a record-breaking year. As we move into the first quarter 2014,
for the total company, we're forecasting a mid-single-digit percentage sequential decline in revenue with fairly high
decremental margins. But for the year, we're forecasting mid-single-digit percentage growth over 2013 with strong
year-over-year flow-through.
Now let's turn to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated fourth quarter 2013 income statement. Gross margins improved
50 basis points sequentially to 24.3%. SG&A increased $25 million sequentially on the incremental volume, but as a
percentage of revenue, SG&A declined 30 basis points sequentially to 8.5%.
Transaction costs, primarily related to the Robbins & Myers acquisition, totaled $16 million in the quarter. Interest
expense increased $1 million sequentially to $27 million, but interest income improved $2 million to $4 million as a
result of higher cash balances and higher yields.
Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV was $16 million, up $3 million sequentially as the plant resumed operations
following its annually scheduled maintenance in the third quarter. We expect equity income for the JV to decline
slightly in the first quarter of 2014 as demand for drill pipe and, therefore, green tube in the U.S. will continue to be
somewhat muted.
Other expense for the quarter was $17 million, which was $2 million higher than the third quarter, but still fairly
consistent with historical trends. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29.2%, which was well below the
third quarter rate of 30.8% as we benefited from some sizable U.S. manufacturing credits, some R&D credits, and a
higher percentage of international income. Going forward, we expect for the effective tax rate to remain in the range of
31%.
Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $150 million in the fourth quarter,
down $5 million sequentially. Depreciation and amortization was $200 million, up $9 million from the third quarter;
and EBITDA, excluding transaction charges, was a quarterly record of $1.2 billion, or 19.3% of sales. For the full year
2013, the company produced $4.3 billion in EBITDA.

Turning to the balance sheet, National Oilwell Varco's December 31, 2013, balance sheet employed working capital,
excluding cash and debt, of $6.3 billion. That's down almost $900 million from the third quarter and down over $400
million from the same time in 2012. In the quarter, our accounts receivable balance only increased $96 million despite
revenue growth of $485 million over that same time period.
Our prepayments and milestone invoicing on current projects once again outpaced costs incurred, resulting in a $319
million favorable delta. And even more importantly, in the quarter, we drove down inventory by $475 million. While
it's taken some time to turn the ship, we're starting to realize the benefits of our heightened focus on commercial
payment terms, on collections, and on inventory
As a direct result of our strong operating results and more efficient management of working capital, we generated a
quarterly record of $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations, which marked a 50% improvement over the previous
record of $1 billion which we generated in the third quarter of 2013. So we're clearly pleased with the performance
over the second half of the year.
During the quarter, we spent $185 million in CapEx, bringing our 2013 total spend to $669 million. We also made
dividend payments of $111 million, cash tax payments of $213 million, cash interest payments of $111 million, and we
paid off the remaining balance of $600 million on our commercial paper program, which enabled us to finish the year
with $3.1 billion in long-term debt, of which $3 billion was from the bond offering in November 2012.
Despite these fourth quarter disbursements we still managed to build our cash balance by nearly $700 million to $3.4
billion leaving us with a net cash position of $286 million at December 31, 2013, versus a net debt of $1 billion at
September 30, 2013. Of the $3.4 billion in cash only 10% of the balance was in the U.S. at December 31.
As we moved= through 2014, we expect CapEx spending to decline from the $669 million that we spent in 2013
however we still have some sizeable projects underway in key markets, therefore we expect CapEx could still approach
$600 million for the full year 2014.
Now, let me turn it back to Pete.
Merrill A. Miller, Jr.
Thanks, Jeremy.
I'm just going to have a couple of brief comments because I think Clay and Jeremy have really hit all the big topics
quite well. The one thing I would like to echo Clay on is really about technology. Technology marches on and as
technology improves, that changes rigs. And I think it's a good proxy for this yesterday if any of you listened to the
Helmerich & Payne conference call, they announced nine new contracts for newbuild rigs.
Well, why would that happen if in fact there are rigs still stacked out there that people could pick up? Well, I'll tell you
why that could happen. It's a proxy for what's going on around the industry. The operators want the best rigs. They
want the most highly technical rigs. Where do you get those? You get those from NOV.
That's why I think that the rumor of the death of orders of new rigs is being greatly exaggerated. I'm very confident that
things are going to continue on in a very positive fashion. I also believe what you're probably going to see overseas is a
quicker response to shales than a lot of people are projecting. I think the world needs natural gas, we're getting ready to
fire up hopefully within the next year or so, some LNG facilities here in the U.S. And I think that all bodes well for
what we're doing.
Finally, I'd just like to offer one note. One of our long-term executives, Haynes Smith, is retiring today. Haynes has
been with us for quite some time, has been the President of our Tuboscope, our fiberglass and our brand operations, and
we all want to wish Haynes the best in the future.
So at this point, Shannon, I'd like to open it up for any questions that people that might have.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Crandell from Cowen & Company.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Good morning, Jim.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Pete, since the spin-off is March 31, I'm assuming this is your last time on the call as CEO and
I just want to congratulate you on a terrific 13-year-plus run as CEO.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Well, thank you, Jim.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: I guess, first of all, Pete, could you talk a little bit to the non-traditional demand for floaters? I
think we probably can get a good handle on what SeaDrill, Noble Ensco, et cetera, are doing, but probably less so on
the non-traditional demand, which you had some positive things to say. Can you talk to that point in a little bit more
detail?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Sure. And I think it's kind of ironic, Jim, that when you talk about the traditional players,
the one you brought up was SeaDrill, because I would tell you back in 2006, they were business plan. And they were
one of the major non-traditional players and look what they built themselves into. And I think you're going to see the
same thing [indiscernible] (36:03).
There's a couple of things that happen here. The shipyards want to stay busy and the shipyards are offering still very
compelling economics for the build of these and there is still other folks that want to get in this business. And if you
can get in this business with a new rig fleet a la SeaDrill, a la Pacific Drilling, a la things that Ocean Rig is doing, I
think there's still a lot of room for people to enter it because what you're going to do is you're going to marginalize the
rigs that really don't have the technology and the rigs that are aged. So we're seeing a lot of activity still in that arena.
And I'll ask Clay to kind of add a little bit of color to that.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: You bet. Specifically, we're seeing entrepreneurs out of Asia and Europe interested in
building rigs and moving forward on those projects. Many are talking to some of the shipyards in China and are
impressed by the sorts of terms that those shipyards are offering. And so we're pretty excited about that. That's the
group of shipyards that we do very well with because they recognize the value of a more complete NOV package to go
into those.
So, I think they see the opportunity here. I would stress, too, although a lot – as we talk about in our comments, a lot
has been written about short-term demand in the deepwater and offshore arenas – if you're building a rig, that's a
two-and-a-half to three, three-and-a-half year project. So, you're really sort of aiming for where the puck is going. And
we look out 2015, 2016, 2017, and see how the acreage has been leased and needs to be explored. I think that's really
the target that they're focused on there. And they don't appear to be too anxious about near-term outlook for demand for
rigs.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: One other question about deepwater guidance, if I had to think about where I've been
surprised the most on the upside in terms of NOV's performance. I mean, there are a number of areas, but I'm just
amazed at how you've – at how well you're doing in subsea deepwater BOP stacks. Pete, can you talk to a little bit
about some of the reasons for your – I guess, your dominant market share here in 2013 in that area?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Well, Jim, I think that at the end of the day, we recognized early the importance of what
was going to be for the subsea stacks. I think Macondo really kind of emphasized that, and we put some very
significant investments into our West Little York facility here in Houston and we got in early. I mean, today, we can
actually test, I believe, seven BOPs simultaneously, which is an industry leader.

And so, the fact of the matter is I think people have come to us and said, hey, you saw it early. You guys have
increased your capacity and we want to buy from you. And I think couple that with the fact that I talk about it all the
time, we're in 63 countries with 1,250 locations around the world. And that's a competitive advantage that I don't care
where you're going to move your rig, I don't care what you're going to do, we're going to support you.
We have a company in South Africa that actually can redo and work BOPs that are on the West Coast of Africa and the
East Coast of Africa. We do things in the Middle East. We've got facilities in Aberdeen. We've got facilities in
Singapore that really can take care of that. So I think a lot of it has been better technology, increased capacity and our
ability to take care of our customers wherever they are in the world.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Okay. And Pete, the last question I have, I think you commented that you expect you will win
your first integrated – you hope to win your first integrated FPSO package by the end of 2014. I mean, does it seem to
you that this is going – it certainly is going slowly, but is it a surprise to you that it's going slowly? And how are your
oil company customers, I guess, responding to the idea of standardization and offering an integrated package for an
FPSO?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Jim, let me let – I'll let Clay kind of expand on that.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: That's a great question, Jim. I would say they're very intrigued by the idea. They've been –
the oil companies together with FPSO owner operators have been a little frustrated with the economic results around
building PFSO projects.
As I mentioned in my comments, they tend to be very highly customized and focus on a particular field and changes are
made along the way which introduces inefficiencies in the manufacture or the construction of those large vessels. And
so I think we're talking to people who are beginning to see problems with status quo. And the key thing for us is we're
talking to everybody involved up and down the food chain.
So everyone from oil companies to FPSO owner operators, the engineering firms to shipyards are involved in the
conversation and I think all of us recognize that there ought to be a better way to pursue these and so we're were in
fairly advanced conversations with – on one particular project that is one that I'm referring to. We hope to get done this
year.
In terms of the pace, these are large multi-billion dollar investments by IOCs and those of us who spent time in this
industry know that all those projects tend to move slowly and thoughtfully. And so what was required before someone
pulls the trigger on building an FPSO was sanctioning an entire field development, and that's something that I think
IOCs and NOCs tend to study quite closely. And so we're – I guess, we're not terribly surprised at the pace. We're very
– and we're – I would add, we're very pleased to see progress in this arena. So we're very excited about what the future
holds here.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Thanks, Jim
Operator
Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery from Tudor Pickering Holt.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Clay, you mentioned in discussion around the Rig Tech outlook, some green shoots here in North
America. Just curious, are you seeing anything on kind of the intervention side or is it mostly rigs and just discuss how
you see this year playing out in terms of the land piece of the business?

<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yes. Specifically, that was in intervention and hydraulic fracture stimulation equipment. We
had some – I think Jeremy talked about this in his comments, some opportunistic sales of frac fleet equipment that we
were able to meet out of inventory, so pleased with that.
Within PS&S, we manufacture hydraulic fracture unit, frac fleet pumps and we have four or five customers that we've
gotten calls from here recently looking for replacement parts and new pumps, and so we're seeing, just kind of here and
there, indications that perhaps some folks are starting to work through their inventory of consumables.
We hear – back on the Rig Tech coiled tubing side that units are – there were idled units late last year and that
operators are wearing out frac fleets and coiled tubing units and parking those and then picking up the idled units. And
so there's sort of the cycling going on of the fleet which is to be expected given the high pace of utilization and how
hard this equipment is worked. And that's really kind of the engine that's going to drive future demand. And past cycles
have taught us that you run this equipment really, really hard. And then once utilization hits a certain level, then they've
got to come back to us and to our competitors to restock those consumables and buy new units.
And so we're not seeing a clear – I'm not here to tell you that 2014 is the year that we come back with a vengeance, but
we are seeing a few anecdotal signs of encouragement out there across the North American market.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Great. And my second question is just around the offshore side of Rig Technology. The qualitative
feel seems like the comfort level for you guys around execution whether that means commissioning or learning curve
on some of the newer design rigs, is growing. I mean can you just talk about the qualitative feel as, I mean as you've
been kind of over that business now eight or nine months now...
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Can you compare it now versus how you felt April or May last year?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Well, we're working really, really hard, and I appreciate how professional that team is over
there and the great job that they do.
With respect to the offshore projects – and we've talked about this on past calls – first, we signed up – a couple of years
ago, we began signing up for new rig floor layouts for new class requirements, ABS and DNV requirements around
rigs. So we're sort of building new versions of these drilling rigs and we lost some learning-curve effects.
The second thing we did is we signed to build these rigs very – signed up to build these rigs very, very quickly. And so
when you shave more than a year off of the construction schedule, what we have learned and our shipyard partners
have learned and our suppliers have learned is that that's a – perhaps we went a bridge too far. And so a lot of these
projects ran into delays and problems.
And so, as we approached the end of them, we – a lot of that – they look – the owners of these projects looked to our
I&C efforts to sort of catch up. Now, I&C, you generally plan on five to six months of installation and commissioning
work at the tail end of a rig and that's assuming you have electricity hooked up to the rig floor, you've got mechanical
hook-ups done. We're relying on the shipyard partners to accomplish all that.
What we found with these projects is that they're running a little late due to no fault of our own, but we're asked to
commission these in three to four months, to work around the clock, which we never did in a previous cycle, to work
24-hour operations with only partially completed hook-ups around the equipment. So that's the specific margin
headwind we've run into.
We're committed to our customers. We're committed to getting these rigs back on schedule and so we're doing that and
we're incurring extra cost. And so, what we're finding as we work through this is that we're making good progress. I
think there will be a learning curve effect out there in 2014. I think as we kind of clear through this work and we're
going to get better at it.
We're also training a lot of people. Pete just a second ago mentioned our investments in our BOP infrastructure and a
big part of that is investment in our teams. And so we've opened our seventh NOV Technical College. We have 350

Operator
Our next question comes from James West from Barclays.
<Q - James C. West>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Hey, James.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Good morning, James.
<Q - James C. West>: Pete, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks right at the end there that you thought that
international shales were going to take off probably faster than what was anticipated or is anticipated by the market
right now.
We're heard kind of a mixed bag, I guess, from some of the diversified service companies around that, some fits and
starts. So wanted to just kind of dig into that comment a little further and kind of what do you see in there that leads
you to that conclusion?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: You bet, Jim, I think there's a couple of things, James, and if you take a look, for
instance, right now Argentina is coming on very well for us. We've – you've heard a lot of people talk about softness in
Latin America, but quite frankly Latin America is a real positive place for us right now and Argentina is one of them,
and that's almost all shales.
You can go back a year or two ago and in Russia they were actually downplaying shales because they didn't want
people getting too excited about it, because that was – kind of their main thing was shipping natural gas from Russia
into Western Europe. But today, even the Russians are saying: okay, we're going to start exploiting our shales pretty
rapidly, and we've been selling equipment into Russia pretty successfully.
And a lot of that equipment is going to be utilized to – and to be able to take care of those shales, we also have
manufacturing outfit over in Minsk, Belarus, that's doing very, very well when it comes to building equipment or the
fracking that is necessary for the shales in Russia. So I think that's another area that's very positive.
China is one, and you've heard me said this before. China has some issues with pollution, and they burn a lot of coal;
and there's a quick and easy answer to that, and that's the utilization of natural gas. And China needs natural gas, and I
think you'll see them exploiting their shales probably more rapidly than people give them credit for.
And I think – I certainly understand the other opinion because there's a lot of infrastructure buildup that has to occur for
this to happen more rapidly; however, as you've heard me say before, we are in the business of infrastructure buildup;
and so we've actually sold equipment – coiled tubing equipment and the like – that we build in the U.S., into China.
And so, I think there's a lot of positive things as you look around the world at the opportunity on these shales, and my
belief is it's going to come to fruition sooner rather than later because the world needs it.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay. Okay.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Jim, Jim, if I can add something to that, too.

<Q - James C. West>: Yeah.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: I think it's important to make a distinction between shales and shale technology because a lot
of this demand that we see for hydraulic fracture stimulation or horizontal drilling for improved rig efficiency, we
consider shale technology, but they're being applied to the other reservoir rocks, and so more conventional reservoir
rocks, tight sands, that sort of thing. I think what we're seeing are E&P companies applying these things or shale
technologies to those and so that's further growing the pie for what NOV sells.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then one other question from me. Maybe a little bit of an unfair
question, but I know you talked about book-to-bill being over 1.0 times in 1Q. Do you think that's a reasonable
expectation either for the full year or because you have this non-traditional demand coming for offshore rigs and you
have the FPSO order potential coming or is that – or should we think about maybe it slides a little bit?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: James, last year at this time, I was asked that question. And I said it will be over 1.0 and
everybody kind of went, oh, yeah, right.
<Q - James C. West>: Sure. [Laughter].
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Well, I was wrong. It was 1.5. So I think – we've got a little bit of visibility into the first
quarter and we feel very good, as Clay said in his remarks and Jeremy has said. But I think it's real difficult for us to
make a projection at this point in time that this is exactly what we're going see. I think that makes it difficult. But we
feel very good about what we're seeing and we feel very good about who we're talking to. And I've also said this
before, you don't buy – you aren't going to do an offshore rig without at least coming to NOV and getting a quotation
from us, so – even if you want to use us as a stalking horse – and so we've got a pretty good visibility into the things
that are going on. And let's just say we like where we are and we feel pretty good.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: We wouldn't rule out the possibility.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Yeah.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay, gotcha. Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thank you, James.
Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Lamotte from Guggenheim.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Thanks guys. If I could follow up on the international Tier 1 rigs question. The
contractors, are you seeing more interest from indigenous or local contractors or are there global players looking to
grow their international businesses?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Really both Michael. In Argentina we're dealing with indigenous contractors. The Argentine
government has waived importation duties on rig equipment between now and I think July 1. And so we're seeing a big
surge in demand for rigs for that particular market. In the Middle East more of the international players along with
some of the local Middle East participants.
Really who we try to target are drilling contractors willing to bring that new technology, a differentiated offering into
their particular market. And so where we had the best luck in the past are with more forward thinking sort of drilling
contractors who see the benefit. They see the impact that this new rig technology has made here in North America. And
they're really going in with the business plan to try to replicate that. And those are the folks that we tend to do the best
with.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: And then – Thanks, Clay. And in the Middle East, if I think about one of the
advantages of North America AC electric rig, it's the speed in which it can break down and move location. That doesn't
necessarily transfer to the desert. What's the driver there for upgrades in desert class rigs?

<A - Clay C. Williams>: Really, more reliability and drilling efficiency focused. You're correct, sometimes – it
depends on the market within the Middle East. Sometimes, quick move is less important. But I would say generally,
where we've done the best were the much larger rigs in the Middle East with 2,000, 3,000 horsepower land rigs,
moving does matter because efficiency of moves matters and the cost of moves matters. But really, highly automated,
reliable, big equipment is what we're seeing demand for over there. That's kind of our niche in that marketplace.
I would add to that AC power is starting to get good traction over there. The U.S. market converted from DC electric to
AC electric over the past decade or so, full stop. Middle East is lagging a little bit, but we're now seeing good demand
for AC rigs in that marketplace.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: And it also depends country-to-country, as Clay said, Michael. I mean places like Oman,
the speed of movement is probably more critical than in a place like Saudi. So it is – it's kind of dependent, but the
good thing is in our quiver of arrows, we've got products for all the needs over there.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Okay, great. If I could just come back to the Argentina comment, Clay, a little bit about
the lifting the import restrictions on rig equipment for the next six months?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: That – I mean that's a pretty unusual move for the Argentinean government. I imagine
that there's quite a scramble to jump through that window. Can you talk about sort of the magnitude of what you're
seeing there? And also, does it extend to any frac equipment? Or is it just drilling packages?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: I'm not sure on the last question, frac equipment versus drilling packages. It's important to
our land rig business but in the context of a $3.3 billion segment last quarter, it's moving the needle, but not – that's a
big ship to turn, so glad to see it. Very, very pleased to be able to help that market upgrade its rig fleet. And we're
looking forward to executing on those projects. But it's part of a much bigger business.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Great. Okay, guys. Thanks. I'll turn it back.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Thanks, Michael.

Our final question comes from David Anderson from JPMorgan.
<Q - David Anderson>: So a question on kind of the overall outlook on rig equipment on the newbuild floaters.
Clearly, the market is very concerned that we're getting close to end of the rig equipment cycle. Pete, can you talk
about the technology aspect and how that plays out? Do you think you can get kind of 20 floaters and 30 jackups that
kind of baseline number of just kind of the upgrade and kind of high grading of the fleet. Is that unreasonable to
expect?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Well, I think the – as you take a look at the jackup numbers, I mean, the jackup numbers
continue to defy the common logic. And I would say that there's nothing common about that logic. The fact of the
matter is that we – as Clay pointed out, 45% of the jackups are still over 30 years old and that's just a tough sell to
people. Plus, they don't have the flexibility to be able to drill. You can take a super 116-C newbuild with 450-foot legs
and you can drill in 50 feet of water. You can't take a mat-supported slotted jackup and go drill in 300 feet of water, so
the flexibility is there. You've got the same sort of thing with the big floaters.
So I think there's potential – you've heard me say this before. If I give dates, I don't give numbers, and if I give
numbers, I don't want to give dates, so I think there's a lot of good out there, but I'd be hesitant to zero in on absolute
numbers at this point.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. And then on your kind of more traditional rig package or on the Rig Tech revenue
flow-through, Rig Tech is getting a little bit complicated these days, a lot of moving parts. Just in your traditional rig

package business, Clay, you've talked about the headwinds that you've been facing and obviously in installation and
commissioning, but there's also some tailwinds coming up as you start seeing better pricing starting to float through.
How do we think about that part of your business, of kind of headwinds turning into tailwinds? Is there – is this kind of
a two – second quarter event as you see it playing out or is it over the first half?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: David, we see sort of a gradual improvement in that business bolstered by two things. One is
we can measure margin in our backlog and we have seen that turn and start to move up and it's not a big move. It's a –
$16.2 billion backlog, is a big animal to turn, but it's going the right direction in the last six months.
And then the second thing is we know from experience learning curve effects are real, and as we start making second
and third and fifth copies of these rig designs as our supply chain sort of evens out, given the extraordinary level of
work, we know that will have a positive impact on the P&L. And so when we kind of dial all of that calculus in, we're –
I'd say over the next several quarters, we should continue to march up – back up in EBIT margin.
<Q - David Anderson>: Great. Thank you, Clay and Pete, best of luck on your new venture there.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Thank you, I appreciate it, David.
