MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google Inc. Q1 2014 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this
time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jane Penner, Director of IR. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Jane Penner
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick
Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief
Business Officer.
Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at
investor.google.com, so please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that
accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations page for the latest company news and updates.
Please check it out. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on
our website later today.
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered
forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the

expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a
number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these
forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation
to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information
or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for more detailed descriptions of the risk factors that may affect our
results.
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin are
expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and
restructuring. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which
we referred to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found
in our earnings press release.
With that, I will turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we jump into my usual
remarks, I'd like to bring two points to everybody's attention. First, a reminder that on April 2, we issued our Class C
stock dividend. With twice as many shares outstanding, our usual per share information will look quite different
starting this quarter. Also, second, and also as a reminder, our expected sale of the Motorola business, Mobile business
to Lenovo triggered discontinued operations accounting treatment, which means Motorola's quarterly results are shown
separately from Google's net income. You'll see this new presentation in our financials starting this quarter.
So with these two caveats noted, let's dive into the details of Google's financial performance in Q1. Our gross total
consolidated revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year to $15.4 billion, and it was down 2% quarter-over-quarter.
Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would, in fact, have been 21%
year-over-year. Google sites revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $10.5 billion and was down 1%
quarter-over-quarter, driven by the strength in our core search advertising business. Network revenue was up 4%
year-over-year at $3.4 billion, and was down 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by improved year-over-year growth from
our Ad Exchange and AdMob businesses. Finally, Google's other revenue grew 48% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and
was down 6% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play Store drove year-over-year growth.
Chromecast sales were also strong. Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter again, up 26%
year-over-year and down just 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 9% year-over-year and
flat quarter-over-quarter. Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. Our monetization metrics
continue to be impacted by a number of factors discussed on previous calls, including geographic mix, device mix,
property mix, as well as products and policy changes. And to help investors better understand the complex dynamics of
these monetization metrics, we'll begin disclosing paid clicks and CPC growth by property in Q2. To be clear, this
means that we'll disclose CPC and paid click growth rates for both our sites and our network businesses. We will
continue to disclose, obviously, the aggregate growth rates for CPC and paid clicks.
Turning to the geographic performance, we saw strong performance in the U.S. and the rest of world, solid
performance in the U.K. In our earnings slides which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that
we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our
hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. U.S. revenue was up 14% year-over-year to
$6.7 billion. The U.K. was up 14% year-over-year to $1.6 billion. And in fixed FX terms, it grew 11% year-over-year.
Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 25% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. This accounted for 47% of our
total revenue, which includes a $8 million benefit from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of world
grew in fact 30% year-over-year.
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.2 billion, 23% of total advertising revenue. Our
non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.6 billion in Q1, excluding our stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP

operating expenses totaled $4.6 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation. And as a result, our non-GAAP
operating profit was $5 billion and our non-GAAP operating margins were 32% in Q1.
Just a quick word on a few items that may have created noise in our operating expenses this quarter. We had some
discrete legal expenses that hit our G&A line as well as one-time M&A related costs that increased our operating
expenses, particularly in R&D. So absent these discrete items, our expenses continue to demonstrate the same
disciplined agenda we've always had.
Headcount was up roughly 2,100 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 50,000 full-time
employees, and please note that the head count still includes approximately 3,700 full-time employees from the
Motorola business as well as the employees from the acquisition completed in this quarter. Our effective tax rate was
18% in Q1, and our tax rate this quarter was impacted, obviously, by the federal R&D credits which expired in 2013.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $357 million for the quarter, and realized gains
on investments and interest income offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. For more
details on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. We continue to be happy with
our strong operating cash flow at $4.4 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.3 billion. This quarter, again, the majority
of CapEx was related to data center construction, production equipment, and real-estate purchases. As I mentioned last
quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest in the long-term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic
area of investment for us. Our free cash flow was $2 billion for Q1.
And before I close, want to give a brief update on Motorola. Motorola had a great quarter in Q1 with the Moto G
showing strong sales momentum, especially in emerging markets. The team continues to be hard at work, and we look
forward to seeing them join up with Lenovo soon.
So there you have it. Strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth
opportunities including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Enterprise, just to name a few.
And now I'll cover more details – I'll let Nikesh, in fact, cover more details of our business performance in the quarter,
and after his remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. Here you go, Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. You're welcome to cover more details if you'd like. Our business is growing well with $15.4 billion
in gross revenue. We had a particularly good advertising performance in the United States, highlighted by a very strong
auto sector showing around the Super Bowl. We had strong Play growth in Asia, and we had a few isolated tracks. By
now, you're aware of the four areas driving our business. The first one direct response, or as I like to call it,
performance marketing. The second one, helping clients build their brand. Third, our ad tech platforms for publishers
and agencies. And fourth, our emerging businesses like digital content, enterprise, and hardware.
Let me give you an update on all of those, and talk about industry trends that are driving the investments we're making.
On performance advertising, people are now always online. They want a seamless, easy experience as they move from
screen to screen. This constant connectivity is driving our investments here, as people use search to navigate their
world, Google is really well positioned to help people navigate between web, apps, and the places around them. They
help marketeers measure the entire customer journey and to drive better monetization.
Next week we'll be welcoming hundreds of advertisers to our AdWords performance forum, where we'll talk more
about our work in this area for marketeers. But clients are already benefiting from our recent investments like
Enhanced Campaigns and Estimated Total Conversions. For instance, Shutterfly recently began measuring cross-device
conversions in AdWords to understand sales that start on one device and end on another. As a result, they saw a 60%
increase in mobile conversions for non-brand terms leading them to include 100% of their keywords on mobile devices.
We are seeing great momentum in product listing ads as well with the new shopping campaign system. International
retailer, Farfetch, upgraded their shopping campaigns, increased their conversion rate by 13% while reducing their
cost-per-acquisition, or CPA, by 20%. And, Domino's Pizza – who doesn't like pizza? – recently made it easier for

customers to pay with Google Wallet Instant Buy in their Android app.
Moving on to brand building. For years, you've all seen the rise of digital video, over-the-top networks, connected
screens, streaming devices, and high-quality digital programming. Already for example, YouTube reaches more than 1
billion people a month through hugely popular channels like fashion guru, Bethany Mota; cooking maven, Rosanna
Pansino; and the cult hit, Nerdist. For marketeers, this is an irresistible trend, and we're now at a significant industry
moment. Marketeers and agencies that have historically built their brand on TV are reorienting their creative, planning,
and investments to put digital at the center. This year, nearly all Super Bowl advertisers turned to YouTube to extend
the life and reach of their TV spots and Super Bowl-related ads on YouTube have been viewed over 300 million times.
That's roughly three times the size of the audience that watched the ads on TV.
In Australia, we worked with Nissan to create made-for-YouTube video for the launch of their new Patrol SUV. The
campaign, which was promoted by TrueView ads and the YouTube masthead, drove a 340% increase in daily visits to
their website and more than 2% of those were interactive with the campaign booked a test drive.
In a few weeks, in New York, at our annual Brandcast upfront event, we'll focus on our new Google Preferred offering.
This features exclusive access to the best, most engaging content on YouTube with guaranteed audiences through
third-party measurement providers, Nielsen and comScore. We're really excited about this and we're looking forward to
the results of that upfront Brandcast event. We're also helping brands through our newest display ad formats. We
recently teamed with Tory Burch to bring her New York Fashion Week show to a global audience across our display
network. They hosted the first-ever live stream of a fashion show in an ad using our Lightbox ads and were able to
share the exclusive event with more than seven million of their biggest fans.
Third, moving to our ad technologies and platforms. Our programmatic ad technologies continue to see great
momentum with premium publisher partners like the Local Media Consortium, that's comprised of more than 800 daily
newspapers and 200 local broadcast stations, as well as Time, Inc. Both of them signed on with us in February to create
private exchanges. This maximizes the value of their ad space through a handpicked premium environment.
One thing we know is that agencies and publishers want a trusty environment in which they're transacting. Our ad
network and exchanges are widely regarded across the industry as having the best quality controls, and we continue to
invest here. In February, we acquired well-known fraud fighter spider.io and thousands of our clients are already using
our MRC-accredited Active View technology to buy high-quality viewable ad impressions.
Let me switch over to our emerging new businesses, digital content, hardware and enterprise. Google Play continues to
be the thriving hub of our digital content business. This quarter, we introduced Google Play Movies to 39 new
countries, so now people in more than 65 countries can enjoy movies through Play. We also teamed up with Sonos to
bring high-fidelity Play Music into the home and we introduced new developer tools for Google Play Games, including
game gifting and iOS multi-player support. Over 75 million new users joined Google Play Games in the last six
months. All of this is helping turn developers around the world into full-fledged businesses. In fact, we paid out more
than four-times as much money to developers in 2013 compared to 2012.
And following the Open Automotive Alliance that we announced with partners in January designed to bring Android to
the car, in March we announced Android Wear, a project that extends Android to wearables. We're also already
working with several consumer electronics manufacturers, chip makers and fashion brands and can't wait to see what
developers come up with for your wrist. We also continue to see strong momentum from our suite of hardware
products. Our $35 Chromecast is a real hit. Last month we brought Chromecast to 11 more countries. We also recently
opened up Chromecast to developers and, in just a few weeks, more than 3,000 developers worldwide signed up to
bring their apps and websites to the platform.
Turning over to enterprise, we continue to see strong product adoption around the globe. We launched Chromebox for
Meetings, which makes it easy for any company to have high-definition video meetings through the power of Google+
Hangouts and Google Apps.
We're also investing significantly in the Google Cloud Platform and have seen a very positive response to our most
recent product announcements. We expect to see continued momentum in this area, and we believe we can bring

significant value to the many companies adopting public cloud because of our experience in building and operating one
of the world's largest cloud computing environments for over a decade. We're able to pass on the savings that come
from lower digital storage costs to our customers through highly competitive pricing. In addition, every day more
businesses, governments and schools start using Google Apps to work better together, including the state of São Paulo,
who moved to Google Apps for more than four million students and 300,000 teachers and staff.
Before I close, I want to call out our marketing team, who continues to highlight the magic of Google to people around
the world, on the fourth annual Google Science Fair, to Doodle 4 Google in the United States, the hugely popular ad
campaigns. They've also helped to build great retail experience for Chromecast in over 6,000 stores.
I'd like to thank all Googlers around the world who helped make this a terrific quarter. I'll now hand over back over to
Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. So we'll work with Jamie to go straight to the Q&A. Jamie?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Patrick, I was wondering if you could help us quantify some of the expenses you saw, the
one-time nature of G&A and anything else there that was really one-time just to help us understand what that run rate
would look like if that wasn't in there. And then maybe, Nikesh, if you could talk about the theme of sort of advertising
attribution and how that's going to help you potentially bring over more brand dollars and how do you think about
bringing over those television dollars? I mean is that something that's going to come sort of a big rush in 2014 or is this
going to be a slow evolution over many years? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Great. Thanks. Ben, why don't I start? Look, on the discrete legal expense that impacted, it
really impacted our G&A. And then the one-time M&A deal costs impacted all of our operating lines. But most
prominently, our R&D line, which you'll notice will have jumped a bit. The one-time M&A deal costs are largely
stemming from the Nest deal, which was a pretty large transaction for us is quarter. But I think that the best way to
describe it is that our expenses in Q1, they're completely in line with our objectives if you'd kind of take apart these two
items. So that's how describe it. Nikesh?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thank you, Patrick. Thank you, Ben. The brand question is a very good question. What we've
noticed in the past, let's just say, a year, year and a half, is that people have slowly started coming to the digital medium
to create extension of their existing brand campaigns. Like I mentioned the Super Bowl ad, people come to YouTube
and say, I'd like to reach certain audiences which are only available on digital medium. Hence, we see those advertising
dollars shifting as in enhancing existing television or media campaigns. The real fun will begin when people start doing
campaigns exclusively on digital to go out and help them build brands. That requires us to get ahead of the curve and
get into the creative process much earlier because usually what we end up doing now as we get to the end of the
creative process and they just want to extend their brand.
So we're working really hard to work with creative ad agencies or the large agency groups as well as our advertisers to
say how can we get ahead of that creative process, how can we help you conceive of brand campaigns that actually start
and end in digital where perhaps you use TV as an extension medium as opposed to the other way around. I think this is
definitely the Holy Grail. This is going to take us a little bit of time to get there, but with things like attribution in place
with our deals with Nielsen and comScore, we are beginning to create the comparability saying, look, the same dollar
you spend on television equates to so many dollars on digital or vice versa, the fact that we can give them sort of

cross-media measurement capability, we can give them comfort that their dollars are being well spent, even better spent
on digital and will go a long way in making sure we get them to transition from just using traditional media to including
digital in their media mix and eventually designing campaigns that start and end in digital.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Nikesh. Jamie, let's go to our next question. Thank you, Ben, for your question.
Operator
And we'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two things I wanted to ask. First, Patrick, just
on the U.S., you had commented on the strength here in terms of 14% year-over-year, but it does look like on a
sequential basis we saw a little bit more of a decel than in recent 1Qs. Can you just comment if there's any factors there
to point out? And then, Nikesh, can you just talk about the key drivers of mobile pricing going forward? How you think
the gap can close with desktop over the coming quarters and years? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: All right. Thank you, Doug, for your questions. So in the case of the U.S., if you think about
it, you have the Q4 to Q1 issues that are typical. And then as we've said before, the network business does skew toward
the U.S. on a relative basis. So, network, clearly, grew slower than sites. So that's what really what you see is that mix
of the two, but in aggregate, right, pretty pleased with the U.S. growth overall, so that was a pretty strong quarter, really
happy with it. I'll let Nikesh answer the mobile question.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, Doug, I think – thank you, again, for the question – I've had a firm belief and I continue to
hold on to it that I believe in the medium- to long-term, mobile pricing has to be better than desktop pricing. And I
think the reason, the way to think about it is that in mobile you have location and you have context of individuals which
you don't have in the desktop. And the more you know about the user and their context, the more effective advertising
can provide them. The better the conversion is likely to be for a search or any piece of advertising that you do. There's a
whole bunch of building blocks that need to come into play for us like you said to get the gap to close.
The good news is a lot of people are spending a lot of time on mobile devices. There's a lot of search queries that we
get. People are more and more focused about what they look for on mobile devices. They're closer to intend, they're
closer to transaction. You see that there's a lot of frictionless ways of paying and converting transactions into
commerce, which is happening with things like Instant Buy, et cetera. You're also seeing that a lot of the advertisers are
seeing true value of making sure that they're present in a great experience on the mobile device. So part of our
challenge has been that we've had this huge mass of advertisers in the desktop which over the last decade have become
better at advertising, understanding optimization, understanding conversion, understanding transaction. That journey is
just beginning for advertisers on the mobile side. They're just beginning to understand what it takes for the end-user to
come transact on their website.
So, sort of like, right now, we can lead the horse to water, we can't make it drink, but with all the advertisers coming on
board and working with us, we are actually beginning to show them real transactions, and as that begins to gain
traction, I think we begin that see that gap continue to converge.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Doug, for your question. Jamie, let's go to the next question.
Operator
We'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Great. Thanks, guys. I had a question on the Google Play app store revenues. And, Nikesh,
you just mentioned that you guys paid out 300% more revenue to developers in 2013 versus 2012. So I guess how
much is Play contributing to the overall licensing in other line? And there's clearly some lines, or some items in that

line that are not growing nearly as fast to get to the current 48% average, so can you talk about maybe what's
underperforming in that area? And then last question on this topic is, I think if you go back to the infamous Andy
Rubin slides from the Oracle case, the rev share was around 5% for Google Play app store rev share. Where's that now,
and is it changing as the Android ecosystem gets larger? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So why don't I take a shot at this? Ross, the – if you think of our other revenue estimates for
this quarter, right? First of all, it's we're really delighted by the Play business. So, and you'll remember that a year ago,
we had – I mean, I'm going to bring back everybody to Q1 of 2013, we had a lot of Nexus 4 hardware sales because we
were in stock out in Q4. And that in combination with the accounting change of our Play app content revenue
recognition, again, remember to Q1 of last year, both just simply created a bit of a tougher year-over-year comfort this
quarter, but overall, very pleased with all of the kind of big lines of growth in this space. As per the rev share, I mean
obviously this accounting change kind of goes to 30% rather than the what you would have seen before, which would
have been the net. And, but we don't divulge what the percentages are that we keep going forward. So that's basically
where we stand on it, and that's why we're pretty pleased with this line for this quarter.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: And if I could add too, Patrick, I think the important part is it's taken us a while to get all the
capabilities in place around the world in different markets, making sure we have all the content we need, we have all
the app providers [ph] meet (24:01), as well as we have the payment mechanisms. So really are excited about the
Google Play business going forward.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, thanks, Ross. Jamie, let's go to our next question.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark May with Citi.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks. A question regarding the CPC segmentation for next quarter. While you might not be in
a position to provide the specific data points for Q1, I was hoping that maybe you could give us directionally how the
CPCs have trended between beyond the network businesses and kind of what your expectation is going forward?
Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So, Mark, you'll get the information in Q2. What we really wanted to do was a recognition as
we think about getting more transparency to our shareholders, just looking at having exactly as you just mentioned the
split between kind of our core sites and then the network itself. I think it will be useful for everybody, and then
obviously we'll have the information going forward. So a lot of insights going to come out of that, and we're very
pleased to be able to share it with you starting next quarter. We've just made this decision over the last little while and
shared it with the audit committee of the board so just stay tuned for next quarter on it.
<Q - Mark A. May>: There are a number of dynamics that play into the blended CPC that you've called out before
property, policy, geo, and device, among others. Once you provide this new layer of transparency, does that really
capture the major, is it really the property and maybe to some degree policy differences that are influencing CPCs
between owned and network? Or will geo and devices continue to play a major role in the reported CPC even once you
provide this extra segmentation?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Well, they all will. And if we do make changes to policies that affect network, you'll see them
much more, in a much more transparent way. So in that sense, it's a very positive kind of news. Whether devices kind
of have effects on network versus others, you'll – it'll be much more difficult to see. But, clearly, the impacts that are
driven specifically for network or for sites, you'll be able to see on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So I think that's good
news for our investors.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: All right, thank you so much for your question, Mark. Jamie, why don't we go to our next
question, please?

And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks. Two questions on the U.K. revenue growth, that 11% number, and on the partner
websites, that 4%. Is there anything you'd want to call out as being unusual tracks on those growth rates? I think that
U.K.'s the lowest we've seen and maybe that's just law of large numbers and really successful execution in that market,
but anything you'd want to call out for either of those two revenue streams? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: As I said, well, let me just start with the U.K. The U.K. – look, combination of partner mix
this quarter as well as, again, year-over-year matters a lot, and we happen to have a year-ago a real revenue-favorable
weather, I mean people kind of tend to forget it, but last year we had a very strong Q1 for the U.K. And the
combination of these two things just kind of year-over-year made the comparison a little tighter for this quarter.
As it relates to websites, partner websites, I covered that a bit earlier, and we're, I mean, again, you go back to last year,
where network, if you think of Ad Exchange and AdMob continues to be very strong. And you'll remember again last
year that we started the DLA policy change in Q1, or maybe it was in Q4. But the impact of the DLA actually takes
time to flow through. We said that it would take multi-quarters, so this is not kind of flowed over completely. So what
you have again there is very strong on the course where we want, so the Ad Exchange and the AdMob. But on the
flipside of that, right, you still have the tails of the DLA change policy that from a year-ago, but the effects have not
fully flowed through, so even in the coming quarters, you should see a bit of an effect there. But, overall, pretty pleased
with actually these results, Mark.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thank you, Patrick.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.

And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Thank you. I have two questions. First, in the last eight quarters, head count have grown
significantly slower than revenue, but this quarter you hired I think 2,300 people in the quarter and head count grew
with revenues. Was this change in hiring rate mostly because of acquisitions and marginally what prevents you from
hiring 2,300 people a quarter or even more as the business grows? And secondly, Patrick, in the spirit of giving more
transparency to shareholders can you give us some color on what has driven such a sustained increase on CapEx over
the last four quarters? Because I think clearly it's not just some lumpy behavior. Are you buying data center sites in
advance of demand, and if this is the case, can we infer that CapEx will revert to historical levels? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Carlos, for both of these questions. So to the head count question, I think you've
basically nailed it intuitively, which is the acquisition of Nest, the acquisitions this quarter had quite a bit of people
impact on this number. Our – or kind of if you think of our organic numbers have actually not changed in any material
way. So it just happened, you buy Nest and it comes with a lot of people. We also had, you'll remember, the acquisition
of DeepMind and a few others. So for us, we had the double-hitter of having the opportunity to continue to attract
people on an organic basis through our processes and these few acquisitions kind of move the needle quite a bit for us
this quarter.
As it relates to CapEx, listen, you're right that we – and I've mentioned this in the last couple of quarters, where we
have – and just a reminder to everybody, right, if you think of the CapEx categories, right, data centers first and data
center construction, then production equipment, then all other facilities, is kind of like the hierarchy of needs.
And in the case of data center construction, we have found that the option value of having more capacity on standby
and available to us to grow versus not having it is actually a real strategic issue for the company. And in that sense, if
for whatever reason we continue – we had a spike in demand that was really pronounced and sustained for a couple of

quarters, and we did not have the capacity, it would be a real issue strategically for us relative to the quite low-cost of
having the infrastructure in place. So that's why we're really pushing ahead of the curve, and so it's with this view of
long-term. So from that perspective, you're also right that that's the mindset we're applying. And we've always said that
CapEx was lumpy. So you have a good manifestation of it right now, right here. So thank you for those two questions,
Carlos.

And we'll go next to Steven Ju with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Okay. Thanks, guys. So, Nikesh, so in order to attract greater brand advertising dollars, it seems
like safety and context are also important factors, because you're certainly not falling short on reach. So how close do
you think you are to either engineering or coming up with some sort of a solution to contextualize all the video content
on YouTube so you can guarantee your advertisers brand safety? Thanks.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: That's a good question. I think, as I alluded to, we are going to do an upfront in a few weeks in
New York City, called Google Preferred, which is sort of our way of trying to create a premium sort of concentration of
content that we can have advertisers advertise against which gives them a higher level of brand safety, a better level of
measurement, and hopefully a place where they believe that they can actually build brands and hopefully that will
manifest itself in our ability to have a premium compared to what we can attract to the market without providing those
kinds of things. So that's a very good question. I think that's what we're hoping to achieve, and stay tuned for our
detailed announcement at Brandcast.

And we'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. I have three quick things. Did Enhanced Campaigns, which you rolled out over the summer,
impact Q4? And do you see some more benefits coming this year? Second, on PLAs, we think you had very good
success in the U.S. in Q4. Do you still have some benefits to come from that as you roll that out in Europe? How are
you looking at the timing there versus how you rolled it out in the U.S? And finally, in the first quarter, maybe you
could call out some specific verticals that might have been strong or weak for you? Thank you.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: It's a good question, Justin, thank you. I'm not sure I can give you a lot of detail in terms of the
precise impacts of any individual product that we have, but the Enhanced Campaigns are working. It was a necessity
that we had to do them, both for process reasons as well as the reasons that consumers are going from screen to screen
as well as advertisers need to advertise across multiple screens. So from that perspective, Enhanced Campaigns is
working. It's part of life here. We don't do anything without Enhanced Campaigns across the board. It's sort of gone
from being Enhanced Campaigns to regular campaigns because we don't have any un-enhanced campaigns anymore.
In terms of PLAs, it's something, as I alluded to, that's actually working. It's providing a lot of color in the shopping
vertical. It's providing a lot of [indiscernible] (33:33) shopping campaign effort that we have. PLA is working for us
and it's sort of working from multiple perspectives. It's providing users the detailed information that they need when
they're declaring intent and saying, I'd like to search for a particular product, please don't send me to a website. So, it is
working. We are going to roll that out one separate time around the world. I cannot comment on the timing exactly, but
I think both of those things are having positive impact in our minds to everything we're doing around here.

<A - Patrick Pichette>: Just to close on this, just a few verticals here, I mean again, completely reflecting the economy
around us, if you go to – automobile has been quite strong across the world. Travel actually quite strong in the U.S. – in
the U.K., as well as in the rest of the world, a little bit less in the U.S., but just to give you a sense of it; and then real
estate, clearly in the U.S., has been a strong vertical as well as in the U.K. So, again, a good reflection of the economy
there, Justin. So Google Trends, I always encourage people to go and check out Google Trends as well because they
continue to give good insights as to what's going on in the economy which would mirror in terms of verticals.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Nikesh.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Justin. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the question, guys. So two ones, one for Nikesh. Nikesh, we'd love to get
your view on sort of your view of the travel industry, sort of how you're approaching that industry as a participant from
an economic basis in that industry, both the marketing funnel and potentially the booking funnel longer term. There's
been a lot sort of written lately about the way in which you guys might approach that industry vertical. And then
second, Patrick, for you, maybe taking a stab at the one-time expenses from a different approach. When we look at the
model, if we take your comments before about sort of smoothing out the expenses we saw on the back part of the year
and even year-on-year, it appears the one-time expenses might have been about a 50-basis-point to 100-basis-point
impact on each of those two lines, which would've sort of brought the blended number back up to somewhere between
75 basis points to 150 basis points on margins, but I just wanted to take a stab at that from a different direction just to
quantify it. Thanks, guys.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thanks, Eric. Thanks for the question. I was actually – while you're talking I was talking I was
pulling up the article in which recently where Darren Huston talked about the effectiveness of Google advertising for
Priceline. I think that's a public endorsement that all our efforts in the last many years around the travel industry are
actually working. They see tremendous value in our ability to help them bring more travelers to their sites and for them
to help convert them into real transactions. So, whatever we're doing is working.
I'm suspecting that the comments you're talking about is our continued efforts in providing more and more detailed
information when people do searches. And as we've talked in the past before that people's information needs are getting
more and more precise and we have to keep evolving the results at Google, whether it's Knowledge Cards or Google
Now, all of the things that we do towards giving them more and more precise answers, in which case sometimes we are
required to go work with various industries to get the underlying data to surface it when the users are looking as
opposed to send them to other sites where they have to go through that search process again.
So, I think you can expect us to continue to do that but our intent there is to provide a better answer for the users
whether it's on their desktop or mobile devices. Accordingly, we also work together with the advertisers to provide
them various advertising activities which allow them to work effectively with the end-user and provide them the
answer that they're looking for or perhaps in this case, the ticket or the hotel booking that they're looking for.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Great. And on my side, Eric, look, as I said in my earlier comment, our Q1 expenses were
completely in line with our objectives, and there's always seasonality as you've noticed. From Q4 to Q1, there's always
– we spend less on marketing and so that's true for this year as well. And for the other areas, right, we would have been
in line with the objectives we set for ourselves, so these one-time costs were genuinely in that spirit truly one-time, and
I mean when you acquire Nest for a bit over $3 billion, there's just a lot of stuff that flows through the P&L, a lot of
accounting, and so that's really the issue there. So I would go back to your instinct of at least kind of we should be
roughly in line with what our expectations were, and that's why the nature of truly extraordinary items. So thanks for
that question.

And we'll go next to the Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Peter C. Stabler>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to revisit attribution for a moment.
There are different aspects to attribution and I think you guys are doing a great job on the cross-screen attribution and
taking advantage of your ubiquitous logins across different platforms and Enhanced Campaigns. Wanted to get a better
understanding of how you're thinking about online versus offline attribution for those types of marketers, particularly
brand advertisers, supermarket advertisers, the 30,000 SKUs in those retail channels that don't have e-commerce and
really don't have much of a search opportunity. How are you helping them close the gap between their online activity
and offline sales? Thanks very much.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thanks, Peter. Thanks again for the question. I think as you rightfully pointed out, the attribution
story on the advertising side is kind of becoming clearer as we partner with Nielsen and comScore, adopted some the
mechanisms that traditional media has used to create the comparability between traditional and new media. I think you
identify a good challenge, which is that, how do we bridge the gap between online commerce and offline commerce
and relate that to the advertising opportunity, i.e., when we sell search and when we sell traffic to different people, how
do we convince them, how do we make them realize that that traffic that they bought not only results in online sales but
also results in offline sales in stores and how do we encourage that activity? So over the past many years around the
world, we have run specific studies working with various advertisers which I call online to store studies where we
actually try and measure what online activity created by them to control groups could results in more foot traffic in
their particular stores in certain regions around and we've pretty much had very good results across the board.
I can't detail specifics right now because they're all specific to individual advertisers we work with, but we do
understand that opportunity in the problem and you work specifically with third-party research teams to work on
figuring out how do we keep showing the online to store efficacy. And there are other products as you can see where
we start doing conversion, we start looking at things like Google Shopping Express which also helps in those areas.
Thanks again.

And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to go back to an earlier question, you responded
about the building blocks that were needed in order to get mobile pricing, mobile CPCs to converge with desktop. I was
just wondering if you could share with us kind of specifically what you think those building blocks are that need to
happen over the medium- to long-term, as you said, to see that convergence occur? Thank you.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Of course. Thanks, Heather, for the question. I mean, look, there are some very simple things
and then there are some complicated things. The simple things are, we would make sure that there is payment
enablement for users so, i.e., users have a mechanism that allows them to pay with the lowest amount of friction
because honestly you and I don't want to spend our lives trying to enter payment information on a very small screen
where we are trying to conduct a transaction. So that enablement is happening across the industry across multiple
payment platforms. There's also the need that when people search for some things they can get quickly down to the
information, they don't have to browse multiple sites because people are more keen on declaring intent on mobile

devices than going and surfing multiple websites and trying to figure out what they're trying to do. And that intent
could be in the form of restaurant, could be in form of a taxi, could be in the form of them looking for individual
product.
And you're beginning to see apps, you're beginning to see solutions in search that allow you to get that granularity of
information. Now, of course, there's a big building block which is getting all the people out there which are the
advertisers effectively in this case the merchants who actually have to have experiences in the mobile side which are
simpler to execute on. So try buying something on many companies' mobile website, and it's more onerous than their
desktop site because they've been spending a decade trying to optimize their desktop site, where they haven't spent
enough time optimizing their mobile experience, in some cases not believing that people want to transact with them on
their mobile devices, and in some cases they're just slow and they're just slowly diverting resources from desktop to
mobile.
So if you take all those things and if you take the notion that we need to keep sort of working hard towards getting
these building blocks in place, I think there's a finite time where these building blocks will come into place. And as
they keep coming into place, you will see, or as we talked about earlier, perhaps the convergence will happen between
pricing in mobile and desktop. There's a whole bunch of other issues that go into it, but I think those are the big things
that we can think of right now.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks your question, Heather. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on the Cloud Platform. Since this is obviously a
huge revenue opportunity for you. And, first off, if you could put some context around the impact of this business on
CapEx and OpEx, particularly on the infrastructure-as-a-service part of the business. And then, secondly, if you could
talk about how you're planning to differentiate this service? Is it really about pricing? Or is it by tying in the software
and platform-as-a-service offerings? If you get touch on that, thanks very much.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: I can cover the first part, and then I'll let Nikesh cover the second. Look, we're very
comfortable with our cost structure. In light of Google efficiencies, economies of scale, our vertical integration from
data center to chip to servers to software, I mean, we really have – we believe we have an absolutely unique position
from a cost structure perspective, and therefore from a margin perspective makes us very, very comfortable. In terms of
differentiation, I'll just let Nikesh jump in here.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: I think, Colin, thank you again for the question, the important part at least to acknowledge in the
space of cloud computing is we think it's very, very, very early days. I mean if you think about the potential scope and
scale of what this opportunity is that pretty much every business which is going to be around for the long-term has to
operate in the cloud. I mean there's no efficiency compared to the efficiency of the cloud, but in compared to owning
your own infrastructure and running it by yourself. So the shift is going to happen. It's a matter of every company going
to through that shift one at a time. And if you look at the opportunities out there and the options, there's very few
options.
So there's a lot of room for all of us to have a great time for many, many, many years before we start worrying about
differentiation and why my sort of thing is better than yours. So, right now, the key is to be able to work with the
companies out there, the enterprise customers out there to get them to shift off their legacy systems, get onto the cloud
and realize that Google has been working in the cloud for more than a decade, because we have been running one of the
largest cloud computing platforms in the world, in the public space. And we have all the expertise and the skills that are
required to be able to serve these enterprises and get them off their current legacy systems onto the cloud. So our effort
is really trying to work with each of these third-party partners try and get them off their legacy systems onto our cloud.
I don't think the challenge right now is the need to differentiate. I think our biggest differentiator is we have the most

<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Colin. Jamie, we'll go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jordan Monahan with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Jordan C. Monahan>: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Actually, two, if I may. A couple of big picture
questions, I think, for Nikesh. The first is that I think there is an ongoing debate about whether a mobile web or mobile
app is going to win and what the implications are for various businesses, Google included. And I'm just curious to get
your view on whether you think one will win over the other and then whether it matters for Google. And then the
second is when you look at Google's share of global advertising, you're coming up on about 10% of total, but when you
look at your business in the U.K., you're north of 20% of total. So when you think about your global businesses as
economies start to mature, do you think the U.K. is a fair proxy for thinking about your business globally? Or are there
other factors that you think may prevent you from getting to that type of scale globally?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: I guess let me answer the second question first, Jordan, because I'm standing here, Patrick is
looking at me asking the same question. I think the way to think about it is that we have 10% by some metric
depending on what you believe the total is. As per your metric, we have 10% of the total advertising sort of money, and
in the U.K. we have 20%, that just tells me there's 90% more opportunity around the world and 80% more opportunity
in the U.K. So we're not going to constrain our thinking in terms of what we believe is the stable state. Our aspiration is
to be able to serve every advertiser in the long-term, and our aspiration is that, our hope is that, every piece of
advertising becomes digital advertising. The question is, how much of that are we able to provide through our
technology platforms? How much are we able to provide through our own sort of properties and how much do we
partner with others to provide on their network? So I guess I'm trying to tell you that we don't constrain ourselves in our
thinking. I'm not trying to be arrogant and say we want 100%, but we'd like more than what we have in every market
out there.
In terms of your question around the mobile web and mobile search, that is a tough question and that is a very involved
question. And I think the approach, the best way to think about it is that, we're trying to make sure that we can make
both of them effective for the end-user and make them both work, because we're not about to try and pick winners.
Right now you can see that people spend as much time on mobile devices, and more time mobile devices than they've
previously spent on the desktop, and they're spending their time across the mobile web as well as the mobile app
landscape. We're participating in both those ecosystems, whether it's through our Play Store on the app front, whether
it's through our browser-based search properties, or through our app-based search properties. So we're participating
across the board, and I think at the end of the day, it's going to boil down to ease of use and consumer choice.

DoubleClick revenues, where are those today, and where could they be over time? And then on the cost side, Patrick,

at the ROIC of capital going forward? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Okay. Well, Robert, let's start with the last one first, and then we'll go back to revenue. ROI,
clearly we have – we always look at capital intensity. The fact that we're investing quite a bit in CapEx right now, right,
is a real tribute to kind of the potential and the optimism we have about our businesses going forward. Most of our core
businesses, if you think of YouTube or advertising or search, right, are not that capital-intensive relative to other areas
that we have such as, for example, Google Fiber, if you think of the access portion, right, which is much more
traditional CapEx.
For each of these areas, we actually track and make sure that we have good returns and we have a capital efficient. So
even though an area that – take the advertising business that we run – even though you could argue that it's
phenomenally good on return on capital, the questions that we will ask internally is, okay, so if the utilization rate is X
on our machines on this business, right, why can't it be X plus something? So even though we have already good return
on capital in these areas, we continue to always push the envelope to make sure that our capital efficiency continues to
be better and better on a year-to-year basis. And then across the portfolio, every area has some capital kind of targets to
make sure that we're driving for value.
Finally, there's a number of areas if you think of – take mostly the newer stuff like Loon, for example. In those cases,
you test through the hurdles that we kind of – we seed capital to the Loon team as they hit their hurdles and they kind
of earned their right to the next cost of funding. And in doing so, right, we continue to always have the business case in
mind that says, hey, here's why this continues to make sense to fund and invest, and with an ROIC or value in mind for
the long-term. But in the short-term, it's really kind of delivery of milestones on very specific engineering objectives
that actually gives them the next round of funding.
So, Robert, as you can see, given the portfolio of mature stuff we have, and growing areas as well as kind of much
more R&D and innovation at the early stages, right, we just need to have a basket of tools to actually manage the
concept of ROIC or ROI on each of them. And that's what we do. I mean it's not rocket science, it just requires a lot of
discipline on our part.
On the revenue side, look, we don't breakout DoubleClick or YouTube. I can just tell you, as I had mentioned a bit
earlier, we're really pleased with our network revenue in the kind of AdMob, Ad Exchange; many of our areas, right,
continue to grow very well and we're very, very pleased by these investments, and clearly continue to be very pleased
with YouTube as mentioned – Nikesh mentioned a bit earlier.
<Q - Robert Peck>: Thank you very much.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: That's the story there. Thank you. Jamie, we'll take one last question. We're running out of
time so we'll take one last question if you don't mind?

And our final question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Hey. Good afternoon. Another question regarding trends in mobile CPCs. I know yesterday
you announced an offline conversion tracking plan and program with Datalogix. Is that something potentially the whole
online to offline tracking that could have a positive impact on CPCs? And separately, any updates on how you think
about Fiber longer-term? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Okay. So why don't I take the last portion, and then Nikesh may have views on this data
conversion plan. On Fiber, look, you've heard our announcement earlier this quarter where we're working with 34 cities
and looking for working with these municipalities. I mean they've indicated to us they're really excited about – they
kind of self-selected to be really excited about getting Fiber, and the next-generation of access. So right now we're
basically working directly with them to look if we have the right conditions to actually go to the next stage, which
would be the build. So very excited about it. I think that it's a really good sign of things to come in access in general. I

think that everybody now in the industry is talking about the gig. It's becoming the standard and we're absolutely
thrilled for all of the users out there that can think that they'll one day get a gigabit of symmetrical Internet at a
reasonable price. So stay tuned on the next part of the chapter, but really excited to work with these communities. And,
Nikesh, maybe you want to talk about...
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah. Thank you, Gene. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, and the question earlier from, I think it
was Heather, that the online to offline conversions are a really important opportunity where it's important for offline
merchants to be able to understand what results they get from their online activity. And some of the experiments that
we talked about would, required partnerships with third-party data providers to understand how that happens. And I
think Datalogix is one of those things which we're looking at to see how we can help quantify the opportunity and
quantify the answer for our offline partners. It's just one of those things that we are doing.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Gene.

Just in closing, before I hand it over to Jamie, just to reiterate the point that Nikesh made a bit earlier. To all of our
Googlers out there and all of our partners out there, right, thank you so much for the great work in Q1. What a great
start to the year, and then we'll see you in Q2. So thanks a million.
Jamie, I'll leave it with you to close the call, please.
