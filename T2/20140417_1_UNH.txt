Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release that we issued this morning, and in our Form 8-K
dated April 17, 2014, which may be accessed from our Investors page of the company's website. At this time, all
participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for your questions, following the
presentation.
I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group,
Stephen Hemsley.
Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. This morning, we will review the first quarter's results in the
context of our full year objectives for 2014, objectives that include continuing to diversify our services and product
offerings, continuing to develop and expand our capabilities and relationships, and further strengthened and consistent
fundamental execution in service to customers and consumers.
And we're working towards all these, while new national healthcare policies begin to come into place, and new
baselines for market behaviors and new market dynamics become realities. We plan to deliver revenues in a range of
$128 billion to $129 billion for the year, produce earnings in the range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share, and generate cash
flows from operations between $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion.
UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare, and Optum performed largely as we expected in the first quarter. We remain
on our plans for 2014, and as usual, continue to work through more challenges than benefits for the moment.
Longer-term, we continue to more clearly see evidence for the growth opportunities for both UnitedHealthcare and
Optum as we move beyond the more negative immediate-term impacts of the ACA and its implementation.
This was really the first quarter of full-scale operations under the ACA. Everything else in the past three years has been
more of a preamble. The ACA's impacts on 2014 have been immediate and significant as we described at our Investors
Conference. Non-deductible insurance taxes, ACA-prescribed Medicare Advantage funding pullbacks, commercial
underwriting changes, and various other provisions cumulatively reduced our per-share net earnings by nearly $0.30 for
this quarter, and sequestration cut an additional $0.05 in this quarter.
On a full year basis, 2014 Medicare funding actions will cut roughly $0.45 per share beyond that. This makes a grand
total of about $1.50 per share in externally-driven year-over-year pressure, fully consistent with our view at our
Investors Conference in December. The ACA impacts every major line item of our consolidated results and distorts
comparisons for virtually all performance ratios. This will continue as the year progresses and new regulatory and tax
baselines are established and settled in. But we think some very important early observations can be made about the
ACA's first quarter introduction.
First, consumers and benefit sponsors are showing by their actions, the clear value they see in private sector managed
care products and services. The capabilities of the private sector healthcare community are significant and have proven
to be highly adaptable to serving the needs and demands of consumers in all stages and situations of life, as well as
government and private benefit sponsors and the broader health system.
And ultimately, there should be advances in access to care, and the healthcare system as a whole would become more
effective and efficient and consistent over time. Early evidence of these is visible, and will produce long-term growth
opportunities for both UnitedHealthcare and Optum.
Let's review how this played out in the first quarter for UnitedHealth Group, starting with UnitedHealthcare, whose
revenues grew $1 billion or 3.6% year-over-year, to $29.3 billion, led by membership growth in Medicaid. Over the
past 12 months alone, UnitedHealthcare has implemented six new or renewed Medicaid contracts, and grown to serve
395,000 new members.
In this past quarter, we grew by 255,000 people, driven by the expanded eligibility offered in and about half the states,
where we serve Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as new membership in traditional categories. We expect growth

throughout the year, and could well-exceed the upper end of our outlook of 350,000 to 450,000 additional people
served this year.
The Congressional Budget Office forecasts 12 million people will obtain coverage through Medicaid by the end of
2016. And we will endeavor to gain market share, serving the needs of these beneficiaries and their state sponsors.
Nationally, managed Medicaid is also broadening to serve new patients with greater clinical needs, like dual eligibles.
We believe our integrated and in-the-market clinical model gives us distinct advantages in serving these higher growth,
more complex areas.
Our model integrates behavioral, pharmaceutical, medical, and social services, with a focus on the 5% of the population
that drives well over 50% of the total medical cost in the typical Medicaid programs. In Medicare, we began the year
with growth of 360,000 people across all Medicare product categories, as Part D sales were strong and Medicare
Supplement also grew nicely. Participation in our Medicare Advantage program was essentially flat, down 5,000
people sequentially and well within the range we expected, despite significant market exits and products network
adjustments made in response to the 2014 Medicare Advantage rate cuts of more than 6%.
We continue to manage our Medicare Advantage products and cost structure at the local market level, and we'll stay
focused on that task all this year and next, given the continued adverse funding climate for Medicare Advantage.
Commercial membership also began the year generally in line with our expectations, with a sharp decrease in people
served through fee-based relationships, as well as some expected decline in risk-based business.
As expected, our individual policy business declined this quarter as we decreased by 90,000 consumers with the advent
of the ACA. In the commercial market, we experienced a strong competitive period over early renewals for legacy
benefits, where many small group customers renewed early to avoid community rating and ACA price increases. These
decisions were rational, driving healthier groups to renew early, while other groups took advantage of community
rating, where that was their best course of action.
Over the last quarter, we have seen intensified pricing in several markets, including small group in New York, a large
market for us. We believe several carriers there, including new entrants, are pricing well below cost, and what we
would view as unsustainable pricing levels. If this climate continues, we could see some further pressure on risk-based
membership beyond the ranges we anticipated this year. And at Amil, we are beginning to see clear signs of response
and recovery from a surge in utilization, caused by aggressive access standards imposed nationally by the regulatory
authorities in mid-2013.
We continue to project a 6% commercial medical cost trend, plus or minus 50 basis points for 2014. First quarter usage
benefited slightly from intense winter conditions across the Midwestern and Northeastern areas of the country.
Offsetting this item was the rapid launch of an effective and very expensive new Hepatitis C therapy. The aggressive
U.S. pricing practices on this have been well-publicized, and continues to be quite controversial. We are working
diligently to ensure this medication is applied under clinically appropriate standards.
Patients were treated across the Medicaid Commercial and Medicare Part D categories at a cost of more than $100
million to us in the quarter. The federal government will bear significant expense in the Part D program, because the
high cost of this treatment causes the patient to quickly move through the doughnut hole into the 80% CMS reinsurance
corridor. Meanwhile, state Medicaid directors are at varying stages of concluding whether to include the medication on
their approved state pharmacy lists, and if so, how to pay for it.
Stepping back from these first quarter trends, our full year commercial care ratio will see pressure, caused by a
combination of the revenue impact from stronger than expected early renewal activity in December at pre-ACA rates,
the underpricing dynamic in New York, and higher than expected utilization and cost related to Hepatitis. The size and
diversity of UnitedHealth Group tends to mute the effect of the commercial variance on the consolidated care ratio, but
we expect this ratio could lean toward the higher end of the 80.5% plus or minus 50 basis point range we provided last
December.

Before I turn to Optum, I want to recognize some of our colleagues with us today, who have taken on new roles at
UnitedHealth Group, all in keeping with our long-standing philosophy of moving talented executives across the
enterprise to broaden their experience and our – and management depth. Jack Larsen has moved from the Medicare
business to head up our rapidly growing Optum Collaborative Care, which includes our care delivery businesses, a
perfect transition, given his background in Medicare and extensive M&A background.
Steve Nelson has shifted from his role leading our local market-oriented Medicaid businesses to heading our Medicare
& Retirement operation, where we are putting intense focus on market-by-market strategies around clinical care,
network alignment, and quality stars. And Austin Pittman takes over at our Community & State Medicaid businesses,
coming from his most recent assignment, leading our overall UnitedHealthcare Network and local commercial market
leadership before that.
Turning now to Optum; it is becoming more evident, the capabilities we have collectively built in our services platform
are increasingly recognized in the marketplace. Optum continues to grow and mature quarter-by-quarter. We continue
to evolve to meet the needs of the market, further integrate offerings, strengthen and grow relationships, and align our
efforts to the most valuable and sustainable opportunities to make the healthcare system perform better.
More participants recognize Optum is in position to help customers engage their toughest healthcare challenges. Our
work assisting the HealthCare.gov website in the last quarter of 2013 has led to new relationships, new pipelines of
potential work, and new contracts with a spectrum of customers for 2014. We expect further growth in governmental
services this year, continuing this first quarter's trend.
Our efforts to help our customers improve their end-to-end performance and their structural costs have moved ahead
with the launch of our Optum360 revenue management business with Dignity Health. We are developing a pipeline of
additional health systems and expect to add business to Optum360 as the year progresses. Optum has seen positive
market response to its broad business process outsourcing capabilities as well.
OptumHealth is aligned around five key growth areas; prevention, intervention, financial services, distribution, and
care delivery. Broad capabilities meeting market needs, matched with an efficient, agile, customer-focused
organizational structure. The relationships we are building leveraging these critical capabilities, and they will be
instrumental in Optum's future revenue and earnings growth as the consumer becomes a more significant buyer and
decision-maker in healthcare.
OptumRx is working a strong prospect pipeline in pharmacy services. Our distinctive focus on managing total costs by
synchronizing information and care processes across the medical, lab, and pharmaceutical continuum is driving
significant interest. We are only able to generate this interest as a result of the meaningful investments we made in
OptumRx over the past couple of years.
And similarly, we are making targeted investments in OptumHealth and OptumInsight to seek opportunities in areas
such as consumer engagement, consumer distribution services, next-generation analytics that combine administrative
and clinical data at the scale of 60 million people or more. And next-generation medical care review of compliance
analytics. We will also invest start-up costs in the assimilation of each new Optum360 relationship.
This quarter earnings bear $60 million of these investments, which will continue over the course of the year, but
somewhat more weighted in the first half. All of these efforts resonate with one theme; new and sustained areas for
growth by helping the system to perform better for everyone.
Turning to Optum's performance for the quarter; revenues grew 29% to $11.2 billion, and earnings from operations
grew 20% year-over-year, to $650 million. Operating margins declined slightly due to the exceptional growth of the
lower margin OptumRx business, as well as the planned investments we just discussed. OptumRx led this quarter's
reported results with revenues up 43.5%, earnings from operations up 114.2%, and operating margins expanding a full
percentage point, to 3.2%. We filled 140 million adjusted scripts this quarter, up 38% year over year.
OptumInsight had strong growth in government and sponsored services in the quarter. At the same time, a slowdown in
hospital clinical compliance services pressured revenues and operating earnings year-over-year and sequentially as the

federal government deliberated over medical necessity processes for Medicare, its so-called Two Midnight rule. At the
same time, our newly introduced compliance offering serving hospitals' needs for clean medical necessity
documentation for privately insured patients has seen an accelerated growth in sales and pipeline.
We expect OptumHealth an OptumInsight to increase in profitability as the year progresses, accelerating into the
second half. All-in, Optum delivered a strong first quarter with improved earnings and capital returns as compared to
last year, and remains on pace to produce $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion in operating earnings this year, as well as roughly
one-third of UnitedHealth Group's cash flows from operations, all while investing in the future growth in its business.
As a whole, we have a solid start to the year against the increasing headwinds we described at our Investors
Conference. UnitedHealth Group's first quarter revenues grew nearly $1.4 billion or 4.5% to $31.7 billion, and net
earnings were at $1.10 per share, fully in line with our expectations. Cash flows from operations were strong at $1.4
billion, up 34% year-over-year, and a good start toward our full-year projection. The biggest challenges in 2014 are the
combination of non-deductible healthcare taxes and ACA-mandated Medicare rate cuts on top of sequestration and the
government's continued systematic under-funding of Medicare Advantage.
Including the 2014 Medicare funding issue and other ACA provisions, these impacted our first quarter results by well
more than $0.35 per share, and will pressure our full-year net earnings by about $1.50 per share. We expect second
quarter earnings per share will grow from this past quarter's results; but as planned, will come in below last year's
reported second quarter, which benefited from strong reserve developments, and did not bear some of the competitive
commercial market pressures UnitedHealthcare faces today, and like this quarter, will have substantial ACA effects.
Items we are watching include Hepatitis C treatment costs, the full recovery of state Medicaid fees, commercial
risk-based membership, New York, and the overall performance of our Medicare business. And we are always
respectful of medical cost trends, even though they are basically in line in the quarter. As always, we will strive to
deliver the best possible result in both the short term and longer term. We expect our 2014 net earnings to land in the
existing range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share, and we mean that as a range. The items we discussed this morning might
serve to temper one's thinking within that range.
Standing back from the numbers, UnitedHealth Group faces an expansive, long-term growth opportunity. In the U.S.
alone, there is the opportunity to approach and serve the more than 700 of the Fortune 1000 companies not yet our
customers. Today, we serve more than 85 million people, leaving more than 230 million Americans we do not touch.
There's a growing number of people in government-sponsored programs, who are yet to benefit from managed care.
There is significant upside potential in our PBM market share, and there are multi-billion dollar, multi-year
opportunities that link services, technology, and insight to fundamentally help the health system perform better for
everyone.
Beyond the U.S., we see the same growing opportunities, as the challenges other national health systems face around
access, control, affordability and effective decision-making are in fact the same ones we have here in the U.S., even as
the systems differ. The level of longer-term success we achieve will depend on two things; first, an adaptive and
innovative approach to applying our three long-standing core competencies of clinical care, organization and delivery,
health information analysis and insight, and advanced enabling technology.
And second, the effectiveness of our leaders in our organizational culture. We serve in the sensitive social services
arena in the early stage of important market changes, and we believe success will come to those who can build trust,
serve with compassion, and control costs while driving higher-quality outcomes.
We thank you for your time this morning, and look forward to your questions. So we'll give you a second to get
organized. And we will pick up your questions. Thank you.

The floor is now open for questions at this time. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matthew Borsch
from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Could you talk about the outlook for Medicare Advantage for
2015? I realize we have to get through this year first, but in light of the various changes that were made in finalization
of the rate, I know one of your competitors has put out a point estimate for the all-in rate impact, and I was wondering
if there was a range that you could offer on a similar basis?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. Sure, I think in terms of a range; first of all, the – we would comment that the final
rate notice did mitigate some of the originally proposed cuts for 2015. But in fact, the net result is that rates were once
again taken down somewhere in the order of maybe slightly over 3%. And that really comes on the heels of a overall
funding decline of over 6% in the prior year, and that's against a rising overall medical cost trend. So we would bracket
that around, let's say, the 3%, 3.5% kind of range. And honestly, that is somewhat disappointing. We were hoping for a
more positive all-in response. And so we'll be focused on working through and trying to mitigate that as we approach
2015. But I would bracket it in the, let's say, 3% to 3.5% range.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: If I could just ask for one clarification on that; is that inclusive of the, because it's not a
rate factor, the impact of the increase in the industry fee, at least under the ACA provisions today?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. That is an all-in kind of what we see a funding deficiency to Medicare for 2015.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Justin Lake from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow-up on the comments around 2014 commercial MLR,
specifically those coming toward the higher end of the range; can you tell us whether you think that would likely drive
EPS to the little lower end in your full-year guidance? Or if you think there are other businesses that could work to
offset that and what they might be? And then just quickly on the MLR side, you mentioned $100 million of Hep C
costs in the quarter. Can you tell us what your original expectations were, perhaps in Q1? And how you're currently
expecting this cost to trend for the rest of the year? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: It was a little garbled on the second one. Your second question is $100 million related to
what?
<Q - Justin Lake>: I'm sorry. $100 million of Hep C costs I think you mentioned on the – for the quarter; how your
expectations were going into the year for that versus $100 million? And then, how you expect that to trend for the rest
of the year?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I got it. Well, maybe the way to frame the care ratio – and I'll let Gail Boudreaux and Dan
Schumacher address this in more specifics, but we saw pressure in the first quarter. It is the first quarter. Those
pressures are coming from a variety of sources. We will endeavor to try to mitigate against that over the course of the
year. But we think it's appropriate to alert you to the fact that that care ratio will feel pressure because of these factors.
And as you point out, we have a very diverse business, not only within the UnitedHealthcare platform, but in the
Optum platform. And we have a number of ways to fight back against those pressures, and we're endeavoring to do
that. It's early in the year, and so we are staying largely within the ranges in kind of giving you color around where we
see the pressure points. And then, in terms of Hepatitis C, Gail? Dan?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Justin. On Hepatitis C, as Steve mentioned, we saw $100 million of
costs in the first quarter, a little more than that, and that was across all of our benefits businesses; so Medicare,
Medicaid, and commercial. And I think what we're seeing is not inconsistent with what folks are seeing across the
industry, which is higher pent-up demand.

There was more patients that were warehoused, leading up to the launch of Hepatitis C vaccines, and so we would
expect that there would be some moderation in new patient volume as that initial pent-up demand starts to wear off. But
I would tell you that obviously, these are 12-week and 24-week treatment regimens, so those folks that were introduced
in the first quarter will carry forward into the second. In terms of its relation to our expectation, I won't cite that
specifically other than just saying that it's a multiple of what we had expected.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Great. Thanks for the color.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Pete H. Costa>: Yes. Hi. I'd like to understand a little bit more about what you expect to do about the rising cost
of Hep C going forward? As – you mentioned moderating, but when it becomes perhaps all-oral towards the end of the
year, you'd expect it to re-accelerate again, and in particular for next year. So how are you going to price that into your
businesses for next year? Do you expect states to reimburse you this year or carve it out? So can you build on that a
little bit? And the other cost item that you talked about was in New York. Can you tell us how you're going to respond
in New York to the pricing pressure there?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. As you point out, how Hep C is addressed really does vary across the businesses,
based upon the segment of big business that we're in. So we'll try to respond to several of those. And then maybe we'll
start out with Gail?
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: Sure. Good morning. Let me first address the Hep C question, and then we'll talk about the
issue in New York. I think as you mentioned, first, the Hep C therapies, as you know, are very effective, and one of the
things that we are doing is working to ensure that appropriate clinical protocols and standards are in place. But as
noted, the price is exceptionally high. And as Steve said in his opening comments that that's controversial, and it's
putting a lot of pressure on states, CMS, and in terms of Part D, as well as our employer sponsors. So the cost has to be
addressed.
As we think about actions in the Medicaid space particularly, first and foremost, we're working with each of our states
to ensure that we're aligned with their expectations on their PDL and how they want to handle that, and also giving
them ideas on risk mitigation. From a cost perspective where we're paying for it in Medicaid, it is the cost of the
program that wasn't priced-in, so we are working with our states to figure out that funding gap. We do expect it is a cost
of delivering service in that space, and we'd expect that that would be reimbursed.
But the timing is what is uncertain now, because this accelerated very quickly. And as Dan said in his opening remarks
about this, because of warehousing and the rapid launch, this is something that everyone's dealing with across the space
right now.
In terms of the issue on New York, let me open up a few comments, and I'll ask Jeff Alter, our CEO of our commercial
business, to comment. I think Steve highlighted, in New York, we have a somewhat, I think, unique situation in the
small group market in particular, where there are new entrants, as well as existing competitors pricing below what we
believe is the sustainable cost structure, and pricing below what we believe are costs.
We've always maintained pricing discipline. We're a market share leader in New York. We've had a long history of
several decades of consistent performance in that market, but we do think that there is a market correction needed.
We're going to stay very disciplined in our pricing. But again, because of the dynamic that's going on there, it's
something that we highlighted in the – in our opening comments.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Hey, Peter. It's – good morning. It's Jeff Alter. Just to add a little color to that, as most people are
probably aware, we've served that marketplace successfully for a couple of decades. We know that marketplace really

well. We've got leading economics. We understand the pricing, and we really believe at this point that that market has
got to come back to a more sustainable level.
We're comfortable with our pricing in that marketplace. It's just that others have chosen to be well below our pricing,
and that's going to create an issue in that marketplace. We will talk to the regulator about it. But in the short run, we're
going to maintain our discipline like we have, and that discipline has served us well in that marketplace. But it will put
pressure as we think about 2014, as we pace into the other quarters in 2014 it will put some pressure on our risk-based
membership.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. Next question?

Our next question is from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - David H. Windley>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to shift over to Optum. Curious how you see
your margins progressing in Optum through the year; you mentioned ramping Optum360, making investments there.
You clearly need to see a pretty substantial ramp-up over the course of the year to get to that margin guidance range; so
interested in the progression there, please.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. We do expect that, and you know Optum is performing exceptionally well and
doing it while balancing investments and the assimilation of new business. So it's an impressive performance, but John?
Larry? Which one is going to start?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Well, John's going to start, and then I'll help him out here.
<Q - David H. Windley>: Okay.
<A - John Rex>: Yeah. So just to lead off here, I'd tell you both overall Optum and the individual segment results were
in line with the expectations. I think kind of part of what you're alluding to there, Dave, is within OptumHealth and
OptumInsight, earnings were down year-over-year, about 4%, 5% respectively here. And what we're doing here is
really investing for the future. I would say it's centerpiece of One Optum, chapter 2, it's all about investing for our
future growth outlook. And I'd draw the parallels to OptumRx and what we did there over the last few years, investing
several hundred million dollars into that business. And you can see the results as we are kicking off into 2014.
And as we look at 2014 for ourselves here in OptumInsight and OptumHealth, we'd be looking to invest over $200
million in those businesses this year, all about next-generation clinical administrative data analytics, collaborative care,
our Optum360 business. We're consistent with kind of the look we provided at Investor Day. And back to your direct
question on progression; looking for a 40-60 split in terms of earnings progression first half, second half, so let's get
direct to that.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: So Dave, it's Larry Renfro. Let me make a couple of comments. As John said, Steve said, we
are investing obviously in future growth. This is all part of the One Optum plan; a plan that we put in place three years
ago, where we're continuing to balance growth, investments, and cost management. I won't go back over what John was
talking about in terms of some of the examples, but I will mention the PBM, because that is the perfect example of
something we invested in for a couple of years, and we're now starting to see the payoff of that.
I would also tell you that you could refer to HealthCare.gov and the way that we have been working with the federal
government as well as the states, as we are starting to partner. That's part of one of our disciplines of larger and deeper
relationships. And we believe that that's going to pan out. But the most important thing probably is that that $60 million
of expense in the first quarter was a planned expense. We haven't deviated at all from our plan, and where we said at
this point in time. I think you can look at both business segments and see that the revenues are up. I would tell you that
the OI or the OptumInsight backlog is up 18%, to $7.2 billion, and I can also tell you that OptumHealth and
OptumInsight's pipeline is up 58%. So all this is planned. We're pretty comfortable where we sit with a solid start to the
year, and believe that we'll be strong moving forward for the rest of the year.

Our next question is from Sarah James from Wedbush. Your line is open.
<Q - Sarah James>: Thank you. I wanted to follow-up here on Sovaldi. First, if you could kind of frame it; so the
$100 million is about 1,200 cases. Could you split that between the three segments? Then to follow-up on pricing; is it
currently priced into your commercial product for this year? How does factoring it into Part D work? And then, Gail
said that she expected Sovaldi to be reimbursed for Medicaid. Does that mean retroactive to the drug lunch or more
going forward?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think we will respond kind of in more general terms. We are certainly not going to get
into case-specific across segments. So absent that, I think we can give you a response.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Sarah. Dan Schumacher again. With respect to the new patient volume
that we're seeing, we're seeing the highest volume on a percentage basis in our Medicaid block, as you would expect, as
well as in Medicare, and then followed by commercial. But when you translate that through to the impact, obviously
Medicare is lower, because of the reinsurance aspects of Part D. So that gives you a sense of where the volume is
coming from.
With regard to the reimbursement, I'd ask Austin Pittman to provide some perspective.
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Sure. Thanks, Dan. So again, as Gail mentioned, we're working diligently with all of our
states, first to get in alignment with their coverage decisions, second on risk mitigation strategies where we are
covering. Again, we do expect that that is a funding gap that will be solved. So it's an issue of timing, and we would
expect that to be solved for the contract period.
<Q - Sarah James>: Does that mean retroactive?
<A - Austin T. Pittman>: Yes.
<Q - Sarah James>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - John S. Penshorn>: Sarah, it's John Penshorn. I'd offer caution on estimating number of people, because as Steve
mentioned, the federal government is also covering some of this cost through their funding for the Part D program
catastrophic coverage.
<Q - Sarah James>: Got it. Thank you.

<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Hey there. At your Investor Day, you mentioned that you were targeting 10 or more
really large customer relationships by 2016 within Optum. And I hear you about the backlog and the pipeline. Could
you talk about kind of where you see those large relationships progressing, and when we might see some of those?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. We'll respond in general terms. Obviously, it's sensitive in terms of these things are
active in the market today. So we don't comment ever on specific clients or opportunities. But in broader terms, Larry,

<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. I will start, and I might ask Dirk, and I might ask Andy and Bill Miller, all three to
comment on this. We obviously are talking a lot about what we're doing with Optum360 in that marketplace. That is a
growth marketplace for us. The pipelines, as Steve said, we, from a competitive standpoint, would not really want to
talk about that right now, especially what we're doing on the revenue cycle management side. So I will ask Bill in a
second to talk about that.
I would tell you one of the PBM side, we continue to grow. We continue to see a large number of RFPs that we are
participating in. And I'll ask Dirk to speak to that. And on the government side, obviously, what we're doing with the
states, what we're doing with the federal government and some of the programs that we are involved in are larger deals.
But also we are concentrating in the, what I'll call, our collaborative care area. That's our care delivery organization.
We're going to beat that up a bit, so I might ask Jack Larsen to start with that and just give a little feel for what we're
doing there.
<A - Jack Larsen>: Thanks, Larry. Hey, good morning, Christine. Jack Larsen. So we would view the opportunity to
invest in or align with some of the better-performing primary care physician-oriented physician groups and other
specialty groups around the country as really central to Optum taking on the mission of some of the toughest challenges
of the healthcare system. For example, today in our local care delivery organization, which you can think about as our –
broadly speaking, our physician groups, we serve in 19 markets today, and we serve just a little over 1 million people
as patients. I would expect this to continue to grow through some of those larger, more comprehensive relationships
that your question was sort of pointing at, as well as grow it organically and the continued use of M&A, which I think
we're pretty good at there.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: So maybe, Andy, you could talk about the government?
<A - Andy Slavitt>: Sure. Yeah. Hi, Christine. Really quickly, we've been pleased to have the opportunity to serve
both federal and state governments. I think what they've seen is something that's emblematic of the answer to your
question is they've hopefully seen the technology that the general healthcare and the execution capability that an
organization like Optum can provide. I think that will build relationships both at the state level, as well as, as we take
our technology out commercially in a bigger and bigger way, really substantial relationships where we become a more
embedded part of our clients.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: So maybe Dirk on the PBM?
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Yeah, on the PBM – hi, Christine. Our pipeline's up a bit year-over-year, and this is really on
top of a nice strong sales show in the last year. If you look at finalist meetings we've attended, we're certainly getting
our at-bats with big customers. For example this year, I've already attended two finalist meetings where opportunities
were in the 0.5 million member range. So we're certainly getting our opportunities. We're excited about our pipeline.
Although I'll tell you we're still really early in the season, and a lot TBD.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Two more areas; and I ask Mike Weissel – and this goes back to Steve's comment in his
opening remarks about the 700 organizations that we do not do business with today. Obviously on our consumer
solutions side, we're starting to really target. So Mike, maybe you can make a comment on those?
<A - Michael Weissel>: Sure. This is Mike Weissel. So from a employer perspective, the 700 of the Fortune 1000 that
Optum doesn't serve in any way today; we think there's a large opportunity out there for us to take a lot of our
consumer solutions directly to those and wrap those services around them. So we're in – ramping up the sales force.
We're in conversations, starting those conversations with a number of these large employers. We're also starting
conversations with a number of associations and other places, trying to get to consumers with products and services
that we think will really empower them to take ownership of their healthcare in new ways.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: And I'll end with Bill Miller. Bill, could you talk a little bit about our hospital market?
<A - Bill Miller>: Yeah. So Christine, thanks a lot. There's three things that I'll touch on. And where these big
relationships will continue to grow and foster are three basic areas as we mentioned; Optum360, and we are in several
negotiations with the next phase of clients. We obviously aren't going to expose those right now, but I'd also remind

you that that business platform is adding clients every day.
They may not be the big, large, multi-year arrangements, and many are there – if you look at our backlog going 18% to
$7.2 billion; that's a function of those tools that we have out in the marketplace, or subsets of a full-blown end-to-end
deal being absorbed by many, many clients on a quarterly basis. And those set the stage for larger arrangements down
the line. And some of those are measured in the 10 million to 15 million arrangements over the course of three years to
five years. But we'll see other very large ones added over the year.
And then, I think we're doing far more work on the ACO side, helping hospitals re-engineer themselves to become
ready for fee-for-value. So we've had several large transactions in that space, and we'll continue to see those through
the year. And then finally, the other area emphasis for us, both in our payer and provider, Andy touched on it in the
government market, is our continued ability to impact the marketplace from a BPO standpoint.
With our technology scale, with our state-of-the-art technology and ready-to-go technology, along with our consulting
services, we're finding acceptance in the marketplace, whether it be amongst payers or providers to slide into position
where we're really managing large chunks of their, if you will, core business, so that they can focus on taking care of
their members. And with our backgrounds, both on the payer and the provider side, we end up being a pretty suitable
partner in those really game-changing decisions that governments, payers and providers are making on a more
consistent basis, as margin pressures and talent pressures continue to mount in the marketplace.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So I might complete that very comprehensive response by saying that if you listen,
Optum's challenges are out more around abundance. There are significant opportunities getting those relationship
started right, recognizing they're going to be substantially larger than the relationships we've had in the past, that they
are going to engage a broader spectrum of services and that they're much longer term. We are trying to be thoughtful
about these approaches in each of our businesses there, as well as continuing to make sure that we are investing so that
we are delivering ever-better value. So they're navigating in those kinds of waters right now, which are really great
waters to be in at the moment. So next question?

Our next question is from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Thanks. Hello, everybody. I guess I was thinking, you hadn't really said much about your views about
how the whole public exchange, first-year process played out, and now that we're done with the open enrollment, you
got to think fairly quickly about what you're going to do with respect to 2015. Give us any updated thoughts and
assessments of how it played out, and what your posture will be for next year?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Well, I'll have Gail and others to respond principally to that. We were involved from
the Optum side, so we do have some perspectives from that. It is still very, very early in the life of the exchanges, and
second year in terms of how they will evolve will be affected somewhat by what I call a lot of the spontaneous change
over the course of the first year implementation, which we understand, but does require some consideration and
calibration as we go. But Gail, do you want to start?
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: Sure. Good morning. As you know, we had a very modest footprint in 2014. And as we've
said and still believe, we do have a bias to increase that participation in 2015. There's a lot happening in that. We're in
the process of doing our evaluation. Obviously, we're looking at how the markets and products are regulated; the
networks that we have put in place, but there are some things that we did learn in the first part of the market.
First, that the size of the overall market is positive and that the configuration of products around Silver is also a positive
for the market, and that there is now some experience and a desire to be – to keep these exchanges stable. So we don't
know much about second year pricing. We do know first year pricing. So again, at this stage, I'll just reiterate that our
bias is to increase our participation in 2015, and we will share more with you as those decisions are made over the

Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to go back to the comments on intensified pricing; I
guess one, just wanted to make sure, is it just in New York or are you seeing it start up in other markets? And then
second, did you say that in New York it was coming from new entrants and existing competitors? And then, just the
last piece; just trying to sort of tying in on how related it is to the public exchanges, plans, maybe pricing that would
encourage dumping? Or is it – or are you saying it's just sort of head-to-head off exchange, sort of land grab? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think Gail and Jeff are perfectly prepared for this.
<A - Gail K. Boudreaux>: Morning, Ralph. A couple of things, because there's a number of questions embedded in
there. Let me start first with your questions around exchanges and renewals – and early renewals. One of the first things
is that we had a very successful early renewal of our small group customers in the fourth quarter. That clearly is a big
positive for us going forward. In terms of the New York issue, I'm going to let Jeff specifically address it. We talked
about it, but it is a unique-to-New York issue. And yes, it is both existing competitors, as well as new entrants, but
there's some unique dynamics in that market.
Your broader question around what's happening in the competitiveness of the overall market; as Steve said in his
opening comments, we have seen in the first quarter, again, after a very successful early renewal of small groups and
intensified pricing and some select markets; that is having an impact on our fully insured risk, because we have stayed
very disciplined in our pricing. So that's really the dynamic that's going on. It is select markets, and there is a dynamic
of the early renewal that occurred that's having an impact on that. New York has some unique characteristics, and we
wanted to point that out because of those unique characteristics.
And I'll ask Jeff again to comment on that.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Yeah. Good morning, Ralph. Yeah, so when you think of that New York marketplace, it was
probably one of the least affected by the ACA. It has been community rated, so fairly stable from 2013 going into 2014.
But there were some new entrants into that marketplace that, in our opinion, clearly are underpriced what the cost
structure is in New York, not only our cost structure, but certainly their cost structure. And then over the last few years,
we've had competitors that have left the New York marketplace that chose to re-enter the marketplace in January of
2014. And we see those competitors also underpriced for what the economics would call for.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So next question, please?

<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Thanks. I know it's clearly very early here, but just wanted to get your thoughts on expectations
for the 2016 MA rates, and just sort of thinking about some of the factors that benefited the 2015 rates that CMS said
that they may revisit. For example, freezing the move to the new risk adjustment model, and then also delaying the
proposal on the age rate proposal. So I know there was hope and expectation that the 2016 MA rates we could see the
skies sort of clear there, but just given some of those factors that I mentioned, just interested in your thoughts here on
2016 MA rates.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I'm not sure that we offer kind of a public perspective on future rate settings that we don't
really have any control over. We're aware of the factors and many others that go into the thinking in terms of rate
setting. We're still digesting 2015. And I really am not going to comment about that rate setting process. If you look
back, our batting average on that would be pretty poor. So I don't think we're going a step into that.
I would just speculate that there has been pretty steady funding pressure in terms of the Medicare Advantage program,
that it has been hit severely by the insurance taxes, it's been affected by the funding posture in the various ways that
CMS develops the rates each year, and this has now been several years against a moderate but still rising overall cost
trend. So we will be very watchful and careful with respect to continuing to advocate for fair funding to the Medicare
Advantage segment. It's a segment that serves 15 million seniors. It continues to grow. It continues to perform
exceptionally well, particularly in comparison to the fee-for-service program. So we would be advocates of thinking
that that program really should be more the future of Medicare and funded appropriately for that purpose, and that it
affects seniors. So our posture there hasn't really changed, and it won't change in 2016. And we will be hopeful that the
funding perspectives take that into consideration going forward. Beyond that, I can't really respond your question.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question is from Chris Rigg from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
<Q - Chris D. Rigg>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to make sure I understand the
messaging on the Hep C. Sorry to come back to that, but Dan, I know you said percentage-wise, you're seeing the most
volume in the government segments. But in the press release, the only area where you specifically highlighted is in the
commercial side. So is it fair to assume that sort of the greatest area of surprise has occurred in commercial, or has it
been across the board? Thanks.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Morning, Chris. It's Dan. We've been surprised on the volume – the pent-up demand across
all three businesses. And maybe I'll step through the commercial care ratio and how that goes into the consolidated, and
how you think about Medicare and Medicaid to put it in context around the pieces. So as you look at the commercial
care ratio, it was higher this quarter than we had expected, and there's really two pieces to it. One obviously is the Hep
C, and the other element is the early renewals. So we saw a greater volume of early renewal, so customers choosing to
stay with their existing plan, typically healthier and younger, and that led to less premiums. So those were the two
factors that were really influencing the commercial outcome.
And then, when you blend that together with Medicare and Medicaid, which had pressure from Hep C, but overall are
performing well in line with our expectations, it mutes the impact at the consolidated level. So hopefully that provides
greater color on the implications inside each of the businesses.
<Q - Chris D. Rigg>: Understood. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And I wouldn't take any undue significance to the order. We just merely talked about
commercial first, and got it in there first. There was no intent there. Next question please?

Our next question is from Sheryl Skolnick from CRT Capital Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Good morning. And I have to say that – to put this in context of – $0.35 worth of earnings
pressure to come up with a decent quarter was hard work in a big organization, and it's appreciated, and I respect it very
much.
The question I have, to get away from the detail, the important detail of Hep C and some of the other items is to step
back and perhaps take a look at the bigger picture of the company for a second. I noticed that for example you spent
$345 million, if my numbers are correct, this quarter on acquisitions. You're spending another couple of hundred
million dollars on investments in the two Optum businesses, Health and Insight, in order to create platforms and
structure and opportunity for further growth. But what I'm really – I'm trying to get at is what else can you tell us or
share with us about your thoughts on capital deployment, whether it be acquisitions or investment in the business, or
indeed dividend policy and share repurchases that we should be looking for as not so much offsets, but positioning the
company for growth this year as well as in the out years?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, I'll offer a response that probably won't be very surprising, and then ask Dave if he
has any comments. I would – our capital postures haven't changed, in the broadest sense, and they are oriented towards
a balance of building for the future and continuing to grow and diversify in enterprise, in a thoughtful and logical way,
and then making sure that we are returning capital to shareholders in an efficient, as well as balanced way.
So we will continue to invest organically, actually first and foremost, and you can see those investments play out in our
Optum business. And there are also investments in the UnitedHealthcare business, and I would also offer that a lot of
our internal capital spending as you see it in the financials are particularly related to technology and continuing to
advance and refine a better, a more modern health system that we can propagate across the country.
We continue to balance that with external growth, and we're continuing to maintain a disciplined appetite to continue to
grow and expand our business where we see opportunities to either expand or position a market share that we are
looking to pursue, market position, or secondly, cultivate a capability. And much of our investment is around bringing
capabilities into bear and adding them to our portfolio. Optum is a great example of this, and our technology is as well.
And then, lastly, to return capital by way of a balance between dividends, which we have been advancing strongly and
we'll continue to take an orientation to make sure that we are advancing them to a market payout position, and share
buyback. Those have served us well, and they've been very consistently applied, and it provides a nice balance in terms
of being able to continue to advance, expand, and diversify the business and capture that growth, which is really the
sustaining longer term growth and opportunity, as well as maintain a discipline over capital efficiency and maintain
appropriate and hopefully accretive capital returns and earning returns.
<A - David Scott Wichmann>: I think that'd be virtually impossible to say anything in addition to – Sheryl, it's Dave
Wichmann, I will cover a couple of additional comments. First, probably as you've seen in this quarter, we had a nice
cash flow quarter, particularly compared to last year, and we are managing cash flows and our return on invested
capital very hard and in a very disciplined way. The increase in cash flows for this year to the $7.8 billion to $8.2
billion level to be invested as Steve discussed. I think you've seen that we had a very strong repurchase period in the
first quarter here. And we said $3 billion to $3.5 billion in shares repurchased through 2014, but clearly were on track
for the upper end of that range at this stage.
In the spirit of continuing to return capital to shareholders, as you know, each of the last three years, we've increased
our dividend by 30% or more. That is something that we are committed to reevaluating periodically. We really look at
the outlook of our business, the capital requirements of our business, and then also what are pure benchmarks are. And
I don't think it's news to anybody that we have some room to improve there.
On the M&A front, you noticed it was a relatively modest investment, but I think strategically important, because they
are aligned to what we said at our investor day, they're really oriented more towards our Optum businesses, where we
see stronger growth prospects, earnings growth prospects, and in that case, we think we acquired the leading digital
health – consumer digital health platform in the country. But in addition to that, we continue to extend our reach
internationally with relatively modest, but strategically important investments, particularly in South America, where we

think there's a wonderful opportunity long-term to grow. So with that, I'll end. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you for the question.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And next question please?
Operator
Our next question is from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Hi, thanks. Appreciate you guys taking my question here at the end. So I really just wanted
to drill into the commercial MLR ratio and make sure we're not overreacting to New York in a couple of things. So the
good guys in the quarter to me would be the ACA fee, so it's be helpful if you could tell us what the actual ACA fee
was, and maybe by segment that'd be particularly had helpful?
And then the impact of weather. It looks as though with your payables up 4 times as much as your premiums
sequentially, you're probably just assuming that that utilization comes back and we'll figure that out when we get to see
March/April claims?
And then on the bad side, Hep C is $100 million, or 36 basis points, obviously not all of that is commercial, and so I'm
assuming maybe that's 10 basis points. So that's certainly is not getting above your range. In New York State, I
calculated about 7% of your overall premiums. So every 100 basis points there, 7 bps. I'm struggling to figure out
what's going to drive you above the 80.5% plus or minus 50 basis point range in commercial and really just want to
make sure that New York is not bigger than sort of a 7% impact or something that I'm calculating?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, we will respond I think more in general terms, and I agree, there shouldn't be an
overreaction, and I would also agree that it is a portfolio of issues and pressures, and we're kind of alerting you to that
portfolio. So that as a kind of a context, Dan you want to respond?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Josh, it's Dan. You had a lot of pieces to that. First, I want to clarify.
You talked about the commercial loss ratio. The commercial loss ratio guidance is 79.2% plus or minus 50 basis points.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Okay.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: The consolidated loss ratio guidance is 80.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. And so as we
look inside the commercial business, we have two principal pressures, the bigger of which is the early renewal impact
and having less premium. Good long-term thing, it impacts our premium in the near-term. And then the second, in the
order of impact is this Hepatitis C impact. And when you put that together, that gets muted on the Medicare and
Medicaid side, because they don't have those other dimensions we're talking about other than the Hep C, and on a
consolidated basis, that might suggest that our loss ratio may lean towards the higher end of the range.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Right.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: That's about also I think the ACA fees, our fees in the quarter were in the range of about
$450 million on an expense basis, and then obviously from a reimbursement standpoint, we have reimbursement in the
commercial business, which is higher because it has insurer fees and the re-insurer's fee. We have less Medicaid,
because it's just the insurer's fee and then there isn't a mechanism in Medicare in premium to recover that. So hopefully
that gives you some more context around the pieces.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Okay. So you didn't even mention New York as a pressure in commercial overall now? Is
that because it's not big enough in terms of magnitude?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: That's more of an impact on the enrollment. So you look at our risk-based enrollment and
some of the pressure we're seeing there and potential forward, that's more a commentary on the enrollment and less on

the loss ratio.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Okay. So I guess I'm still struggling to understand the commercial ratio, 79.2% plus or
minus 50 basis points – to see an impact of more than 50 basis points, again, I know Hep C is more of the early
renewals, I assume have to be a huge impact then, much bigger than you guys were expecting. Right?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: It's a very meaningful impact. On the early renewal side we saw more than 2 times the
volume we had expected.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Okay.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: But again, also a good thing in terms of...
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Yes.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: How it positions us and how it sustains that membership and does it for a good period. So
I think while there is a resulting pressure, the reality is I think a very good business decision and a good outcome for us.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Right. And no impact from weather then, because that wasn't mentioned?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: I would tell you that as we look at weather in the quarter, it had – it was a very smallish
impact. As you look at which days were the heaviest in relation to what we see in normal patterns, as you look at where
our densities are from a population perspective, it just – it wasn't particularly meaningful.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: But you have a very good list, Josh. You were listening very attentively. And...
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Trying.
Stephen J. Hemsley
And I think that will conclude our Q&A session for this morning. As always, there's an opportunity for you to talk to
John and Brett and so forth through the course of the day. I just might sum up by saying UnitedHealth Group, Optum
and UnitedHealthcare are tracking to the plans we shared with you. As we told you in December, we fully expected
challenging conditions throughout 2014 and we are working through the headwinds of ACA implementation, the
Medicare cuts, competitive market dynamics, et cetera.
We would have had an underlying growth rate of more than 20% absent the impact of the ACA taxes and the
regulatory provisions. We believe we have the right plans in place to deliver on our commitments and we know the
people of this company have the talent, the experience, the innovation and the drive and are determined to succeed. So
we thank you again for joining us. We'll see you next quarter. This concludes this morning's call. Thank you.
