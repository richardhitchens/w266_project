Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures are included in our first quarter press release, which as I have mentioned can be found on our
website. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of an increase to our reserve related to the Macondo
litigation that was taken in the first quarter of 2013, unless otherwise noted.
We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one
question, and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to
Dave. Dave?
David J. Lesar
Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. We are going to change up our format this quarter to more effectively
communicate the items you've told us you want to hear. I will provide the highlights; then Mark will add the financial
details. That will be followed by Jeff, who will give the operations and technology update.
So here are my highlights for our first quarter. Results played out about as expected, but the earnings mix was a bit
different. We had record first quarter total company revenue of $7.3 billion. And operating income increased 8% over
the first quarter of 2013 as a result of double-digit growth in the Eastern Hemisphere.
Now, as to our outlook by key geographies, the Eastern Hemisphere activity continues to expand at a steady rate and is
playing out about as expected. Our forecast for the full year remains unchanged. We see customer spending levels
increasing by the upper single digits, and our revenue growth to be in the low double digits. And we still expect
average full year Eastern Hemisphere margins in the upper teens.
Latin America came in slightly better than we projected but we continue to believe that 2014 will be a transitional year.
For the full year, we expect Latin America revenue and profit to be in line with 2013 levels. Longer term, we are very
optimistic about our position in Latin America and the future growth potential of this market. As Jeff will discuss, we
were successful in winning over $3 billion in IPM contracts in Mexico during 2013. And the constitutional changes in
Mexico seem to be progressing as planned, and we believe the opportunity for foreign investment to come into this
market will be very beneficial to our businesses beginning as early as 2015.
Turning to North America, as you know, I have been through a number of turns in the market, and let me tell you, I'm
starting to feel the turn. I'm starting to feel the momentum swing. Not only that, I'm starting to see it happen. I am more
excited about North America now than I have been since late 2011. Now, I could be off by a quarter or so, but I do not
believe I am wrong about this turn happening.
Now, why is that? First, the sense of confidence I get when I talk to customers and the sense of confidence that they
have in their own business prospects. Supportive commodity prices today are translating into stronger cash flow and
OpEx budgets for our customers. And despite the logistical issues we saw in the first quarter, during March, we saw
record levels of revenues. Completions intensity is rising, lateral lengths are increasing, stage counts are rising and the
average well volume pumped has increased over 30% just since last year. And due to natural attrition and demand
growth in the Permian, we believe that excess frac capacity has tightened much faster than expected. And we don't
think we'll have any problem filling our frac calendar through the end of the year and believe we will be able to pull
through additional product lines.
So how will this play out? First, we'll derive efficiency leverage from our low cost operating model. Second, we'll gain
incremental revenue from our customer base due to increased job sizes. And thirdly, as a result of tightening supply of
equipment, we can offset increases in input cost through reimbursement from our customers. And think about it, all of
that comes without any help from the natural gas market.
So while the first quarter margins were impacted by weather and logistical issues, this will dissipate. And North
American margins should rebound to second half 2013 levels in the second quarter. And we continue to expect North
America margins will approach 20% before the end of the year.

Based on our continued confidence in our business prospects, we bought back an additional $500 million in shares
during the first quarter. We still have $1.2 billion remaining in repurchase authorizations. Along with the buybacks we
executed last year, we repurchased about 11% of the company since this time last year, while also raising our quarterly
dividend by 67%.
Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Mark to provide financial details. But before I do, I want to point out that as you
work through Mark's financial commentary, you will see projected earnings per share growth of approximately 25%
from Q1 to Q2 and even more increases after that. That is why I am so confident we can continue to deliver
industry-leading growth, margins and returns and continue to return significant cash to our shareholders. Mark?
Mark A. McCollum
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our first quarter results. In the Eastern
Hemisphere, revenue and operating income increased by 11% and 16%, respectively, as a result of year-over-year
growth in both the Middle East-Asia and Europe-Africa-CIS regions. Sequentially, we experienced a typical decline in
revenue and margins during the first quarter due to the absence of seasonally higher year-end software and product
sales, as well as the normal first quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and Australia.
In the Middle East-Asia region, both revenue and operating income increased by 13% compared to the prior year.
Middle East-Asia is projected to be our highest growth region this year, led by Saudi Arabia. In the first quarter, Saudi
Arabia grew by almost 50% compared to the first quarter of 2013, which clearly demonstrates the success we've had in
expanding our integrated project capability and our ability to leverage our unconventional leadership and expertise
outside of North America. But the improvement was also driven by solid growth across the majority of our Asia-Pacific
countries, with Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia leading the pack.
Turning to Europe-Africa-CIS, we saw revenue and operating income increase 9% and 21% respectively on a
year-over-year basis. This improvement was led by higher completion tool sales and increased drilling and open-hole
wireline activity in Angola. We also posted increased activity in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Algeria.
Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 9% and 8% respectively compared to the same quarter last
year, in large part due to a decline in drilling-related activity in Brazil. Increased unconventional stimulation and
cementing activity in Argentina partially offset this decline.
We also continue to be impacted by an activity reduction in Mexico related to the cessation of older contracts in
anticipation of new integrated projects awarded late last year and earlier this year. We are currently mobilizing for our
Humapa and Mesozoic projects, and these should get underway in the second and third quarters.
Moving to North America, revenues were up 5% year over year relative to a 1% increase in the U.S. land rig count, and
operating income was flat. This was a challenging quarter for our North America business. We experienced the coldest
winter in 20 years, which impacted activity in the Bakken, Niobrara, Marcellus, and other operating areas, including
Canada, during the early part of the quarter. Severe weather also disrupted rail movements, further reducing efficiency.
Pricing contributed to lower margins in the quarter as a result of pressure pumping contract renewals that went into
effect late in the fourth quarter or early this year. Additionally, we saw rising costs in certain expense categories such as
freight and fuel.
Our corporate and other expense totaled $89 million this quarter. We invested approximately $15 million in our
HALvantage strategic initiatives during the first quarter, a bit lower than we expected. These activities will continue
throughout 2014, but the related costs should begin to decline in the second half of the year. We anticipate the impact
of these investments will be approximately $0.02 per share after tax in the second quarter. Including these strategic
costs, we anticipate that corporate expenses for the second quarter will run approximately $95 million to $100 million.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter also came in slightly lower than expected at approximately 27%, due to a tax
basis adjustment. For the remainder of 2014, we're expecting the effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%.

Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $954 million, nearly triple the cash flow from the first quarter of
2013. Adjusting for the $500 million in stock repurchases, we generated approximately $300 million in cash during the
quarter. As we progress through 2014, we believe we are well positioned to generate significantly more cash and that
our cash flow will grow sustainably in the coming years. As a reminder, we're working to grow the percentage of cash
available for distribution to shareholders up to roughly 35% of our operating cash flows over the next few years, which
is nearly double our historic average.
For the second quarter, we expect our average share count will be approximately 850 million. We continue to expect
that our capital expenditures for 2014 will be approximately $3 billion. We also expect depreciation and amortization to
be approximately $2.1 billion during 2014.
Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook, in the second quarter we're anticipating a low double-digit percentage
improvement in revenue as we recover from the first quarter seasonal drop-off, and we expect margins to move solidly
into the mid-teens. Over the course of the year, revenue and margins should continue to progressively stair-step higher,
with full-year margins averaging in the upper teens.
In Latin America, we expect for Brazil to be a headwind for the remainder of this year. An average of 24 rigs were
drilling during the first quarter, and activity is expected to remain at this reduced level for the rest of 2014 and into
2015. However, IPM activity is beginning to pick up in Mexico to offset the Brazil slowdown.
For the second quarter, we expect a high single-digit percentage improvement in revenue in Latin America. We believe
margins will only be modestly higher than the first quarter, due not only to lower Brazil activity but also to project
mobilization costs in Mexico. We expect a more meaningful step-up in revenues and margins in the second half of the
year, which should bring full-year revenue and margins in line with 2013.
Concluding with North America, in the second quarter we're expecting higher U.S. land activity to more than offset the
seasonal Canadian spring breakup. The logistics issues we experienced in the first quarter should also abate, and we
will yield more benefit from our HALvantage initiatives. The net result is that we should see a low to mid-single-digit
percentage improvement in North America revenue in the second quarter and margins will return to second half 2013
levels. And as Dave commented earlier, we fully expect North America margins will approach 20% before year end.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for an operational update. Jeff?
Jeffrey Allen Miller
Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.
As you heard, we're excited about the North American market and we are confident that we're going to hit our Eastern
Hemisphere growth expectations. The key point that I want to make today is that our strategies from unconventionals,
deepwater, and mature fields are working well. Our unconventional strategy continues to focus on driving a lower cost
per BOE for our customers. Our discussions with operators about their unconventional assets today are almost entirely
centered around how to make more barrels, and our strategy is dead focused on just that. Using Frac of the Future,
CYPHER, and custom chemistry, we've consistently demonstrated that we can help operators get more barrels and
improve their efficiency.
Now as Dave said, we're seeing rising servicing intensity across North America, and this underscores the importance of
our unconventional strategy. Lateral lengths have grown to over 10,000 feet in the Bakken. Stage density has increased
by 20% to 25% year-over-year in basins like the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus. And in the Permian Basin, the
horizontal rig count has crossed over the 50% mark, and you know this is great for us.
The net result is that year over year we've seen average completion volumes per well increase by 30% for our customer
set, which is driving demand for improved surface efficiency at the wellhead. Now Frac of the Future is delivering the
increased efficiency we expected, reducing maintenance, head count and the capital required on location. At the end of
the first quarter, over 20% of our fleet has been converted to Frac of the Future, and we have largely completed the

HALvantage rollout across our U.S. land operations.
Now CYPHER is making a difference in helping our customers increase their EURs, telling them where to drill, how to
drill, where to complete and how to complete. CYPHER is now gaining traction internationally as well, as we deploy
the platform to projects in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Argentina and Australia.
When it comes to how to complete, the goal is maximum reservoir contact, and this is where our customized chemistry
is generating results. One example is AccessFrac. AccessFrac is a system that combines leading edge unconventional
hydraulic fracturing techniques with proprietary diversion chemistry, and the result is substantially better multi-zone
completions during plug-and-perf operations. AccessFrac has been used in thousands of stages in every major U.S.
basin and in a number of emerging international plays as well. Through successful application, our customers are
seeing a production improvement on the order of 20% to 30%.
Moving to deepwater, our outlook has always been one of steady growth, which is precisely what we are seeing play
out. And our strategy to reduce uncertainty and increase reliability is more important to our clients than ever. As we
think about our deepwater strategy, reducing uncertainty for our clients shortens their cycle time and improves their
decision-making.
Our ICE Core fluid analysis technology does exactly that. It performs lab-quality fluid analysis downhole using
spectroscopy and proprietary algorithms. Now this is important to our clients, because one logging run can potentially
save an operator costly weeks of waiting on lab results. Instead, oil, gas, water and other fluid composition can be
determined during testing operations. Now, not surprisingly, this unique Halliburton technology is really gaining
traction, and it's gaining traction in every deepwater market in the world. It's been successfully run in the North Sea,
Latin America, West Africa, and Asia-Pacific.
We're also reducing uncertainty with our subsalt reservoir characterization software GeoShell. GeoShell is part of our
leading decisions-based 3D seismic interpretation software and it allows our clients to better image salt structures and
then, therefore, map the subsurface more accurately. We're gaining traction in markets like the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico, where a large customer is now using GeoShell to improve technical success and reduce exploratory drilling
risk.
Next, I'm very excited about the pipeline of projects that we see in mature fields. Our discussions with clients are
increasingly focused on how to improve mature field production. Now, these assets are a terrific annuity for our
customers, whether they may be a simple workover or a full field optimization project. And as evidence of increasing
demand, we have over $6 billion in awarded integrated projects and over $25 billion in projects in the pursuit pipeline,
primarily in mature assets.
In Mexico, we have two significant integrated mature field mobilizations underway, the Humapa project in the north
and the Mesozoic project in the south. We expect Humapa to be generating revenue in the second quarter. And with
Mesozoic, we're currently preparing the rigs required to deliver these high-pressure wells and expect to spud the first
well late in the second quarter. This four-year project is the largest of the recent mega-tender awards and represents
over 20% of the recent $4 billion tender round. We expect to be operating at our full run rate in early 2015.
And there are two takeaways here. First, we have built the organizational capability to successfully execute large
mature field projects. We have aggressively developed the reservoir skills to increase recovery factors for our
customers at a field-wide level and have built a service portfolio required to drill, complete and produce mature fields.
And second, we are more constructive on Mexico than at the end of last year and in spite of any near-term transition,
it's clear that the future activity in Mexico is taking shape. In closing, our strategies are working and working well in
mature fields, deepwater and unconventionals and we're more confident than ever that we're on track to deliver on our
commitments.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?

David J. Lesar
Thanks, Jeff, and let me just do a quick wrap-up.
In summary, the Eastern Hemisphere is playing out as we said it would, and based on our contract pipeline, we are
confident in our estimates. Latin America will be a transitional year, but our project wins in Mexico set us up for a
stronger second half and an improved 2015. And as I said, in North America, I can feel and I can see the turn coming
which gives us confidence in our outlook for the year.
Overall, our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. I'm optimistic about our ability to grow our
North America revenue and margins, realize industry-leading revenue and margin growth in our international
businesses, which will result in EPS growth and significantly higher cash generation. We remain focused on consistent
execution, generating superior financial performance, and providing industry-leading shareholder returns. Thank you.
Kelly Youngblood
Okay, Sam, we're ready to open it up for questions now.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is now opened.
<Q - James C. West>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<Q - David J. Lesar>: Hey, James.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Hey.
<Q - James C. West>: And good to hear your confidence on North America. We certainly are aligned with you there.
One quick question on them, if we think about – Dave, you mentioned you're getting reimbursables for higher cost. Are
you also at the point now, or getting close to the point, where you can get net pricing on the product lines that have
been somewhat out of balance here?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: James, this is Jeff. The first thing with respect to pricing, we're not going to discuss our
pricing strategy. But if you go back to what Dave said, we have seen some capacity tightening and the ability to pass on
some of the increased prices to customers. But the point being, from our standpoint, we stay focused on returns.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay, fair enough. And then, Jeff or Dave, you mentioned that a lot of the confidence comes
from everything outside of the gas markets. What are you seeing in gas markets today given where gas prices sit and
where gas prices essentially could go, given the tightness in the area gas market?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: The short answer is gas. We don't have it in the plan for 2014.
<Q - James C. West>: Right.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: The view is sustainable prices north of $4.50 would be what's required to see gas move,
though we are seeing it support probably cash flows for some clients. But if anything, the takeaway is it would be a
2015 event.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay, great, got it. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Your line is now opened.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks, good morning. So I have a question on the pressure pumping pricing comments. So,
obviously, you guys are pretty fired up. Help us understand kind of how you see this playing out. It sounds like there
should be a couple more quarters of seeing contract rollovers kind of pushing pricing down. But I was wondering if you
could give us a little more say context as to what you're seeing out there. Is this primarily in the Permian that things are
kind of changing around? But just a little bit of more color in terms of how that should play out this year.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: We don't see pricing pushing down. What we've described is contract rollovers through
Q4 taking effect now having pricing effect, but what I will just reiterate is that we stay focused on returns for our
business. The ability to push through the pricing for inputs is again a bit of what we've seen. But the vagaries of the
tightening, it's tough to call that at this point. We have seen some tightening.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Dave, I was just curious on your comments. You talked about kind of seeing the
beginnings of another upswing here. You've been here before. I was just wondering if you could kind of maybe give us
a little color in terms of how you're approaching this cycle different from the past. Obviously, if you're seeing this I
would have to think some of your smaller competitors are starting to get fired up as well. Are you concerned about
capacity coming into the market? Do you start building capacity a little bit sooner? I'm just curious. Maybe you can
help us understand a little bit how do you approach this cycle different without obviously giving away the secret sauce
and whatnot.
<A - David J. Lesar>: I think, Dave, first of all, I do feel the turn coming, but I want to see it get here first. When it
gets here, we'll be making those kinds of decisions. I think a couple things to keep in mind, one is we will continue to
high grade our customer base as we go through this process, working with the ones that want to work with us to
basically get the efficiencies that we need, the rate of returns that we need.
We are going to continue to roll out the Q10 as we said at our Analyst Day. We believe it's a differentiating platform to
go to market with, and we'll just sort of analyze the market as it comes to us and make those decisions at that point in
time. I'm certainly not going to give away our strategy at this point, but I think we're pretty well down the road in
thinking about what we're going to do.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Thanks, Dave.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now opened.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thanks, good morning. I was a little bit unclear with regard to your commentary on the
earnings growth envisioned for the second half of the year following the 25% upswing in the second quarter. Did you
call for an additional 25% increase in EPS sequentially in Q3?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Bill, this is Mark. We did not call for a 25% sequential from Q2 to Q3. I think what Dave
was alluding to is that if you just translate the notion of getting us back toward 20% margins in North America as the
year progresses...
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: ...as well as to continue strong double-digit growth that we expect in our international or
our Eastern Hemisphere markets, that's going to continue to add to what we think is going to be a good solid Q2 for us
coming off of Q1's seasonal low.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Understood. And then secondly, in light of the increased service intensity that you're
seeing in the business and the increased vigor with regard to the overall business, can you comment a little bit on your
capital spending intensity overall? We've gone from call it a low to mid-teens capital spend rate as a percentage of
revenues down to high single digits, and I'm just curious. Given the runway that you see now, your restraint with regard

to adding horsepower for a considerable period of time, your rollout of Frac of the Future, how is that all interwoven
into your capital spending intensity, your capital allocation with regard to new horsepower going forward?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: It's a great question, Bill. And one of the things that, as Dave alluded to, as we think about
our strategy for looking at North America, we're keenly focused on – clearly several years ago, we accelerated our
capital bid quite dramatically anticipating a fairly dramatic turn in North America coming off of the bottom of the
financial crisis. And then, seeing the growth of opportunities that were available to us in international markets, we felt
like that that was a season, a time overall, because of our focus on returns, we wanted to get our spending back down to
something that was a more reasonable growth rate and really focused the business on capital utilization, asset turnover,
and return to our penultimate focus on returns.
As we look at this market today and what may be happening, I would tell you, while we're still expecting capital
expenditures to be at $3 billion, I've got a lot of – I'm keeping a tight grip on the reins in terms of what the opportunity
set that's out there for the growth of our business. There are a lot of things that we can do, and we're going to try to
maintain that focus on returns. Remember, one of the things that we also have available to us, as we do the rollout of
Q10s and we're bringing equipment out of the market itself for reclamation or repositioning in international markets, it
in a sense gives us some opportunity to spread our assets, improve our utilization overall that maybe some other
businesses don't have within their capital budget.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay, thanks very much. That's helpful.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Angie.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: I thought it was interesting your comments first that you're seeing frac capacity tighten faster
than expected, which you would expect to some degree, But can you give us your thoughts on where the market's frac
capacity or frac utilization is today and then thoughts towards the exit rate at the end of the year given we still are
seeing frac efficiencies, moderate activity growth clearly, and some capacity additions on where we could be on the
frac capacity or the utilization side at the end of the year?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thanks, Angie, this is Jeff. Certainly, as we look out, we've seen some tightening. But
what I would say about broadly capacity is that I don't have any reason to disagree with some of the numbers that you
saw last week. So that's my view.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, let's move to Latin America then. On Mexico, your comments certainly were a little bit
more positive on the opening of the country and that you could see something as early as 2015. What are you seeing,
what are you hearing that gives you more confidence and more confidence on that timing?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: A couple of things. First, the country is making a lot of the right moves. So as we see the
reform taking shape, clearly I'm impressed and pleased to see the schedule keeping pace. Equally important as we see
the contract opportunities in the market, that work is being let, being tendered and won, which gives me confidence that
the base activity, though we see the transitory slowdown in the contracts that were in place, we also see the path to the
contracts that are going to take their place.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. And then finally, the Q10 pumps, based on your remarks, it does appear or it does
sound as if you are not making net additions to your horsepower in the U.S. Is that fair that you're still actually adding
capacity on the Q10 side but retiring or refurbishing older capacity?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Right now, we're sticking to our same policy. We're not going to comment on our overall
capacity additions, just for competitive reasons.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Jim.
Operator
Jim, please check your mute button. We'll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of
RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Hey, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: I just had a follow-up question here. Your forecast and guidance I think speaks to this, but there
have been significant investor concerns about the deepwater drilling market and potential utilization declines in
conjunction with the prospect for lower international oil company E&P spending dynamics throughout the course of the
year. I know again given the context of your forecast whether or not you can give us some views on IOC spend plans
maybe versus NOC or independents and how you see this rolling up into your forecast.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thanks, Kurt. We've always called the growth in that market as slow and steady, and it's staying
on the pace that we've described all along. I won't comment necessarily on the deepwater drillers, but our view and
their view may be a little bit different around that growth pace. We feel confident about the book of business that we
see over the near term and then clearly contracts that are being let appear to be going to work. So I'm confident that,
from our standpoint, our outlook is still intact and our commitment to outgrow that market by 25% stays intact.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, great. And just a follow-up I had, commentary about the North American market capacity
tightening and maybe more quickly than anticipated. What do you see is the potential impact on a global standpoint
from pricing? Because typically when North America gets tight, it's a pretty good opportunity to improve pricing on the
international front as well; any sense on that prospect as we head out into the rest of 2014?
<A - David J. Lesar>: I think as we – our experience in the last up cycle following the financial crisis, that potential
connection doesn't always work. We continue to believe that while there are pockets of opportunity to – or maybe to
adjust our pricing when contracts are awarded for specific product service lines, the large mega tenders that come out
continue to be very, very competitive, and we don't anticipate that necessarily changing in a slow and steady growth
market over time regardless of what happens in the North America market in the short term.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor, Pickering. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hi, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Given some of the volume increases you talked about in North America, 30% on a per well basis,
and your customer mix, can you just talk about the challenges that brings and what you're doing to address it, whether it
be sand, water, whatever else on the logistics side?

<A - David J. Lesar>: Thanks, Jeff. The increased volumes put a lot of not pressure but give us an opportunity really
to use our logistics and infrastructure that we've put in place over the last several years. But clearly, the ability to
deliver the large volumes is crucial to our business and we do that through managing that delivery really from the
beginning to the end, from the mine to the wellsite and so the takeaway is, yes, we manage it and, yes, we see it as a
key component of our advantage.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: And the second quarter in North America, so seasonally, Canada's obviously always takes a step
backward. But could you comment on weather risk and how you see it in the northern part of the U.S., whether it be the
Bakken breakup or whatnot? I'm just curious how you see that playing out at this point.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, the Canada breakup is always an impact. That's always part of the outlook, but in our
case, that is part of our outlook. That's included in the commitments that we've made for next quarter and then beyond
in North America. So we continue to be positive on that. And really the takeaway, the equipment works harder in the
Lower 48 than it does in Canada just given that impact breakup.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Any thoughts on the Bakken and just given coming off the very, very cold weather? Do we need to
expect a normal seasonal impact, better or worse, any thoughts around the Bakken this quarter?
<A - David J. Lesar>: The Bakken I think is back to work. It works its way through breakup and don't have any reason
to believe that it's impacted any differently and it was extremely cold winter, but that market knows how to rebound.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Sorry, guys. I'm obviously technically challenged on a Monday morning.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: We already knew that.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: That's no surprise, no surprise. Let me talk about sustainability if I could. It's great that
you're excited about the North American market. A lot of people seem to forget there was a price fixing litigation last
year. So it's good that you can be excited but we understand why you can't talk details so that's fine.
But it just strikes me and, Jeff, your comments about natural gas but we all kind of know that volumes have to increase
over time. And I'm just wondering how you guys view the sustainability of growth in the North American market. And
I would think that you get paid on volume as much as what the gas price is but, David, to your point, you all are
increasing volume so much that maybe that's not the case. But can you talk about the broader five-year outlook for
North American activity, the sustainability part of it?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thanks, Jim. If we look out five years, a lot of the structural things, in my view, are happening
that support a sustainable gas market. So if we look at LNG export, clearly a positive and it's moving the right way. If
we look at the uptake on gas and its positioning in the market as a long-term fuel for electricity and then we look at the
economy and the upside in this economy, all of those conspire to, in my view, a sustainable gas market.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: And should we expect to see – I'm looking at the consensus numbers for you guys and your
biggest competitors and 8% to 10% revenue growth seems to be sustainable, at least through the consensus. Is that – I
don't want to – you guys are saying that the business is no longer cyclical but, David, to your point, is this the
momentum leading into a two-year or a five-year cycle, or do you all have a thought on that?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Jim, it's clearly in my view more than a two-year cycle because, as I indicated earlier, we're not
getting any help from gas essentially at this point in time, and I have a view on gas. I happen to believe that over the
next five years to 10 years the gas market is going to be there and potentially be there in a big way. Everyone else on
the call probably has their own view as to whether I'm right or wrong there. But I think that what we're trying to

indicate is that if you just look at the liquids side of the business right now, that's actually what's giving us our
excitement. And so, is it sustainable, yes. Duration, it is still a cyclical business but I clearly think that we're looking at
something that is going to be turning up for more than two years.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Okay. And my follow-up, if I could on the mature fields end of the business, you guys have
mentioned several times that you'll probably have to make some acquisitions to get to where your guidance at your
analyst meeting was. And obviously, those are around pumps of all different kinds and chemistry of all different kinds.
Should we expect to see some continuing level of M&A over the next couple of years or could it come in big bursts?
I'm just trying to think of not who you'd buy or what you'd buy but how you'd go about doing it over the next couple of
years?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Well, I think the honest answer is while we would always love to do some big bites, it takes two
to tango, right? You've got to have those opportunities in front of you. An absent those opportunities, the way I
describe our M&A strategy is we play small ball, right, Jim? That's ultimately can win the games and so we're out there
constantly keeping our M&A pipeline full of prospects that address the strategic technologies and niches that we want
to fill and keep a constant dialogue. Not all of those will come to fruition, but enough of those along the way are filling
up the prospects that can ultimately get us there.
We would love to have some bigger deals. We have the balance sheet. We think we have the management team, the
ability to integrate in a way that could make that very successful, but those have been few and far between.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Cowen. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Thank you. Mark, are there any chances of any adjustments to your Brazilian contracts? And
if the answer to that is no, when do you expect them to be rebid and when might that take effect?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Thanks, Jim. This is Jeff. The answer to your question, well, I'm not going to comment on
specific discussions with a client. But I'm confident that we work through those during the current year. So as we –
some point this year, we'll see some relief there and certainly going into 2015, it would look different.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Okay. Secondly, another question about a South American country, have you seen any
improvement in your receivables situation from PDVSA, and have you at all curtailed shipments of products or
services to PDVSA because of that?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: We saw a significant improvement in our receivable position at the end of the fourth
quarter. This quarter, it didn't necessarily improve but I think that that was driven probably more by an expansion of
our operations there in Venezuela versus a lack of payment. It still is slower than we would like it to be. We continue to
work with our customer there to try to find an arrangement that's mutually beneficial. But I think that, at this point in
time, we take a long-term view on Venezuela. We continue to be constructive about that market, think it can work for
us and we're continuing to invest and operate there to help them achieve their goals.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Okay, good, Mark, and one final question about two categories of companies and how you see
this category of E&P spending. One is the majors' budgets, if you add them up, are actually slightly lower in 2014
versus 2013 and they make up about 26% of spending. And then, we're also seeing, at least in the budgets, a significant
slowdown coming out of Asia-Pacific companies, particularly the NOCs out of China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia.
When you do you expect that this condition is going to change, and if so, when do you think it could change?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: It's a challenging question. Your second part is when it necessarily will change. Again, I
think that our overall view of the market has been slow and steady. And we have supported commodity prices.
Ultimately, when things will change will really relate to the supply and demand balance. Right now, everything seems
to be well in balance. And I think as macroeconomic indicators improve globally, demand will grow. Then the need for

supply will start growing and I think accelerate activity.
The first part of the question on IOCs, an IOC is a part of our overall portfolio. They're an important part, but they're
less than 25% as a percentage of our total revenues. I would also say that even though their relative budgets have stayed
flat, what we see internally that they've adjusted some of that spending toward E&P and away from infrastructure this
year. So the overall budget totals that they give may not be necessarily indicative of what we see them spending. And
we expect that particularly in areas like the Gulf of Mexico that spending will be creeping up as the year goes by.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Okay. Thank you, Mark.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Thanks. I'll stick with Latin America. Mark, you've mentioned expectations for slightly
higher margins in 2Q versus 1Q, pretty flat for the full year. What assumptions are you making regarding work in
Brazil and the signing of the blanket contract with Pemex in that guidance, and maybe if you could help us think about
the range of outcomes in terms of margins related to those factors?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Okay, just to reiterate the guidance, we're expecting that revenues will be slightly up but
that margins will be flat in Q2, but that they will be increasing over the rest of the year, so that when you look at the
total 2014 year, it will be on balance the same as 2013 was, both from a revenue standpoint and a margin standpoint, so
that's the overall guidance. So that anticipates a higher margin in the back part of the year than we're currently
experiencing. The forecast that I gave you for Q2 on the blanket contract assumes a Q2 award, but probably later in the
quarter versus earlier, and so its large impact will be back half of the year versus for Q2.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Okay. And as it relates to Brazil, just that the contract stays in place as is. Is that the
underlying assumption?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Yes, it is. We have not anticipated any kind of contract reform in Brazil over the course of
the year. So if something happens there earlier than towards the end of the year, then that would be beneficial for us.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Got it. And then, Dave, you did mention that March saw record revenues in North America.
Can we get any sense for just how much better March was, whether it's in terms of revenue, profitability compared to
January and February?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: This is Jeff. There were solid exit rates. And on the basis of that, we feel confident about
the forecast we've laid out for you and also see the path to the commitments that we've made for 2014, which was
adding the 200 basis points in North America.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Maybe another way of approaching it, just any quantification of what the weather impact
was on North American margins in the first quarter?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Maybe to help, when we gave our guidance at the end of the fourth quarter about what
would happen in Q1, we highlighted that we expected that there would be some pricing degradation that we'd have to
fight against because of contract rollovers as well as weather. And I think that – so some of the pricing was basically
anticipated, but I think that the weather and the knock-on impacts of the weather, the logistics impacts and stuff like
that, were not anticipated to be as bad as they were. And so that's probably I guess as much as I want to give. But again,
looking at March exit rates, they were very strong, very solid, and that gives us high confidence for not only just Q2 but
the rest of the year.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Thank you very much. My question relates to the Middle East. As we look at the margins of
Middle East in the first quarter versus last year's first quarter, they're relatively flat. Could you talk about that given
what's going on in Saudi Arabia and the UAE? I would have expected the margins to be year over year much better. Is
there anything special going on there on Iraq or equipment relocation that's impacting first quarter?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thanks, Waqar. The Middle East growth is solid. But don't forget, we have won a number of
projects in the Middle East and we're mobilizing for those, including in Saudi Arabia. And so what you're seeing is
some of the sorting out of that activity. That said, the takeaway is we are very confident about the business in the
Middle East and expect to see strengthening there.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Okay. Where could the margins in the Middle East head to? I know you've given guidance for
all of the Eastern Hemisphere. But just looking at Middle East on its own, any guidance in terms of revenues and
margins for not just 2014, maybe longer term as well?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Waqar, we're not going to provide any guidance specifically on the Middle East. Middle
East-Asia is our reportable region. If you look at it, it tends to have higher margins, and we anticipate it will have
higher growth than the average of Eastern Hemisphere overall. But otherwise, we're going to stay with our Eastern
Hemisphere guidance.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Now we've heard from some of your peers saying that like rig count growth could be 17% –
18% in the Middle East area. Is that your thinking as well?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: I have no to reason to dispute their estimates on rig count growth.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Okay, and just one finally on the labor. We hear that labor is pretty tight, not just in Permian,
but other places too. Do you see that having any impact on work or the industry's ability to perform work this year?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: No, this is really where we've built a machine that's able to hire people. We know how to
do that. We've seen this sort of tightness in labor before. So, we may see some increased costs but the ability to execute
and deliver the people, I'm quite confident that we'll do that.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
<A - Kelly Youngblood>: Sam, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Yes, sir. Our final question comes from Scott Gruber of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave or Jeff, have you started to see a turn in the appetite for
shale technology, particularly by the domestic E&Ps? Just from a 20,000 foot level, it appears that the domestic
industry is just running so hard right now that customers are simply demanding more and more of the conventional
services. But, obviously, you have a much more detailed perspective than we do. So, I wanted to see if you're starting
to sense a turn in that mentality.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, this is Jeff. Now, there's a strong appetite for better technology. And that's really the
crux of most of the conversations I have with customers today, is around how to make more barrels and what
technology will allow them to do that. And that's really what our CYPHER suite is all about, is how to frac and how to
drill to make more barrels. And so that's where we're seeing that increase in appetite. And that's really across the piece.
So the takeaway is yes, there is more activity but every application of better technology in that higher volume
environment is able to even create more value for our customers.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: And do you think that's a product of where we stand with the evolution of shale? You're more
in the development phase today. Is that a product of the emerging tightness for people and equipment? And if you

could, comment on any change in your sales strategy and whether that's having an impact as well.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, let me comment on the place we are in the cycle. And clearly, as a client goes into
development, there's such a premium on making more barrels out of that existing asset that I think that's driving some
of that appetite. I won't comment on our sales strategy necessarily, other than to say we really like the suite of tools that
we have in the marketplace right now and the benefit that it's delivering for our customers.
