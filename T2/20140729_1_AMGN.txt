MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
My name is Marvin and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's second quarter earnings conference
call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session
at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we
would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A section. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.
Arvind K. Sood
Okay. Thank you, Marvin, and good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to welcome you to our conference call to review our
operating results for the second quarter.
Our new CFO and my new boss, David Meline, actually picked a great quarter to join us as our business performance
was strong across the board. Our CEO, Bob Bradway, will introduce David formally in just a couple minutes and will
also review our strategic progress and actions we are taking to position ourselves for long-term growth. Following Bob,

David will review our second quarter performance. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will
then discuss our product performance during the quarter and trends that we see going forward. Following Tony, our
Head of R&D, Sean Harper, will provide a brief update on the many late-stage opportunities we have in our pipeline, as
well as progress we are making on regulatory submissions. After Sean's comments, Bob will make a few concluding
comments and then we should have plenty of time for Q&A.
We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent
separately by e-mail. You will notice that we have made some significant additions to our quarterly slide deck. This
change was made in the spirit of providing more disclosure to further your understanding of our product trend drivers
and, of course, this will give my friend, Mark Schoenebaum, something to talk about in his next few weekly videos.
Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of
our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary
materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert A. Bradway
Okay. Thank you, Arvind.
Let me begin by welcoming David Meline as our Chief Financial Officer. David joins us from 3M. His financial
leadership and broad international experience will be very helpful to Amgen as we execute our strategy for long-term
growth and launch our pipeline of medicines in a number of new geographies. I'd also like to thank Michael Kelly for
serving as our acting CFO prior to David's appointment.
Our performance was strong across the board in the second quarter and our confidence in the business is buoyed by our
11% revenue growth, 30% operating income growth and 25% earnings per share growth for the period. Our recently
launched and legacy brands performed well in the U.S. and internationally. And we exercised expense discipline across
the business to drive these results. Based on our progress through the first half of the year and our confidence in the
underlying trends of the business we're raising guidance, as David will explain shortly.
Because we'll be talking on this call both about our quarterly results and some restructuring activity, I would like to just
take a moment to set some strategic context. Our strategy for long term growth begins with a commitment to
developing a robust, differentiated pipeline of new medicines addressing serious illness. This strategy is beginning to
bear fruit. We've talked about our substantial portfolio of ten late stage molecules delivering pivotal data by 2016.
So far in 2014 we've reported positive pivotal data for five of these molecules and we have submitted two of them
already in the U.S. ivabradine for chronic heart failure and T-VEC for malignant melanoma. In Q3 we expect to submit
evolocumab in the U.S. and Europe, T-VEC in Europe and later in the year blinatumomab in the U.S. with a
breakthrough therapy designation.
This presents us with the prospect of several high potential new product launches beginning in 2015. To capitalize on
this opportunity we announced today the first steps of a restructuring plan designed to improve our focus and
proactively reallocate resources ahead of the commercialization of our many promising molecules on a cost
competitive basis.
Our initial efforts include streamlining our organization, reducing layers of management, increasing managerial spans
of responsibility and beginning implementation of a revised geographic site plan. In this regard, we'll reduce our
workforce by between 2,400 and 2,900 positions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2015,
predominantly in the United States. This represents approximately 12% to 15% of Amgen's global workforce of some
20,000 staff members.
A significant element of our current restructuring plan involves optimizing our sites in the United States. As part of this
we plan to close all of our facilities in Washington and Colorado by the end of 2015. We'll begin the progress of exiting

these sites in the third quarter of this year. These sites were primarily research and development and manufacturing
facilities. Going forward we see opportunities to concentrate more of our research and process development activities
in our sites in south San Francisco and Cambridge, Massachusetts, obviously two key biotechnology hubs.
We will retain our headquarters in Thousand Oaks albeit with a reduced number of staff. And overall we anticipate
approximately a 23% reduction in our facilities footprint as part of this first step in our restructuring. These actions will
result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $775 million to $950 million primarily incurred in 2014 and 2015.
The combination of these actions will reduce operating expenses by approximately $700 million in 2016 as compared
to 2013 although most of the savings will be reinvested to support global launches of our new products.
These actions were contemplated as part of our 2014 guidance and the financial benefit will be modest in 2015 due to
the timing of these actions during the calendar year. Now let me just point out that the initiatives I've described
represent the first steps in our strategic resource reallocation efforts.
For much of the past year teams across Amgen have engaged in a coordinated effort to re-engineer our company for the
future. They are focused on ensuring that we build exactly the right capabilities to deliver on our strategy and our
aspirations. As part of this, we've been evaluating our overall expense base, our fixed costs, our variable costs, our
labor related expenses and our financing costs. Our next steps, which are well underway, include evaluating additional
efficiency initiatives, particularly in the shared-services area.
We'll discuss our full program with you together with an estimate of the resulting cost savings, pipeline progress and
our commercial plans during our business review meeting that we'll be hosting in the fourth quarter.
I want to emphasize today that we begin these actions with a strong underlying confidence in our business. Our
confidence is bolstered by our strong operating performance and the widespread positive reception to our evolocumab
data, and by our expectations for the well-designed ASPIRE trial for Kyprolis, the results for which will be announced
as soon as they are available.
Let me now turn the call over to David Meline who will walk you through the financials for our second quarter.
David W. Meline
Thanks, Bob.
I'm pleased to join Amgen at this pivotal time. I look forward to working with the team in order to support the global
growth of the company while helping to prioritize the best opportunities for products and programs which will serve the
company's mission. We will also ensure that the company is efficient and lean in order to maintain competitiveness and
support our capital allocation plans. I look forward to expanding on these themes during the fourth quarter business
review.
Turning to page five of the presentation, Amgen's revenue grew by 11% year-over-year with 8% product sales growth,
driven by strength across the product portfolio both in the U.S. and internationally. We also saw a nearly $150 million
increase in other revenues primarily due to our Nexavar and Stivagar (sic) [Stivarga] partnerships.
On a quarter-over-quarter basis, revenues grew 15%. This is consistent with our product sales pattern in recent years.
However, the increase was a bit sharper this year, in part due to inventory build for Enbrel of about $60 million in Q2
which Tony will discuss in more detail shortly.
Operating income grew 30% based on the combination of solid revenue growth along with reduced operating expenses
which were down year-over-year. Within operating expenses, cost of sales increased by 0.4 points to 15.9% of sales
due to the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax.
Research and development expenses increased by 4% year-over-year driven by the addition of the Onyx programs
offset partially by reduced expenses associated with support of marketed products.

SG&A expenses decreased by 12%, driven by a significant reduction in Enbrel related expenses.
Other income and expenses were $144 million in the quarter, which was flat year-over-year.
Tax rate for the quarter was 16.2%, a 4.3 point increase versus the second quarter of 2013 due primarily to the
geographic earnings mix and the absence of the R&D tax credit versus the year ago period. As a result, adjusted net
income increased 26% for the quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased 25%.
Now turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page six, we generated $2.1 billion in free cash flow in the
second quarter of 2014, a $600 million year-over-year increase, due primarily to the impact of higher sales and
improvements in working capital.
Dividend payments in the quarter totaled $0.5 billion, reflecting the 30% year-over-year dividend increase.
At quarter end, Amgen held over $26 billion in cash and short term investments, up over $4 billion versus a year ago
and our debt balance was $33 billion. The quarter end debt and cash balances include the impact of pre-funding a
majority of our $2 billion debt maturity later this year.
Turning to page seven, Amgen is increasing its revenue guidance for 2014 to $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion, and
adjusted EPS guidance to $8.20 to $8.40 a share.
We are reaffirming our tax rate guidance of 15% to 16% for the year, which assumes that the R&D tax credit will be
extended in 2014 and applied retroactively to the full year. At this point, our best view on timing is that the R&D tax
credit extension would happen in the fourth quarter, which would result in a lower tax rate in Q4 as compared to the
first three quarters of 2014.
Our guidance on capital expenditures remains unchanged.
Finally, on slide eight we see a summary of the financial impacts from the restructuring announced today. Specifically
we will be incurring pre-tax GAAP charges of $775 million to $950 million in 2014 and 2015. In the second half of
2014 we expect an EPS impact of $0.36 to $0.45 per share on a GAAP basis with the balance occurring substantially in
2015. Roughly 40% of total expenses will be on a cash basis.
Based on the timing of the program, savings for 2014 are reflected in the full-year guidance. And as a reminder,
operating expenses tend to be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, and we expect that again to
occur in 2014.
While capital investments will also be required as part of these restructuring actions, we are maintaining our capital
investment guidance for 2014, and in the future, expect to fund these investments within the capital expense run rate of
approximately $800 million.
We look forward to discussing our full program in greater detail at our business review meeting in the fourth quarter.
Let me now turn this over to Tony.
Anthony C. Hooper
Thanks, David.
You'll find the summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on slide number 10. The strong
underlying demand we saw in quarter one continued into quarter two as our legacy product franchises remain stable
despite new competition and our growth phase products continued to increase demand from both share and market
growth. As a result, we delivered 8% year-on-year sales growth in quarter two driven by solid unit demand and to a
lesser extent price as shown on slide number 11.
You will recall that last year, we realized the benefit of a Medicaid rebate adjustment in the amount of $185 million,
which negatively impacted the year-on-year comparison this year by about 4 percentage points. This adjustment mostly

impacted our ESA and filgrastim products. Our performance was particularly strong in the international markets with
15% year-on-year growth driven by strong performance in Europe and we also benefited from the acquisition of the
filgrastim rights from Roche in several new and emerging markets.
Now to slide 12 where on a sequential basis sales grew 14% due to the rebound of the inventory dynamic from quarter
one and solid unit demand. We exited quarter two with wholesale inventory levels within our normal range.
Let's review our second quarter product performance beginning with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN on slides 13 and 14.
Neulasta sales were able to be flat year-on-year. Positive contribution from price was partially offset by the positive
Medicaid rebate adjustment of quarter two of last year. This Medicaid rebate adjustment also negatively impacted
NEUPOGEN sales as they were down 9% year-on-year. To date, we've only seen a slight impact from the new
filgrastim competition in both the U.S. and Europe.
Turning now to Enbrel on slides 15 and 16, underlying demand continues to be strong as sales were up 7%
year-on-year, primarily driven by price. Most of the inventory dynamic we saw last quarter has worked its way through
the channel. At the end of quarter two, we did see a slight inventory build of about $60 million that we expect to be
drawn down in quarter three. We continue to see strong segment growth in both rheumatology and dermatology at 19%
and 21% respectively. And we held value share in both segments quarter-on-quarter as shown in slide number 17.
Now to slide 18, EPOGEN sales were up 2% year-on-year as price was partially offset by last year's Medicaid rebate
adjustment. Unit demand has been relatively stable as we continue to monitor average hemoglobin levels and dose
utilization under the bundled payment system.
Aranesp was down 1% year-on-year as shown on slide 19. Underlying demand for Aranesp continued to decrease
slightly due to practice patterns in both oncology and necrology in the U.S. and due to price competition pressures in
Europe.
Turning now slide 20, the combined denosumab franchise grew 29% year-on-year with a 31% unit growth. Prolia grew
40% year-on-year due to strong unit demand as we continue to grow share in all markets. In the U.S., our improved
sales force focus on high-prescribing physicians continues to drive both depth and breadth of prescriptions. In fact, new
patient Rx is up 33% year-on-year. And our DTC programs are driving increases in patients' awareness and patient
requests. As a result, in the U.S., we grew market share as measured by days of therapy, by 3 percentage points in the
quarter, up to 17% as shown on slide number 21. U.S. repeat injection rates are over 60% on second injection and over
70% on third injections, leading to a 50% increase in repeat patients versus a year ago.
XGEVA grew 20% year-on-year due to strong unit demand. XGEVA continues to capture market share in a growing
market despite competition from generic zoledronic acid, as shown on slide number 22. Our focus with prescribers on
the superior clinical efficacy profile of XGEVA continues to drive growth.
Now to Sensipar which continues to grow and is now annualizing a run rate of about $1.2 billion. As a result of
increased patient penetration, quarter two sales grew 15% year-on-year. Growth included both unit demand and price.
Nplate grew 12% year-on-year mainly due to a high unit demand and strong market growth across all regions.
Vectibix sales grew 42% year-on-year driven by strong unit demand across all regions. Vectibix is now the only EGFR
agent approved with improved overall survival data for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with an
oxaliplatin based regimen, or FOLFOX, in KRAS wild-type patients and will address an important unmet need in these
patients.
Finally, Kyprolis sales were up 15% globally and 23% in the U.S. on a sequential basis. In the U.S. roughly half of this
growth is due to unit demand and the other half due to return to normal inventory levels versus last quarter. Kyprolis
continues to maintain dominant share in the third line multiple myeloma setting. We expect the next major inflection
point for Kyprolis will be upon the inclusion of second line data in the label, and look forward to reviewing the
ASPIRE data in the near future.

As we enter into the second half of the year, we've made very good progress on a number of fronts. I will conclude my
prepared comments where I began. Our legacy products remain stable despite new competition and our growth phase
products continue to benefit from higher demand and increased market share.
Let me pass you to Sean.
Sean E. Harper
Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon.
We continued to advance our pipelines. Let me begin with an update on cardiovascular programs, beginning with
evolocumab our PCSK9 antibody. We're busy preparing our evolocumab submission for dyslipidemia and are targeting
submission in the U.S. and E.U. this quarter. These submissions for evolocumab will include both Q2 week and Q
monthly dosing. However, in order to maximize the probability of a first cycle approval for evolocumab delivered via
our auto-ejector, we've decided to not include our automated mini-doser device in the initial submission. Rather the
plan is to submit the device file as a supplement shortly after the initial approval of evolocumab.
We also had the opportunity to present data from our evolocumab Phase 3 TESLA study in homozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia and our Phase 2/3 TAUSSIG study in severe familial hypercholesterolemia at the European
Atherosclerosis Society meeting last month. These data generated a lot of excitement and we continue to explore the
potential for evolocumab in these severely affected patient populations.
In addition, we have completed our submission of ivabradine in the U.S. for chronic heart failure, an epidemic
condition with a high degree of unmet need, based on a large data set including outcomes data. We anticipate that the
successful launch of evolocumab and ivabradine will meaningfully benefit many patients with cardiovascular risk.
We are looking forward to new Kyprolis data, including a review by an independent Data Monitoring Committee of an
interim analysis of the ASPIRE study in relapsed, multiple myeloma patients and the final analysis of the FOCUS study
in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. In both of these event driven studies, our current estimates are that these
analyses will occur in the third quarter.
We've also completed enrollment in ENDEAVOR, our Phase III head-to-head comparison of Kyprolis with
dexamethasone to Velcade with dexamethasone in relapsed multiple myeloma.
Our immuno-oncology programs continue to advance and we had several data presentations at ASCO. We presented
the overall survival data from our Phase III T-VEC study in metastatic melanoma which demonstrated a 4.4 month
improvement in overall survival, which closely approached statistical significance. We believe this trend, along with
the successful result on our durable response rate primary endpoint, makes for a very compelling data set and we
recently submitted a BLA for this agent in the U.S. and are planning a European submission in the third quarter for
regionally and distantly metastatic melanoma.
In addition, we continue to believe that there's a compelling opportunity for T-VEC to prime the immune system with
checkpoint inhibitors. We're currently investigating T-VEC in combination with ipilimumab, or Yervoy, in a Phase
1b/2 metastatic melanoma study. The phase 1b portion was presented at ASCO and while a small study, the
encouraging response rate we reported along with no new or unexpected toxicities generated a lot of interest.
We're also moving forward aggressively with our collaborative efforts with Merck on PD-1 and expect to begin
combination studies later on this year.
We also presented the blinatumomab confirmatory Phase 2 results in relapsed refractory adult acute lymphoblastic
leukemia at ASCO. We're preparing a submission in the U.S., where we were granted breakthrough therapy designation
this year and are also in discussions with regulators about our E.U. submission.
Our Phase 2 study of Vectibix versus Avastin in first line wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer, suggested a
survival advantage for Vectibix in this population which also garnered interest at ASCO. As you will recall, we

recently received U.S. approval for first line use with FOLFOX in wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer. Our
accelerated approval for monotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer was also converted to full approval at that time.
Regarding the ongoing trebananib Phase 3 study in recurrent ovarian cancer, our latest estimates for the results from
this event-driven overall survival secondary endpoint is now the fourth quarter this year. Recall that trebananib is a
peptibody that inhibits Ang1 and Ang2 and the primary endpoint of progression free survival was met last year.
Our psoriasis program for brodalumab, which we're developing with our partners at AstraZeneca, consists of three
Phase 3 studies, one placebo-controlled and two head-to-head studies comparing to ustekinumab, or STELARA. The
efficacy data we reported from the placebo-controlled study was very positive and the other two studies will read out in
the fourth quarter.
The results from our Phase 2 study in psoriatic arthritis with brodalumab were recently published in the New England
Journal of Medicine. And as we have announced, we and our partners have initiated two Phase 3 studies in psoriatic
arthritis to evaluate the impact of brodalumab on improving clinical signs and symptoms as well as the ability to
prevent joint damage.
As you heard from us earlier this month, AMG 416, the intravenous calcimimetic we gained access to via the
acquisition of KAI Pharmaceuticals, had a very positive top line result from the first of three Phase 3 studies in
secondary hyperparathyroidism. We look forward to seeing the second placebo controlled study in the third quarter as
well as the results of a head-to-head comparison to Sensipar in the first half of next year. Secondary
hyperparathyroidism can be a challenging disease to manage and we believe there's an important role for an effective
calcimimetic that can be administered intravenously coincident with hemodialysis.
Turning to a couple of our earlier stage programs, we were pleased to see Phase I asthma data from our anti-TSLP, or
thymic stromal lymphopoietin, monoclonal antibody AMG 157 also highlighted in the New England Journal recently.
We're developing this molecule in partnership with AstraZeneca MedImmune and believe this program has the
potential to help address the large unmet need in asthma.
As a quick update on our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, we've completed enrollment in our Phase 2b dose
ranging study in episodic migraine patients and expect to see these data later this year. Our Phase 2b chronic migraine
study with AMG 334 continues to enroll.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to thank my Amgen colleagues for our continued progress towards advancing these
new potential medicines for patients in need. Bob?
Robert A. Bradway
Okay. Thank you, Sean. Before turning to questions let me just take a moment to put the many parts of our business
into a single perspective as we move along the strategic path that we first outlined for you in 2011.
First, we're focused on bringing forward a substantial portfolio of innovative molecules that address significant unmet
medical needs in areas of grievous illness. The molecules demonstrate large, clinically relevant effects and are
supported, where possible, by human genetic validation.
Second, we're building our business infrastructure to bring medicines to patients all around the world, shifting
resources to areas of highest value and growth.
Finally, we're making these investments for growth as we continue to meet our commitments to grow revenues and
earnings and return capital to our shareholders. And we look forward to providing more granularity on our progressing
pipeline, our commercial plans for launching new products, our expansion activities and so forth when we're together
for the business review meeting during the fourth quarter.
So with that, let's turn to the question-and-answer session and, Marvin, perhaps you can remind our callers of the
procedure that will follow.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask
specifically about the restructuring and what you indicated was potentially its impact on the guidance for this year. If I
go and I look you at the low end had about a $0.30 improvement in EPS and at the high end you bumped by $0.20. And
if I take a look at that based upon your margin structure that you didn't change in your guidance, it looks like on an
annualized base that's around $30 million to about $165 million. Of that $700 million is that what you expect will
actually fall through to the bottom line and the rest is in terms of R&D or – increased R&D or SG&A expense to
launch these new products? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Thanks for the question, Matt. I guess a couple of things perhaps to help you think through
the modeling.
First, as I said in my remarks, the restructuring announcement that we made today was contemplated when we have
initial 2014 guidance, so I wouldn't expect that you'd be adjusting 2014 guidance as a result of today's announcements
because, as I said, we had these in mind when we provided 2014 guidance.
And I'd just reiterate what David said, which is, bear in mind that it's typical for our second quarter operating margin to
be the highest for us of the year, and we expect that there will be some increase in operating expenses as normal in the
third and fourth quarter and perhaps a little bit more than usual as we begin investing in the pre-launch activities for the
medicines that we've filed.

Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mohit Bansal>: Great. This is Mohit for Robyn. Thanks for taking my question. I have one question regarding
AMG 416 regarding the head-to-head study you are doing with comparison to Sensipar. I mean what do you expect to
see from this trial apart from the primary endpoint? Which other second endpoint we should look at as well? And then
do you expect to conduct an outcome study for this product as well? Thank you.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Sure. It's Sean. I would say that the comparison to Sensipar is important because we need to
understand both at an efficacy, a tolerability and an adherence over time how the products compare. And I think all of
those are important just understanding the sort of biochemical activity of the dosing that we've chosen for AMG 114
versus the current Sensipar dosing. Understanding the tolerability issues, which, as you know, are quite limiting for
Sensipar given the large pill burden that these hemodialysis patients face. And finally, the adherence issue, which of
course is related to tolerability, but not directly. So these are all the things that we'd be looking at to try to understand
where AMG 416 should be positioned to help patients and physicians manage the issues associated with these patients.

R&D down to more in line with your large biopharma peers?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yeah, thanks for your question, Eric. Let me just make clear that the changes that we
announced today are company-wide changes, so while the facilities, particularly in Washington and to an extent in
Colorado, that we're closing are primarily research and development and process development related, the cuts
themselves are company-wide and some of the launch investments will relate to research and development activities
and obviously the bulk of it over time to commercial activities.
So we're reallocating away from some of our lower growth, lower return areas and to what we expect to be higher
growth, high return opportunities for us. So that's how I'd characterize it. And you're right, that, Eric, in the context of
our full business review we'll be able to, I think, spend enough time with you to elaborate on how we expect the cost
structure to evolve as we reshape the business.

Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Was just wondering if there are any new pieces of
clinical data that you're expecting that might change the level of reinvestment either up or down that you've cited in
your restructuring?
And then another question, Bob, is just in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the well-designed ASPIRE trial. I was
wondering if you care to expand here as we fielded a number of questions on some of the limitations of the trial design
and just wondering if you can help us out there? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure. Perhaps take your question in two pieces. Why don't I take the first part. And then
Sean can elaborate on the R&D question and ASPIRE question in particular.
The, our expectation again is that the reception to our evolocumab data has been very positive. So we look forward to
continuing to advance that and to begin investing in the kinds of activities that would be typical before the launch of
such a medicine. In addition we shared incremental information with you on this call about our other cardiovascular
medicine, ivabradine, and Sean, I think, was pretty clear about the steps that we're taking with our oncology medicine
and velcalcetide as well. Excuse me, AMG 416.
So on the basis of those molecules and the progress we've made against them, we feel it's time now to reallocate
resources and that's what we're preparing to do.
Sean, if you want to elaborate on any of the specific incremental programs that we've embarked on or talk about
ASPIRE.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: No. I – of course, fundamentally, we look at each of the clinical trial results that we get on
major late stage programs and the emerging pipeline as well and make investment decisions accordingly. So it's – that's

kind of the name of the game. It's little bit hard to anticipate. You can get disappointed and invest less and you can be –
things can look better than you think and you invest more. So, I don't know how else to address that.
In terms of ASPIRE, I think that Bob is reflecting the sense that the R&D organization has about the ASPIRE study in
general terms, which is that, I would agree entirely and do agree that the study is well-designed. It's always possible to
criticize study designs and many different ways to design studies for the same basic objectives. Obviously ASPIRE is
designed to help us to understand the incremental benefit that occurs by adding Kyprolis to a Rev/dex standard of care
background in this population. So I think likely if there are real specific questions around the study design and so on,
we can talk about that offline. But I would agree that it's a well...
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: And a large study, 800...
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, 800 patient study. It's, and I think we expect it to provide a pretty good window into the
truth about the molecule. That's what I'd expect from a well-designed study.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thank you very much for taking the question. I hate to come back to this, Bob, but I'm
still confused about the effect of the restructuring. And could I ask you, is the – are you suggesting to us that the
operating expenses net will be flat in 2015 and 2016 because you'll take R&D down and SG&A will go up to prepare
for these cardiovascular launches? Or are you suggesting that the operating expense ratio will be constant in 2015 and
2016 with that same reallocation? Because I'm struggling to understand what it means.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yeah, thanks, Geoff. So what we were trying to convey is the changes that we've
announced in the first step of restructuring would aggregate to $700 million of operating expense when compared to
2013. So the things that we're eliminating, for example, were [ph] $1,700 million (38:00) of operating expense in 2013.
Now what we're planning to do is to reallocate much of that to the activities associated with the molecules that we've
begun filing. So you're right that what we're saying is first in 2014 we had contemplated these actions and they take
place late in the calendar year so this doesn't really affect the outlook for 2014.
With respect to 2015, again the actions will begin to accrue benefits for us through the course of the year and by 2016
we think we will be through the actions that we've disclosed, so the full benefit of these actions would be available.
Therefore, we'll have on order magnitude, $700 million in that year, some portion of which, most of which we expect
to invest in launch activities for the molecules that we're filing. So assuming those activities continue to proceed as we
expect them to, we would plan to reinvest most of that in the business, Geoff, in that year.
Now one other thing just to reiterate, again, the restructuring that we've announced is company-wide. So we're
reallocating resources away, not just from research and development, but from across the business.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. If you don't mind it's sort of two quick ones. One,
just for you, Bob, when you look at Amgen historically, Amgen has had really a great franchise and very much
monopoly-dominant position. This company historically has not had to compete in a lot of markets maybe outside of
inflammation. The markets you're going to go into are going be a lot more competitive. And I just want to understand
how you're sort of positioning the company for that?
And then, secondly if you don't mind, just evolocumab, the decision to sort of split up the two formulations, what was
the reason for that? Thank you. The filing of the two formulations. Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, Yaron, so there are two questions there. Why don't I take the first part of the
competitive dynamic and then I'll ask Tony to add his thoughts, and then Sean can reiterate his comments on
evolocumab.
But Yaron, you're right. We're entering a new era in the sense that we'll be entering into more competitive spaces than
we have in the past. And that's something we've been talking about here at Amgen over the course of the past couple
years. And we're excited. Looking forward to having the opportunity to show what we can do in competing in some of
these competitively intense fields that we're entering. Again, we think we're entering these spaces with molecules that
have large effect size, which are differentiated, which form the basis of clear approach for our developing these new
product areas.
Tony, why don't you share your thoughts?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So you're right that initially Amgen specialized in building markets as we did with both
filgrastim and the ESA franchise, but as you look back at the legacy portfolio now, where our European team have been
defending against a number of competitors in the markets there over the last seven years, we truly have built the
competitive skill and ability.
When we look at Enbrel in the U.S., we compete on a daily basis against at least nine other competitors. And when we
launched denosumab, we went into launch against a branded Zometa, which basically became generic, had six
competitors, we still drove market share against those.
So I think we have built a skill over time to really be competitive. And this is what we're honing with the team now
again as we go into new therapeutic areas, building therapeutic confidence, understanding the relationships and
ensuring that we can be maximally competitive as we go to market.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, and let me clarify on the issue around the evolocumab device. So this is not a
formulation issue. The formulation is the formulation that's going to be registered along with the every two week and
every month dosing data of the autoinjector, which is the SureClick autoinjector which we have many, many years of
patient years of exposure and the regulators are very familiar, will also be registered. What we are not initially
registering is the automated mini-doser device which administers the entire volume necessary for monthly injection as a
single infusion. And the reason for that is to not take a chance, given the novelty of that device as compared to our
autoinjector, of delaying the entire drug submission by including that, rather, instead get it approved, get the
autoinjector approved, get the product ready for launch and then submit shortly after approval, the device, which will
be reviewed on a device clock, not a drug review clock.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. In all seriousness, thank you for the slide deck. And Arvind, I'll be featuring
my Arvind Sood bobble-head doll this week on my video, just so you know. But I just had a question for Bob then just
a quick clarification. There's been a lot of activity in the large pharma and specialty pharma space, which you guys kind
of straddle that with biotech on the inversion front. And I know your tax rate's very low but much of your cash is
generated ex-U.S., and getting access to it is maybe a bit more complicated than under ideal situations. So as a former
and well-known banker, I'd love to know how you're thinking about inversions in general and how – whether or not
Amgen might be interested in something like that, whether it makes sense or not?
And then just a quick clarification for Tony. Tony, there's a lot going on with inventory this quarter. I just want to be
very clear. If one looks at the data on a year-on-year comparison, you – the increase in inventory year-on-year was
negligible and you remain within the normal range, correct?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Just get that one first. Go ahead, Tony.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So the answer is we ended the quarter within our normal range with the only exception
being Enbrel that was about $60 million over the normal range.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sequentially.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Sequentially, yes.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: And on a year-on-year basis the build was very, very modest, correct?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Correct. Yes.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. So, Mark, on your question, you're right. There's an awful lot of activity at the
moment related to tax structuring. I guess the first thing I would observe is that our focus strategically is to try to
advance molecules that we think we can add value to that address grievous illness. So that's where our energy is
focused from a business development and capital allocation standpoint when we think outside of our own four walls.
I think my take on the inversion activity is that unfortunately our country doesn't yet have a globally competitive
corporate tax system or structure and until that changes, I think there will be tax financial engineering related
transactions like those that we're seeing now.
I hope that Congress will take action and enact broad sweeping corporate tax reform but I'm not optimistic that will
happen, certainly not this year. And again, I hope that even if corporate tax reform doesn't happen, that there may be a
window for repatriation. But I think those two steps, corporate tax reform and repatriation are important in order to
create a level playing field for corporations, particularly like ours in innovative industries and I think that's what you
see in biotechnology and pharmaceutical activity right now.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hi. Hey, thanks. Just maybe a question for Sean. Going back to some of the Kyprolis data
which is coming up maybe you can clarify for us I know there's multiple interims so I just wanted to clarify is this is a
50% or 75% interim, did prior ones not stop? And should we have full expectation that this one would stop since you're
so positive on the overall design?

Secondly, when this data comes out, what do you think is clinically meaningful here in second line understanding it
should be positive? What would you be very pleased with?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: So this particular interim on ASPIRE comes up with a reasonable number of events and power.
It's not, of course, fully-powered, as the final analysis would be. Whether the study is well-designed or not has, in my
view, nothing to do with the question of whether the results are going to be positive in an interim. It's a question of the
statistical power that you have to detect the effect size. So depending on whether you're very ambitious in your thinking
about an effect size for the molecule on top of Rev/dex, you might imagine a positive interim at this stage. If you're
more conservative about the effects size, you can imagine the study might have to run through to completion to show
that effect size.
I hate to burp out a number because I've had so many conversations with so many experts in this field. And I've heard
such a large range of answers from people about what they think would be meaningful and largely it's because they're
doing some kind of back of the envelope comparison in their minds to what one might see in such an experiment with
Velcade, and this is not a Velcade comparison study. That study just enrolled fully, ENDEAVOR, and will come later.
So we're going to see the data very soon, and I think – I'm just going to look at the data when it comes. And we'll figure
out, we'll work with our – with the – we have access to most of the really key opinion leaders in this disease around the
world. And we'll have them help us understand how they feel about the results, assuming that we do get a readout,
because the study stopped early for efficacy. That may or may not occur at this DSMB review.

<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my question. First question, what
can you tell us about the pace of commercial investments in evolocumab, just especially given the earlier filing?
And then on the restructuring the facilities footprint; is this mostly for legacy products? Does this change your view on
the biosimilar opportunity or other sort of, let's say, more legacy kind of assets in terms of their revenue potential?
Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sorry, Geoff. I know you asked two questions there, and I got the first one clearly. And I'll
ask – let me ask Tony to respond to the first question. You recognize, of course, that this is a competitive space, so I'm
sure we're not going to say a whole lot there. But then let's come back – Marvin, let Geoff ask the second question. I
didn't catch the beginning few words of your sentence in the second question, Geoff.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Yeah, well, as Sean said earlier, we've filed now for ivabradine, the drug for cardiac heart
failure. Obviously it'll be the critical path to Amgen moving into the cardiovascular space. Clearly that drug will be
potentially approved sometime early next year, and we're setting up the commercial launch to ready ourselves for that.
That team of specialists plus the medical organization will be the same organization that then takes evolocumab to
market a bit later during 2015.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Yeah, the second one – and thanks, Bob. Bob, just on the restructuring, with the lower
facilities footprint, I'm assuming this is mostly for legacy products. But does it change your view on the biosimilar
opportunity or the revenue potential for that, or for any of your legacy products? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, great. Thanks for asking that question. I want to make sure to be clear in my
response, that this doesn't in any way diminish our enthusiasm for the biosimilar portfolio that we're developing. Just to
remind you, we have six programs advancing, three of which are already in pivotal trials. So we're excited about the
prospect of developing and launching those beginning in 2017.

And you're right to point out that this enables – gives us an opportunity to rationalize some of our manufacturing
capability. And let me just, at a high level, remind you that we've talked over the past couple of years about our
investments in manufacturing technologies and new processes that we think will enable us to make protein therapies
more reliably and at lower cost than what we currently do. And as we progress our investments in that area, we would
expect that to free up some of our legacy manufacturing capacity. So we're exiting 20-year-old manufacturing
technologies and continuing to invest in what we think are state-of-the-art cutting-edge technologies that will enable us

Next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.
<Q - Andrew Peters>: Hey, guys. This is Andrew Peters in for Matt. Thanks for taking our question. I have one for
Tony on the EPOGEN and dialysis market. As both branded and potentially biosimilars begin to come to market in the
U.S., we wanted to get your thoughts on how you view the impact of some of the large dialysis providers and potential
volume deals, and how you see, kind of, that moving forward once Roche comes in, and the biosimilars as well.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Okay. So just to remind you again that Roche have the right to enter the market at present
with Mircera, and then the patent will expire during 2015. The market is divided into three large chunks, obviously
DaVita and FMC each holding about a third of the business, and the other third being held or managed by some of the
small providers.
As regards DaVita, we have an exclusive supply contract with them that runs until 2018, and with FMC we have a
non-exclusive agreement at present. So obviously, all the experience that FMC and a few of the others have in Europe,
which included a number of other alternative products, is something we've taken into account. We have continued to
maintain a fairly large portion of the dialysis market share in Europe. So we are modeling ourselves on that but the
market of course in the U.S. is supposedly different.

Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.
<Q - Eun K. Yang>: Thank you. Question on romosozumab for 785. In Phase 3, patients are treated with 785 for 12
months then followed by 24 months of Prolia. Would that be less favorable for a primary outcome measure at 24
months compared to 24 months continuous romosozumab treatment?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, Eun, thanks for the question. Sean, why don't you respond?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, I think that the science of this novel pathway really led us to that approach and what we
found in our Phase 2 work with romosozumab was that while one does see the most rapid increase in bone marrow
density that has been seen with any agent that has been introduced into humans, it does plateau by a year. And by a
year, essentially what one is experiencing with continued use of romosozumab is an anti-resorptive effect, a kind of
magnitude effect that's generally similar to that which you would see with marketed anti-resorptives. And so at that
point it didn't seem prudent to continue to dose people with an anabolic agent which is a novel mechanism, et cetera,
when we had the ability to adopt a paradigm of rapidly building bone in patients who require that and then kind of
locking in those gains with an anti-resorptive such as Prolia.
So that was a surprise to us, of course, because this is completely novel biology. And it wasn't until we got into the
clinic and worked with the agent in Phase 2 that we found that it really wasn't sensible to use the product on a chronic

Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Thanks. Just a question on the restructuring. Should we expect any sort of pipeline
reprioritization when we get to the business review meeting at the end of the year? And, just as we think about 2016
and beyond, how much of the shift in spending to SG&A is sort of one time in support of launching of these products
and how much of it should we assume is recurring?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yeah, okay, Ian. Thanks for those questions. I'll invite Sean to respond to your pipeline
question. But I'd just remind you we've been doing a fair amount of reprioritizing of the pipeline over the past two
years. But, Sean, you can reiterate the actions that we've taken there if you'd like. And of course, we'll talk about where
we're focusing our efforts when we're together for the full business review and we'd like to give you an update on our
approaches in the discovery research as well as the molecules that we're excited about at earlier stage of development
that we haven't had as much time to talk about given the bolus of advanced molecules that we're currently developing.
And similarly, Ian, I'd ask that rather than getting into the details now of our investment in competitive molecules that
we'll use the business review at year end or in the fourth quarter as an opportunity to update you on our thinking. But
you'll appreciate that the initial stages before launch of a molecule include a considerable amount of investment prior to
actually generating revenues.
Sean?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, and I think it's obvious to folks that we have an unprecedented number of late stage
programs rolling through at the moment. And this is the nature of R&D at any given company. It tends to be lumpy in
this way. So we're, as you're absorbing first enormous amounts of Phase 3 clinical trial expenses, those of course, as a
bolus, like this moves through, they begin to roll off. But the R&D expenses associated with supporting
commercialization and pharmacovigilance and regulatory activities, et cetera, in addition to supporting the new
geographies that we're moving into, are substantial investments.
And then while we may not have this number of molecules at any given time, at steady state in late stage development,
we certainly want to have plenty. So we're going be continuing to make significant investment both in internal
innovation as well as to be looking externally to make sure we're capturing innovation appropriately. If you look at our
late stage portfolio right now, it definitely represents a mix of those two capabilities.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Okay, Marvin, as we are getting close to the top of the hour. Why don't we take two last
questions?

Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry, another one on the head count reduction. Thanks
for all the color. You've partly answered this but let me ask from a very philosophical perspective, is the head count
principally being driven squeeze out operational inefficiencies over the greater goal of gaining new structural
advantages with a view of dominating select R&D and operational domains? And if it's the second of these, are there
any subtleties in the restructuring that you can highlight which we may miss in just the headline head count reduction
numbers? Thank you.

<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Ravi, I think in our disclosure of the reductions we were clear and transparent about what
our objectives for the move are. And again, what we're doing is we're carefully, selectively reallocating resources away
from some of our legacy investment areas to some of these new areas that we think offer higher growth and better
returns. And again, I don't think there's a lot of subtlety to it. We tried to be quite clear and transparent about what we're
trying to do both as regards the numbers, the locations, and what we're trying to do with our fixed cost from a site
standpoint. So, again, I expect when we're together in the fourth quarter, if there's need for more insight on the actions
that we will have taken, or be in the process of taking, we can provide that for you.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Thank you.

Our last question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thank you very much. Can you talk about what additional commercial infrastructure that you
think you will need in order to launch evolocumab and other products? And with the $700 million benefit from the
restructuring, would that be sufficient? Or do you think you need more buildup from other investments to build
infrastructure?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Howard, this is Tony. It clearly is a very sensitive and competitive debate we'll have about
this now. But we are looking at putting together a definitive cardiovascular team and that team will evolve over time as
we then go from ivabradine to evolocumab. The other products we'll be launching fall pretty much within our existing
organization in terms of the oncology skills. That's about as much language we would want to disclose at this point in
time.
Arvind K. Sood
Great. Thanks, Tony. Well, let me thank everybody for your participation in our call this afternoon. And if you have
any other questions, thoughts, obviously I, together with the rest of my team, will be around for the next several hours,
so feel free to reach out to me. Thanks again.
