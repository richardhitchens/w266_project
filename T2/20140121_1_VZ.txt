MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants
have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator
Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is
now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Michael T. Stefanski
Thanks, Evan. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This is Mike
Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning. Before
we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the Investor Quarterly,
and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be
made available on our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement and other legends on slides 2 and 3. Information
in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and
subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings
with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial
measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also
available on our website.
Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I would like to cover a few special items that are included in
our reported results. These are displayed on slide 4. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.76 per share on a

GAAP basis. This includes several significant nonoperational items that I would like to highlight. The largest item is a
pre-tax gain of $6 billion related to the year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities. This
favorable accounting adjustment is primarily noncash and is caused by an increase in the discount rate, changes in
actuarial assumptions, and a greater-than-projected return on plan assets. On an after-tax basis, this gain amounted to
$3.7 billion or $1.29 per share.
Partially offsetting this favorable item were pre-tax charges of $865 million related to the transaction to acquire
Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless. These transaction costs include net incremental interest expense of $616
million related to the debt raised in connection with the acquisition and the bridge financing and other cost of $249
million. On an after-tax basis, these transaction charges totaled $540 million or $0.19 per share.
Excluding these nonoperational effects, adjusted earnings per share was $0.66 in the quarter, compared with $0.38 a
year ago, which included a $0.07 per share charge for the direct impact from Superstorm Sandy. For the full year,
adjusted earnings per share were $2.84, compared with $2.24 last year, an increase of 26.8%. If you exclude the Sandy
impact from last year, the increase was 22.9%. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a
year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Also, the results and growth rates exclude the effects of the
nonoperational items.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.
Francis J. Shammo
Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and happy New Year. Before we get into the details, I'd like to start with on
an overview to put our results in the proper context. 2013 was a great year for Verizon, from both a strategic and
financial perspective. Of course, the big strategic milestone was in our agreement to purchase Vodafone's 45% stake in
Verizon Wireless, which will give us sole ownership of the best asset in the global wireless industry. We have all the
necessary financing in place; the special shareholder meetings for both companies are scheduled for one week from
today, on January 28; and the closing is planned for February 21.
As we have stated, the transaction will be accretive to earnings per share by about 10% on day one. Full ownership will
also provide access to all the cash flows and give us greater flexibility to develop converged solutions without any
integration and due diligence risks. Our strategy is to build upon the foundation and strength of our network assets as
the platforms for the future growth and innovation. To that end, we are extremely well positioned in the center of the
trends that are driving growth in our industry: mobility, broadband, video, cloud services, and security. Sole ownership
of Verizon Wireless, along with our portfolio of other assets, will enable us to better leverage our capabilities across the
entire business.
In wireless, we completed our LTE coverage build and continue to invest in our 4G network to take advantage of the
significant opportunities enabled by this technology as we innovate around our customer solutions. In 2013, we further
strengthened our portfolio of enterprise strategic services with the development of a new cloud services product suite,
the launch of a mobile healthcare platform, and several targeted acquisitions, which will enhance our capabilities in
mobile video delivery. Collectively, these moves further strengthened the business and improved our competitive
position in key areas of growth.
Underlying these strategic imperatives has been consistently strong operational and financial performance, driven by
solid execution and a disciplined focus on meeting our financial objectives. In 2013, we achieved or exceeded all of our
key financial targets, delivering on what we said in January of 2013. In wireless, we had an excellent year. We added
4.1 million new post-paid connections, generated service revenue growth of more than 8%, and drove a 15% increase
in EBITDA. Our growth in EBITDA was significant, $4.5 billion in absolute terms, and we expanded our annual
service EBITDA margin nearly 300 basis points to 49.5%, squarely within our 49% to 50% guidance for the full year.
In FiOS, we increased our penetration of data and video services by adding more than 600,000 new customers during
the year. The scale of our FiOS business and the popularity of our FiOS Quantum speeds drove annual consumer

revenue growth of 4.9%, up sharply from 3.2% in 2012. In the enterprise space, in spite of continued economic
challenges, strategic services revenue grew 4.6% in 2013. In terms of wireline profitability, we got it to a flat EBITDA
margin, and that is what we produced at 22.2%. In the area of capital spending, we met our revised guidance of $16.6
billion, which was up 2.7% over 2012. Even with that increased spending level, we improved our overall
CapEx-to-revenue ratio, as we said we would.
2013 was a great year of significant earnings and free cash flow growth. Adjusted earnings per share increased to
$2.84, up over 26% for the year. Our free cash flow growth was also very significant, increasing by $6.9 billion to
$22.2 billion, an increase of 45% from 2012. In terms of shareholder value, we generated a total return of 18.6% in
2013 through a combination of stock price appreciation and dividends. For the seventh consecutive year, our board of
directors approved a dividend increase, indicating their confidence in our future cash flows and earnings growth. From
my perspective, 2013 was a great year of execution, resulting in impressive customer growth and significant
improvements in profitability and cash flows.
Now, let's look at our fourth-quarter and full-year performance in more detail, starting with consolidated results on
slide 6. Total operating revenue grew 3.4% in the fourth quarter, continuing our consistent top-line growth trend. For
the year, we added $4.7 billion to consolidated revenue, an increase of 4.1%. On a full-year basis, the increase in
consolidated revenues, along with effective cost management, resulted in more than 21% growth in adjusted operating
income. On the same adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA increased $4.6 billion, up 12.3% for the year. Our adjusted
EBITDA margin expanded 260 basis points to 34.9%, the highest consolidated margin in eight years. As we
highlighted earlier, adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of $0.66 was significantly higher than a year ago.
Our earnings performance has been very strong and very consistent, with double-digit year-over-year growth
throughout 2013.
Now, let's move into a review of the segments, starting with wireless on slide 7. Our consistent investment in wireless
is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability, and the overall customer
experience. We will continue to build on our network advantage in 4G LTE by deploying capital to increase capacity
and density to our network. Our fourth-quarter and full-year wireless results were excellent. We continued the strong
momentum built during the year and finished very strong.
Total wireless revenues grew by $5.2 billion in 2013 and totaled $81 billion, representing two-thirds of Verizon's
consolidated revenue. We sustained our strong service revenue performance with 8% growth in the fourth quarter,
making this our fifth consecutive quarter of at least 8% growth. For the year, service revenue grew 8.3%. We generated
$8.3 billion of EBITDA in the fourth quarter, up 22.6% from the same quarter last year. Our service EBITDA margin
in the quarter was 47%, compared with 41.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012.
For the year, EBITDA grew to $34.2 billion, up $4.5 billion or 15%. This is a very impressive accomplishment and a
testament to the efficiency of our network and our continuous focus on improving productivity and efficiency
throughout the business by applying our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. Our 2013 EBITDA service margin of
49.5% improved by 290 basis points, a very significant expansion, and is squarely within the guidance we provided
during the year. The other point I would emphasize is the consistency of our wireless profitability. We have posted
margins of 49% or higher in the five of the last seven quarters.
Now, let's turn to a more detailed look at wireless revenue per account, beginning on slide 8. Service revenue growth
continued to be driven by more customers and devices, increase of data usage, and smartphone penetration. Our Share
Everything plans are doing exactly what we expected: driving device adoption and stimulating higher usage, resulting
in increases in both the number of devices and revenue per account. During the fourth quarter, retail post-paid revenue
per account, or ARPA, grew 7.1% to more than $157 per month. We have seen consistent growth in this metric. For the
full year, ARPA was up nearly $10 or 6.9%. We ended the year with 35.1 million post-paid accounts, and averaged
connections per account grew from 2.64 to 2.76, an annual increase of 4.5%.
As we've said, customer adoption of our Share Everything plans has been exceptional. In just 18 months more than
46% of our post-paid accounts are on these plans. In 2013, we effectively doubled the number of accounts on Share
Everything from 8.1 million to 16.2 million. The value proposition is simple and straightforward, and customers

recognize the value of shared data across multiple devices.
Let's take a closer look at connections growth on slide 9. We had a strong quarter of quality customer growth. Retail net
additions totaled 1.7 million. Post-paid net adds were 1.6 million, and prepaid were 80,000. In terms of the makeup of
our post-paid net adds, we added 1.4 million new 4G smartphone customers. Total phone net adds were 824,000 when
you include the net change in 3G smartphone and basic phone customers. We had a very strong quarter of Internet
device growth, with 675,000 net adds, 625.000 of which were tablets. The remaining net adds of about 74,000 were
primarily home phone connect. As usual, we finished the year with strong customer growth and have great momentum
heading into 2014.
To recap the full year, we had a total of 4.1 million new postpaid net adds and 4.2 million new 4G LTE smartphone
customers. We added 1.8 million new Internet devices, with tablets representing about 1.5 million of this total. We also
added about 360,000 other devices, primarily home phone connect. The offset to these additions was the net change in
basic phones. Total phone net adds were 1.9 million for the year, representing about 47% of the total. We ended the
year with 102.8 million total retail connections. Our industry leading postpaid connections base reached 96.8 million,
and prepaid totaled 6 million.
Postpaid gross adds increased sequentially to 4.3 million and totaled 15.1 million for the full year, up 1.7%. Roughly
60% of our gross adds for the quarter and the full year were smartphones. Our postpaid upgrade rate was 7.4% in the
fourth quarter, and our quarterly average was 7% for the year. As you would expect, a significant percentage of our
upgrades are smartphones, which benefits us from a service revenue perspective. About 23% of upgrades in the quarter
were basic phone customers getting a smartphones for the first time. The majority of the remaining upgrades were 3G
smartphones customers moving up to a 4G smartphone, which we are able to monetize through higher data usage and
lower cost to serve. Our churn metrics continue to be market-leading. Our retail post-pay churn was 0.96% in the fourth
quarter, down 1 basis point sequentially and up 1 basis point year over year.
Next, let's turn to slide 10 and our take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations,
which include both gross adds and upgrades, totaled 11.5 million in the quarter. This is higher than any prior quarter in
2013. For the full year, total postpaid activations totaled 41.5 million. Smartphone activations totaled 8.8 million in the
quarter, and 87% were 4G LTE. For the year, smartphone activations increased 7.8% to 31.1 million. Smartphone
penetration increased to 70% of total phone. About 58% of our smartphones are 4G. We still have approximately 25.5
million basic phones and 24.73 million 3G smartphones in our customer base, which gives us plenty of opportunity in
2014.
We had our best quarter of tablet activations since they were first introduced in late 2010. We activated about 790,000
postpaid tablets in the quarter and 1.9 million for the full year. Our tablet base now stands at 3.6 million. So, again, we
have a great opportunity in 2014 to expand this category and generate growth. 4G device penetration within our
postpaid base really picked up in 2013. At year end, 44% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G, up from 23% one
year ago. Usage on our network continues to rise. Currently about 69% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE
network. Going forward, we will continue to add capacity and optimize our 4G LTE network, ensuring that customers
are receiving the quality and consistent reliability that they expect from our network and devices.
Let's move next to our wireline segment starting on slide 11. Our wireline investments in platforms such as FiOS,
global IP, security, cloud services, and machine-to-machine enable us to deliver the services, applications, and
solutions that our customers want. As these services scale, they will become increasingly efficient and will improve our
overall cost structure. In the consumer and mass markets business, we continue to see positive revenue trends. For the
last six quarters, consumer revenues have grown in excess of 4%. In the fourth quarter, these revenues were up 6.4%,
driven by FiOS price increases and incremental revenue from FiOS Quantum.
We believe that consumer revenue growth in excess of 4% in 2014 is sustainable. FiOS now represents about 73% of
consumer revenue, and we sustained strong double-digit growth throughout the year. FiOS consumer revenue grew
14.9% in the fourth quarter and 14.3% for the full year. Within our base, 46% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribe
to Quantum, with speeds ranging from 50 to 500 megabits per second. In the fourth quarter, 55% of our FiOS Internet
sales were at speeds in excess of 50 megabits per second. Our overall consumer monthly ARPU increased to $117, up

10.8%. Roughly two-thirds of our FiOS customers are Triple Play, which have a much higher amount of recurring
revenue per month.
In terms of adding new customers, we are focused on profitable growth and have been disciplined in our approach in
this very competitive market. In broadband, we had 126,000 new FiOS Internet additions in the fourth quarter and now
have 6.1 million subscribers, representing 39.5% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive
20,000. In FiOS video, we added 92,000 new subscribers in the quarter. Total FiOS videos customers reached 5.3
million, representing 35% penetration.
We also continue to make steady progress with copper migrations. During the fourth quarter, we converted about
80,000 customers. For the full year, we converted 330,000 customers, exceeding our target of 300,000. This network
initiative is important for us, as we systematically reduce our dependence on older technologies. At the end of the year,
less than 1 million consumer customers remain on copper services within our FiOS footprint. Aside from the
maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide customers the
opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which would result in additional recurring revenue. Looking at access lines,
retail residential connections declined by 5.2%, compared with a loss of 6.2% at this time last year.
Let's move to our enterprise markets next on slide 12. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined $200
million or 5.2%. Legacy CPE sales were down 25%. Excluding the quarterly decline in CPE, global enterprise revenue
was down 2.6%. We also continue to see pressure and revenue from the public sector, which declined at a double-digit
rate. This decline included both soft demand and product rationalization at the federal, state, and local levels.
Strategic services, which now comprise 59% of enterprise revenue, grew 2.3%. Key areas of investment, such as data
centers, cloud, and security services, are growing at higher rates. We continue to work through economic challenges in
the enterprise space. In addition to public sector pressures, in the private sector many enterprise customers are more
focused on improving their cost structure, which puts pressure on our top-line revenue. In general, enterprise customers
continue to be cautious regarding new investment decisions.
Moving next to global wholesale, quarterly revenues declined $138 million, or 7.8%. The revenue pressure is caused by
the continued decline in legacy transport services. As we have stated, our wholesale strategy is to better monetize our
global IP and fiber network by driving a more efficient migration to next-generation Ethernet services. In terms of
profitability, while growth in enterprise strategic services is improving the revenue mix, volume declines in the rest of
global enterprise and wholesale continue to put pressure on wireline margins. Through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma
program, we are making good progress in our cost restructuring programs and retooling efforts, which we believe will
ultimately improve our operating efficiency.
Let's turn now to slide 13. To summarize our overall wireline results, total operating revenues were down 1.5% in the
fourth quarter and 1.4% for the full year. FiOS and certain strategic services continued their positive growth trends,
while global enterprise and wholesale were pressured by declines in legacy transport services, DPE, and challenges in
the public sector. In terms of wireline profitability, fourth quarter EBITDA was $2.2 billion, resulting in an EBITDA
margin of 22.4%. For the full year, EBITDA increased 2.5% (sic) [22.5%] (24:44) to $8.7 billion, with an EBITDA
margin of 22.2%. As expected, our margin is similar to 2012. As I have stated in the past, we are confident that we will
increase our wireline EBITDA margin in 2014.
Let's turn to slide 14 for a discussion of our cash flow results. Our cash generation in the quarter remained very strong.
For the full year, cash flows from operations increased to $38.8 billion, an increase of more than 23%. Free cash flow
increased to $22.2 billion, up 45%. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.8 billion and were $16.6 billion for
the full year, an increase of 2.7%. We continued to be very focused on improving investment returns and capital
efficiency, and our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio improved from 14% in 2012 to 13.8% in 2013. At the segment level,
wireless capital spending was $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $9.4 billion for the full year, up 6.4%. In wireline,
capital expenditures were $1.8 billion in the quarter and $6.2 billion for the year, down 1.8% from 2012.
The strength of our financial position enabled us to raise a record-setting amount of capital in the debt markets last
September. We ended the year with total debt of $93.6 billion, with all the permanent financing in place related to the

pending Vodafone transaction. We have a positive track record in terms of deleveraging the balance sheet. Our
pre-transaction leverage ratios were very low. And we utilized cash to retire $8.1 billion in bonds during 2013. Even
though we have more debt, our balance sheet remains strong, and we retain the financial flexibility needed to grow the
business.
In 2014, our priorities for uses of cash are unchanged. We will continue to invest in our networks, purchase spectrum,
and delever the balance sheet in a prudent and disciplined manner. We do not need to execute any major acquisitions to
drive our business model. We understand the importance of our dividend, and our board of directors has shown its
support by approving dividend increases in each of the last seven years. In terms of capital spending, we estimate total
spending in 2014 to be in the range of $16.5 billion to $17 billion, with continued improvement in our annual
CapEx-to-revenue ratio.
We will be opportunistic in terms of acquiring new spectrum and have consistently demonstrated our ability to execute
on this through a number of secondary market transactions. Our willingness to sell or swap lower-band spectrum with
competitors shows our industry leadership and strong belief that spectrum should be in the hands of companies that
plan to deploy the spectrum and put it to use. As far as pension funding requirements, our minimum required funding
for 2014 is $1.2 billion, based on our current plan assumptions. As far as additional forward-looking information for
2014, we intend to provide that on our first quarter earnings conference call in April.
Let's move next to our summary slide. We enter 2014 with confidence in our ability to take advantage of the growth
opportunities in our key strategic markets. We will continue to invest in our networks as the platforms for future growth
and innovation. We have strong momentum in wireless, and we expect to build on that strength, driving further
penetration of devices and extending our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration
in existing markets and continue to differentiate ourselves with our FiOS Quantum product and quality of our video
services. In the enterprise space, we will continue to aggressively market key platforms like cloud, security,
machine-to-machine and video delivery, demonstrating to customers that we have a unique set of capabilities to
provide customer solutions in a rapidly changing, mobile-first environment. In terms of our cost structure, we will
continue to drive productivity improvements and operating efficiencies throughout the entire business, utilizing our
Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles.
At the end of the day, it's all about execution. 2013 was a great year. Our focus on the customer and improving the
value proposition drove consistent top-line performance and resulted in significant growth in profitability and cash
flows, improving our investment returns. For 2014, Lowell and I have challenged our business leaders to build on the
strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we've achieved, improve the returns on our investments, and
create more shareholder value. We look forward to another great year in 2014. With that, I will turn the call back to
Mike so we can get to your questions.

<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Hi. Wireless margins were better than we thought, it looks like partially due to the lower
upgrade rate. Is Edge putting pressure on the number of upgrades, and do you expect the number to be lower in 2014
than it was in 2013? And then, secondly, T-Mobile's new strategy with ETFs has been getting a lot of attention. How
do you see that? Is that sort of an incremental change, or do you think more of a fundamental change to the industry,
and how do you expect that to affect your business as you look out in 2014? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right, thanks, John. Good morning. On the upgrade side, obviously the volume of
upgrades this year were less than last year, given all of the policy changes that we made. And also, keep in mind that at
the end of 2012 we also had a free iPhone for the first time on our network. So that drove a lot of upgrade activity year
over year. So we had less volume this year.
As far as the Edge program, the Edge program is going very well for us, but I would tell you, just to give you a sense,
it's generating less than 1% of our profitability right now. So this is not a significant portion of our portfolio. But,
obviously, given the competitive environment here – first off, let me just reiterate the fact that I know there's been a lot
of questions around a price war, and if you really look at what's going on, really what's the shift of pricing is between
service and equipment. And really, when you do the math, there really isn't much of a price decrease here. It's just a
shift of how it's marketed into the consumer market. So obviously Edge is important to us from a competitive
standpoint, but I'm not going to give guidance, John, on where our upgrade rate will be in 2014. As I said, I'll give more
guidance here once we close the Vodafone transaction. We have a shareholder vote here in a week, so I think it would
put us in a very peculiar situation to give a further guidance at this point in time. So I'll give more guidance on that at
the end of the first quarter. So that's where we stand.

Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess two. One, can you help us think about wireline margins next year?
How do you think about the issues of total revenue being sort of flat to down and mix issues versus cost-cutting? Just
trying to sort of scale the potential for wireline margin growth. And then second, on the OnCue platform, can you give
us some more color? Do you envision a full MSO over wireless or out of region eventually, or is this more of an
in-region and sort of ancillary product? Thank you.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right, thanks, Phil. Good morning. So, on wireline margin, look, I think that I've been
pretty clear on this. Coming into this year, I said we would be flat, given a lot of headwinds that we have from some of
these start-up products we have, especially around the Redbox joint venture, VDMS, and some other things in there.
So, look, we are very optimistic that we can improve this margin in 2014.
As far as top line, what I gave here today is we are very confident that we can sustain the 4% plus top-line growth on
the wireline consumer piece of this. And as you notice, we did our price-ups here in the fourth quarter of this year,
which is different than what we've done in the past, and that was to prepare us for, obviously, the January 1 witching
hour, which is when content costs go up in all of our contractual arrangements. So we put ourselves in a position this
year to offset that content increase, which we weren't in a position last year. So we've done some strategic things from a
top-line perspective.
Obviously, enterprise continues to be a pressure point, and I would say that we don't plan for that to change in 2014.
And I've said that coming into 2013 and leaving 2013, that I don't think we're going to see much of a change in our
enterprise top-line position in 2014. So I think that the cost-cutting measures, our Verizon Lean Six Sigma, some of the
improvement in some of these other ancillary platforms, where obviously we acquired Hughes Telematics, that is now
growing top-line revenue coming into the fourth quarter of this year. You probably saw today we just signed another
agreement with Hyundai to acquire their business. So this is a growing platform, but it does put pressure on us because

we are hiring people, and it was a loss when we acquired it and continued to be a loss through 2013. And I think that
could change some in 2014. So there's a number of things here, and I guess what I would say is I am confident that we
can improve the margin of our wireline business going into 2014.
As far as the OnCue acquisition, look, the focus here is really to accelerate the availability of the next-generation IP
video service, which we will integrate into the FiOS video service. And really what we're trying to do is differentiate
this even more so with fiber to the home versus others with the TV offerings and reducing the deployment costs. And
this really accelerates us from if we were trying to build IPTV versus buying the IPTV technology.
From a FiOS customer perspective, we expect the benefits that they will have more elegant search and discovery
interactivity and cross-screen ease of use. But also keep in mind, with the acquisition of Verizon Wireless and
becoming 100% ownership of that, we also plan to take that platform and integrate it more deeply with our Verizon
Wireless 4G LTE network. So that really was the strategy behind this. As far as would we enable this platform to take
us over the top? Obviously, we have our video digital media services that we've been working on for two and a half
years. We've just made two acquisitions related to that platform. So, look, I mean, we are positioning ourselves
strategically to be in a position to competitively compete around the whole mobile-first world in video. So I think that's
where we are.

Operator
Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks. Just a couple questions. First, Fran, if we can just get an update on the net debt at
Verizon Wireless. And then secondly, can you talk about the total amount of cost cutting that the Verizon Wireless
business achieved during 2013 that contributed to the margin expansion? You've flagged in the past a few different
initiatives that you were working on. And I was wondering if you could also share your aspirations in terms of the
cost-cutting potential for 2014. Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right, Mike, thanks. I guess this will be the last and final quarter that I ever have to do
this, hopefully. Gross debt of $5.3 billion, cash of $3.6 billion, and net debt of $1.7 billion.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: As far as the cost-cutting side goes, look, I mean, coming into 2013 we said that Verizon
Wireless had already cut about $5 billion worth of cost out of their infrastructure. We said that we were targeting them
for another $2 billion in 2013. They actually exceeded that benchmark in 2013. And, again, I'm going to hold on 2014
here, and I'll give you more guidance when we get to the end of the first quarter. And, again, it is all around our
shareholder vote and the acquisition of the Vodafone transaction.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: If I can then just follow up with a different question then. On the pension side, you
mentioned the cash investment that you're planning to make for 2014. Where are you starting off the year in terms of
the funding status, and then where would that $1.2 billion roughly get you to?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah, so, with the change in the discount rate and our assumptions around the return on
assets, our actual unfunded liability from the end of last year to the end of this year has improved by $2.6 billion. So
our unfunded liability at the end of the year for pension is at $5.9 billion. Now, that also is very helpful from us on the
annuitization that we also did there during the year of 2013. So it puts us in a very good position with the $1.2 billion
minimum contribution that we have into the plan to really start to make this a 100% funded plan.
On the OPEB side of the house, our unfunded liability went from $24 billion at the end of 2012 to $19 billion. So a
$4.2 billion improvement on that unfunded liability. So when you look at our balance sheet, even with the $8.1 billion

of bonds that I paid off, we also had a decrease of over $6 billion in our unfunded liability. So the strength of our
balance sheet has really taken off this year, with almost $14 billion of a decline in our liabilities.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thank you.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Evan, let's take the next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question. Since we've seen some changes in competitive behavior, I
feel like we've been getting sort of scattered data points around who's taking share from who. In the past, you guys
always had pretty positive porting ratios versus all of your peers. I know you don't give that on a regular basis. I'm just
curious; can you either quantitatively or even qualitatively talk about how you feel about your net share gains versus
your peers in light of the current environment?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yes, so thanks, Brett. Well, I think the fourth quarter will stand on its own at 1.7 million
adds and 824,000 net phone ads, with the best quarter we've had since we launched tablets of 625,000. And I think that,
in a combination of itself, will stand on its own. But let's just go back here a second from a competitive environment
standpoint. And I've said before, we will compete and respond accordingly where we need to. And if you recall,
coming out of the third quarter, this question came up, and I said, look, we are seeing a segment of our base that is
responding to go some of the competitive offers, and we will make the necessary changes that we need to, to compete
against those changes. And, if you look at our churn in the fourth quarter – which was unusual, because in a seasonal
season, we normally would go up in churn from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and this year, we sequentially
declined by 1 basis point. So I think that tells you that we responded to our base, we listened to our customers, and this
is what we do. Now, the competitive environment has changed again here in the fourth quarter, and you can expect us
to respond accordingly.
The other thing I would hedge ourselves on that we have built our brand very long term, and we've built loyalty with
our customers. And they come to us because of our network quality and superiority. If you look at the coverage of our
LTE network compared to our [ph] coverers, (41:50) we are by far, multiple times more coverage that our competitors
and some as much as five and six times more coverage than our competitors. If you look at our Share Everything plans,
we continue to change them. We launched the new price plan you probably picked up yesterday to go after our basic
phone customers. And, look, I mean, we're going to compete in all devices in all markets. I think that another
competitive advantage we have is our customer service and the quality of that customer service. If you look at the new
store we launched, which we call our Destination Store in Minneapolis, I mean, we're going after smartphone
customers, but it goes well beyond that, from a competitive standpoint. I mean, if you look at that store, we now are
going after the sports and fitness with all kinds of devices, music, gamers. We have a whole home section. And, of
course, we've been talking about the machine-to-machine and tablets for a while now.
So, again, I think there's more competitiveness than just one little price plan, and we will respond accordingly and
aggressively and continue to do what we're doing.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: Great. Thanks for that color.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Evan, we can take the next question now.

Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first one, Fran, on FiOS.
And the quarter was a little soft relative to the trend, but what I noticed was that the footprint path is inching up towards

about 19 million. The homes marketed to looks like it's more in the mid 15 millions. Could you talk a little bit about
kind of the plans for mining out the rest of the FiOS opportunity and how that might contribute to the expectations for
healthy consumer growth. I guess that's number one. And, number two, if I could just follow up on something you guys
talked about on the Verizon/Vodafone transaction. I think, Fran, you had some estimates about what you thought the
flowback was going to be and how it was going to impact trading in your stock, and obviously I'm sure there's been a
lot of hedging and things that have moved around. If you could maybe give us a little bit of an update on what you
think the movement around the stock is going to be around the transaction, based on your latest data, it would be super
helpful. Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right, thanks, David. So on FiOS, yeah, so let's put it in perspective. I mean, we came
out of the third quarter with an extremely good quarter of growth. And the environment became extremely competitive,
and the competition went after price and dropped pricing accordingly. And we were pretty cautious on how we
responded to that. We didn't believe that we wanted to chase some of those price points in the fourth quarter, because
we know from our customer experience that a lot of customers do not want us intruding in their houses during the
holiday season. So we were cautious in how we responded to that, and obviously that led to some slower growth that
we had from a net add perspective.
But here's what I would say, is if you look at what we've done in 2013 and the concentration of the copper-to-fiber
migration, which we believe is a more profitable customer at the end of the day, they are just voice and DSL customers.
So, if you look at our Internet volumes, we actually did over 42,000 more net adds in 2013 with Internet on FiOS than
we did in 2012. So that really was the concentration, and we exceeded that by 30,000. So we came into the year
thinking we would get 300,000; we did 330,000. And what we're seeing from this base is once we move them with the
same price plans, either by voice or DSL, they are then buying up. If they're only voice, they're coming over to our
FiOS Quantum offer. And, if they come over, they are buying up FiOS Quantum pretty significantly, which is
generating ARPUs in the range of $15 to $20 over and above what they were as a copper customer. And, as you know,
we gave a disclosure of 55% of these folks are coming in at 50 megabits and above, and we will continue to increase
our speeds. We're working on a new router that's going to give better in-home performance with all the extra wireless
devices that are going on.
So when you think about profitability and top-line growth, FiOS Quantum is extremely important. Because when you
look at broadband versus TV, I mean, look, you don't have the content, so broadband is actually more profitable than
the TV product. Now, having said that, as I said, in the third quarter, there is a lag once we move these people in
marketing to them in getting to move to the TV. So TV did lag this quarter, and I expected it to lag this quarter, and I
expect it to lag as we continue to migrate this extra less than 1 million homes that we have left in our FiOS footprint.
But I also want to be clear that we're not going to build beyond what our current LFAs are. And, as you said, we have
18.5 million homes passed now with about 15.3 million open for sale on Internet and about 15 million for TV. So we
have plenty of opportunity here, but I would also tell you that, again, even with the slower growth in the fourth quarter,
we still took market share and continued to increase our penetration. And New York continues to be our
fastest-growing market with the most penetration this year over any other market we had in the TV arena. So I think
that's what sets us up for 2014. We will continue to execute on the same things that we've done this year, which is
concentration on migration and getting those quality customers to buy up in their bundles.
On the second question of flowback, look, I think it's getting harder and harder for me to zero in on what the flowback
is, given what the market has done and the short positions and everybody positioning where they are. As we said when
we came into this transaction, we thought the net flowback would be around 300 million shares, but keep in mind we'll
have somewhere between 4.1 billion and 4.2 billion shares outstanding. So it's a pretty insignificant, minimal amount
based on the volume of daily trading that we think we'll have. So that's really all the thought I can give you on the
flowback at this point in time.

Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hey, guys, thanks. Fran, maybe a couple things. Just – you commented regarding the Edge
program. It seems like some of the competitors out there are moving to EIP, which you can argue is a pretty bad deal
for the consumer but pretty good for carriers. Why wouldn't you guys just get more active in the Edge marketplace and
offload that subsidy back to the consumer? And then, secondly, on the enterprise side, it seems like the industry overall
has been pretty weak. Can you just comment, like, the different push back pieces there between legacy to new
migration? What does the pricing environment look like? And then, from a competitive standpoint, are you seeing any
change there? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right, thanks, Mike. Look, on the Edge program, I mean, as I said earlier, we will
respond where we think we need to respond. I'm not going to get into what others have done between Edge and
subsidy. I mean, we had a very successful fourth quarter in what we launched to the marketplace. They were receptive
to that. We ran a lot of promotions in the fourth quarter, and it drove a lot of growth to our business. And look, I mean,
again, we'll continue to do what we do best, which is we add customers and we're profitable.
On the enterprise side of the house, look, I mean, this is becoming a more and more struggling event here, given the
uncertainty of the government. And, as you know, what causes more concern now is the President has nominated
Senator Baucus, who was leading the Tax Reform Act – he's now been nominated to Ambassador of China, which
means now that that could delay some reform. Now, others are picking it up. But this just gives more room for caution
as to what is going to happen in 2014. Are we going to get tax reform? What about the extenders? They haven't talked
about extenders at all. There's a large cliff that we hit here on December 31, which was we lost a lot of credits, and
obviously the accelerated depreciation deduction is gone. So there's a lot of things that are putting enterprise back on
their heels, and people are just looking for cost-cutting measures, which means – that means I take a top-line decrease
in order to maintain that business.
From a public sector perspective, look, I mean, the federal government, our sector there, is declining double digits year
over year, and that is obviously putting a lot of pressure here. There are opportunities in that segment that we're
exploring. But the way I would look at this is you've seen us make some moves here around EdgeCast and upLynk and
the video digital media services, and you've seen us make some other moves in our cloud and what we have recently
launched with our new cloud product in a beta test. So within security, cloud, data centers, and our advanced
communications arena, we are growing revenue year over year, even more significantly than strategic services overall.
So there are certain niches that are growing, but unfortunately, it's not enough to offset the other declines we're seeing
just from the public sector and some of these other pressures we're getting from the large enterprise customers. So,
again, I think 2014 will be pretty much flat with where 2013 was. I don't expect it to get any worse, but it will be a
tough slug for 2014.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Fran, you've talked about in the past, I think, the percentage of customers – this goes back
many years, probably – but percentage of customers who've already moved from legacy product into IP Ethernet. Is
there a metric you can put around that as far as the customer base goes?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: You know, Mike, to be honest, I don't know that off the top of my head. I'm sorry.

<Q - John Mark Warren>: Thanks. I was just wondering, on FiOS Quantum, you've had a lot of success getting
customers to upgrade from lower speeds, like 10 megabits per second, to 50. Is that typically a one-time boost, or do
you see customers continuing to come back for more speed?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah, John, thanks for the question. We actually continue to see customers come back.
And if you think about this, this is like when you're in your home, if you have one or two wireless devices running off
of that WiFi at 10 megabits and you start to put three or four devices on that, guess what? You're not getting 10
megabits to those wireless devices anymore. You're getting something significantly less than that. So the only way to
compensate for that is to increase the speed into that router.
So we see customers, 50, 75, 100. And, as I said, we're going to come out with a new proprietary router that's going to
even increase the speeds even more that are available for those wireless devices as people start to saturate the inside of
their homes with tablets and other machine-to-machine connections. So this is an ongoing upgrade that customers are
doing. We do this very seamlessly within the Verizon FiOS TV product, or online, where we pop up things within your
TV. You can just click the OK button if you want to upgrade right there and then, and it automatically does it. There's
no phone call needed. So we make it very easy for customers to do that. But, yes, we see customers coming back for a
second time.

Your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Thanks. We've started to see a bit of a resurgence in access line M&A activity in the industry.
Are there opportunities for Verizon to divest wireline assets in 2014 or 2015 in order to increase the wireless mix and
deleverage the balance sheet? And if wireline's a third of revenue today, where would you like to see that in three
years?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, thanks for the question, Kevin. That's pretty little foresight there on divestitures. But,
look, I think Lowell and I have always said we will always look at opportunities for anything. And if we feel that we
can get an adequate return for our shareholders based on the investments we have and the properties we have, then we
will execute on that. So, look, I guess I would say we always have an open mind, but at this point, there's nothing on
the table for us around that. The properties we have are performing extremely well, and we'll continue to execute on
that.
As far as a three-year view, I guess I'll talk maybe a little bit more of that when we get to the end of the first quarter
call, but, again, I'm not going to give any more further guidance. But, look, I think we are very satisfied with the asset
portfolio we have and with the acquisition of Verizon Wireless and owning 100% of that asset, you're going to see us
do more things around converged solutions. So the wireline assets, in my view, will actually become more valuable
over the longer term here with our footprint. So, at this point, I would say, we're open, but nothing on the table at this
point in time.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: And you mentioned the loss of some of the tax credits for bonus appreciation, et cetera. When
you think about your capital budget for the year, are you going to continue to spend at the clip you spent last year for
wireless given some of the spectrum and strong subscriber growth, or are there risks to the CapEx number to fund some
of the higher cash taxes that are likely?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: No, because I think – look, we gave guidance on CapEx at $16.5 billion to $17 billion. As
I said before, obviously wireless will take a higher percentage of that CapEx spend, and the other areas of the business
will take a lower portion of that CapEx spend, especially as the FiOS builds continues to slow here. But, no, there's no
strategic change in the way we view our investments. And I don't do investments based on tax law. I didn't accelerate
CapEx spending when the accelerated depreciation went into effect. I don't anticipate I'm going to slow capital
spending because it's not there anymore. So I think we will just continue to drive and execute on what we have. From a

cash tax standpoint, as I said before, obviously our cash taxes will go up with the acquisition of the 45% of wireless. I
guided for next year, when we announced the acquisition, that we would be somewhere in 35% to 36% ETR. So I think
at this point, that's where we'll keep it, and I'll give you more color once we come out of the first quarter.

Operator
Your next question comes from Joe Mastrogiovanni of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Fran, you have potentially some spectrum
opportunities in the secondary market, and then you have a couple of spectrum auctions coming up. How should we
think about the way you prioritize the low-band spectrum versus maybe the mid- and the high-band spectrum?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, look, I mean, as obviously I think we've shown, that we have made the secondary
market a very viable market. We've done a number of swaps with Leap, T-Mobile, sales with T-Mobile and AT&T, and
some swaps even with AT&T in that B sale that we did.
As far as our portfolio, obviously we like the 700 megahertz for the coverage of LTE that we did. AWS is our sweet
spot at this point in time, which is the spectrum that we've been swapping for. So we have a very efficient portfolio of
spectrum, and I think we've shown through the years that we are very efficient on how we use spectrum.
Keep in mind that, as I said, we will participate in the auctions because we will need more spectrum. But right now our
current position is, with the AWS we have and that we're launching in markets that you know in New York and San
Francisco, Chicago, we're lighting that spectrum up. It's pretty much completed in New York. We will continue to add
to that. But keep in mind, though, too, that we will also reappropriate our 3G spectrum to 4G. So we will take that PCS
spectrum that's been running in our 3G network as the volume of that network continues to decrease as we move more
3G phones to 4G. We will reappropriate that spectrum over to the 4G LTE. So, again, you know, three to four years,
we're in very good shape from a spectrum holding position, but we will participate in the upcoming auctions.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Evan, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Hi. Thanks very much. So I wonder if I could just follow up on that last question. So I think
the next block of spectrum that's going to come on to the market is AWS-3. So two questions around that. First of all,
do you see that as a valuable spectrum block that you really want to earn a part of, or is there enough opportunity
within repurposing some of your 3G spectrum for 4G that that's not critical? And then, in terms of deploying that
spectrum, if it is valuable to you, does it require you to put more equipment on the tower? Or because it's contiguous to
existing spectrum that you are deploying, can you do it with all existing equipment? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah, so, Jonathan, on this one, look, we will participate in the auctions that are coming
up, whether it's the AWS-3 or if it's the broadcast or whatever the FCC is going to auction here in the future. We have
to build our portfolio for the next 10 years out. So, as we have done in the past and we've shown, that when auctions
come up, it's opportunistic. They only come up one time, so you need to participate. And that's what we showed when
we won our 700 megahertz and we won the A and the B blocks a while ago, and now we've repositioned that portfolio;
we've launched the 700 megahertz and the AWS that we have. So AWS-3 is pleasing to us. Some of the higher
frequencies is pleasing to us. So, again, I won't get into – I'm not an engineer, so I'm not quite sure what happens to

have within the network in order to enable these spectrums, but don't think it's much, based on what we've done with
AWS. So we will participate in upcoming auctions.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Great, thanks very much.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay, Evan, last question, and then we'll wrap up.
Operator
Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Great, thanks. Fran, I just wanted to see if you could give us a little – quantify this –
what I call the smart-to-smart phone device upgrade opportunity. You said you're seeing ARPA lift there, but between
the 3G and 4G, I know there's more usage, but is there a way to quantify that kind of ARPA lift you've seen with these
smart-to-smart movers?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah, look, I'm probably not going to give you that, Jennifer. Look, if you look at a 3G
usage moving to a 4G, we know that – and we've seen it in our base – that as soon as you get on the 4G with video
consumption and the quality of video, your usage goes up. So obviously it's hard for us to quantify this, because with
our Share Everything plan, you're obviously buying a bundle of minutes that you can share among all devices. But, as
you can see from our service revenue growth, our ARPA lift, our increase in connections, it's all coming together as to
how these plans were designed. And, as I said, we still have a lot of 3G customers and a lot of basic customers for 2014
that give us a lot of opportunity. So I think I'll leave it there, and the numbers will speak for itself.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Thanks, Fran.
Michael T. Stefanski
Thank you for your questions today. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back over to Fran.
Francis J. Shammo
Okay, thanks, Mike. Look, our industry has a very healthy, competitive environment, and we are forecasting continued
strong demand for video and broadband across multiple networks. As I said, Verizon will compete aggressively in all
of our markets. We will focus on delivering a superior customer experience on the best networks in the world. Our
customer value proposition and the efficiency delivery of our services will generate growth and profitability. This focus
on profitable growth will create value for our shareholders, provide the earnings and cash flow necessary to reinvest in
our networks and platforms for future growth and innovation.
We are very excited about the future. We will continue to invest, innovate around solutions, deliver for our customers,
our shareholders, and our Verizon employees. So, again, happy New Year, everyone. And thank you for joining our
call this morning.
