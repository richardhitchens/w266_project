I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group,
Stephen Hemsley.
Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning and thank you for joining us. This morning we will review our third quarter results and update you on
our view of market trends and developments as we approach 2014.
In the third quarter, UnitedHealth Group earned $1.53 per share on revenues of $30.6 billion. Revenues grew 12%
year-over-year, with continued diversification across businesses and product types. Cash flows from operations were
strong at $3.4 billion, more than two times our net earnings for the quarter. The consistency of our efforts and results is
guided by a focus on serving the distinct needs of all health system participants. Those who receive. deliver, and who
pay for care. No other company is engaged so diversely across health care.
Our services all center around the same three competencies, cultivated for nearly two decades. The organization and
optimization of health resources at the local market level, the application of data, and the enabling use of advanced
technology.
Over the long-term, this approach continues to produce distinguishing results; record growth from those who have
experienced our products and services, well-controlled medical and operating cost trends and improved affordability
and access to health care.
The emergence of public exchanges, private exchanges, Medicaid expansions, growing due eligible and long-term care
needs, accountable care experimentation, rising consumerism, and the confluence of these elements have the potential
to create new opportunities for us to grow and serve in new ways. We continue to adapt to the markets' changing needs.
We offer consumers and customers an unparalleled array of health products, services, and capabilities, and we are
steadily advancing along themes of consumer responsiveness, simplicity and affordability.
Turning to the quarter, our 12% revenue growth, solid earnings results, and steady operating disciplines drove strong
cash flows of $3.4 billion, bringing year-to-date cash flow to nearly $6 billion. As expected, the third quarter operating
margin of 8.6% decreased from last year, primarily due to government underfunding of the Medicare Advantage
program and nearly 40 basis points of impact from lower reserve development. These were partially offset by strong
margin expansion in health services at both UnitedHealthcare and Optum.
Operating costs were well-controlled at 15.9% of revenue. Our percentage operating costs are 20 basis points higher
than the third quarter 2012, despite year-over-year services growth of 25%, or more than twice the growth rate of health
premiums. That said, we have intense efforts underway to continue to increase the overall level of productivity and
realize cost savings across our businesses.
Our debt to total capital ratio was comfortably under 35% at September 30, and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion
in available cash. Year-to-date shareholder dividend payments increased nearly 30% to $777 million. We have
purchased about 37 million shares so far in 2013 at an average price just under $64 per share, bringing our pure share
count now under 1 billion shares.
Turning to business level results; UnitedHealthcare earned $2 billion on revenues up $28.4 billion in the third quarter.
UnitedHealthcare's momentum continues as the fastest growing health benefits company in the market. Increased the
number of people served by 24%, nearly 9 million individuals over the past year. This includes more than 2.9 million

people in TRICARE and another 4.8 million people in Brazil, both new markets for us. Within our traditional domestic
markets, growth has also remained strong. Over the last year, we have grown to serve 1 million more people today in
the employer, individual, senior, and public markets. This growth is varied and diverse across geographies, products,
market segment.
UnitedHealthcare is achieving consistent results by aligning modern benefit design with strong consumer engagement,
empowerment, tools, programs and incentives. These are further aligned to targeted clinical management and wellness
programs that channel care delivery to a focus set of network with proven performance capability and with
progressively higher levels of care provider, financial incentives for quality outcomes and patient satisfaction.
For many years, we have used our commitment to and insight into local market communities to shape our capabilities
to fit each unique market as a provider of health benefits. These same local market insights and relationships play out in
our accountable care strategy, which continues to differentiate UnitedHealthcare. We closed the quarter with more than
$25 billion in annual medical spending, driving a spectrum of first-generation care provider performance incentives.
Today, the healthcare experience of more than 2 million people we serve are directly aligned end-to-end through the
most progressive of these arrangements, including full risk, shared risk, and bundled episodic care payment approaches.
We entered into several new ACO partnerships in the quarter, including our first smart multi-entity ACO with Quality
Health Solutions, a collaborative of four hospital systems and the Medical College of Wisconsin all in the southeast
corner of that state. More importantly, we are making significant gain sharing payments to several of our ACO partners
based on the actual outcomes they are achieving to improve quality and care effectiveness and efficiency for patients.
This includes Optum's care delivery network, earnings payments for its work to improve performance for both
UnitedHealthcare and organizations outside UnitedHealth Group. In the third quarter, UnitedHealthcare growth was
again led by senior market performance. We added 100,000 seniors with Medicare Advantage or Medicare Supplement
benefits and sold 95,000 additional Medicare Part D drug plans. We expect to finish 2013 with market-leading growth
momentum coming through these Medicare offerings. We have already grown by 670,000 people in Part D for the first
nine months of the year.
While our overall Medicare star ratings for 2015 have advanced year-over-year, we believe we can and must execute
much better than these ratings reflect. We are intensely focused on steady and significant improvement in this critical
performance area.
In Medicaid, UnitedHealthcare grew by 15,000 people in the quarter. It was honored to be selected for new awards
serving Florida, and rural Texas, which will begin over the course of 2014. The number of consumers served through
UnitedHealthcare employer and individual grew by 30,000 in the quarter, despite expected in-group attrition.
2013 will be the fourth consecutive year UnitedHealthcare grows commercial membership organically. And
UnitedHealthcare Military and Veterans membership in TRICARE was well-served with its transitional issues now
well in hand.
UnitedHealthcare International has added almost 400,000 people so far this year, with particular strength in the large
group market. Our UnitedHealthcare International medical assistance in clinics business continues to grow and
advance, recently receiving new contracts to serve the global oil and gas industry in the Middle East, Africa, and now
in the North Atlantic.
Optum's technology enabled services again grew strongly in a market sized at over a $500 billion. Our growth potential
was particularly compelling as we continue to develop broader, more integrated, long-term relationships with larger
clients who are pursuing new approaches to the market.
Earlier this week, we announced the formation of the Optum360 business with our partner Dignity Health. Working
collaboratively and applying advanced Optum technology, we expect to improve revenue cycle performance end-to-end
from the perspectives of both patients and care providers across Dignity's 39 hospitals and 300 care centers in 21 states.
Through the Optum360 business, we are together creating the next-generation performance organization dedicated to
bringing these resources to serve a broad base of large healthcare systems across the U.S. To that end, we are engaged

with other care provider systems and believe Optum360 will develop into a sizable and impactful business.
Earlier this week, we announced a multiyear extension and expansion through 2020 of our new 15 year relationship
with AARP. Through this extension, we will continue to advance the overall missions of AARP, with the broadest
offering of senior products and services around health and well-being.
Also, this week, consulting firm Mercer announced it was using both the Optum multicarrier private exchange platform
called myCustomHealth and UnitedHealthcare's dedicated exchange platform to serve benefit choice needs of retirees
and larger employers. And earlier this year, we created Optum Labs to combine and analyze both clinical and
administrative data from large patient populations.
Insights from Optum Labs research will advance knowledge and understanding of every aspect of care delivery, from
care protocols to therapeutic agent performance and more. We expect these research efforts to lead to new and better
products and services and improved overall system performance.
The Mayo Clinic health system is a founding partner of Optum Labs as is AARP and other important national
relationships are also in various levels of engagement. With these, Optum Labs has the potential to effectively become
the national research platform for healthcare data analytics.
These initiatives combined with several other important business relationships and awards this year are the results of
our efforts to align Optum around three major growth drivers: modernizing health system infrastructure, aligning and
enabling the highest-quality, most effective and efficient care delivery and engaging the consumer. These drivers define
the broad business opportunities emerging as healthcare evolves and support our optimism and confidence in Optum's
sustained double-digit growth.
And Optum's operating performance was strong again this quarter. Each business repeated double-digit revenue gain.
Overall revenues rose 33% over last year, to $9.6 billion, led by the 41% increase at OptumRx. Operating margin
expanded 100 basis points to 6.6% despite the increasing mix of comparatively lower margin pharmacy revenues.
As of today, our OptumRx pharmacy migration is 96% complete, more than 11 million consumers have transitioned
and are now served by OptumRx. Our team has successfully executed the largest scale and most complex membership
transition in the healthcare industry.
Optum's strong revenue growth combined with margin expansion has driven exceptional earnings performance.
Optum's earnings grew 54% year-over-year this quarter and 69% year-to-date. Optum is now contributing nearly
one-fourth of UnitedHealth Group's operating earnings up from 16% one year ago.
We believe Optum will achieve our 2015 margin target of 6% in 2013, two years earlier than originally planned. The
combined and complementary performances of Optum and UnitedHealthcare produced very solid third quarter results
as we discussed at the outset, with quarterly revenues up $3.3 billion over last year, driven by increasing
diversification, producing earnings of $1.53 per share with cash flows of $3.4 billion.
We're achieving our full year results against headwinds ranging from intense government reimbursement pressures,
including an unplanned $0.15 per share sequestration impact, and $0.17 per share in lower reserve development as
compared to the strong reserve development levels of last year. And we're getting there while continuing to make
significant investments in our businesses, including the increased level of fourth quarter investment in OptumInsight.
All in, we are tightening our outlook for 2013 net earnings to a range of $5.40 to $5.50 per share. At the raised
mid-point of $5.45, this would translate to a strong 13% year-over-year earnings growth targeted for the fourth quarter
this year.
Our balance sheet strength continues to differentiate UnitedHealth Group. In the past week, both S&P and Moody's
affirmed our corporate debt ratings, and upgraded their outlooks. We continue to project cash flows from operations in
a range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, and expect to return $4 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and
dividends.

Looking forward, we expect our 2014 earnings outlook to be impacted by overall Medicare Advantage funding levels,
as well as the effects of the nondeductible insurer fee on Medicare, as we indicated in our last earnings call.
The significant and continued level of under-funding cannot be fully offset in 2014 from the performance effects we
expect from the balance of our health benefits market. And we see limited potential for dramatic further improvement
in overall medical cost trends, recognizing how well medical costs have been controlled over 2012 and 2013. We fully
expect Optum to again grow and perform strongly, and we are well along in far reaching efforts to improve
productivity and control operating costs across the entire enterprise, and we will as always endeavor to use capital
judiciously.
Given that overall landscape, we expect our 2014 earnings outlook, which we will introduce and discuss in detail at our
December 3 investor conference, will once again begin the year with broad earnings range that will likely straddle to
the upside and to the downside our current year performance outlook of $5.40 to $5.50 per share. We will of course be
focused on performing to the highest possible level. 2014 and 2015 represent periods we have long described as
challenging in the near-term, followed by the potential for several years of growth and advancement once these market
changes are digested. The history of market changes in the healthcare sector over the past 50 years bears that out.
Our own historical performance provides some context. It is worth noting that today we generate more than $1.5 billion
in operating earnings from businesses we were not even in at the start of 2006. We have grown earnings per share at a
14% annual rate since the end of 2009, accompanied by strong cash flow growth while going through the most
prolonged economic and employment downturn in nearly a century. Over the last 10 years, we've quadrupled our
market share in health benefits from a starting point of 3%. yet today we are only 13% penetrated into the overall U.S.
population. While we have the largest enterprise serving the healthcare services markets, we estimate our penetration
into that $0.5 trillion market at just 6%.
Today our business is serving Medicare, and Medicaid beneficiaries are approaching parity with our 30-year-old
commercial health benefit businesses. Optum is ahead of our 15% by 2015 commitment, and moving rapidly toward
our goal of representing well more than 30% of our overall income contribution, and growing at a strong and
accelerating pace. We are committed to thoughtful growth pursuing international markets, where emerging economies
and fully-developed nations both recognize the need to meet the growing healthcare needs of their people, and are
looking to the private sector to play a key role. And here in the U.S., we have recently taken important steps toward the
adjacent primary care market, focused on serving populations whose needs are high where we can make a positive
difference to them and to their benefit sponsors, one of the most fragmented yet influential of all sectors across the
healthcare landscape.
We can only be certain of one thing, that UnitedHealth Group will look meaningfully different 10 years from today.
We are committed to being a differentiating factor and a better healthcare system and to grow and productively use
capital in the process. We look forward to your questions today so we turn to the moderator.
Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Thanks, good morning. First question, just a follow-up on your 2014 commentary, Steve, I just
want to make sure I was clear on that. So it sounds like the UHC business will be down in earnings year-over-year with
Medicare Advantage driving down. Any color on how the commercial and Medicaid businesses will look?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, well, we're going to kind of try to keep our – this call is not the time when we get
into the details of this. We provide guidance at the investor conference, and I really don't want to front run that process.
So I will leave it kind of in the context that we put it that when you look at the businesses in total, pressure that's on the

Medicare Advantage program from the funding pressures that we have talked about for some time and then look at the
performance of the balance of the businesses, each of them have their challenges and their opportunities both, we come
out in a range that, as I said, straddles. So with both upside to where we are today as well as probably a downside
starting point. And that's largely where we think we'll probably position 2014 as we go in and we're going to try not to
provide a great deal more detail than that other than the portfolio has that potential within it and that we are focused on
a number of things that we think will drive towards the upper end of that performance. But that execution remains to be
done and so we will kind of keep it in that kind of context this morning and then we'll talk about it in much more detail
when we get to the investment conference.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Okay and then just a question on Optum. Can you give us some color on the Optum360 revenue
opportunity post the Dignity announcement? And also the PBM, can you give us an update on the Medco integration
and how you're positioned heading into the 2015 selling season? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure, I'll let Larry kick that off.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: So, Justin, it's Larry. I'm assuming you read the announcement about our arrangement with
Dignity Health. As we said earlier in the year, we were going to try to establish what I would call larger, deeper, more
complex relationships with our clients. And I would say that Optum360 is an example of that.
We won't go into the detail of the contract or we won't go into the detail of the numbers but what I would say about that
is that it is a multiyear, multibillion dollar contract and it is a next-generation RCM that we are starting with them that
will – candidly will simplify patient billing and as well as modernize healthcare administration. So nice win, nice
venture that we put together and more to come on that and I'll ask Dirk to handle the PBM?
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Yes. Thanks, Larry. I guess what I would say is the PBM migration and the success has given
the market confidence that we can compete. It's given us a lot of scale to be able to purchase more effectively and I
think candidly our synchronization as well as specialty value propositions are resonating well in the marketplace. So
my commentary on 2015 is that ultimately we've – not a lot has moved but what business has moved, we've won more
than our fair share of. So I think we're really well positioned for 2015.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Great, thanks for the color.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please? And we'll try to keep it to one per; that was a nice portfolio of
questions on that one but let's try to keep it to one each. Thanks.

And our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - A.J. Rice>: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe I'll just ask you to flesh out a little more your comments about the
Medicare Advantage outlook. Obviously you've now got some competitive information available. Can you give us your
assessment of the landscape moving into next year, prospects for overall enrollment growth in that segment, and maybe
for the market overall if you have any thoughts on that, and anything you could say on the margin outlook on that?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I'll have Jack comment on that, but I think our – as we look at the benefits, we see
that our position is pretty positive. Jack?
<A - Jack Larsen>: Thanks. A.J., good morning. So in 2014, once again, we are looking at market opportunity that
expands upwards of 3 million seniors or so, many of whom who we think will be well-positioned to select Medicare
Advantage. And I think in our planning this year, we started where we start every year, and that is with identifying the
benefits that seniors value the most, while keeping the year-over-year total cost changes to them as low as possible.
This year was obviously made far more difficult than prior years given the reductions in the effective rates that we
received versus the expected medical cost trends. So you have, I'm sure, no doubt seen some of the competitive plan
offerings, and while it's still very early in OEP, I think today is the third day of selling. I'd have to say that we're

pleased. We're pleased with where we positioned ourselves competitively in our key markets. And we're pleased with
some of the things that we are seeing in terms of the leading indicators coming from our field sales teams, our web
portals, and the busyness of our call centers.
In terms of growth, I think as Steve shared in his opening comments, we had industry-leading growth in 2013,
something we're very happy with. I would say at this distance, when we come to you at the investor conference, we will
be positioning our growth as moderating off of the sort of blistering rate we've had this year. And keep in mind, that
we're approaching 2014 with almost 150,000 people impacted by our planned withdrawals. So I'm sure we'll have lots
more to say about that at the investor conference in the next few weeks.

Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - David A. Styblo>: Good morning. It's Dave Styblo in for Windley. I had just a question on the private exchange,
and if you could talk a little bit more about your strategy there. How you guys are approaching it, and what sort of
success you're having this year, as well as the enrollment cycle that's going forward so far?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Gail, do you want to kick that off?
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: Good morning. It's Gail Boudreaux. First of all, in terms of the overall exchange
market, we see – we're very positive about it. We see it as a significant opportunity, both for UnitedHealthcare, and for
Optum. And I think one of the things to remember, the private exchange market isn't brand new. While it's certainly
seeing some acceleration and going into 2014 we have had offerings, strong product offerings, and feel very
well-positioned in a number of those markets. Thinking about the private exchange market, I think you have to think
about two sub-sectors of it. One is the retiree exchange and that retiree exchange has had a very consistent movement
over the last two years of employers moving into either group Medicare or into private exchange offerings.
Again, our product offerings there have continued to grow and are very strong. We also offer, through Optum, an
opportunity to do a multi-employer exchange which has seen increased enrollment in it and we expect to see solid
enrollment going forward. The active space is really getting a lot of recent press. You heard in Steve's comments, our
offering – we participate pretty broadly, actually, and again, feel that we have a very strong product offering in the
private active exchange, and we expect to continue to see growth.
From our perspective there's a number of different types, certainly the movement from a self-funded offering to
fully-insured offering is a positive for us. But overall, we're pretty optimistic and positive, and we see them as an
expanding distribution channel going forward.
And maybe I'll ask Mike Weissel to comment a little bit about the Optum opportunity, because we work closely with
Optum as well and see their opportunity.
<A - Michael Weissel>: Thanks, Gail. David, this is Mike Weissel, Executive Vice President at Optum. And from our
perspective, we really see two major opportunities for us in the exchange marketplace. The first is it's acting as an
enablement platform, using our myCustomHealth platform to work with payers, providers, states, employers and really
anyone who needs that platform for doing an exchange. Maybe the greater opportunity and the more exciting
opportunity for us is how we utilize all the Optum products to assist our clients. So any company moving to a private
exchange often has a greater need for incentives, wellness, care management capabilities, to create a consistent
experience across their membership, and we just see a strong market for ourselves over time and really using our
services to meet that need.

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So for us basically exchanges have two dimensions – it is a great new channel for us and
we'll participate in that channel. And then for our Optum business it is – we can not only be a channel as that but also
enable others. So we really see exchanges as having two business dimensions for us.
Thanks for the question. Next, please?

We'll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter Costa>: Hi. I want to zoom in a little bit on the cost trend commentary about it not being a helper going
forward and also combine that with the fact that payroll [ph] TPD (29:58) went from sort of a helper by $100 million
last quarter to a headwind of $100 million this quarter. Can you contrast that with your commentary and talk about
what you see going on with the medical cost trend?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I'll have Dan talk to medical cost trends but we've had very strong performance in
those over the last two years and I think our only signaling was there is only so much you can expect to achieve out of
that so I think that was really the nexus of it. I don't think we're really planning on offering any new or enlightening
views about where trends will be. Dan?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Peter, Dan Schumacher. With respect to our medical cost performance
as Steve said we were very pleased with it over the course of the year thus far but obviously this is a space where our
work is never done. As you look underneath it I would tell you that inpatient is an area that continues to be very
distinguished for us. So as you look at each of the three quarters this year in each of our three businesses we've lowered
our bed days. And that's been true for the last four years. So doing well in the inpatient side.
As you look at the commercial space in particular we've had, against our expectation, some improvement in the
outpatient as well as we continue to focus our programs around – on the network spend, around the appropriate site of
service and things like that.
When you put it together at the commercial market level we have a trend expectation that we provided. It was 5% to
6% and we'd now expect to be at the lower end of that range. As you think about the development I wouldn't read into
the variation of that quarter-to-quarter or business-to-business. Some of the factors that influence that obviously is our
operating performance and stability but also those programs, what I was talking about in outpatient as an example. As
we introduce those programs and they begin to come into in full effect we start to realize those in our actuarial process.
So there is differences in timing quarter-to-quarter and business-to-business.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And last year we did have exceptional levels of reserve development and that fits into the
narrative of the contrast between the quarters – or year of 2012 versus 2013.
So next question please?

And we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris D. Rigg>: Good morning. Just wanted to touch a little on the Medicaid business and the industry fee there.
I know we're getting kind of late into 2013 now. Any sense for whether you expect some margin leakage there because
of the tax? Do think they're generally going to be made whole in most states? And color would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. I'll have – Steve Nelson do you want to take that?

area since last quarter. We have just to kind of level set. We have a very robust and consistent rate advocacy process

where we're consistently engaged with our states around rates in general. And the insurer fee and the tax impact of that
is a part of that ongoing conversation. And I'll tell you at this point we have about a quarter of our states that have
formally committed to including both the fee and the tax impact in the rates and while we have a lot more work to do

Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Great. Thanks. I appreciate the fact that you're probably not going to have an ability to
put a fine point to this at all yet at this point. But just the commentary around the headwinds to MA for 2014, just to
kind of beg the question about what the implications are for 2015. Because as we look at 2015 we already know we
have the healthcare reform cuts to the rates, we have the coding adjustment, we have the industry fee increasing, we
have – you mentioned the stars maybe didn't improve as much as you would want them to. So there's a number of
headwinds in 2015 which may argue that the rate situation in 2015 might not be dramatically better than 2014? So just
want to understand if there's any good reason to think that the headwinds in 2015 would be any better a starting point
for thinking about what 2015 looks like as to kind of how you think about how 2014 is going to shape up?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I think you have a good list of the headwinds that we all see and have talked about,
so you have been attentive to our calls over the last couple of quarters. Those are the things that concern us about
basically the funding approaches that have been taken to the Medicare Advantage program, because it does serve a
quarter of the U.S. seniors and is the fastest growing and by far the most popular of the programs.
So that's why we have been vocal about it in that context. So those headwinds are real. Now we are clearly pushing
back against those in terms of how we're approaching the business and I'll let Jack speak to some of the actions that
were taken along those lines and our star performance clearly has to improve. We are not pleased with our execution
there and that is something that we have to address.
But we are positioning that business and that business has grown very nicely and we want to kind of balance the
position of that business and continue to grow it because long-term, Medicare Advantage and whatever other products
come forward in the private sector in Medicare are going to be important because the pressures that you're seeing in the
funding from these programs are the pressures that are felt in the program in total and the private sector is the best
outlet for that.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Just before we get the clarification...
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: That's prologue; I'll let Jack respond, sorry.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: I was just going to say that yeah, I'd love to hear Jack's perspective but just to clarify
do you feel the 2015 headwinds are the same or worse or better than what you're seeing for 2014?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: We don't know. I would certainly hope that the funding actions are stronger than they have
been in the last couple of years. And then unique to us I think that we need to improve our star performance and that's
going to affect us in 2015. That's the thing that I would say would be unique to us. Jack?
<A - Jack Larsen>: So hey. Good morning, Kevin. Jack Larsen. I guess maybe first things first. You've articulated all
the headwinds that we're seeing and we certainly early on recognize that the shifting of all of the legislative and
regulatory prompted rate reductions, re-calibrations, insurers, taxes, channeling them through benefit-design changes to
seniors would have been absolutely questionable to them individually as well as I think to the sustainability of the
program itself. We also recognize that notwithstanding that point of view on overall reimbursements, we have a

responsibility to ensure that we are doing all that we can to make sure that we make the basic product as affordable and
as accessible as possible.
The kind of work we're doing is making sure that we have highly performing, best in class networks that are aligned
not only with us and the physicians but also with the members as well. We are doubling down on the efficiency, of our
clinical programs and then of course the never-ending battle we wage on operating costs. All that sort of goes into
make the MA program sustainable in individual markets. And so I think with the work we did in 2014 puts us in a good
position to take on those challenging headwinds in 2015.
Let me spend a moment on stars since that, I think was embedded in part of your question. I would say overall that we
are pleased with the progress we've made that we have almost 2.5 times more of our members in four-star or better
plans for 2014 that will impact the 2015 payment year and you need to keep in mind that that star rating represents the
activities that we did in 2012. So while that's a nice percentage gain overall, I have to say that we're admittedly starting
off from a relatively low level and we have, as Steve said, much more work to do to get to the point where we're
making the progress we should. I can tell you that we have an intense level of focus all around the company, starting
with Steve on down to the UnitedHealthcare organization and also within our Optum colleagues who are really an
integral part of our overall success [indiscernible] (39:06).
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: We are focused on this sector, for sure. Next question, please?

Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So I guess I want to talk a little bit about MA in the context of
the overall UnitedHealth Group, and I think you guys historically have talked about the sort of 13% to 16% earnings
per share growth. Obviously, we're not going to get too close to that this year. And then it sounds like, I don't know
what straddling means exactly, but it sounds like the midpoint is going to be something relatively flat on a
year-over-year basis. So it would imply, if the overall business is growing even just low teens, that MA is going be
down by a third in terms of profitability next year.
And so I look at your market actions and I understand there's been some product exits, but you guys are entering four
new states or counties in four different states, new counties altogether. And so I guess I'm just a little bit confused as to
what the actual magnitude, in terms of the headwinds on MA? Are we really looking at a business that's going to lose a
third of its profitability in one year?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Now so, again, let's go back to the first question. We'll talk about 2014 in more specific
terms at the investor conference, and we will go through each of the business lines along those lines. The pressure on
MA is not a new subject. We have been talking about this through the course of the year. We have a lot of opportunities
to improve the performance of that business but we have to take a look realistically at the funding levels that have been
imposed there. And the other businesses also have their individual pressures. So we're going to talk about them on a
line-by-line basis at the investor conference, and then as a total portfolio.
But if I go back to the range, we are clearly focused on growing earnings in 2014 and the range that we're beginning
with encompasses that upside potential. And I don't know – I think it's appropriate for us to be very direct with you all
about the headwinds that are in the marketplace, and we have done that with you each year, and to position ourselves
appropriately in a range because there are a range of performance outcomes that could occur as a result of those
headwinds, not all of which are fully predictable. But we are putting forward I think, an appropriate and I would say
positive context for thinking about 2014 that we are discussing a range that has upside performance above the upper
range of our current year performance. So I think I would walk away from that, in my view, in a positive context. There
is a lot of work we will have to do to perform that upper end, but we are clearly focused on that.

<Q - Joshua R. Raskin>: So I think, Steve, I think I understand the context in which your range will encompass
potential upside relative to this year. I guess I'm still trying to figure out and quantify what the actual impact from MA
is. You guys have talked about the funding challenges as you mentioned...

And our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Thanks. Was wondering if you could help us think about how pricing is shaping up in the market
for commercial and individual and small group, both on and off the exchanges? And then, without getting into too
much detail, maybe if you can help us think directionally about how you're thinking about enrollment for commercial
large group in national accounts for next year?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So maybe Gail would start out and then Jeff could comment?
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: Sure. Good morning. A couple of questions there. Let me start with the pricing
question. First, on the commercial pricing environment, we've talked about this on I think every call I've been on. It
remains a competitive environment. This year's a little different in that as every year we see, I call them different
themes that play out in each of our local markets. And some of those themes, this year, are around what I'll call very
selective disruption. It's not broad, but there are some of that playing out as well as some of the early renewals that are
occurring in the market.
I think what's important to note, about our approach, is we haven't changed our pricing approach. It's staying very
consistent, our controls and discipline are staying consistent, and our focus really is around the value-based products
that we've put in the market over the last couple of years and feel that those will resonate very well.
In terms of – I think your second question was on national accounts enrollment, I'm going to ask Jeff to comment on
what's happening there. But before I go, actually, you had asked about the pricing in the public exchanges. And our
comments on that, as you know we have taken a very modest position in the public exchanges, and unlike any other
new entry into the market, these are structurally different market to market, very similar to our existing portfolio so you
have to look at those.
Again, our approach in those markets is very consistent, and we look at things that are basically two functions when we
set our price. One is the expected cost of the product and network configuration is an important part of that, and then
the expected cost of the people to enroll, and that discipline has stayed very consistent. As we look at the pricing across
the public exchanges, you would expect to see a broader range, because of it being a new market and quite frankly, the
network product configurations that are in the marketplace today. So I don't think that's unexpected, but that's
essentially what we are seeing. And I'll ask Jeff to comment on the national accounts marketplace.

<A - Jeff Alter>: Thanks. Hi, Scott. It's Jeff Alter. Just to wrap up with Gail on pricing, because obviously pricing and
our enrollment outlook are tied together. So again, we remain unchanged in our discipline, and our pricing to forward
costs, and sometimes, as you know, over our history in doing that it can tend to cause us to give share back in the
short-term. So as we think about our enrollment in 2014, keeping it at a high level, obviously sitting in the middle of
October, there are a lot of things still to play out. But we do expect our enrollment to be down next year, and as Steve
said in his comments, we've come off a string of very successful years. But we expect that down to happen primarily in
a couple of areas.
One, we've mentioned that the national accounts season early on had a structural change in that the pipeline for new
business, and new business in existing accounts was the lowest we had seen in a number of years, and probably based
upon all the changes at the national level in the healthcare system, many of our national account clients sat still. We've
mentioned it before and this morning about the impact of private exchanges, which we think are going to be positive
overall financially, but as we do transition some of our businesses and some of our clients that are total replacement
into an open exchange model, it would be prudent to believe we're not going to continue to have the total population
back. But financially, it's still a very good trade. And then, we've got our individual business, which I'll start right out
by saying, is not a large contributor to our financial performance, but we do have about 900,000 individuals who will
be impacted.
So that's – those are those tranches, and then I think we've talked about this and the world knows about this, the largest
driver of our outlook for down for next year is the loss of that large public sector account, which we are protesting, but
at this point, believe it's appropriate to say that's a loss. So those are the – that's where we're looking at our outlook.
Obviously we'll have a lot more detail in December for you.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Thanks. That's helpful. And if I could just clarify on that, so are you saying that when you say
"expect to be down", is that overall commercial membership? Or is that both overall commercial membership, and
national accounts membership? Just want to make sure that we have that clear.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Both.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please?
Operator
And our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the public exchanges. I know you guys
provided some commentary already, and obviously you guys have taken a more cautious stance, at least initially. I
guess, again, now that you've seen the pricing, are you surprised at some of those levels, and maybe some of the
strategies some have taken? And then, any concern of sort of spillover effect onto the commercial pricing environment
over time because of that? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Gail, you want to...?
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: So I'll go back to – again, there's a few embedded questions in there. The pricing
environment in the public exchanges, again, ours is a pretty modest footprint. And there – I think it's hard to draw
conclusions at this stage from what we're seeing in pricing from that market because it is based on a whole group of
factors that are not necessarily in the broader small-group market. So I think that's the first thing and it does really rely
on the estimate of the product configuration, the network that was chosen as well as the expectation of what the
population of enrollment is in that network.
So from that perspective again, while I can't comment on others, we did expect to see some diversity and we think over
the long term that as people get experience and understand what's happening in that market we'll see that come into a

tighter range, would be our expectation. And then in terms of our pricing philosophy I keep going back to, we've been
very consistent. We're keeping that same consistent methodology. The one change that's happening in the marketplace
as you know is market's going to adjusted community ratings. So that is a change in the marketplace but it's something
we're well prepared for and a large part of our business is already in that model given the states we work in.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please?
Operator
And we'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Good morning and thank you. Steve, I'm very intrigued by your commentary, more
qualitative obviously than quantitative, about 2014 because my sense is the early perception of the initial straddle
guidance in loose terms was negative. And yet when you clarified it which was very helpful you suggested that we
walk away from it positive. And I think it was negative because it was seen initially – early e-mail contact – as being a
reversal of your prior commentary which on the second quarter call I think you said that you're intensely focused on if
not committed to achieving – finding ways to achieve growth in 2014 despite the headwinds. So let me just clarify if I
may. So you said you'd walk away from this positively. Stock is down. Obviously the Street's walking away from it
negatively. This seems to me to be a continuation of what you said before except represented in a range around current
year guidance. That's question number one.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: That's exactly right. So I don't know how many questions you'll have but that one – if you
go back to our commentary and we do pay attention to what we said in the prior teleconferences. We see today's
commentary to be completely consistent with that. We would always have come out in a range and what we're really
signaling is that that range will have an upper end and we are basically confirming that today.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Right. Okay. So that is good news because obviously with all the headwinds it could have
been negative. So the real question if you can give me some qualitative sense are the things that would have to go right
to get to an upper end of that range versus a lower end of that range? In very broad terms, the positive influences that
you see because we've heard a lot about the negatives. But I'm interested in the opportunity to achieve that upper end
which again would temper the negatives for today or decide maybe it's inappropriate to temper that negative? Thank
you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So I'll do my best. But basically we laid some of the threads out in the teleconference. We
expect our performance on our services businesses – our Optum business and the services business in United to
continue to grow and perform strongly. We said that in the teleconference. We must execute at very high levels along
things that are hard to do because the medical cost trends have been so well managed we have to continue to not only
manage them well but manage them better than we have. We have to execute on strategies we discussed before on
Medicare around focused on specific targeted markets, narrowing networks, ever effective. There are areas where we
could make progress in terms of effective care management on the ground level. It would be in the Medicare book of
business.
Those kinds of elements – managing and taking our productivity and operating cost disciplines to a next level
performance which I think we are very capable of doing are all areas that we see as opportunities. And kind of even to
the last area of discussion as I think you all well know that sometimes to improve performance and improve it on the
long-term you have to do things in the short term that don't – that have a longer-term logic to them. So you have to
really hold the pricing disciplines. Sometimes you'll have to give back some membership in the marketplace to perform
more strongly in the current year and going forward.
So all those elements that you would imagine, we have to do and we have to execute well on. And as we do, we will
position ourselves for an even stronger performance position for 2015 because all those things we talk about are
structural in nature. And then beyond that, we see growth opportunities that come on to a much harder, much more
rigorous platform. That is in essence the elements of the plan. We will be laying those kinds of things out in the

investor conference. And to the first part of your question is we put out a range that has a – acknowledges and upside to
where we are today as well as a downside because I think we have a responsibility to acknowledge the headwinds that
are in the marketplace.
The notion that we are putting out, a range that has a upside to it, we think, is completely aligned and consistent with
the conversation we had last quarter. We are focused on growing earnings of this enterprise. It will be difficult in 2014.
We've said that before, but beyond that we think the things that we're going to do are going to improve and strengthen
our business going forward. And we have very strong businesses and growth opportunities in Optum and we haven't
even touched on International. So that's why I think we do take a positive attitude about where we are.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator
And we'll go next to Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Yes. Thank you. Just one question on the Medicaid business. You touched on the
headwind from the industry fee there. I think, though, when we had visited you guys a couple of months ago, Jack, you
in particular had highlighted that unless I misunderstood that the Medicaid business is – on an overall basis you
expected earnings to grow in 2014? I'm just, I'm trying to match that up with the size of the headwind that you might be
facing and maybe some of it is just going to be timing because the rates will catch up, but how do you get there with the
industry fee not reflected in many of the rates?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I think we can go back to Steve Nelson's comments, but I think what he was offering
in his discussion about overall rate advocacy is whether you can pinpoint that element in the rate response from the
states. We are getting rates that would suggest that we have opportunity for growth in 2014. So I would've said that, to
me, was one of the more positive elements in terms of his commentary. So I think we are getting that kind of overall
rate relief. Steve, is that correct?
<A - Steve Nelson>: Absolutely. There's not only – within that positive view on the opportunity to grow earnings, but
some of this membership growth as well. And that will come from a lot of sources but our geographic footprint is really
strong. We're in states that we've developed great partnerships with and we're bringing innovations and capability and
have demonstrated competitiveness with recent wins and so I think there's a lot of opportunity. We feel pretty positive
about that business.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Great. That was important clarification. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. Next question, please?
Operator
And we'll go to next to Tom Carroll with Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tom A. Carroll>: Hey. Good morning. So question on the mix shift that you're highlighting with the sizable
fee-based growth here this quarter as well as last quarter, I believe you commented on it. But looking year-over-year at
the change in your operating cost number as well as your cost of products sold number, those two things together are up
about $700 million year-over-year and I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of how much of that increase is
attributable to the fee-based growth, and should we think about kind of a higher-level of operating cost going forward?
Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Maybe Dave Wichmann would be best to cover this but when we talk about operating
costs relative to that, we're talking about services. So we're talking about the difference between insurance premiums
versus services. There are some services in UnitedHealthcare, but the big pieces of services are Optum. Virtually all of
Optum's businesses fall into that category and a significant portion of Amil as well, because Amil has significant care

delivery services. All of those elements contribute to that. So those are the elements that are growing very rapidly, and
are outgrowing our premium-based arrangements in creating the higher proportion of operating costs versus medical
costs, because medical costs only come through on risk-based products. Steve?
<A - Steve Nelson>: Yeah, so a couple of things. First, I think specifically to the lines you're looking at, if you look at
our services growth year-over-year, it's 25%. If you look at our products growth year-over-year it's 19%. And those two
things are disproportionately pushing our operating costs, which are up about 14% year-over-year, and our cost of
products some of which are up about 17%. So you can see, just by the very nature of those few line items that there is a
significant influence, there. But maybe in the context of the operating cost ratio being up 20 basis points
quarter-to-quarter I could demonstrate this more fully. The single largest driver of that increase has been, and in this
quarter is no exception, continues to be mix – business mix changes. And those are the things that Steve just laid out.
We had a large funding conversion this year, as you recall, in the first quarter.
That of course, reduces our revenue side. We have Amil included and Amil has a higher operating cost ratio in the
business. We brought on TRICARE, which is a significant fee-based arrangement, and of course the results at Optum
are eye-popping in terms of the growth, and that's largely services-based business. That again, is the dominant
component of that. But in addition to that, we have been implementing ICD-10, PPACA, implementing TRICARE and
re-implementing it unfortunately this year as well. But also this PBM migration as well. So again, a large contributor to
the operating cost ratio this year. I'll tell you these are significantly offset by the productivity advances of this team.
Very significantly offset. I'd say our productivity is not only at the upper end of the range we typically have given you,
but it's an additional 50% more. So very, very strong results this year in terms of the way we manage that. So in
general, we are very pleased with our operating cost results and the progress we've made in containing them, and that's
something that we're committed to doing into the future as well. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you for that question. Next, please?
Operator
And we'll go next to Sarah James with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sarah James>: Thank you. Can you speak to how you're thinking about public exchange accounting?
Specifically, can you reasonably accrue for the three Rs, and there's been some talk of a plan-initiated data share
program to aid on understanding market average risk scores that CMS doesn't provide until 2015. So is this something
that United is considering participating in, and how valid is the insight from this group, meaning how much of the
exchange market may be participating in the data share?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dan, do you want to take care of that?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Sarah.
<Q - Sarah James>: Good morning.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: With respect to risk adjustment I think it's important to recognize that it's not something
that's unfamiliar to us. We've got a couple of our large states, and very successful states, where we have modified the
forms of risk adjustment today. And also we operate in Medicare Advantage, which as you know, has a big risk
adjustment to it as well. To your point, we have absolutely participated with a third party to gather industry information
and get some feedback on where we sit, and based on that information, as well as our past experience, we feel very
comfortable with our ability to estimate the results as we get into 2014. And the other thing that I think is important is
our size and geographic diversity is another thing that plays in our favor with respect to risk adjustment.
<Q - Sarah James>: It sounded like you have already participated with this third party on sharing information, so is
there enough out there to kind of tell what the average health of the exchange is? You know if they're more costly or
sick?

<A - Dan Schumacher>: Yes. We've participated in two cycles of that right now, and we will again in the first quarter,
participate in another cycle of that. And they're endeavoring to get 75% of the market participants at a local level,
segmented by small group and individual. So we'll be able to, based on that information, we think we've got a good
sense of it. And also, again, our size and geographic diversity are things that'll be important to us.
<Q - Sarah James>: Is there any comparison you can offer to your traditional commercial book, you know the – how
much more sick these people are -
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So I think we might be getting a little muddled in this because I think you might be asking
about, does this give us insight into what we think the public exchange mix looks like? And I don't really think we're
going to get – we usually don't have an experience with that, and I don't think it is our place to comment on that. I think
Dan was commenting that the size, diversity and geographic spread of our book gives us a perspective of being kind of
very average across the nation. We're a good proxy for a national platform. Is that right, Dan?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: That's right. And, Sarah, this obviously relates to both on and off exchange business in small
group and in individual. And it's really – that's the reference around our size and scale, not our exchange participation,
which as we've said before is modest in the initial year.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Okay. So I'm sure we'll be talking and touching more about that at the investor conference
as well. So next question, please?
Operator
And we'll go next to Carl McDonald with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carl R. McDonald>: Great. Thanks. I wanted to focus on the OptumHealth business earnings up roughly 90%
this year, and that's come mainly from margins running 300 basis points above your expectations. So just the two
related questions there: what's driving the margin expansion within OptumHealth and do you think a 10% margin is
sustainable or should we look, going forward, for that margin to return to more historical levels?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Larry and John, do you want to touch that?
<A - John S. Penshorn>: Before we start, Carl, can you clarify – are you asking about OptumHealth – sorry, this is
John Penshorn. Are you asking about OptumHealth or Optum overall? I don't follow your question.
<Q - Carl R. McDonald>: OptumHealth, specifically.
<A - John S. Penshorn>: Thank you.
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: So, Carl, it's Larry Renfro. Let me make a couple of comments, and then I'm going to ask
John Rex to jump in on this. You know, when we look at Optum, we look at the three – what I'll call – the three
organizations. And we have a margin range of each one of them, and OptumHealth is 8% to 10% and OptumInsight is
15% to 19% and OptumRx is 3% to 4%. And we try to manage this throughout the year, and I realize that we had a
very good quarter in the third quarter. But I would say that over the 12-month period based on mix, seasonality and
investments that we're making that we still believe that that range in OptumHealth is going be in that 8% to 10% range.
So we don't see anything that's changing that. I think Steve commented that overall, and I'll just say this, that we
believe that this year we will finish at 6%, which was one of the goals that we had set for 2015 for Optum overall. But
maybe I'll ask John to comment on this in more detail.
<A - John S. Penshorn>: Yes, if we look at it in particular, so first of all, I'd comment that when I look at
OptumHealth and the performance nine months to date, and actually I'll kind of broaden a little bit and talk about
Insight and Rx also within that context, that when I look at the nine months, we're within the range of those long-term
guidance ranges we've given. So nine months to date within OptumHealth and OptumInsight, we're running at the high
end of those ranges and within OptumRx we're running just about in the middle of that range, and that would be our
expectation going forward.

I mean I think quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, we see impacts from mix, seasonality and investments that we'll be
making in the businesses. So that's why we stick with those long-term ranges that we've set out. If I were to think about
OptumHealth, in particular in terms of the 3Q and some of the highlights, I mean I would say the entire portfolio of
businesses within OptumHealth were performing well. But I'd maybe point out local care delivery, our population
health and our health related financial services businesses, all strong contributors. But again very much sticking with
that long-term range that we've laid out for these businesses as we will continue to invest.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah. And I think, in total, if you look at Optum as an emerging enterprise that there is
scale opportunities there that are meaningful. And I think that when we talk about things like One Optum and so forth,
that's what we're really talking about is that we have opportunities to, we think, continue to improve the performance
and yield of that business.
Next question, please?
Operator
We'll go next to Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Hi, following up on Optum. I'm hearing a couple of things I just wanted to clarify. I'm
hearing that we're within the long-term range of margins that we expect which suggests that margins will be – probably
not move much next year relative to this year but I'm also hearing it's an emerging enterprise with scale opportunities.
Scale opportunities suggest to me margin improvement opportunities. So can Optum grow earnings at the same pace in
2014 as they did in 2013? How do I think about that?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So just let's go back to the very first question of the call. This is again more triangulation
around 2014 that we would really prefer to save for the investor conference and can then actually present those things
in a coherent and fulsome basis, see all of the offerings across the enterprise, their relative challenges and their relative
opportunities. There are clearly opportunities in Optum. We are clearly looking to improve its performance, grow its
earnings, improve its margins but we're not going to comment specifically on 2014 until the investor conference.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Okay. Well, then taking a different question then. If you look at Amil, can you talk to
how that's performing and is this an investment year, how do I think about this year's Amil performance relative to kind
of future opportunity? Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. Well, I think we have great growth aspirations for Amil and I think it's performing
on or above its plan but Dave, you want to talk?
<A - David S. Wichmann>: Yeah. Christine, Dave Wichmann. For the first nine months of this year Amil is ahead of
its financial plan both in terms of growth and profitability. So obviously we're quite pleased. I think the economy in
Brazil is shaping up to our expectations, so it provides a nice platform if you will for growth. We are seeing that growth
in the business, both in terms of our membership growth on medical lives which are up about 365,000 since we started
and then also in the general marketplace as well which are up about 400,000 lives since we commenced just under a
year ago.
And I think that growth is really the greatest testament of the strength of Amil's offerings and the value of its, what I'll
call semi-integrated delivery model and its ability to offer higher quality as well as cost effective products in the
marketplace. This quarter we're experiencing winter so it's counter seasonal to what we see here in the United States.
So as expected, its earnings are off related to seasonality, not relative to our overall expectations.
Just on the integration front it's going very well. I'd just point out two things. One is we're really working with Amil to
I'd say bring a more modern technology and operating infrastructure to that marketplace which I think is a great
opportunity for us to distinguish ourselves in the market around service quality and whatnot in addition to the clinical
quality aspects of the model that they offer. And likewise they are in turn helping us with ideas around clinical care
delivery and how that integrates in local markets and drives superior performance on behalf of the consumers we serve.

So overall, you should take away from all of that that we're quite pleased today with our Amil relationship.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. So we'll take two more questions. So the first of those would be?
Operator
We'll go to Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Baker>: Thanks a lot. Just a question on OptumRx. Given the fact that you're at the tail end of the
Medco integration here, I was wondering if there are any plans to differentiate your specialty pharmacy management
offering given your unique positioning in the marketplace?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Yeah. Sure. Well, we have a couple of philosophies on specialty and the first one is we really focus
on adherence because adherence for these very sick patients drives lower medical costs for our customers. The second
thing is we want to eliminate drug waste, so we do a lot of work with respect to making sure that we take [ph] led
(1:13:36) values and the like, to make sure the treatments are working. And the last thing I think we can do from a
specialty standpoint is we have great visibility into the medical benefits so we can see and manage about half the spend
that resides there.
<Q - Michael J. Baker>: Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please?
Operator
And we'll go last to Steve Halper with FBR (sic) [Lazard Capital Markets LLC]. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve P. Halper>: Yeah, hi. Just looking at OptumInsight over the last few years. You've been focused on Optum
One and focusing on certain business lines. How is that progressing in terms of achieving the overall efficiencies as
well as what were the stronger performers within Insight during the quarter?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure, Larry, you want to kick that off and then Bill -
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: And I'll kick it over to Bill. The overall [ph] one-off and plan (1:14:34), and I think you said
this, had in it for 2013 that we were pivoting to growth. And pivoting to growth, what we had talked about doing was
really being able to position ourselves to attract what – and I said this earlier, a larger, deeper and more complex
relationship and the Optum360, the Dignity deal is a good example. That is part of OptumInsight and Bill can talk a
little bit about that.
I can tell you that as we go down the road here, the pipeline is very strong. We think we are well-positioned in the
marketplace and I think that you're going see more and more of these larger organizations that are going to be part of
what I'll call planned investments that we have to put in place as we still have to – we really have to develop and
innovate as we become more of a potent solutions oriented organization. So we're positioning for the future a lot in the
OptumInsight area. So, Bill?
<A - Bill Miller>: Yes, I think we continue to see specifically our compliance offerings expand. A lot of the work that
we're doing with payers around payment integrity and to Larry's point, our provider businesses as we continue to create
depth with them and really the one Optimum strategy coming together to really give more end-to-end oriented solutions
is being, I think, very warmly received by the industry. The latest example of that is the Optum360 relationship with
Dignity. And I think we're seeing a continued demand for us to be more end-to-end in our approaches and that has been
the intent of the One Optum thought and our product integration and our business integrations and I think were reaping
the rewards for that.

<Q - Steve P. Halper>: Thank you.
Stephen J. Hemsley
So I think that's it. Let me just briefly finish by thanking you again for joining us this morning, your interest and
participation. I think we had a very solid third quarter in the context of a very strong 2013. We think we a have
meaningful performance opportunities in front of us. We are focused on optimizing the performance of this enterprise
and addressing the headwinds of 2014, and we will look forward to sharing more detail with you and insight at the
investor conference on December 3. Thank you.
