MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Altria Group 2013 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to
last about one hour, including remarks by Altria's management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brendan McCormick, Vice President, Investor Relations, for Altria Client
Services. Please go ahead, sir.
Brendan J. McCormick
Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. I am joined this morning by Marty Barrington, Altria's Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Willard, Altria's Chief Financial Officer. This morning we will only be
discussing Altria's 2013 business results for the first quarter, and will not be discussing status of tobacco litigation.
Our remarks contain forward-looking and cautionary statements and projections of future results. And I direct your
attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements section at the end of our earnings release for the review of
the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. For a detailed review of Altria's
business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website altria.com.
Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Today's call will
contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the
comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in today's earnings
press release and are available on our website.

In addition, comparisons discussed in this conference call are to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated. As
previously announced, effective January 1, 2013, Altria's reportable segments are smokeable products, smokeless
products, and wine. In connection with this revision, results of the financial services business and the alternative
products business are combined in an all other category. Prior-period segment data have been recast to conform to the
current period segment presentation.
Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Marty Barrington.
Martin J. Barrington
Thanks, Brendan. Good morning, everyone. Altria's diverse business model delivered strong financial results for the
first quarter as the company increased its adjusted diluted earnings per share by 10.2%. Higher pricing contributed to
adjusted operating companies income and margin growth in all three of our reportable segments. Higher earnings from
our equity investment in SABMiller and lower interest expense also drove adjusted EPS growth.
In the smokeable products segment, PM USA grew adjusted operating companies income and margins while increasing
retail share for both Marlboro and PM USA. PM USA continued to support Marlboro's new brand architecture with
brand-building activities that contributed to Marlboro's retail share gains for the first quarter. Earlier this year, PM USA
expanded distribution of Marlboro's Southern Cut nationally. Marlboro's Southern Cut, part of the Marlboro Gold
family, has a uniquely rich and smooth flavor. Each of Marlboro's product family has exciting activities planned for the
year to enhance brand strength.
Earlier this month, PM USA received a $483 million credit against its Master Settlement Agreement payment to the
states as a result of the settlement of NPM adjustment disputes with certain states. The credit increased the smokeable
products segment's reported operating companies income, but we excluded it from adjusted operating companies
income.
Middleton's volume and retail share of large machine-made cigars decreased for the first quarter. The quarter was
marked by heightened competitive activity including high levels of low-priced imported machine-made cigars.
In the smokeless products segment, USSTC and PM USA increased adjusted operating companies income and margins
while growing Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share and volume. USSTC is supporting both Copenhagen and
Skoal with equity-building initiatives.
In the first quarter, USSTC expanded Copenhagen Southern Blend into additional states. In February, Skoal began to
refresh its packaging to better reflect the brand's contemporary premium qualities and differentiate its product
offerings.
In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle delivered strong operating companies income and margin growth by expanding
distribution of its premium wines. As we've explained in the past, our tobacco operating companies remain very
focused on understanding the evolving preferences of adult tobacco consumers and creating superior new products for
them.
In our core tobacco businesses, PM USA, USSTC and Middleton are making disciplined investments in innovation to
expand the reach of their premium products to segments in which they are underrepresented. We apply the same
disciplined approach to developing innovative tobacco products for adult consumers who are interested in alternatives
to traditional tobacco products. Today, we're pleased to announce another step in our efforts to address these changing
preferences.
In the second half of this year, Altria's subsidiary, Nu Mark, plans to introduce an electronic cigarette into a lead
market. As you know, awareness and trial of e-cigarettes have increased over the last year, a subject to which we have
been devoting attention and product development resources. We believe that Nu Mark should now enter the e-vapor
category, and we expect to provide more detail on these plans at our Investor Day in June.

Altria remains focused on cost management. Our current cost-reduction program remains on track, and is expected to
deliver $400 million in annualized savings versus previously planned spending by the end of 2013.
During the first quarter, Altria paid $886 million in dividends and purchased shares valued at $57 million. We're also
pleased to share with you today that our board of directors has authorized a new $300 million share repurchase program
that we expect to complete by the end of 2013.
We are pleased with Altria's results for the first quarter. Altria reaffirms that it expects its 2013 full-year adjusted
diluted earnings per share to increase by 6% to 9% to a range of $2.35 to $2.41 from an adjusted diluted base of $2.21
per share in 2012.
Howard will now discuss Altria's business results in more detail.
Howard A. Willard
Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. In the smokeable products segment, first quarter reported operating
companies income increased 33.4%, largely due to PM USA settlement of the NPM adjustment disputes with certain
states and higher pricing, partially offset by lower reported shipment volume. Excluding special items, first quarter
adjusted operating companies income for the smokeable products segment increased by 1.3% to $1.4 billion. Adjusted
operating companies income margins increased 0.9 percentage points to 41.9%.
PM USA's reported cigarette shipments decreased 5.2% for the first quarter, primarily due to the industry's rate of
decline and one less shipping day, partially offset by retail share gains and changes in trade inventories.
PM USA believes that the trade depleted less inventory during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of
2012. When adjusted for one less shipping day and trade inventories, PM USA estimates that its cigarette volume was
down approximately 4% for the first quarter of 2013 compared to the prior-year period. PM USA estimates that the
total cigarette category's adjusted volume declined approximately 4.5% in the first quarter.
PM USA's first quarter retail share increased 0.5 share points versus the prior year as measured by its new tracking
service. Marlboro grew its retail share by 0.2 percentage points and L&M drove a 0.5 percentage point share gain in
Discount for the first quarter. These gains were partially offset by a 0.2-percentage point share loss on other premium
brands.
Cigar shipment volume decreased 16.8% for the first quarter, primarily due to retail share losses and changes in
wholesale inventories. Black & Mild's retail share as measured by its new tracking service decreased 3.1 share points,
primarily due to heightened competitive activity including high levels of low-priced imported machine-made large
cigars.
Turning the smokeless products, reported operating companies income for this segment increased 15.6% to $222
million for the first quarter, due primarily to restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2012 related to the
cost-reduction program and higher pricing and volume. These factors were partially offset by higher promotional
investments and unfavorable mix due to growth in products introduced in recent years at a lower popular price.
Adjusted operating companies income increased 5.2% to $222 million. USSTC and PM USA's combined reported
smokeless products shipment volume increased 3.4% in the first quarter.
Strong volume gains for Copenhagen were partially offset by declines for other portfolio brands. USSTC grew
Copenhagen and Skoal's combined volume by 4.9%. USSTC and PM USA estimate that the smokeless products
category grew by approximately 5% over the 12 months ended March 31, 2013.
Adjusted smokeless products volume is difficult to estimate on a quarterly basis. However, after adjusting for changes
in trade inventories and year-over-year calendar differences, USSTC and PM USA estimate that their combined 2013
first quarter adjusted smokeless products shipment volume grew at a rate slightly below the 12-month category growth
rate.

USSTC and PM USA's combined first quarter retail share of the smokeless products category decreased 0.4 share
points as measured by the new smokeless tracking service. Copenhagen and Skoal grew their combined retail share by
0.5 share points. Retail share for other brands decreased 0.9 share points.
Copenhagen grew its retail share by 1.3 share points as products introduced by Copenhagen in recent years continue to
have a positive impact on the brand's retail share. Skoal's retail share declined 0.8 share points as the brand was
negatively impacted by competitive activity and Copenhagen's strong performance, partially offset by share gains for
Skoal X-TRA.
Ste. Michelle's reported and adjusted operating companies income of $20 million was up 33% for the first quarter,
driven primarily by higher shipment volume and higher pricing. Ste. Michelle's reported shipment volume increased
9.5% for the first quarter, driven primarily by the growth of certain premium brands and the timing of the Easter
holiday.
Marty and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let us cover a few housekeeping
items. Keep in mind that the tobacco product pricing and retail share figures are from the new tracking services. We'll
also provide you with restated figures from the first quarter of 2012 so you will be able to compare the periods.
Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 34% in the first quarter of 2013. Marlboro's price
gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 35% in the first quarter of 2012. Marlboro's net pack price in the
first quarter of 2013 was $5.79 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.32.
In the first quarter of 2012, Marlboro's net pack price was $5.71 while the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.24.
The cigarette discount category's retail share was 25.5% for the first quarter of 2013, unchanged versus the first quarter
of 2012.
The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the first quarter was $1.42 per pack, up $0.01
versus the fourth quarter and up $0.05 versus the first quarter of last year. Copenhagen's first quarter retail price was
$4.07, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 37% in the first quarter of 2013. In the
first quarter of 2012, Copenhagen's retail price was $4.07, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was
approximately 42%.
CapEx was $15 million for the first quarter, and we estimate capital expenditures for the full year will be in the range
of $125 million to $150 million. Ongoing depreciation and amortization was $54 million for the first quarter, and we
estimate depreciation and amortization will be approximately $215 million for the full year.
Operator, do we have any questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: First – so just in terms of the industry consumption decline in the quarter – so I think your
competitors have commented on some of the factors that may have caused a little bit of a softness in terms of the
industry volume. So, if you could just comment on what you think is driving a bit of a moderation in terms of the
overall cigarette industry shipments?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, thanks for the question. I guess I'd begin by observing, Judy, that this is best seen
over time. I think to take one quarter's worth of data and to try to extrapolate too much is probably a bit dangerous. If
you look over time, you see that the cigarette decline rate has been about 3% to 4%. Our estimate on an adjusted basis

for the quarter is about 4.5%, although PM USA was less than that at about 4%, and we saw in 2012 it was about 3%.
When we look at it, we don't see any big drivers in the first quarter that would argue for a sustained acceleration in the
volume decline. And folks have pointed out various factors in the quarter, the end of the payroll tax holiday, some
referred to the gasoline prices and other factors. So, I think we'll have to see is the answer. But again, we're informed I
think generally by the fact that the historical decline rate has been in that 3% to 4% zone.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just in terms of your decision to launch your own e-cigarette brand in the second
half, I know we'll get more details at your meeting, but just in terms of why now. Are you more comfortable with the
regulatory – the potential regulatory environment for e-cigarettes? Do you think that the category is starting to have a
bit more of an impact on the cigarette consumption? Or do you think that you've got the product that you're really ready
to go in with a differentiated positioning? Just rationale for why now?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. I mean, we've observed previously that we were monitoring the category carefully,
of course. It's obviously relevant to consumers that we know quite a lot about. We had devoted significant product
development work to it. And we think that for all those factors, the reason that we're announcing that we'll be out in the
second half is we have a product and we have plans that I think will allow us to compete effectively in this area that's
emerging. It's small, of course, relative to traditional tobacco products, but there's no denying that adult tobacco
consumers have shown some interest in it. So, for us at Altria that's spot on our mission. We're about providing adult
tobacco and wine consumers superior branded products, and that's our intention here, and we'll learn our way in
smartly.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just lastly on pricing, so if you look at smokeables, your pricing was up pretty
nicely both year-over-year and sequentially. So, maybe if you can talk about your promotional activity in the first
quarter versus a year ago or the fourth quarter. And then is there any impact in terms of the cigar, either pricing or the
volume decline that's causing the smokeable pricing to be up more? Or is it just really consistent more with the
cigarette pricing?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah. I mean, if you look at smokeable, if you look at net effect of pricing, actually is
quite nice, wasn't it? Call it – I don't know, 4.5%, give or take. But we had a significant volume decline year-over-year
for the reasons that you've asked about it and we've pointed out and others have pointed out. So, basically it's driven by
the volume. The cigar numbers, if you look at cigar shipments, obviously year-over-year, they were distorted a bit by
trade inventory factors. And we've got pretty highly competitive dynamic in the cigar space with people with bringing
in low-priced offshore-made product. In terms of the cigarette competitive space, I would say it's pretty much in line
with what we've seen before. It's competitive out there, but it's been competitive for some time. We didn't see any
particular change in the first quarter.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling.

Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Hi, good morning, Marty.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, David.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: First, let me ask you about your cigarette promotional activity during the quarter. Did – was
that recalibrated at all because of the weaker volumes?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No. I think in line with what I just said that our plans as you know in the smokeable
segment, we're trying to maximize income, we're making sure that getting modest share momentum on Marlboro, and I
think that's what you see play out in the quarter. If you look at Marlboro share growth year-over-year, it's about

two-tenths. So, I think we stuck pretty much to our plan, which is what we intend to do.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. And then on e-cigarettes, I think it's sort of a philosophical question. It's certainly
legal to advertise those products much more broadly than other tobacco products – or tobacco-derived products,
including television. And some of the leading brands in that category are on TV. Is that something in the current
regulatory environment you'd be willing to do?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: We're looking at all that now is the honest answer, David. That's why we'll have more on
that in June. Our intention is to do this, to do it responsibly, and of course, as you well know, and everyone else who
follows us knows, a lot of that will be defined by what the FDA has to say about how they intend to regulate these
products. So, our intention is to compete and to compete effectively. We'll work through all those particulars which

Thank you for your patience. You may now resume.

caused the line to drop out. Apologies to everyone.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: No, no. No problem. I hope it wasn't something I said.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No, it was nothing you said at all. I'm not sure where we dropped, so let me know what
you heard, and I'll try to pick back up without repeating unduly.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Let me go on to a different question. I was able to hear your response with respect to
e-cigarettes. The only other thing I wanted to ask was about your management of your product mix within the
smokeless tobacco business. Both this quarter and really all of last year, revenue growth has been pretty much in line
with volume growth. You've taken list price increases, but the mix within the portfolios really offset the net pricing.
And I'm wondering is that what you envisioned and hoped for, can you do a little bit better, is that – are you overdoing
some of the price positioning of your line extensions? Or is that just a function of the competitive reality in that
market?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, I wouldn't be too concerned about that. If you look at the mix of the products in
smokeables, they're overwhelmingly premium. We've discussed previously having to manage a brand of the size and
scale of Marlboro and having some price points for people during a tough economy, so I won't repeat all that. But the
overwhelming amount of the products in the smokeable segment are premium, and that's our intention because we're

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Citi.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Just to go back on cigarette industry volume trends, I mean, I hear you loud and clear on an
adjusted basis, it's not the end of the world, the down 4.5%. But can you comment on the sequential trends that you saw
in the quarter month-to-month?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, again, I guess I'd go back – I just hate to suggest that one quarter's worth of data
really provides us with a lot of insight. I can tell you, Vivien, there was a slow start in the quarter, and then it got
stronger as we went through the quarter for the first quarter. We obviously don't comment intra-quarter, so that's not
intended to be a comment on the second quarter. But again, it's just a cautionary note about trying to read too much into
one quarter's worth of data on this.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Understood. And do you guys have an estimate perhaps on the potential volume impact
from e-cigarette consumption in the quarter?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No, I think it's too small to read. It's probably – we know there's some interest so it's
probably having some effect, but it's really too small to read and extrapolate from at this time.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Understood. And lastly, could you comment on your outlook for both state excise taxes and
federal excise taxes?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, let's take them one at the time. In terms of state excise taxes, Howard gave you the
numbers year-over-year. We're watchful, of course; there's a fair amount of activity. This is the peak time as you know,
during this period of the year when state legislatures are in. We have some activity in Massachusetts and Minnesota.
There's been a proposal in California. We and others are obviously doing our best advocacy to try to persuade
legislatures that that's not the way to go, as consumers are already very heavily taxed in this area.
But there is a fair amount of activity in the states and we'll have to see how she goes.
If we switch to the federal excise tax, as you know the President raised this issue in his budget proposal. We are
strongly opposed to that. As you know, federal excise tax was raised 158% just a few years ago. It's incredibly
disruptive. These taxes are regressive, they're unfair, and to the extent that programs are proposed that are for the
benefit of everyone, we think that there are better ways to finance them than to put it on the back of adult tobacco
consumers. So, we'll see how it goes, this dynamic in Washington, but we're hopeful that that won't come to pass and
we're certainly advocating against it.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: And do you have a specific number in terms of your outlook for the weighted average state
excise tax increase of the full year?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No, we don't forecast that.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: I have a question on your decision to enter the e-cig category. I was hoping you could give us a
little more color on the process you undertook to evaluate your options for entering, and then what other options you
considered. And then could you give us some color on any test markets you've had or focus groups you've conducted
for your e-cig?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: You just don't want to wait for June, do you, Bonnie? You want me to...
<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: I don't. I do not.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I can understand, and I appreciate your interest. Well, look, it always starts with the
consumer, and that's where we began. Our mission, as I just mentioned a moment ago, was to provide adult tobacco
consumers with superior branded products. So, we wanted to make sure we understood the consumer dynamic. And as
we've discussed previously, there is some interest out there, there is some trial, awareness is high. So, we started by
trying to understand those dynamics and to understand them well. And, of course, you have to do product development
to try to find products that are interesting to them that are going to have interest to them that'll work in the marketplace,
and that's the basic process that we follow.
We have a robust center for research and development. We have robust product development capability. We have good
insight into this consumer. We have great brand-building capability. And so, that's the process that we followed, and
then when we have something that meets those standards, we'll put it into a test for elite market to see if the consumer
reacts to it the way we predict he or she will, and that's what we're about to do in the second half. So, that's a bit of an
overview, and I know it's at a high level, but we can talk about that some more when we're ready to say more about our
plans.
<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: No, I understand. That was really helpful; I appreciate it. And then, I'd love to hear your
thoughts and reaction to some of the comments made recently by Mitch Zeller while he was on a panel at the NATO
Show, specifically as it relates to three priorities, menthols, substantial equivalence and then deeming regulation on
e-cigs, and I'd be curious to hear if you've had much dialogue recently with Mr. Zeller.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, we engage with the FDA regularly, up and down the Agency at the Center for
Tobacco Products, and that includes at the director level as well as with all of the staff in the various groups that work.
And our strategy has been and continues to be to be in full compliance with the regulations that govern our businesses,
as well as to engage and to try to be thoughtful and constructive about the issues that face the industry. And we did that
before, and we'll do that again.
I wasn't particularly surprised about the topics that Mr. Zeller referred to as being his priorities because as we all know,
these are the topics that have been the subject of some discussion. The Agency had said for some time that it was
working on deeming, so I'm not surprised that he will continue to work on deeming. Substantial equivalence has been
much discussed and the Agency, I think, is working hard to try to move those along. So, I think those are the topics we
would expect, and we would expect for Mr. Zeller to come in and do a professional job in accordance with the statute
as did his predecessor.
<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: Okay. And then my final question is on your Marlboro Special Blend. I was hoping you could
talk further about any progress you've made to narrow the relative price gap between your Special Blend line and then
regular Marlboro's? And as you're lowering promos on MSB, what has been the consumer reaction, and then the
retention?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, we don't break it out at that level of detail, but I would remind everyone what our
strategy is here. Overall, for the smokeable segment, because we're trying to maximize income while maintaining
modest share momentum on the Marlboro, we've deployed Special Blend for the purpose of making sure we have a
price point for some price-sensitive consumers in the franchise. They want to be in the Marlboro franchise, they like

Marlboro, but the consumer macro-economy has been hard on them. So, we want to make sure that we have a place for
them.
You correctly referred to our strategy of – I'll begin I guess with list price, reminding everyone that Marlboro sells for
the same list price everywhere. And then we had different promotional platforms within the franchise, and we've
reduced the promotions for Special Blend over time as we've been able to do that. So, overall, I think we're pretty
happy with how that's come together. You see continued margin growth in the smokeable segment. So, all in all, we're
pretty happy with that. I think we've also discussed previously if and when the economy really begins to improve and
get some traction and adult tobacco consumers are feeling better and we have higher consumer confidence, those
promotional platforms can be further modified.
<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Just had two questions for you. The first one, and forgive me if I missed this, but
just there were some questions around around promotional spending. I'm just curious sequentially in the cigarette
business if you could talk about promotional spending? And did that actually tick down in Q1 from Q4?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I think I'll refer to what I said before, Chris, which is in terms of the competitive
environment in the smokeable segment, it's about where we've been. It's competitive out there, it's been competitive,
and our plans take all that into account.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then I was also curious on a year-over-year comparison basis. You had a lot
of new product activity in the year-ago period and heightened promotional levels. Is that at all a factor in your volume
performance in the first quarter, especially with Marlboro Black launching a year ago at this time?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No. I don't think that's the way to see it. It looks just like it's industry volume
performance, and again, you can see that PM USA actually performed better on an adjusted basis against that volume
than did the industry.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. If I could ask just one more, there was a recent update by the FDA to Congress
on – and had some mentions and obviously discussions of modified risk tobacco products. Is that something that –
obviously it's an opportunity for the industry, there's been no applications for MRTP. Do you have any plans, or
anything you can speak about in that regard, or any update on modified risk tobacco products, and how PM USA or
other businesses may pursue that?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I can certainly comment on why we supported the FDA, which included this protocol, to
get modified risk tobacco products approved. And we've advocated to the agency as we have for some time now, and
you can see these papers on altria.com that we believe that's an important policy issue for FDA. We believe that the
role of manufacturers like ourselves are to try to develop these products to make the case about why they should be
considered for modified risk if the science and evidence supports it. And it's the Agency's role to the consider those
applications and then communicate accurately to consumers if the case is made. And we're actually pleased that there's
all this activity at FDA. It's an important component of its mission to regulate tobacco products, so we support that.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for your call.

Your next question comes from the line of [ph] Philipe Buson of Mitsubishi Securities (35:24).
<Q>: Yes. Good morning. Two questions, if I may. The first one is about the $1.4 billion in debt coming due in
November, I'm going to assume that you will refinance that. Given the current rate environment, might you also be
taking advantage to refinance some of your higher coupon debt or the premium at which those bonds straight, or is it
just too high that you're not willing to take the hit on the P&L?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah. I'd rather not talk about our future plans for that debt. Certainly, when you look at
our historical pattern, in some cases, we've – when our debt has matured, we've issued new debt, and we did do a tender
refinancing last year. But I'm not in a position to share what our plans are through the end of this year.
<Q>: Okay. And then just a follow-up on Bonnie's question with regard to e-cigarettes. As you know, one of your
competitors yesterday estimated that the impact of e-cigarettes on volumes for cigarettes may have been somewhere
around 1%. I understand it's very early on, it's a small category, but more holistically, my question is, the way that you
see the category potentially evolve over time, what do you see the margin potential to be, and how do you make sure
that you're going to protect the profit pool from the traditional cigarettes as there could be more cannibalization down
the road? Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah. I understand your question. It's just so early to make any predictions about that. I
don't think I'd be giving you any help. I replied in response to a question a bit earlier about it's very hard to even
understand at these small numbers the volume impact or not, so to be predicting about future rates and margins and
cannibalization is just a bit ahead of where we are.
<Q>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for your question.

Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA [Credit Agricole Securities (USA)].
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Just looking at your share repurchase pacing, you've had comfortably over $1 billion each
of the last couple of years, and now you've got the $300 million authorization for this year plus a little bit from Q1.
With the NPM cash coming in, what – seems like you'd be in a position to certainly do more comfortably. Is there other
strategic priorities that might be on your radar instead, or how are you thinking about the capital allocation?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Sure. I think as you pointed out, we've done over $2 billion since 2011, and certainly we
feel good about the new $300 million program. I think to start off with how we thought about this year, obviously the
primary way we return cash to shareholders is through dividends, and the dividend was increased last August. And I
think each year we look at our various cash needs and decide what the appropriate amount of share repurchase is, and I
think at this point, we feel comfortable with the $300 million, but certainly, we'll keep an eye on that as the year
evolves.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just looking at e-cigarettes, does today's
announcement imply or suggest that you wouldn't do – that you're only moving organically, or would you still consider
an acquisition in that space as well?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, our announcement today is that we have developed a product that we intend to
launch in the second half and we don't comment on acquisitions.

<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. Fair enough. And then just – I realize you'll give us a lot better detail in June, but is
that something you would consider using the Marlboro brand for, or would it be a separate brand that you'd go to
market with?

out our plans. Good try.

Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin at Davenport.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Ann.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: I wanted to switch to cigars. I wonder if you'd comment a little about your strategy for the
cigar business. Is there any innovation, repositioning the brand? Can you comment on the loss at retail? Can you just
give us an update on cigars?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, it's pretty competitive out there in the cigar space. You have – our strategy, which
is we're trying to, just as we are with cigarettes, we're trying to maximize income there. We have as you know, Ann, a
large percentage of the tipped segment there and the profitability there remains pretty good. It's in the cigarillo space
where we're seeing lots of competition with low price entries, some of which has been facilitated by these imports that
Howard and I mentioned in our remarks. And so, we would like to have greater exposure in the cigarillo space, but
we're also mindful of trying to maximize our profitability there. And that's what the brand people are trying to work
through right now. If you've been at retail and you've seen this, it's just mighty competitive on price, and we, of course,
prefer to compete on equity.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: All right. That helps. Thank you; that's all I have. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Marty, you mentioned a minute ago that if the economy improves you might consider your
promotional activities. Is there any particular number that you look at when you judge the economy? Is it
unemployment, is it consumer sentiment, or is it more a gut feeling by management how the economy is doing?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I would say it's a combination of a number of factors that we track closely. We certainly
track unemployment. We're mindful of underemployment. I remind people that the labor participation rate continues to
drop, which really, if the unemployment rate were corrected for that, unemployment would be even higher than it being
what's reported. We watch housing starts pretty carefully, and that's actually a bit of an encouragement, isn't it? That
housing starts are doing better than they were a year ago. We've got a number of those factors that we watch, and then,
of course, we try to manage to branch to the gaps as best we can based on all those data.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. And then the other question I had for you, for five of the last six quarters, at least from my
math, the retail price increase for Marlboro when you exclude the impact of fed excise taxes has been below the price
increase that I calculate when I look at the reported numbers that you have in your income statement. Can you help me
understand philosophically how this continues to – this retail price underperformance continues to drag on like this?

<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, again, I'd go back to – if we start with manufacturers' pricing, our pricing ticked up
really quite nicely. At retail, there are a number of factors that influence the average retail pack price. Some of them are
our trade programs, some of them are retailer strategies about how they choose to compete at the c-store, and what
you've seen I think during the period that you've referenced is a number of those strategies coming to bear in the retail
market. So, as you know, we offer a variety of Marlboro programs, MLP, Flex, Margin Option, which are intended to
offer retailers the opportunity to align their strategies as best they think they can with Marlboro. And I think those are
the dynamics you see. Retailers have different strategies for different platforms, indeed for different stores. Our goal is
to try to offer programs that give them choices to make with respect to our business.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Chris
Ferrara of Bank of America.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Hey. Thanks, guys. I just wanted to follow-up real quick on the buyback question. I
know you said $300 million is the number and you're comfortable with it. But can you just give a little color as to why
you're comfortable with it? Because I think you recognize – the question, which is you had a lot of buyback, you have
more cash coming in and now the buyback projection is lower. So, any color you can give on why would be fantastic.
Thank you.
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Sure. I think – I hesitate to give forecast on what we're going to use our cash flow through
throughout the rest of the year. But I think it's something that we look at pretty carefully. And certainly when you look
at an 80% dividend payout ratio, most of the cash is going out on a pretty regular basis. And I think for now, we feel
that the $300 million number is the right number. Certainly, there'll be greater color as to the cash use as the year
progresses.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Thank you.

Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Citi.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Hi. Thanks for the follow-up.
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Sure.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: I just wanted to circle back on the question that Michael asked. Can you just clarify from a
regulatory standpoint is there anything that would preclude you from using an existing cigarette brand name on novel
new tobacco products?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, that's a bit of a complex topic. What I was trying to convey to Michael was as
we're thinking about the product that we intend to launch in the second half, Vivien, that we'll have our plans rolled out
as they become more final. Maybe that's best handled offline. I can get Brendan or someone to walk you through the
complexities of using cigarette brands in various spaces.
