With that I'd like to turn the call over to Ford Credit's CFO, Mike Seneski. Mike?
Michael L. Seneski
Thanks, Molly. Consistent with prior quarters, today's presentation will cover Ford Credit's profit and credit loss
performance, Ford Credit funding and liquidity highlights, automotive cash, debt and liquidity and then we'll wrap
things up with a summary of the quarter. Let's look at Ford Credit's operating highlights on slide 1.
Ford Credit had another strong quarter with pre-tax profit of $507 million and net income of $364 million. Managed
receivables were $94 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $3 billion from year-end 2012, primarily explained by
increases in wholesale receivables and net investment in operating leases. First quarter charge-offs were $45 million, up
$10 million from the prior year. The first quarter loss receivables ratio was 20 basis points, up three basis points from a
year ago.
At March 31, the allowance for credit losses or reserve was $389 million or 41 basis points of receivables. Managed
leverage was 8.4 to 1 at March 31, 2013 compared with 8.3 to 1 at December 31, 2012. At the end of the first quarter,
our equity was $9.8 million.
Slide 2 shows the $55 million increase in first quarter pre-tax results compared with a year ago by [indiscernible] (3:34)
factor. The results are primarily explained by higher receivables and favorable residual performance, offset partially by
lower credit loss reserve reduction. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pre-tax profit increased by $93 million
compared with the fourth quarter. Ford Credit continues to expect 2013 pre-tax profits to be about equal to 2012,
year-end managed receivables of $95 billion to $105 billion, and distributions of about $200 million.
Slide 3 shows our quarterly trends of charge-offs, loss receivables ratios and credit loss reserve. Our first quarter credit
losses continued to be near historically low levels. Year-over-year charge-offs were up $10 million reflecting lower
recoveries and higher severity in the United States. Quarter-over-quarter charge-offs were down about $4 million
reflecting higher recoveries. The loss receivables ratio was up three basis points versus the prior year. The credit loss
reserve was $389 million, down $90 million from a year ago and down $19 million from the fourth quarter reflecting
the continuation of the historically low losses.
Slide 4 shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. retail and lease business, which comprises approximately
75% of our worldwide consumer portfolio. Over-60-day delinquencies were up five basis points from the same period a
year ago, down one basis point from the past two quarters and still below our historical average.
Repossessions in the first quarter were 8,000 units or 1.29% of average accounts outstanding, down 25 basis points
from the same period a year ago. Severity was $7,200 in the first quarter, about flat from the fourth quarter and up $500
from the same period a year ago, primarily reflecting lower relative auction value. U.S. year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter credit loss performance is consistent with the worldwide results discussed on the prior slide.
Slide 5 shows the U.S. Ford and Lincoln lease residual performance. Lease return volumes in the first quarter were
7,000 units higher than the same period last year, reflecting primarily higher lease placements in 2010 and 2011. The
first quarter lease return rate was 69%, up 3% compared with the same period last year, reflecting a higher mix of
24-month contracts, which typically have return rates than longer-term contracts.
In the first quarter despite higher content on vehicles returned, our 24 and 36 month average auction values have
remained pretty flat when compared to both a year ago and the prior quarter. Our worldwide net investment in
operating leases was $15.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $1.2 billion from year-end 2012.
With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.

Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide 6, we are on track to achieve our 2013 funding plan. In the first quarter, we completed
about $8 billion of funding in the public term market. Our public term issuance included about $3 billion of unsecured
debt transactions in the U.S. and Europe and about $5 billion of public asset-backed transactions in the U.S. and
Canada. Our asset-backed transactions included issuances in all three major asset classes and our first seven-year term
wholesale transaction.
We ended the quarter with $31 billion of committed capacity, about flat when compared to year-end 2012. Our funding
strategy remains focused on diversification and we plan to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels and
investors. We remain focused on maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet.
Slide 7 shows the trends in funding of our managed receivables. At the end of the first quarter, managed receivables
were $94 billion. We ended the quarter with about $10 billion in cash and securitized funding was 46% of managed
receivables. Our projections for year-end managed receivables at $95 billion to $105 billion and securitized funding as
a percent of managed receivables at 42% to 47% are unchanged from prior guidance. We expect this percentage to
continue to decline over time.
Slide 8 shows our 2013 global public term funding plan for Ford Credit, excluding our short-term funding programs.
This includes our issuance plan for Ford Credit Europe, which is detailed in the appendix. As I mentioned earlier, we
have completed $8 billion of public term funding in the U.S., Canada and Europe. We project full year global public
term funding in the range of $17 billion to $24 billion, consisting of $7 billion to $10 billion of unsecured debt and $10
billion and $14 billion of public securitizations. All unchanged from prior guidance.
Turning to slide 9, our liquidity remains strong at over $20 billion, up slightly from year end. Ford Credit sources of
liquidity include cash, unsecured credit facilities, FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines, and other asset-backed
bank capacity. As of March 31, we have 41 – I'm sorry $40.8 billion of cash and committed liquidity sources, down
$1.6 billion from year-end, primarily reflecting seasonality in first quarter debt maturities.
Utilization of liquidity totaled $19.1 billion and we ended the quarter with gross liquidity of $21.7 billion. Capacity in
excess of eligible receivables was $1.5 billion, same as year-end. We are focused on maintaining liquidity levels to
meet our business and funding requirements through economic cycles.
Now we'll summarize our automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the first quarter, which is captured on
slide 10. Automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $16 billion, $1.7 billion higher than year-end 2012. The
increase is driven primarily by $2 billion of debt issuance and the consolidation of $500 million debt from our
Romanian operation, offset partially by the redemption of about $600 million of higher cost callable debt and other
debt repayments. Proceeds from the debt issuance that were not used for reduction of higher cost debt are being used
for pension contributions, which will reduce our pension expense by a greater amount than the interest incurred on the
incremental debt.
Net cash at the end of the quarter stood at $8.2 billion, $1.8 billion lower than year-end 2012. Automotive liquidity at
the end of the quarter was $34.5 billion, equal to year-end 2012.
Now let's close with the summary of the first quarter. The company earned an operating profit of $2.1 billion and net
income of $1.6 billion. Automotive operating-related cash flow was positive as well and we ended the quarter with
strong liquidity. North America achieved record quarterly performance for pre-tax profits since at least 2000.
Asia-Pacific earned a small profit while Europe and South America incurred losses as anticipated.
We raised $2 billion of 30-year debt and contributed $1.8 billion to our worldwide funded pension plans which
included $1.2 billion of discretionary payments to our U.S. funded plans. We ended the quarter with automotive net
cash at about $8 billion and liquidity was about $35 billion.
Ford Credit had another strong quarter with pre-tax profit of $507 million. Managed receivables were $94 billion at the
end of the quarter, up $3 billion from year end. Credit losses continued near historic lows. Year-to-date Ford Credit has
completed about $8 billion of public term funding and is on track to complete our full-year funding plan.

Ford Credit's liquidity was about $20 billion for the quarter which is in addition to Ford's automotive liquidity of about
$35 billion. And with that, I'll turn it back to Molly, to start the Q&A session.
Molly Tripp
Thanks, Neil. With that, we'll start the question-and-answer session. Teisha, can we please have the first question?
Q&A
Operator
Yes. Will do. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Karson from Bank of America
Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Great, guys. Thanks. I have one or two quick questions here. I guess first is the capacity
improvement in Europe. I know you talked briefly about it on the previous call but could you just refresh me on the
timing of when those plants are going to be taken down and when we'll start seeing some of the capacity improvements
in Europe take hold? I'm thinking it's the second half of this year?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yes. Yeah. Thanks, for the question. This is Stuart here. We announced our plan in
October of last year and we announced that we were closing three facilities in Europe, two facilities in the U.K., our
assembly plant in Southampton and our Dagenham stamping and tooling operations. Those two facilities will close mid
of this year. And then the third facility is our Genk Assembly Plant in Belgium and that facility will close subject to
completion of a consultation process at the end of 2014. Combined, the closure of those facilities would reduce our
installed capacity by about 18% or 350,000 units. And that plan that we communicated in October remains our plan and
is on track.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Does that get your capacity utilization like up in the 80's then after that?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: We haven't provided a projection of capacity. We did share last year that if that capacity
had not been in place, we provided some guidance of what our utilization would have been in 2012 and I'd have to refer
back to those numbers. But of course future utilization will depend upon a number of other factors including demand at
any given point in time.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Sure. That makes sense. And then, I'll just turn over to Ford Credit and some of the balance
sheet items I was looking at. It looked like Ford commented that there was a $300 million dividend paid by Ford Credit
on one of their slides. And is that pretty much what Ford Credit's expecting to dividend up to Ford this year? Where are
we on that kind of cadence?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Hey, Doug. It's Mike. No. The distribution or the $300 million that Ford showed was
actually a tax payment related to settlement of 2008 and 2009 issues. We paid a very nominal dividend in the first
quarter. Our plan for this year is $200 million and that's really weighted towards the back-end of the year.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Okay. That makes sense because it didn't add up to me. And then finally on debt issuance, I
know it's hard to kind of comment much on this but I mean internally it looks like the 30-year was pretty successful,
again a pretty low cost of capital to fund – to that pension. The pension's still kind of largely under-funded. I mean is
there any more thoughts about putting more bonds on the balance sheet because you have some capacity to take some
pension funding down? And then on the Ford Credit side, I know you've got quite a bit of unsecured financing still to
do. I mean how does the market look to you right now? Is this something that if you could share a little bit of timing on
just when some of these financings could happen.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yeah. Doug, this is Neil, and thanks for both the questions. And what was said this morning
and is our strategy for both debt and pension is to both bring those down over time. We've externally said that our

long-term debt target by mid-decade is to get down to about $10 billion and to get our funded plans fully funded. And
so, I think both of those we are on plan for. And so the debt raise we did in January, took advantage of a very good
market as well as low rates to accelerate some of the pension contributions that we were making. But when we think
about sort of debt and leverage, we think about those two together. And so our plan and our strategy uses cash as we go
forward to continue to take actions to reduce debt and reduce the pension under-funded status.
And then on the credit capacity, we had a very good first quarter from the standpoint of our issuance of almost $3
billion of unsecured both here and in Europe. And so the balance of the year we say it's $7 billion to $10 billion, I think
you can pretty much divide them by eight quarters from a standpoint of timing. Obviously which market we issue and
what maturity we issue will be somewhat dependent upon the mark-to-market at that point in time. Although I can tell
you that so far the back half of last year plus the first quarter has been very accommodative to corporate issuers. And
obviously getting our investment grade back last year has helped a lot. Our spreads continue to improve. Market access
is there. So we don't see any issue from a standpoint of raising the remaining part of our funding plan.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Right. That's helpful. And last question for me and then I'll turn it over, your dividend yield
now is 3% which is higher than it's been in a long time. And I mean how does that kind of dovetail with you're taking
debt down and having the pension balance fall and potentially growing the dividend. I'm not putting words in your
mouth about growing the dividend but now that you have a dividend there, is it something that you guys would want to
expand also?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: I think what we've said and our overall capital strategy is to really balance a lot of different
variables, dividend debt repayments, pension contributions. We did announce as part of our – a small stock repurchase
program consistent with what we did a year ago for new shares as part of the comp. So it really is a balanced approach
as well as continue to fund the growth of the business and all the strategies around the product and market side.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Great. That makes sense. Well thanks for answering my questions though. I'll pass over the
baton.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Thanks, Doug.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Selle from JPMorgan. Please, proceed.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the Focus winning the Global Auto Sales
Leader. I'm very happy to contribute one of those sales and I'm a walking advertisement for you guys every day so
congrats on that. That's a huge victory that I think you guys could do more and more advertising behind it. Getting back
to Doug's question on Europe, I mean basically you guys are going to go from a $2 billion loss to breakeven over two
years. If you look at IHS, they're looking for about 4% growth per year and I guess that gives you about 100,000 more
units of sales, if they're right. If you compartmentalize the cost savings from shutting down the plants, the potential
volume growth, and then the new product introductions, I mean how can you help us kind of granularly get to that $2
billion lift? And I guess the cost side is a side that maybe we could get some help on? I mean how many workers are
going to be out? Is that the main part of the cost savings from shutting down these facilities or is it just the capacity
utilization coming in?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Eric, thank you for your question and also thank you for contributing to our sales level.
The – I'd refer you back again to our transformation strategy that we communicated for Europe back in October. And
we said then that our return to profitability in Europe by mid-decade is supported by a number of factors. You rightly
point out that we do anticipate some recovery in industry volume although not dramatic. I think we, like other industry
observers, think this will be a slow economic and industry recovery. Our return to profitability will also be supported
by the new product investments coming on stream.
In 2013, we have a negative impact because we chose to defer the introduction of our new Mondeo which is the Fusion
here in North America. We would have launched that in 2013. That will not now come on stream until late 2014. And

that's our largest passenger vehicle, that product and the associated S-MAX and Galaxy are key contributors. So we'll
have those back in the market in 2015 as well as having turned over our entire commercial vehicle portfolio which is
also a key source of profits in Europe. So our product offer will be renewed and expanded by the 2015 and mid-decade
point and that will support us both in terms of modest share gains, but also in terms of the margins that we'll get on that
fresher product line-up.
And then as you point out, also cost, where the restructuring actions we are taking, they have a negative impact on our
results this year as we accelerate the depreciation of the facilities that we're going to close. Clearly, some of that is
complete this year but some more will be in our result in 2014, but by mid-decade that cost will be behind us. And
that's an order of magnitude about $0.5 billion negative impact on our result this year that we won't have in the future.
And then finally, we're continuing to invest to grow in the parts of the European region that are growth markets,
Eastern Europe, but specifically in Russia our joint venture with Sollers that we launched in late 2011; and in Turkey,
where we have a very strong joint venture in Ford Otosan, and we are market leaders. So it's going to be a number of
factors that bring us back to profitability. We're really pleased with the progress we're seeing in the first quarter and that
we're on track for that plan.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: That's great color. I really appreciate that. And then, Mike, we've seen modest amount of
delinquencies rise in your portfolio, and you guys are obviously one of the cleanest portfolios out there, which is why
we love you guys. But I know that the Finco space is getting more competitive. You had a pretty heavy asset growth in
the first quarter, leases obviously understood, but some due to wholesale. I guess two-fold, on wholesale is that
inventory growth? Or are you guys in fact taking share? And then overall, are you guys having a hard time growing that
portfolio while keeping your underwriting standards tight? I've been down to Nashville. I know you guys aren't going
to stretch deep, deep, deep like some of your competitors, but in that regard are you guys going to give up some
business as the rest of the market grows?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Okay, Eric. I'll try and take those one at a time. First, on wholesale growth, it's really
consistent with Ford's days supply. As you know, when you look at Ford's level of days supply in the U.S. they're at 62
days. In Europe, it's 43 days. So our growth just reflects what's going on in the U.S. inventories. Our share, both in
Europe and the U.S., is always pretty stable. In the U.S. it's plus or minus a couple of points, but the wholesale growth
is because of the strength we're seeing on the auto side.
On the retail side of the business, as you know, our underwriting standards don't change. We are very consistent in that.
And we are seeing growth. We're seeing it, primarily our retail portfolio is pretty flat, so the new originations are
offsetting the liquidations. And in lease, we are seeing a growth in the lease industry. Competition is always out there,
but we work very closely with the motor company to go to market, and we feel very comfortable with the growth we've
gotten so far this year and our guidance of ending up at somewhere between $95 billion and $105 billion.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: I appreciate that. And then just finally some housekeeping stuff, looking at the cash flow
statement, I don't know if you've given specific guidance, I guess you'll tell me that after I ask the question, but CapEx
seemed a little bit light in the first quarter versus I guess the $7 billion estimate. I don't know if that's guidance? And
then the pension contributions seemed a little bit higher than the $5 billion we expected. Are those numbers we should
cuff to? Or I don't know if you've got into this, I mean I think the pension number you have. But are those still kind of
good goalposts for us?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Eric, maybe I'll take part of that and ask Neil to cover the pensions question. So in terms
of our operating related cash flow, we've guided that we expect it to be higher than 2012, and that guidance remains. In
terms of capital spending, we had $1.5 billion in the first quarter. Our guidance is for about $7 billion for the year. And
again that remains our guidance. If you look at it, if you take the $1.5 billion times by four that's $6 billion, but if you
look at first quarter last year we're up about $400 million year on year for the quarter, and we do see some seasonality
in our CapEx and some of the physicals of what's in our plan there. So we think that's still good at $7 billion. Neil?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yeah. And on the pension side we have provided guidance for the full year of pension
contributions to the funded plans of about $5 billion. First quarter was heavier, and that really reflected, Eric, the debt

raise we did in January for automotive. So a lot of the proceeds from that wasn't used to call more expensive debt; it
was used to accelerate the contributions to the pension fund.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: That's right. Thank you for reminding me of that. It seems like many moons ago, but it's been a
busy year. And then just one final one, I know other is traditionally an outflow in the first quarter. Can you remind me
why that is? And what's the big number on that?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yeah. Are you talking about the other timing differences?
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Yes, sir.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yeah. I think that just flows along with when vehicles actually ship from plants and actually
get paid for by Ford Credit on the sense of the dealers that are wholesale. And so in the first quarter, we shipped several
at the end that did not get funded by Credit. So there's a negative cash flow associated with that because it's in the
profits.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Great. I remember that was kind of an annual thing, but my memory evaded me. So I appreciate
that. I appreciate your time of day. Solid quarter, and look forward to doing it again next quarter.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Thanks, Eric.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] You have a question from the line of Brian Jacoby from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Hey, guys. Good morning. You guys pretty much addressed everything. I just have one
question. I'll keep it to one. S&P still has you guys at BB, and they seem to be focused on more so the industry in
Europe and when that will stabilize. And you guys have done a great job, and you're announcing plans in Europe and
executing on them, and obviously it's a tough market, but your inventory levels are coming down, and you seem pretty
good. But where do you guys think about the industry broadly in Europe?
I mean I'm not asking you to comment specifically on competitors themselves, but how do you guys feel about industry
inventory levels in Europe? And obviously there's some countries that really it's difficult to cut capacity, but I mean do
you think directionally we're moving in the right way industry-wise where things could begin to maybe stabilize later
this year? Or any type of color on that would be helpful because clearly S&P seems to be holding that out as one of the
key factors why they haven't brought you up to investment grade yet.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Brian, this is Stuart. In terms of the inventory levels, we have, as you know, we've taken
significant actions through 2012 to reduce our inventory levels. And they are at about the level that we want them to be.
In addition to the headline numbers, we've also taken down the levels of near-new inventories in our dealers, what are
referred to as self-registered vehicles and that's another part of our strategy to improve our brand and the quality of our
sales. In terms of what it looks like across the industry, we really don't have the quality of industry-wide data that you
see here in the U.S. market. So it's hard to comment with any sort of certainty about what's going on across the
industry. So I'd definitely hold back any comment from that other than we are focused on doing the right thing for our
business.
In terms of the industry sales rate, we guided in January that we expect it to be in the low end of the $13 million to $14
million range and we reflected that in our call again today. That's where we've seen the sales rate come in during the
first quarter. It's where we're seeing the sales rate trend in April; there's a few more days to go yet. And our projection
is pretty flat through the year; so we, at the moment, expect to see 2014 increase from that level. So we'd characterize
the situation in Europe as stabilizing. We are observing – if you look at run rates in terms of the peripheral markets,
including Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, where most of the fall-off came, we're seeing the rolling averages
there flatten out.

What we haven't yet seen is any sign of an increase off that stabilized low level, and we're watching for that as other
industry observers are. But in terms of our performance, we're very pleased with the work that our team in Europe is
doing in terms of focusing on our business, getting the inventories down, the quality of our sales and our net pricing
performance in what remains a very difficult industry.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. That's great color. Thank you.

All right. We have no more questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Tripp for
