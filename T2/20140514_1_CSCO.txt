Throughout this conference call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters we
will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, and as such, are subject to the risks and uncertainties that
we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q
and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.
All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. As we have in the past,
we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer segment results in terms of product
orders unless specifically stated otherwise.
I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.
John T. Chambers
Mel, thank you very much.
I am pleased with our solid performance in Q3 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 on revenues of $11.5
billion. We saw strength in our non-GAAP gross margins of 62.7% and non-GAAP product gross margins of 61.4%.
We also continued our disciplined management of the business with total non-GAAP OpEx down 6% year-over-year.
We generated $3.2 billion in operating cash flow and returned approximately $3 billion to our shareholders through the
dividend and share buyback. We are very focused on creating value for our shareholders, employees, customers and
partners. Our conviction around how we are evolving Cisco is strong and resolute. You've seen us deliver incredible
innovation, make bold moves in the market to capture future opportunities and disrupt our competitors and ourselves
when necessary. We remain committed to do the right thing to increase our long-term strategic value to our customers
and advance Cisco toward our goal of becoming the number one IT company.
In Q3, revenue, earnings per share and gross margins exceeded our guidance. Our product orders improved to be
relatively flat year-over-year. Our book-to-bill was comfortably above 1. I am pleased with the progress to return to
growth and I'd like to give you an update on Q4 revenue guidance, which will allow you to frame our remarks on the
business momentum.
For Q4, we expect revenue to decline in the range of -3% to -1%, which would represent quarter-over-quarter growth
of 4% to 6%. That is Q3 to Q4.
We saw strength across a number of the areas of our business and as we looked across the world. From a geographic
perspective, total U.S. product orders grew 7%, with U.S. Commercial and U.S. Enterprise both up over 10%. The
momentum in U.S. Enterprise and Commercial remains very strong. As an example, in the U.S. Enterprise, total deals
over $1 million are up over 25% from Q3 start to Q4 start, and deals over $5 million are up more than 50%. As we
continue to move to solutions, our enterprise customers are making more and bigger investments as they partner with
us.
We see continued stabilization across Europe. With order strength in the U.K. up 7%, Germany up 5% and Northern
Europe as a whole up 4%.
From a product perspective, our new service provider platforms are showing good momentum. As we shared with you
in prior calls, it takes time when you introduce disruptive high-end products before the growth returns. This quarter we
saw high-end router order growth reversing a three-quarter negative trend. While we are pleased with these results,
these numbers will continue to be lumpy.
The Nexus 9000 and our application-centric infrastructure, while still early, is gaining significant market traction. In
just our second quarter shipping new application-centric infrastructure, i.e. ACI-enabled platforms, specifically the
Nexus 9000, we grew from 20-plus customers last quarter to 175 customers this quarter with a pipeline approaching

1,000 customers. We saw major wins including competitive wins and displacements at large financial institutions, large
cloud providers, software as a service, and major service providers.
Data Center revenue grew 29%, UCS continues to cement its place as a leading platform for hybrid cloud
environments, big data and virtual desktop services, gaining market share for the 17th consecutive quarter since it was
introduced. Security revenue increased 10% and orders increased 20% as the Sourcefire integration continues to fuel
growth and opportunities with customers.
There are several businesses that are starting to show improving trends. Collaboration is the first. While Collaboration
revenues decreased 12% in the quarter, Collaboration orders increased 4%, reversing a multi-quarter negative trend.
Positive revenue growth of software as a service WebEx business was balanced by declines in Unified
Communications and TelePresence. In this quarter we began unveiling our next-generation of collaboration solutions,
specifically a new range of innovation cloud-connected TelePresence products at a very competitive price point.
Wireless. Revenues grew 3% with orders up 12%. We did see some weakness in the service provider customer
segment, and at the low end of the market, but we saw good strength in 802.11ac ramp, with the AP 3700 now the
fastest ramping access point in our history.
There are three areas of our business which we have discussed for the last several quarters where we are managing
through challenges, both macro and Cisco-specific. First, emerging markets. From a macroeconomic perspective,
continue to be challenging. Orders in our emerging markets declined 7% with the BRICs plus Mexico down 13%. As
we said for several quarters we expect these challenges to continue. The challenges we saw in Brazil, down 27%, and
Russia down 28%, are consistent with those we are hearing and seeing from our peers and customers. While China
declined 8%, Mexico declined 3%, and India declined 1%.
Our strategy with emerging markets has not changed. Our relationship begins with the engagement with the leadership
of the countries on key priorities for the country and technology development initiatives, and drives all the way to local
municipalities, their service providers and private businesses.
Second, service providers. Service provider orders were down 5%, showing improvement from the -12% decline in Q2
and 13% decline in Q1. The weakness in emerging markets also negatively impacted the service provider customer
segment. SP video revenue declined 26%, which had a negative impact on our SP segment numbers as we continue to
manage through the transition that business. SP video orders declined 11%.
We are seeing some signs of stabilization in the SP business but believe it will take multiple quarters to return to
growth. We will continue to make changes we need to, to lead in the service provider market.
And third, new product transitions in high-end routing and high-end switching. While we saw momentum, actually
good momentum in high-end routing orders as mentioned earlier, it is still early in the transition as revenue lags orders
by a quarter or so. We did not see the benefit on this revenue in this quarter. This lag combined with the challenges on
access layer and the mobility business led to a decrease in next-generation network routing revenue of 10%.
On the positive side the strength of the ASR 9000 continues with revenue growth of 59% and it is Cisco's
fastest-growing and most successful high-end router since the 7500 introduced over a decade ago. We did see
next-generation routing orders relatively flat and saw orders of the NCS 6000 and the CRS-X grow above our
expectations, though again, it is still early in the ramp and off relatively small numbers.
Overall switching revenue declined by 6%. We continue to manage through declines in our campus switching portfolio
specifically at the high end with the exception of the Catalyst 3850, which is growing very well. We are pleased with
our momentum in data center switching but it's still early in the high-end switching transition. As a result of these
transitions, it will be several more quarters before we see growth in overall switching. Switching gross margins remain
strong.
Stepping back, I'm pleased with the momentum we are continuing to drive across our business despite these challenges.
We will continue to take it one quarter at a time, as you would expect. While competitors at times may gain share on us
in a given quarter or two, we believe that our strategy of driving architectures to deliver business value will win in the

long-term. I've met with over 100 CIOs in the last month and they understand where we're going, our strategy and our
differentiation, and are asking us to partner even more closely with them on their business outcomes.
Looking forward, we are driving the innovation and making bold moves to lead the major market transitions our
customers are facing today. Two transitions that I would like to highlight this quarter are cloud and the Internet of
Everything. On cloud, in this quarter we announced our InterCloud strategy, leveraging our application-centric
infrastructure together with our partners to deliver the first global open network of clouds.
Customers, providers and channel partners are turning to Cisco to create an open and highly secure hybrid cloud
environment. Cisco is unique in our ability to enable a seamless world of many clouds in which our customers have the
choice to enable the right and highly secure cloud for the right workload.
We have already announced major global InterCloud partners such as Telstra and with more to come at Cisco Live next
week. Rob, I think you'll be announcing them at that time and it's getting pretty exciting. As you would expect, we have
added some of the best and brightest cloud talent to our team. We are also seeing our partnerships in delivering
converged infrastructure such as VCE and FlexPod leveraging application-centric infrastructure and the InterCloud
fabric to provide on ramps to the InterCloud.
As part of our InterCloud strategy, we'll deliver a portfolio of Cisco cloud applications and services. The Cisco cloud
applications, which are already in market, namely WebEx and Meraki continue to perform very well. WebEx revenue
grew 7% with annual recurring revenues up 12%. The total number of billable users was up over 26%. Meraki, our
cloud networking business, grew over 150% with the customer count growing approximately 30% sequentially.
We also see continued – I'm sorry. We also continue to cement our position as the number one cloud infrastructure and
the number one cloud provider according to Synergy delivering the innovation and platforms to fuel the world's largest
cloud that was again the number one cloud infrastructure and number one hybrid cloud provider.
On the Internet of Everything, last quarter I discussed the momentum we are seeing with our customers to translate the
Internet of Everything opportunity to actual business requirements. We are making measurable progress connecting the
$19 trillion value we have identified in the Internet of Everything to specific business opportunities and pipelines.
Again at Cisco Live next week, our user conference, probably 20,000 people in person and we hope 200,000 plus
virtually, customers like Royal Dutch Shell and The Weather Channel will join us on stage to share how they are
partnering with Cisco to leverage the Internet of Everything to drive innovation and business results in their own
organizations.
Our close engagement with our customers to capitalize on the major market transitions like cloud and Internet of
Everything will be a future driver of our services growth. Service revenues grew 3% this quarter with continued strong
margins.
Gary, nice job by you and Edzard and the team.
Gary B. Moore
Thanks, John.
John T. Chambers
We continue to be optimistic about the future opportunities. As our customers embrace cloud, mobility, social,
analytics and the Internet of Everything, they are seeing Cisco as uniquely positioned to help them build and run the
highly securable environments they require. We are helping them design secure and optimized cloud solutions,
enabling industry-leading security for their mobile workforce and access data from anywhere to speed decision-making
among other solutions.

During the past quarter we announced our new Managed Threat Defense service to help customers detect and prevent
attacks across their extended networks, fueling our Security Services business opportunities. We will continue to
differentiate our approach to services, leveraging both technology and people to deliver business value.
We continue to drive our evolution to software and services, and this quarter we closed a first-of-its-kind multi-year
deal to license Cisco's software portfolio to General Motors. This innovative license agreement involving our software
and hardware where needed will give GM better speed and flexibility to drive business value. So for example, when
GM needs to increase their collaboration solutions across the company, they have access to our full suite of products to
do that. Going forward, Cisco and GM will continue to partner to deliver GM's business goals up to and including the
Internet of Everything.
We are evolving very quickly as a company to meet the changing requirements of our customers globally and I am
extremely pleased with the level of innovation and the value we are driving across the company in both technology and
business models. We are leaning forward and will continue to make the moves and investments we need to ensure our
leadership for the next decade.
I'd now like to turn the call over to you, Frank, and to go into a little bit more detail on the financials for the quarter and
expand on our guidance.
Frank A. Calderoni
Thank you, John.
John T. Chambers
You're very welcome.
Frank A. Calderoni
In Q3 FY 2014 we executed well as we managed through the transitions in our business and markets, resulting in our
financial performance above our expectations.
From a top and bottom line perspective, total revenue was $11.5 billion, down 5%; non-GAAP net income was $2.6
billion; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.51. Our GAAP net income was $2.2 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a
fully diluted basis were $0.42. Product revenue declined 8% and services revenue increased 3% with product
book-to-bill comfortably above one. Overall, non-GAAP operating margin was 28.1%.
In Q3, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 62.7%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 61.4%, and product gross
margin benefited from improved productivity, as we had greater leverage with our cost structure, partly driven by
higher revenue volumes. These benefits were offset by pricing. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 66.8%, consistent
with historical levels.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4 billion or 34.6% as a percentage of revenue, compared to 34.8% in Q3 of
FY 2013. Operating expenses were higher quarter-over-quarter, driven by investments in cloud and acquisitions as well
as higher variable compensation. Given the expected decline in our full fiscal year revenue, we do expect our variable
compensation expense and thus, total non-GAAP operating expense to be lower than originally forecasted.
Our head count decreased by approximately 230 from last quarter to 73,834. In Q3, other income and expense was
$100 million, reflecting realized gains on sales of publicly traded equity and fixed income securities. Total cash, cash
equivalents and investments were $50.5 billion, including $4.6 billion available in the United States at the end of the
quarter. We generated operating cash flows of $3.2 billion during the quarter.

During the quarter we issued $8 billion of debt for general corporate purposes, including repayment of debt, and
returned capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase as well as our dividends. The debt repayment portion
covered $3.3 billion of previously outstanding notes.
As you recall, our capital allocation strategy is to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually through
dividends and share repurchases. So far, in fiscal year 2014, we have returned approximately 140% of free cash flow to
our shareholders comprised of $8 billion of share repurchases and $2.8 billion of dividends.
In Q3, we returned $3 billion to shareholders that included $2 billion through share repurchases and approximately
$974 million through our quarterly dividend. Our diluted share count decreased by approximately 150 million shares
driven by this repurchases. We remain committed to this strategy. Our balance sheet continued to be an area of strength
in Q3 with DSO at 35 days, non-GAAP inventory returns of 11.2 and total deferred revenue growth of 4%.
Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments
include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and
understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements and that
actual results could be above or below our guidance.
The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP. As John mentioned, we expect
total revenue to decline in the range of minus 3% to minus 1% on a year-over-year basis. For the fourth quarter, we
anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, forecasting
non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors such as the volume, product mix, cost
savings as well as pricing.
So as a result, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance
range. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5% and our GAAP tax
provision rate is expected to be approximately 21% in the fourth quarter.
Our Q4 FY 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53. With our Q3 performance
and our current guidance for Q4, our non-GAAP EPS would be at the higher end of the full-year FY 2014 guidance of
$1.95 to $2.05 that we provided earlier this year.
We anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by about $0.11 to $0.14 per share in Q4 FY
2014 and $0.56 to $0.59 for the full year. This range includes pre-tax impact of approximately $60 million in Q4 FY
2014 and up to $500 million for the full year as a result of our anticipated restructuring charges related to our
workforce reduction plan that we announced in the second quarter.
Substantially all of these charges are expected to be recognized during fiscal 2014. During Q3, we recognized pre-tax
charges to our GAAP financial statement of $26 million related to that announcement and $336 million through Q3.
Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for further details.
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other significant differences between our GAAP and
our non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings and tax
or other events, which may or may not be significant. And as a reminder, Cisco will not comment on financial guidance
during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
I'll now hand it back to John for his summary comments. John?
John T. Chambers
Frank, thank you very much, and well done.
Reflecting on the quarter, the dynamics in our business and market continued to play out as we said they would and we
did what we said we would do. Our management team is executing well and driving innovation, transformation and
discipline across the entire company. We're delivering solutions not just technology in a way we haven't in the past and

are transforming our business models toward recurring product, software and cloud revenues.
As we continue to drive the business, we remain focused on shareholder value creation by maintaining the flexibility to
make the right long-term strategic decisions for the business driving efficiencies in our cost structure and returning
capital through dividends and share repurchase to our shareholders.
In addition to the solid financial results, there are four key takeaways for how we are driving Cisco forward that were
evident in this quarter.
First, we made good progress on our plans to return to growth, despite some macro and industry-specific challenges. At
the same time, we are innovating and investing while becoming more efficient and taking costs out. As a result we're
delivering and often over-delivering on the expectations by transforming our business. I'm proud of what we've done
and excited about what's to come.
Second, we are delivering more innovation at a faster pace than any time in our history. I look at the new high-end
switching and routing platforms, the recently announced InterCloud strategy, new collaboration portfolio, new
pervasive security offerings, new data analytics, self-learning networks, services in all delivery capabilities, IoE
[Internet of Everything] and much more.
And we're not just innovating in technology. The changes we are making in how we deliver value to our customers,
leveraging integrated architecture, software and services to deliver their business outcomes are driving larger
opportunities and deal sizes, as well as more recurring revenue.
Third, we are disrupting the competition and when necessary, disrupting ourselves to drive our leadership position. For
example, we began work on application-centric infrastructure over three years ago. When we launched into the market
in November, we laid out a road map for our customers on how we could deliver on the benefits and promises of SDN.
The traction we are seeing with our application-centric infrastructure solutions gives me great confidence that we are
leading the transition to SDN. We have similar disruption examples today in high-end routing, collaboration, our
overall go-to-market and organization structures.
Finally, I believe we are positioned extremely well on the major market transitions. When I look at our leadership in the
Internet of Everything, our differentiated hybrid cloud strategy, InterCloud, our ability to combine SP and enterprise
mobile solutions like no one else can. Cisco's unique insight into the network traffic to provide security and analytics
solutions is second to none. And our ability to converge the network, compute and storage from the cloud to the data
center, to the wide area network, all the way to the edge, the network is clearly at the center of each of these transitions.
We are creating tremendous value for our customers when we connect the unconnected, and opportunities are clearly
exciting.
Now, Mel, let's move to the most fun part, which is Q&A.
Melissa Selcher
Thanks, John. We'll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell side analysts please ask only one question.
Operator, please open the floor to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thank you very much. Hello. So this is one question with perhaps a couple of
subparts. But I just wanted to understand, John, your guidance a little bit. So you are guiding for better than normal
seasonality in the July quarter, and that's despite the continued weakness both in emerging markets and in service

providers. So can you just expand on what is driving that, and to the extent that some of that is driven by the Nexus 9k
ramp, where you highlighted 175 customers, can you just dig into a little bit on how many of them are also licensing
ACI, and also, does that include any of the top 10 cloud providers? Thank you.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Got you. A few questions, Simona, but you've been very patient with us over the years. So
we'll do that. In the future we'll hold the questions for everybody to one.
In terms of seasonality, you're right. The guidance seasonality-wise for Q3 to Q4 is 4% to 6% growth. If you look at it,
Frank, if I've read these numbers right, over the last three years is about 1.9% or 2%. Over the last five years it's
averaged just 3.2%. So it is above that. We're going in with stronger backlog, and by definition we had a very good
third month of the quarter.
In terms of the weakness in emerging markets and service provider, you're correct in that we anticipate those to
continue for several more quarters, and that could be heavy lifting as we work our way out. But let me leave no doubt
in anyone's mind, we are committed to emerging markets. We're going to position ourselves as we've done before when
countries have seen economic downturns and position us for the future. In regards to service provider, we're going to do
whatever it takes, Rob, to get back on top there and get that to return to regular growth.
In terms of the areas that are growing well, you saw it in almost every product category, and while the revenue numbers
by definition when product revenues are down 8%, if I remember, Mel, right and product orders were relatively flat
between plus or minus 1%, it means in almost every product category bookings grew faster, orders grew faster than the
revenues. And we showed that.
So you see areas like collaboration, which we've been getting a little bit longer in terms of our products before we
introduce new products and Rowan's done an amazing job there. They turned from what's been a three or four-quarter,
three-quarter I think it is, negative quarter-over-quarter to a 4% growth, and, Rowan, I'm betting on you big time to get
that growth up to at least high single digits by the end of this next fiscal year.
You will see new product announcements throughout this year in the collaboration area making it easier to use and
product announcements even at Cisco Live next week where you almost want to think about it like a iMac combination
with TelePresence on ease-of-use and tremendous price performance so you can bring this to the desktop and it can be
literally a phone replacement that also has a capability on a touchscreen to bring it alive.
Now where you're leading me on other products, such as the high-end switching, the Nexus 9K, I have not missed on a
customer call, and I probably called, like I said, 100 CIOs in the last quarter on the 9000 and application-centric
infrastructure behind it. And I'm not that good of a salesperson, Rob, none of us are. What it means is the product is
really, really solid. And so you're seeing us take leadership across the enterprise accounts. When you think about it
going from 20-plus customers to 175, going to 1,000 people in the pipeline and you see us with the application-centric
infrastructure with the simulation going on, Rob, if I remember that number right, I think it's over 50 customers that are
doing that...
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: That's correct.
<A - John T. Chambers>: And again, the receptivity's been extremely strong. Many of you come from financial
institutions, so you might have seen a small startup and VMware combined because they've been out there for five-plus
years. We're taking most all of those back, momentum feels very, very good on it and I think you'll just see us knock
them off one after the other.
In the commercial marketplace, Alison Gleeson would say the 9K is on fire, but to your indirect part of your question,
Simona, it will take another at least one and probably two quarters before you get high-end switching growing well.
They put a 9000 in. You do the ACI modeling, et cetera. So it's going to take us a few quarters to extend it out, but your
overall premise is right: when we present our architecture strategy and our vision, the CIOs get it, they buy into it and
we're in extremely good shape in enterprise, as you would guess from the 6% growth that we showed this quarter and
improving.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Simona. Next question?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thanks, and congrats again on great execution. I'll also take a stab at a two-part question. First of
all, referring to the last page of your press release...
<A - John T. Chambers>: I'll allow it because you gave us a compliment. Okay. Two questions, and then we've got to
keep it to one.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Well, I'll give you another one if I can get three questions. But speaking on deferred revenue,
Frank, and looking at the breakdown of your deferred revenue, you have a very nice increase on a year-over-year basis
on the product side, but when we look at the split of that between current and non-current, it seems like most of it is
concentrated in the non-current area. So can you talk about how the change in deferred revenue relates to the change in
your business model as far as moving more into cloud, more into as-a-service type of consumption models for your
customers?
And then for you, John, on the competitive front, from a high level standpoint, some of the switching vendors have
talked about going aggressively after your CAT 65 [Catalyst 6500] installed base, which is quite substantial still out
there. How do you feel about your ability to defend that? And also with the, some of the clearly good progress you've
been making with UCS, how do you feel against IBM and HP these days as far as going after the server footprint, both
the standalone and on a converged basis as well?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Gotcha. Okay. Frank, you get the easy part, deferred revenue and what's occurring there,
and I'll probably expand on that and lead into the other questions.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: So, Ittai, as you know, so if we look at the overall deferred revenue, close to $12.7 billion
in the quarter, up 4%, the key driver of the growth was the product side [audio gap] (33:14) billion close to $4 billion,
up 11%. And within that on the question that you mentioned, the driver has been growth that we've seen on
subscription type business, and that was up within that segment about 36%, and within that segment, it's the WebEx, it's
security, it's Meraki and it's our collaboration and our enterprise license agreements.
So those are the areas that when we talked about even back in December at the financial analyst conference when I was
talking about some of the cloud offerings and subscription offerings, that's the piece that is showing growth, and that's
clearly what's driving the improvement in the deferred revenue on the product side. Good performance there, I'd just
also put in perspective as far as contribution, still small contribution, but we do expect that to continue as we see the
investments over the next several quarters in this space.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, what's interesting is, Ittai, you nailed it, we are seeing a number of our customers of
all types begin to look at not just recurring revenue but kind of a pay-as-you-go or pay-as-you-drink type of approach.
We've closed a number of key deals and these are $100 million type of deals this quarter alone that we'll see the results
on over the next three to five years but it shows very little impact in terms of this quarter and next quarter and that's
something we just have to manage through and we'll try to keep you in tune what that means. It obviously means as you
understood from the deferred revenue product growth that it's 1% of our growth now goes into this category faster than
before per quarter.
And you know, it would not surprise me to see it at 2% to 3% by the end of next year and our key is to do that, keep
our balance on profits and revenue growth and earnings per share at the same time we build something that will
introduce more continuity in our revenue stream which I think all of you want to see.
So it's a little bit of a balancing act. It's one that we're up to but kind of fun for Chuck Robbins, our Head of Sales, as he
does this.

In terms of the switching, I think your comments are right. The campus switching is where we're seeing some good
competition. But our real issue is we have products like the Cat 6K that are still going great guns and very competitive
but they are decreasing as you expect year-over-year by a fair amount. The 3850 in that category is very price
competitive but we're competing with much lower cost products so we're trying to get the total number up in price
performance might be two or three or four to one, so a little bit of a challenge there.
To answer the question about – that Simona hit on the 9K, our win rate on the data center switching is really, really
good. Our share there is probably close to 70%. We are clearly built backlog this last quarter because a lot of orders
came in late in this category area and I feel very, very comfortable with our ability to win, not with the 9K alone, but
how we're going to not only embrace SDN and benefit from it but we're going to lead in SDN. And, Rob, maybe you
can – I don't know if we'll get some questions later, I'll give you the ball on that but we're going to embrace it very
tightly and bring the benefits of our virtual and physical architecture into one and then take with application centric
infrastructure straight down from the cloud, data center all the way to the WAN to the edge, so it's a great story to tell.
In terms of UCS, candidly, our competition, IBM and HP and Dell, I feel very comfortable with us continuing to beat
them pretty well. You know in our growth of 29% I think the three of them added together might've been negative
growth in terms of blade servers. So our real competition here is white label. We saw this coming three to four years
ago. We're going to sell architectures in the white label approach as opposed to standalone products. I personally
believe standalone products from any company, whether it's standalone switch or a standalone server, will get squeezed
pretty hard.
And so our competition there is architecture and how you bring compute and network and storage together, how you
bring that together that application-centric infrastructure and bring it down the environment. That you get a premium
for and we know how to sell it pretty well. And when I talk with our customers, most of them will say that we're the
only company that's really differentiating our server architecture in a way they will pay a premium for. Most of the
others, they view it more as a commodity in a bid type of approach. Frank, you had something to say?
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: Yeah, I just want to go back to what I – just clarify, Ittai, the first part of the question on
deferred revenue. So I just – I gave the balances for Q3 2013 that are growing at 11%. Just to clarify, last year we had
close to $4 billion Q3 2013 going to $4.4 billion in product deferred revenue, that's up 11%, and the overall total last
year $12.7 billion going to $13.2 billion, up 4% total. I just want to clarify that.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Ittai. Operator, next question.

Thank you. The next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein.
<Q - Pierre C. Ferragu>: Hi. Thank you for taken my question.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Pierre.
<Q - Pierre C. Ferragu>: Could you give us some color on how your gross margin evolved sequentially? You had a
very good improvement in gross margin. I was wondering how much behind that was just operating leverage, having
better volumes and if there was anything that has settled between this quarter and last in terms of product mix and of
course pricing as well?
And lastly, if you had some specific like first actions over the last three months that helped gross margin improve?
And maybe I have just one last question to ask you on the switching weakness. I was just wondering if you could give
us some color geographically. [indiscernible] (38:45) between your weakness in emerging markets in switching or is
switching a market that is seeing like a weakness much more broad-based across the globe. Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. So first on the gross margin question, Frank, keep me kind of balanced on this, if I
look at gross margins this quarter we moved a fair amount of products, Gary, that you had been and the team and

engineering, that John Kern had been working on gross margin improvements but last quarter we did not have as many
of those products to work our benefit on.
Also the mix was to our benefit. You know, you saw set-top boxes continue to decline even though orders slowed,
declined a lot less than we've seen in prior quarters on it. And the UCS was good at 29% but it was at 29%. So we had a
very good mix advantage for us on that. We are seeing pricing issues but contrary to what people are worried about, I'm
not seeing pricing issues because of SDN.
We – actually our win rate there is really good in our story, Rob, and really bringing it to home application-wise and
protection-wise is very, very good and you see that in the data center. We are seeing some pressure on the campus
switching area where there are different price points as you move into the market. A little bit of it was due to volume
but I think also what you saw on this time is almost 1% above our 61% to 62% guidance and you're going to see the
swings a point above, a point below that guidance periodically and I'd urge you not to overreact or under react, either
one of them. We clearly aren't – did not give you guidance at 62.7% for this next quarter nor is it likely it will be, 61%
to 62% and there'll be quarters when it goes below that 61%.
If we see a trend coming we will tell you. Right now we're comfortable in that 61% to 62% gross margins where
actually what I worry about most is the mix and a little bit aggressive pricing out of emerging countries in an ugly
market where if you've got to win some strategic deals, you're going to discount pretty aggressively. That's not a
function of architecture SDN. It's purely a tough market in a UCS type environment or a campus switching type
environment. Frank, how close was I to what you would say?
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: Very close. So the 61.3% from last quarter...
<A - John T. Chambers>: That's a good answer, by the way. [Laughter]. Sorry.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: I just want to add one point though.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: Just to recap. The mix was pretty much as you said was to a slight benefit
quarter-on-quarter, if that helps. Pricing was fairly consistent. We haven't seen much change from a pricing standpoint.
We did get a benefit in the volume because last quarter we did talk about the drop in the volume that we had from Q1
to Q2.
So volume improved so we got that and as a result of that, we were able to get a substantial amount of a cost benefit,
some of which came from last quarter that was delayed and others that we kind of worked on this quarter. The cost was
a big plus for us in the quarter, which enabled us to get to 62.7%.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Got you.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Pierre. Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Northland.
<Q - Jeff T. Kvaal>: Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. I would like to follow-up on the gross margin
question if I could and that is to say you have a couple new products that theoretically should be very accretive to the
gross margin structure that are in the pipeline, i.e. the new high-end switches and routers. Why wouldn't we see the
gross margins be stable if not even a little bit above where we are today as those products blend into the overall mix?
What are some of the offsetting forces there?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Got you. So in regards to the new platforms, let's go first to switching, the new products
we're introducing is very much in line with our high-end switching margins. They're very good. We're able to protect it
very well. We win in terms of the architectures, comfortable with it. They just don't have a major volume yet and while

175 customers is exciting up from 20 plus, it isn't 1,000 and we need to move to those bigger numbers. And then to
have the big volume rollout as ACI simulation moves to ACI implementation not just across our Nexus 9000 but down
through our other Catalyst products as well in terms of direction.
And the routing products, again, were designed from the beginning with good gross margins as opposed to if I had to
do over something we've done throughout our history for almost 20 years, we developed the products and brought them
in at 50% gross margin and over a period of two or three years brought them up to their normal margins of 70% or
whatever you're aiming for. We won't make that mistake again. We're bringing them in at high gross margins but again
the volume isn't as much to that. Rob, would you add anything to that?
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: No, John. I think you covered it.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: Well, I would say our gross margins have been consistent.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yes.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: I mean last quarter, given the volume which we talked about, historically, we've done
everything we said we're going to do around gross margin 61% to 62% plus or minus one or two every quarter.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, but don't want to give anybody the impression we are not all over this. We clearly
are and we don't want to give the impression that we know a mix issue could put pressure on us here so we're working
on it hard and that's one of the things we got to execute on and continue to execute well on.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Hi. Hey, John. Question around the ac or the Wi-Fi piece. Wireless was up 3% year-on-year,
orders up 12%, if my memory's correct. Can you talk a little bit about what you see coming in the next quarter. Is this
really an ac transition that you've gone through for the last couple quarters, and you expect to come out of that? And
when do you see wave two ac impacting the upgrade cycle of your campus switching business, the 3850, specifically?
Thanks. And if I can do a follow-on I'd appreciate that.
<A - John T. Chambers>: All right. Since I lost control earlier, Mel, we'll get it back to one next time. Brian, in terms
of the Wireless, and I'm including all Wireless on it. We lost a little bit of momentum due to a combination of factors. I
think you're seeing us pick that back up. It's the very low end that we were exposed in for a while. Now with the new
products coming out from Rob Soderbery's group, I think we're much more competitive there. You're right that we are
going to combine the fixed and the wireless products together on it. I'm not sure I would have been sure, in fact, turn up
on that, because they often take longer than we think and then when they occur, occur faster, especially at the low end
on it. And your second question?
<Q - Brian Modoff>: The second question is, really on the – your license agreement with your software portfolio for
GM. I wanted to try to understand that a little bit more. You mentioned collaboration, what are you specifically
licensing? How is this going to – just a little more color on what the agreement is, and what products it might involve,
and how could you see expanding this as your product line becomes more software versus hardware over time? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. So let me talk about the concept with GM and just put that to the side, because that's
specific to a customer, the first one. Think about what we are really beginning to share with our customers is a
architecture in each product category we're in that combines the infrastructure, with the platform, with the application,
with services. And you go across all of these architectures from the Internet of Everything, to cloud, to data center, to

collaboration, to security, to mobility. And when you combine those together, and we bring a largely Cisco-powered
environment to this, your operating costs drop dramatically because the customer doesn't have to do systems
integration, and you get outcomes quicker.
Now what's exciting about this deal, this is all about software. And you license that software all the way across
everything from our iOS to the collaboration, to the security, and as you therefore begin to compete against products
like white label you're able to say, all right, you've already got a license in software, you can be very competitive on the
architecture.
This is something that clearly Rob and I, and then Chuck Robbins, who heads-up sales, want to drive through our
whole company and this is what we'd like to see many of the customers do. If we do this well, that really gets exciting
and this is a huge move on the transition to software being more and more part of our portfolio, and tying our software
pieces together just like we were beginning to tie our hardware and ASICs.
[ph] Gary (47:11), you're very familiar with the GM deal. I know we have to respect their rights on this one, but any
other thoughts to add to this?
<A>: Well, just a couple quickly. One, it is everything that you've said, and I do believe we've already seen high
interest from our other large enterprise customers, the CIOs you met with, et cetera. But the opportunity here is to put
in their catalog all of the software that Cisco has. We've added to it and we've added everything we do to this. So now
they have a software catalog that they've prepaid. And now all they have to do is make minor decisions relative to what
products, and our products give them that end-to-end architecture.
An example would be moving stuff that might be individual products in a dealership that would be controlled with a
floppy disk being mailed out, to now a very easy, and for them, cost effective solution to IP enable it, and control that
from a single spot and download it to any dealer they have, as an example. Same thing we do with StadiumVision and
some of our other solutions.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Brian. Next question, operator?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Tal.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hello. It's my birthday so I'm also going to ask two questions.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay.
<Q - Tal Liani>: I had a question on two things. Number one is, service revenues are down. If you sum up the last four
quarters, service revenue growth is down to 2.5%. Down from 7% the same four quarters a year ago, so a similar
period, down from 10%, 11% before. I understand that there is a link between product growth and service growth, but
on the other hand, you do offer and you mentioned it, you do offer more service-based solutions. And with other
companies we've seen longer lag between the decline in products to the decline in services. So is there any fundamental
change in services? Is there any discount on services side or difficulties to charge for services? Can you tell us anything
about it beyond just the product growth?
<A - John T. Chambers>: I'll take a crack. Or, Gary, do you want to go first? I'll go second.
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Okay. So, Tal, I think, first off, your numbers are correct as it compares to last year. If you look
at where we've been each of the quarters this year, pretty consistent as we look across that. I think the core product
bookings over the last eight quarters have driven us down.
What we've done, though, and we started this some time ago, to build these other services that have a slower
contribution in 2014, will have a bigger one in 2015 and a bigger one in 2016. And so we're building those out, and

those are services that we are selling today in large part, whether it's cloud enablement and adoption services as we
look at InterCloud and helping customers build out hybrid clouds, the service catalog development and how these
customers are managing that services catalog, helping them move their workloads to the cloud and from one cloud to
another, as well as the security managed threat detection that we announced last quarter.
So those are all things that have a revenue ramp that are adding to the services revenue that won't be as dependent on
core product bookings. That said, the ability for us to continue to manage 3% growth in the quarter relative to the
margins that we continue to drive, look anywhere else, I think you'll see that it is a very well-run services organization
that contributes greatly to our customers and that they value.
<A - John T. Chambers>: No, I completely agree with what Gary said, Tal, especially on the profitability and the
customer sat [satisfaction] it brings us. I think the Technical Services, what Joe Pinto has done there, has been amazing.
They had to – did we split Technical from Advanced Services out? Okay. So it grew well and its profitability is very
good and I think given the product run rates that we're on, I'd give us an A in that.
I think the point you're raising, Tal, is how quickly do we move in Advanced Services from not just bringing our
products together to be able to work well or network audits or things of that type to outcome-based. And the outcomes
that Gary walked through, we're going to move through over this next year very aggressively, and only about 20% of
our Advanced Services if I remember right, Gary, are outcome-based today, and they're at more mid-level outcome
basis opposed to the transformation that we talked about at GM or transformation, hopefully, if we do our job right,
would be in a number of companies and countries.
So that's where the growth has to return from, assuming the product numbers do not pick up at a much more healthy
rate, and I think what you're seeing is kind of, I hate to always call a leveling out, but I think you'll see us level out
about this level, maybe one more quarter of this and then slowly start coming back up. But, Tal, your constructive
feedback and criticism is fair. We like where we are. We love the profits. We love the customer satisfaction, but we've
got to make the transition here to services delivering on those architectures and business outcomes before you're going
to see the number grow well that you alluded to.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Tal. Next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.
<Q - Amitabh Passi>: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. John, I only have one question for you. I wanted to maybe
understand your sort of strategic rationale in some of the alternative areas where you're making investments. If I look at
the radio active market, you made an investment in a company I think called Altiostar. Your broadband access
investments with the ME 4600, you're going after the converged packet optical market with the NCS 4K. When I look
at each of these markets, they are large markets, but they have very well-established incumbents, all of them with
relatively low gross margin. So I guess just given all the focus on gross margin, just wanted to understand how you're
thinking about attacking these markets? How do you continue to sort of extract a premium, just given the fact that
they're highly competitive with relatively low gross margin?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. So the reason we're not in radios is because the margins are terrible and actually
almost nonexistent unless you bundle it into a total solution. We make investments in new companies and new
architectures, and we make investments to see if their strategy plays out, and plays out well. And if it doesn't, it's a
good investment and hopefully you get a reasonable return on it. If it does, then we partner very tightly or acquire off of
that. So we've got $2 billion under investment directly and probably a fair amount more indirectly through a number of
our joint funds we invest in the technology.
Let's use Altiostar as an example. A real good team at the top. Ash Dahod [Ashraf Dahod], he is world-class. He did
the Starent job, as you all know serial entrepreneur and he usually does extremely well. We told him if he ever wanted
to come back to Cisco and work, and do something exciting together, we are very interested. And he did come back to

us and say, all right, Pankaj and John, I would like to do this. Would you want to invest, and would you like to be a part
of it? And when we looked at his new architecture and his price points he's designing to, they got really exciting.
Now we have to see if it's going to work, but I like the team that's in place and that's what you look at when you invest.
I like the fact he's got a marketing transition, not building an old-world radio architecture of the past, but one for the
future, probably starting in emerging markets, then coming into developed. We'll see if it works out. If it does, we'll
claim victory, and we would tell you we're very smart, and if it doesn't, you might not hear us talk about it again, on
that. But if I were going to bet on a startup team, we've got a couple of them inside of Cisco we do well with, and Ash
has been extremely good.
So that's the classic way to invest. Rather than take a big risk and an unreasonable amount of up-front capital to see if
you own the whole thing, and then see if it works, you do investments, keep them as an entrepreneurship running fast.
You open doors for them at accounts and go for it. Does that make sense to you, Amitabh, of what we're doing?
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Okay, great. I think we might have lost Amitabh. Operator, next question?
<A - John T. Chambers>: I answered shorter, Mel. I got you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Hey. Thanks a lot. Hey, John. I wanted to ask about the pick-up you saw in the U.S. and
Europe. Is this it? Are things turning? And in particular, how sustainable would it be?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Good question. I think the U.S. is sustainable, especially in commercial and enterprise with
all the appropriate caveats my few years of law school taught me on that. But I watch the pipeline, I watch the
approach. Our U.S. enterprise and commercial are usually a very good indicator of GDP slowly increasing, or GDP
decreasing, and we saw a turn-up in U.S. in enterprise and commercial back in summer of 2012, and if you'd bought the
Dow then I think we all understood what would have happened. So that feels good, and if you combine that with the
CEOs I've talked to, most of us feel 2.5%, 3% for the next nine months is very doable number. Not anything to do
backflips on, but reasonable progress.
Europe is still a little bit fragile. But we did see stability across the North, with some growth rates were changed, and
Europe in total was finally positive, not counting the emerging markets for us. And even stability in the South looks
like it's occurring. Now I know they've still got structural issues there, and I know some of the countries are in
transformation have some tough decisions to make. But I think they're out of this downturn, slowly improving.
And when I talked with our customers and the top financial people in New York, which I did just a week ago, most
everybody else is beginning to see very similar trends. In fact, it almost was scary, because when you describe the
world just like I did earlier, including emerging markets, and the challenges in Russia and Brazil, we could finish each
other's sentences regardless of industry.
So I think Europe is coming back. Again, it's going to be slow and heavy lifting there because they haven't addressed
some of their structural issues, but more consistency. Even the South is starting to show stability on it in terms of
direction. So good about the U.S., good about Europe. Don't feel very good about emerging markets. They're still very
challenged, especially the BRICs.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks. Operator, next question?

<Q - Mark Sue>: Hi, John. The business is stabilizing and looking into your bookings linearity more predictable. It
feels like in a couple quarters the revenues may actually stop declining and actually turn positive. Does it feel that you
can hold this $46 billion to $48 billion annual revenue base, because it's more predictable?
And also, how should we think about the annual OpEx? Is $15 billion to $16 billion the right number, or should we
expect some cost cutting?
And then, just on cash. eBay repatriated some cash, recognizing your views on taxes, what else can Cisco do since half
the market cap of Cisco is in overseas cash?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. So our clear goal is to return to growth. It won't be straight up and to the right and it
may be a little bumpy because we're still way too dependent on our orders coming in and shipping them the next
quarter and during the quarter on it. But you are right, looking out over several quarters we'd expect that. How long it
will take us to turn back up to mid-single digit growth if that's where we're going, it probably won't be immediate once
you get a slight growth quarter and then the next quarter is there but I think you will see us do it over gradual time. We
are going to continue to watch operating expenses, you know, Gary's our champion here along with Frank, tightly but
we have to put money into InterCloud and we have to put money into sales rep coverage as we make these changes.
And as we get really good on security and collaboration they require specialists for a period of time to run with so we
are going to put investments into the area there as we go forward a little bit in the next year. But I think your premise
on slowly up and to the right is right. It will probably be a little bit bumpy. It won't be just one quarter. You finally turn
the corner and then the next quarter you're there but we're going to take it a quarter at a time in terms of guidance.
So we want you all not to get ahead of us on this. We're very pleased with this quarter. Next quarter's set up pretty well
but we've got some real heavy lifting to do and I'm sure a couple bumps along the way, especially in emerging markets
and service provider on the lifting.
Frank, talk a little bit about where we are in the cash and how we've chosen a different path than some of our
counterparts did and why we chose the path we did.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: So we can't comment specifically in regards to what eBay did but I think, Mark, that the
key thing for us and this goes to the outreach we've had with all investors over the last couple of years is to build a
capital allocation strategy that our investors are looking forward to. The combination of investing both in the buyback
as well as the dividend, which we've done in the last couple of years, and our strategy to at a minimum have 50% of our
free cash flow be used for that purpose.
As I had mentioned earlier, this year we've been fairly aggressive with 140% of that free cash flow through the
dividend and the buyback. We expect to continue that strategy going forward. We feel that based on the amount of cash
that we have in the U.S., the amount of cash that we generate in the United States on an ongoing basis as well as our
ability, as we did this past quarter, to leverage the debt market that we have the ability to fund both near-term and
long-term, the continued support of being aggressive on that capital allocation strategy.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, we're pleased, I think, Frank, with what we've done here and I think we've pushed it
to a pretty good extent without endangering our ratings, et cetera, on it. So we just chose a different path and actually
I'm very comfortable with the path we chose.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Mark.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: Thanks, Mark.

<Q - Simon M. Leopold>: Thank you very much. Hello. Quick one. I wanted to see if you could talk a little more
about the Ethernet switch business in the transition. You alluded to the idea that the transitions do take a long time.
What I wanted to see if you could talk about is any kind of compare and contrast this transition to the 9K family versus
the prior transition you experienced when you moved to the Nexus family. If we could understand a little bit better
about how this situation is either similar or different from the past, it might help us. Thank you.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure. And then I'm going to put on the backend of that, Simon. I'm going to ask Rob to kind
of tie through where this fits on InterCloud and ACI throughout our whole family of Nexus products.
So to answer the question very directly, when we moved to – remember, the 9K is the Nexus line and we are going to
take many of the capabilities of the 9K including ACI and move it down through our other Nexus products. The 7K
was a slow startup and it took us a long period of time and candidly, we had tough gross margins on it when we
designed it, et cetera, and it took us a while to add the features that we needed. Now I like very much where the 7K is.
You're going to see it have very continuous, very good growth opportunities, you know, it will be the 9K and the 7K
together and then I kind of judge the total growth there at the high-end switching on in terms of the capability.
I think the 9K will probably ramp quicker once you get a number of lighthouse accounts and they get their two and
three and four systems working well on it. And remember, this is the engineering team that did the UCS where people
said this is going to have a very slow ramp and it will take time to achieve that goal and while it took us a little while to
get the attention of the market on UCS, the numbers went up very quickly and I was talking with Alison Gleeson, who
heads up our Commercial Group, and what she and Soni are doing on focus on the market and they're actually on pace
for the number of customers in the pipeline that they had for UCS, which is amazing in the commercial market where
clearly some of the commercial accounts won't be reaching to the 9K.
So I think the ramp, once it goes, will probably be quicker but it will be the 7K and the 9K together. And, Rob, bring
this together and maybe a quick snapshot of this next week with where we are on InterCloud and how this really ties to
where we're going with our switching architectures.
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: Sure, John. And I think just to continue on the comment you made, it's the 9K is a
continuation of the Nexus family, running in standalone mode, using the same operating processes our customers rely
on, as well as an APIC mode where we begin to deploy the controller that is the fundamental building block of our ACI
architecture.
When you think of the differences across not only our Catalyst switch and our routers and access technology, the vision
of ACI is to use the construct of our unique application policy, which no one else is talking about in SDN, and move
that policy not only across both physical and virtual networks in the data center, but as well to the wide area and to the
access. So when we now begin shipping that technology in the next few months, the trials turn to production, you will
start to see the idea of an end-to-end application policy evolve, and the really neat thing here is that same policy could
run in my private cloud on a UCS or even now on a Vblock or a FlexPod, but as well in a public cloud instance, and
we'll be showing examples of how that policy can flow between private, managed and public clouds at Cisco Live next
week.
So there's a lot a difference. We really do both physical and virtual end-to-end across the network in terms of moving
policies. We are starting to see that at scale. Earlier we were asked about public clouds deploying; we'll be announcing
two partners that are deploying ACI in their public cloud environment. One of them is in the Gartner Top Quadrant,
one of them is mid-sized. So I think it's really catching on and it is really different in terms of deploying the model our
customers are embracing today, which is hybrid cloud, and I think we've really hit the nail on the head with ACI.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Rob. Operator, next question?

<Q - Inder M. Singh>: Yeah, hi.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Inder.
<Q - Inder M. Singh>: Hey, John. How are you?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Good.
<Q - Inder M. Singh>: So good quarter, and you sound decidedly upbeat, especially after the past couple of quarters.
It sounds like the demand side has picked up for you, but also the product upgrades are starting to kick in, and I think
you've spent quite a time on the switching side of it. I wanted to ask you about routing as well. Clearly, the company
made a big bet with CRS-X, and I think you alluded that you're seeing above expectations in terms of the demand for
that. But can you provide some more color on that?
And then just the other part of the question around the Security business, same thing. We've seen all these networks
come under threat. Clearly, perimeter security hasn't been working on networks. What are you doing differently here
where the Security business is starting to show growth for you now?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Gotcha. So on the sequence, I'm usually pretty realistic where our competitors are, even
though we know how we're going to beat them. At the high-end routing, we're by ourselves and some people might
have a product that might compete with an ASR 9000, say that's a high-end router product. It's really not. So on the
CRS-X and NCS, they're both world-class by themselves type capability. The ramp was actually good. But these tend
to – they tend to buy pilot and then buy 10, and so you will see those numbers bounce a little bit in terms of
quarter-to-quarter, based on one big deal or two, and Mel allows me to use the word 'lumpy' now in terms of direction.
In terms – so I really like those products, and candidly, I've not had a customer concern on the ones we've put in so far,
which is unusual with the new products.
In terms of Security, you're right. The market in security, you tend to have a hot product company, you have one to two
product areas and as long as that product is hot, i.e., a malware or a firewall or whatever they're doing, intrusion
protection and prevention, it tends to be a very good growth. The bad guys, as you alluded to, just go right around that
and found weaknesses. And so where we're going to play in terms of security, you will see security go across the whole
architecture from our, literally a capability with InterCloud, down through individual private clouds, down through the
data centers, down through the WAN, down to the access point.
And this is where we're going to use both our merchant, but also our custom ASICs. You will see us place security at
each node throughout that environment in a way that nobody else can. And you will see us evolve to something we'll
talk about next week on self-learning networks to where it's very good for load balancing or the Internet of Everything,
and you have to have that given how unpredictable the Internet of Everything, 50 billion devices are going to be on
loads and prioritization of applications, but its ability to handle distributed denial of service attacks and other things
becomes very exciting.
It was a gleam in our eye 15 months ago, we put the team on it and it now looks like this is really going hunt and I want
to see a couple of big lighthouses moving from beta to growth but that begins to change the competitive environment
and I think that's what you're going to see us do in security. You'll see us move on multiple fronts on security bringing
these products together in architecture and then providing what Gary alluded to and what Bryan Palma is leading for us
in terms of a consultancy group that really helps you before, during and after and does this virtually and physically
together.
So we're betting on this big-time. I think the market has already figured out it's got to be an architectural player that
wins here and if you don't have the ability to see what's going on in the network, you're playing with one arm behind
your back no matter how good your products are in terms of direction.
Now this is heavy lifting and it takes multiple steps to do it and you get up one step and then you plateau out and you
get up the next step. So I'm counting on Chris Young executing well here.

And I think that's a good question, Mel, to end on. But, you know, key take away is what you all asked us here at the
end is this innovation engine has never been better and think about it. We talked probably about 10 major product
innovation areas today from InterCloud to what we're doing in high-end routing and switching to self-learning
networks to collaboration portfolio with a refresh on it, how we're moving to software architectures on it, where we're
going with security and it's moving very well.
The one area that we didn't spend as much time on was collaboration and each of our enterprise customers will tell you
what the CEO want is, first, operating cost reductions, and second, revenue growth. And that has changed over the last
six months. The collaboration has been good from us and maybe one other peer, but it doesn't get the productivity to
5% to 7%, Gary, that we need inside Cisco and others. Watch what Rowan and team bring down this next year on
products, ease-of-use, capability, creativity.
And just to level-set you, when Rowan came here and we finally brought our three product areas together with WebEx,
which had been separate too long, and with TelePresence and with Jabber and they took a small team to move very
rapidly. It took him six months to develop his plan, 12 months to implement it. He hit every milestone along the way.
Now you're finally starting to see products start to come out which are really world-class and something called Red
Dots, which might not mean much to people in this audience, but Red Dot is like the Oscars in this industry. We've
won six in our history as a company. We won six this last year all on this collaboration product groups on product
design and direction.
So we're getting back to ease-of-use. Think of it like an Apple and TelePresence combined in ease-of-use and
implementation I encourage you to look at it at Cisco Live this next week. So innovation is going well. We've got a lot
of challenges in front of us. We're not underestimating those but, you know, I think this is a very good step, Mel, back
to not only [indiscernible] (1:11:55) but innovation and disrupting ourselves, which I know is painful at times for our
shareholders.
