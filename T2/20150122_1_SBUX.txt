With that, let me turn the call over to Howard.
Howard S. Schultz
Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today's call. Starbucks' performance in Q1 was exceptional by any
standard or metric. Financially, each of Starbucks' principal business segments and each of the regions around the
world in which we operate contributed meaningfully to record Q1 revenues of $4.8 billion, record Q1 operating income
of $916 million, and record Q1 EPS of $1.30 on a GAAP basis, and record $0.80 when excluding non-routine items,
principally the gain on our acquisition of Starbucks Japan.
Operationally, we delivered the best in-store holiday experience to customers in our history, bar none, with comp sales
accelerating through the quarter and December's performance reflecting the success of our holiday line-up. For the
quarter, we drove nearly 9 million more customer transactions through our U.S. stores than we did in Q1 last year,
almost 12 million more globally. And our global comp store sales grew 5%, with 2% coming from increased traffic,
representing our 20th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater.
And every geographic region contributed to our performance this quarter, with Americas delivering 5% comp growth,
EMEA 4%, and CAP 8%. These results are nothing short of stunning, particularly when you consider that our comps
were calculated off of a U.S. store base of almost 7,000 stores and a global store base of almost 10,000 stores.
Our Channel Development segment grew sales 10% and delivered strong profitability. At the same time, we increased
our share of premium single serve, premium packaged coffee and premium packaged tea, and we delivered record
non-GAAP operating margin across the company of 19.5% for the quarter, an 80 basis points increase over Q1 last
year.
I'll be discussing a number of strategic initiatives and innovations that took shape in the quarter that will further extend
our global coffee authority and leadership in retail and mobile technology and set us up to continue to lead and win
around the world into the future. Then I'll turn the call over to Scott, who'll take you through our Q1 financial and
operating results in detail.
I'll start with our reimagined in-store holiday experience that integrated and leveraged food and beverage innovation
with all of Starbucks' digital, loyalty, card, mobile, store footprint and partner assets to deliver the most successful
holiday in our 40-plus-year history. Our new holiday seasonal beverage, Chestnut Praline Latte, was a huge hit with
customers and one of our most successful LTOs ever. Our food platform, driven by new and innovative holiday
offerings, as well as our new lunch program, continued to gain momentum during the quarter, contributing to
incremental traffic and day-part growth, and our Dot Collection of premium, highly-styled merchandise performed very
well as well.
But the really big news is how powerfully the innovation of our card wall and vastly-expanded selection of proprietary
Starbucks gift cards enabled customers to give the Starbucks gift-of-choice throughout the season. To put the success of

our holiday card program into perspective, consider these following metrics. This holiday, one in seven American
adults received a Starbucks gift card, up from one in eight last year. Roughly 2.6 million Starbucks cards were activated
on December 23 alone, and $1.6 billion was loaded on cards in the U.S. and Canada in Q1, up 17% over last year. The
strength and success of our Starbucks card program reflects both the power and the growing relevancy of the Starbucks
brand as further demonstrated by the fact that over a 31-day period, more than 13 million customers entered into our
first-ever It's a Wonderful Card sweepstake for the chance to win Starbucks for Life.
Going forward, we know that increased Starbucks card sales drives My Starbucks Rewards membership, and in turn,
traffic in our stores. We added almost 900,000 new MSR members in Q1 alone, bringing our total membership to over
9 million, 23% over, above where we were at this time last year. And 5.5 million of our MSR members are gold
members. We are already seeing and realizing the benefit of increased activity in our stores as gift cards received over
holiday are redeemed and have additional enhancements to the MSR program planned that I am confident will continue
to result in even further acceleration in MSR membership in the future. It should be noted that MSR is one of the most
important business drivers as new members contribute not only short-term increases in revenue and profit, but also
long-term loyalty for years to come.
We continue to see broad customer acceptance and adoption of our mobile payment technologies. Today in the U.S.
alone, over 13 million customers were actively using our mobile apps, and we are now averaging over 7 million mobile
transactions in our stores each week, representing roughly 16% of total tender, more than any other bricks-and-mortar
retailer in the marketplace.
In December, we introduced Mobile Order and Pay into 150 stores in Portland, Oregon. The Starbucks Mobile Order
and Pay experience is a proprietary, fully-integrated technology that allows customers to order their food and beverage
selections through their mobile device ahead of time, go to their preferred store to pick up their completed order and
pay automatically through the same mobile device that they ordered from. Mobile Order and Pay saves our customers
time by enabling them to avoid the lines and waiting for the orders to be filled, resulting in shorter lines, faster service,
improved in-store execution and an elevated Starbucks experience.
Mobile Order and Pay has been extremely well received by customers in the Portland market. We will be launching it
now in over 600 stores in the Pacific Northwest in the months ahead, and will be rolled out nationally later in calendar
2015.
Our experience to-date confirms that once fully rolled out, Mobile Order and Pay will drive a significant increase in
mobile payment transactions in our stores overall and have a flywheel positive effect on our overall business, driving
both increased MSR membership and app usage and creating significant additional one-to-one marketing opportunities.
As previously discussed, we are also preparing for the introduction of delivery in the second half of 2015 and are
finalizing plans for two distinct delivery models, one of which utilizes our own people, green apron baristas and the
other which leverages the capabilities of a third-party service. We'll have more to share with you on our plans for
delivery in the months ahead, but rest assured that delivery, like Mobile Order and Pay, will drive incrementally and
increased customer loyalty.
Global leadership around all things coffee is and will always remain at our core. As we continue to innovate and invest
to enhance and elevate the premium, highly-differentiated but locally-relevant coffee experience we deliver to our
customers around the world. This month we successfully introduced Flat White, an espresso-forward handcrafted
beverage that combines premium coffee quality with creative artistry to deliver a unique and elegantly-delicious hot
beverage. While it's very early in its early days for Flat White, we're already seeing great attachment from our
customers and we are exceeding the early expectations.
Many of you on the call today have the unique opportunity to experience the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting
Room firsthand when you were in Seattle for our Investor Day. Well I'm delighted to report that the Roastery has
received an overwhelming response from our customers and has been the strongest opening in the 40-plus history of
our company, well exceeding even our most optimistic projections. The Roastery is setting new records every week, at
the same time as it grows both repeat customers and visitors to Seattle at all hours of the days and evening.

Personally, I feel that the Roastery is the finest, most creative and immersive experiential retail environment of any in
the world today. It should be no coincidence that the Roastery opened in the same year that we identified and shared
with you the urgent need for retailers to elevate, deepen and ultimately redefine how they were emotionally connecting
with their customers. The Roastery represents both premiumization of the coffee experience and a new chapter for
Starbucks. The additional small-batch coffee roasting capacity provided by the Roastery is enabling us to source, roast,
blend and market spectacular limited available coffees from around the world, elevate the coffee experience we deliver
to our customers, and expand availability of super-premium micro-lot Starbucks Reserve coffees to ultimately 1,500
Starbucks locations.
Customer response to the Roastery has been so strong that in addition to the second Roastery we have planned to open
in Asia in calendar 2016, we are now actively looking at real estate in another major U.S. market as well. The Roastery
is also supporting the launch of our new Starbucks Reserve brand and the opening of 100 dedicated Starbucks Reserve
stores over the years to come, devoted entirely to showcasing rare, limited, premium, small-lot coffees as we continue
to execute against our plan to elevate the consumer coffee experience globally.
At the same time, we are continuing to invest in smaller, alternative store footprints that respond to the continued
urbanization of retail, and we will soon be launching a pilot project around express locations in New York that'll offer a
streamlined assortment of food and beverage offerings and integrate Starbucks mobile payment and Mobile Order and
Pay functionality in order to enhance customer convenience and provide even faster locations in these locations – faster
service in these locations.
Turning to tea and Teavana; as we previously discussed, tea represents a massive, strategic opportunity to Starbucks
around the world, and with the integration of Teavana complete, we are now executing our plan to double our tea
business to $2 billion over the next five years. We will accomplish this goal by further elevating the Teavana in-store
experience, expanding into targeted select global markets with a focus on regions within our China and Asia-Pacific
segment, entering multiple new channels of distribution for Teavana and further developing Teavana's e-commerce
platform. We are already seeing lift in revenue generated by the sale of handcrafted tea beverages in Starbucks retail
stores, driven in large part by the very strong customer response to the launch of Teavana-branded Shaken Iced Tea and
Teavana tea lattes. In this month, we launched Teavana hot brewed teas in Starbucks stores in U.S. and Canada to
extremely favorable early results. We'll be sharing additional specifics around our plans for Teavana in the months
ahead.
Our fast-growing China, Asia Pacific region delivered strong sales profit and a company-leading 8% store comp in Q1
and continues to be a focal point of our future growth. As we shared with you at the Investor Day, we have plans in
place to double our CAP store count to roughly 10,000 locations and triple our revenue to over $3 billion and our
operating income to over $1 billion by 2019.
China, our largest market outside the United States, is a big part of our CAP story, and we are well on our way to
achieving our goal of having 3,400 stores in China by fiscal 2019. We now have a presence in 86 cities in China and
we will be adding seven more cities in 2015. To give you a sense of the size of the China opportunity, last month, we
opened our 1,500th China store and now have over 320 stores in Shanghai alone, making Shanghai the city with the
most Starbucks locations in the world today, and we have plans for opening many more.
We expect to take full ownership of Starbucks Japan by the end of this quarter, providing us with the opportunity to
accelerate growth across all channels, both in and out of our stores, in ways not previously feasible.
Our EMEA segment demonstrated continued progress against its transformation plan, delivering comp growth of 4%
with key UK markets outpacing the EMEA region overall. I'm particularly delighted to share with you that the EMEA
segment delivered its most profitable quarter in company history in Q1. Special recognition goes out to Chris and Scott
and all of our EMEA Starbucks partners for delivering these extraordinary results.
Channel Development; our relationship with Keurig Green Mountain continues to strengthen at the same time as our
K-Cup business continues to grow. Approximately 100 million Starbucks K-Cups were shipped in December 2014
alone, our largest single shipment month ever, up 20% over December 2013. Customers have now made Starbucks the

number one coffee K-Cup in the category, and we had another record share week during the key week before
Christmas. Starbucks' already industry-leading share of premium packaged roast and ground coffee continues to
increase as well. Together, accelerating sales combined with strong operating leverage enabled our Channel
Development segment to deliver 10% revenue growth and strong profit in Q1.
Delivering the complete Starbucks experience to our customers and creating an authentic, emotional connection
between our customers and our partners has been and continues to be at the heart of everything we do. This month, we
are making the single largest new investment we have ever made in our partner, our employee experience, and it will
touch 135,000 partners across our U.S. store base. Changes include increases in barista and shift supervisor pay rates,
enhanced recognition programs, a new food benefit and updates to our dress code, among others. At the same time, we
are investing in technologies that will help our partners deliver a consistently-elevated Starbucks experience to our
customers, including introducing technologies to ease and simplify required store tasks, improving access to core
business tools and resources and introducing partner apps with information and resources to facilitate viewing work
schedules from a personal mobile device.
We will continue to listen to our partners and we will endeavor to continue delivering enhancements to the partner
experience that exceed their expectations, so they in turn, will continue to exceed the expectations of our customers.
And we are making similar investments in locally-relevant ways to improve our partner experience elsewhere around
the world as well.
In closing, Starbucks is off to a fantastic start in fiscal 2015. Together, our record-shattering holiday quarter financial
and operating results, the historic opening of the Roastery and the undeniable success of our card, mobile and digital
strategies underscore the increasing strength of the Starbucks brand around the world, and ideally and uniquely
positions us to thrive in the face of this seismic shift in consumer behavior that is underway. I cannot be more proud or
appreciative of our partners and our teams around the world for delivering the record results we reported today, and I
cannot be more optimistic about our future.
I'll now turn the call over to Scott Maw, who will take you through our Q1 financial and operating results in detail, and
then I'll be back with Troy to share details on the transition. Thank you.
Scott Harlan Maw
Thanks, Howard and good afternoon, everyone. Starbucks had a very strong start to fiscal 2015 with each of our
reportable segments contributing to record consolidated revenues, operating income and earnings per share. Revenues
grew to $4.8 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year, driven primarily by incremental revenues from the acquisition
of Starbucks Japan, 5% global comp growth and incremental revenues from the 1,641 net new Starbucks stores opened
during the past 12 months. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation.
As Howard mentioned, we saw global traffic increase 2% during the quarter, reflecting the strength of our brand and
progress in many of the areas we discussed during Investor Day. On a GAAP basis, operating income grew 13% over
Q1 to $916 million, resulting in operating margin of 19.1% for the quarter and earnings per share of a $1.30. When
excluding non-GAAP items, operating income was $935 million or 18% higher than the prior year first quarter.
Non-GAAP operating margin was 19.5% compared to 18.7% in Q1 FY 2014, primarily due to sales leverage, including
meaningful COGS leverage.
After adjusting for certain items for comparability purposes, we also saw a G&A leverage in Q1, as we continue to gain
traction early in our efforts in both of these areas. And non-GAAP EPS grew 16% to $0.80 per share over the prior year
first quarter. Before going into specifics, I'd like to provide a quick update on the status of the Starbucks Japan
acquisition. During Q1, with the closing of the first tender offer, Starbucks assumed the majority ownership of
Starbucks Japan and a second tender offer to the public shareholders was commenced.
We completed the second tender offer early in the fiscal second quarter and the transaction is expected to close as
planned during the first half of calendar 2015. As of today, we own approximately 94% of the outstanding shares of

Starbucks Japan. Therefore, our Q1 2015 financials reflect a consolidation of Starbucks Japan into our financials for the
last eight weeks of the quarter and pre-acquisition JV accounting treatment for the first five weeks.
I also want to explain our non-GAAP adjustments for comparison purposes. For Q1 2015, we have excluded several
items related to our acquisition of Starbucks Japan, including an acquisition related gain of $391 million that was
partially offset by certain expenses related to the transaction. Combined these items increased first quarter earnings by a
net $0.41 per share, and for Q1 2014, we have excluded the litigation credit related to the Kraft arbitration. You can see
the amounts, timing and description of these items in the detailed reconciliation table provided at the end of the
earnings release.
In the Americas, the strong holiday season and excellent execution by our partners drove increases in revenue,
operating income and operating margin to record first quarter levels. Revenue grew by nearly 10% in the first quarter,
driven by 5% growth in comps, and revenues from 766 net new stores opened this past year. Americas delivered its
20th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater, the notable 2% increase in transactions in Q1 was a
testament to the success of the traffic-driving initiatives we discussed during our last earnings call and at our Investor
Day.
Increased operational focus helped drive transaction growth across all day-parts, including strong growth at peak and
accelerated during holiday. And for the fourth consecutive quarter, food contributed 2% to comp growth, including the
excellent performance by our breakfast sandwiches with net sales growing 29% in Q1 versus the prior year, and strong
holiday limited-time food offers. Sales of our lunch offerings increased 15% over the prior year, driven by our warm
sandwiches, which included three new items year-over-year.
Moving on to beverages, our core and limited-time offerings contributed almost half of the U.S. comp growth during
Q1. Holiday beverages delivered 9% year-over-year growth and total tea sales in our U.S. stores increased 17% over
Q1 2014. The significant momentum gained from Teavana's handcrafted iced teas this summer continued in Q1.
In addition to the solid revenue growth in Q1, operating income in the Americas grew 12% over the prior year to a new
all-time high of $818 million. Operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 24.3%, a new Q1 record, due primarily
to sales leverage. Margin opportunities still exist in the established Americas business over the balance of the year
when considering – even when considering the additional investments in 2015 for our U.S. store partners.
As you know, Target Corporation has made the decision to close all of their Canadian stores. We have a very good
relationship with Target in North America, and our 132 Canada-based licensed stores have been profitable and
growing. However, given the impact on our operation and to the customer experience from Target's decision, our stores
will close tomorrow, January 23. We don't expect these closures to impact our guidance for 2015, nor will they be
material to our Americas business results.
Moving on to EMEA, where the momentum and remarkable results from fiscal 2014 continued into the first quarter.
Revenue grew by 3% after adjusting for $15 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Revenue growth
was driven by 4% comps in the first quarter, including 3% traffic. Among the most positive signs from EMEA is the
record two-year comp of 9% that was achieved in the first quarter.
EMEA operating income in Q1 grew 49% over the prior year to $50 million, a new all-time high. Operating margin
expanded 510 basis points to 15%, as sales leverage and continued cost management driven by the portfolio shift to
higher margin licensed stores and other operational improvements drove the segment's highest quarterly operating
margin ever. We now expect EMEA operating margin to be at the high end of the 10% to 12% target range we gave to
you last quarter.
Momentum continues to build in EMEA and we are very encouraged by the broad-based improvements in both our
largest company-owned markets and our licensed stores. Across EMEA, Q1 licensed store comps were in the high
single-digits with comps in the Middle East in the double-digits.
Turning to China, Asia Pacific, CAP revenues grew 86% over prior year in Q1 to $496 million, principally the result of
the Starbucks Japan acquisition. Revenue growth was also driven by 767 net new store openings over the last 12

months and strong comp growth of 8%, all of which resulted from increased traffic. China comps continue to trend
higher than CAP comps as a whole. Adjusting out the net revenue increase of $172 million attributable to Starbucks
Japan, CAP revenue grew over 20% for the 18th straight quarter. On a GAAP basis, CAP operating margin grew 34%
to $108 million in Q1 and operating margin declined 860 basis points to 21.8%, driven by the impact of the ownership
change for Starbucks Japan. Noteworthy is that under the previous joint venture ownership structure, our Japan margin
was over 100% and our Japan store level margin remains among the highest in our global portfolio. The acquisition of
Starbucks Japan was immediately accretive on a non-GAAP basis.
We continue to believe that the CAP margin for 2015 will be in the high teens. Excluding the amortization of
intangibles associated with the Japan acquisition, CAP operating income on a non-GAAP basis increased by 43% over
Q1 last year. Operating margin, excluding the full 1,060-basis-point impact of our ownership change in Starbucks
Japan, increased by 200 basis points, driven principally by strong sales leverage and a continuing emphasis on
improving operations in the region.
Strong performance from China's new stores and overall revenue and margin expansion contributed significantly to
CAP's excellent performance in Q1. Starbucks China launched eight Reserve stores in five cities during the quarter,
including the world-class flagship store in Chengdu. Across the region, digital assets such as mobile apps, e-gifting,
Starbucks cards and My Starbucks Reward continue to gain significant momentum.
In Channel Development, Q1 was very strong as we gained market share in our U.S. business despite significant
competitive pressure. Robust sales of K-Cups and healthy growth in packaged coffee drove revenues to a new quarterly
record of $443 million in Q1, a 10% increase over the prior year. Operating income for Channel Development grew
33% in Q1 over the prior year to $158 million, another quarterly record. And operating margin was 35.6%, a 600 basis
point increase over last year. Coffee cost favorability and efficiencies in cost of goods sold were the primary drivers of
this improvement. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect modest improvement in Channel Development margin for
the full year compared to 2014, with commodities and COGS favorability lower in the latter quarters of 2015.
Starbucks K-Cups gained the leadership position in the category in December with an 18% share during the last five
weeks of Q1, our highest share since launch. Overall, we shipped 232 million cups in Q1, 17% greater than last year,
driven by strong customer response to new flavors such as Cinnamon Dolce and Mocha and limited-time offers such as
Fall and Holiday Blend. Our recently launched single-origin K-Cups, including Rwanda Rift Valley, also contributed to
growth, demonstrating customer demand for these excellent varietals.
Starbucks packaged coffee also gained share during the last five weeks of Q1, growing to 28% and exceeding 30% for
the first time during the key merchandise week of the month. Our cross-channel loyalty program, Stars Down the Aisle,
also played a role in these results with 1.7 million MSR members entering codes through grocery in Q1. Almost 12
million codes have been entered since the launch of the program less than two years ago.
Teavana's performance, which is included in the all other segments, was relatively flat to the prior year. However, as
Howard mentioned, sales of Teavana handcrafted beverages through our Starbucks stores in the Americas segments has
driven exceptional growth in tea category revenue year-over-year. Regarding taxes, our Q1 tax rate was 24.2% and the
decrease in the rate was primarily due to the impact of the gain related to the Starbucks Japan acquisition, which is
almost entirely nontaxable.
As I mentioned at the outset, Starbucks had a very strong Q1, with both solid revenue growth and margin expansion.
This performance gives us the confidence in now targeting non-GAAP EPS of $3.09 to $3.13. That's moving the
bottom end of our range up slightly from our previous target range, while retaining the top end. A higher gain on the
Japan transaction results in our raising the 2015 GAAP EPS target up to $3.53 to $3.58. Revenue growth is also
expected to remain within our previous target range of 16% to 18%.
Noteworthy is that based upon where exchange rates are today, the stronger dollar will adversely impact revenue
growth and operating income growth by about one point each. We are confident that we will be able to offset this
foreign exchange impact given the strength of our Q1 global operating results and the progress we will continue to
make in leveraging COGS and G&A. It is also important to note that the vast majority of this currency impact

represents only the effect of translating our foreign earnings into the U.S. dollar for reporting purposes. We actively
hedge our largest real economic cross-currency cash flow risks.
We are now expecting Q2 GAAP EPS in the range of $0.63 to $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS in Q2 is expected to be in the
range of $0.64 to $0.65. The second quarter is when the majority of our U.S. store partner investments begin in earnest,
including our new food benefit and the changes in wages, Howard mentioned earlier. This will have some impact on
Q2 Americas margin.
I also want to acknowledge that we see many external analysts' projections for Q2 EPS growth above 20%, higher than
the Q2 earnings range I just mentioned. I suspect that this difference is driven by our increased partner investments in
Q2 and some seasonality that we always see in our second quarter. I want to reiterate that our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP
EPS growth remains the previously targeted 16% to 18%. We expect the first half of the year to be near the lower end
of this range and the second half of the year to be closer to the upper end. Increasing revenues, strong global comp
growth, new innovation, including Mobile Order and Pay, and the strong momentum we are seeing across our business
gives us confidence in this slight acceleration, despite additional foreign translation impact. In addition, we expect
some acceleration in the benefit from our COGS and G&A leverage over the course of the year.
Moving on to commodities, we have recently priced a significant amount of coffee as prices have moved down within
our target range over the past six weeks. As such, we now have 94% of our 2015 coffee needs priced, and therefore we
expect commodity costs to be roughly flat for 2014. We will continue to provide updates as we price our coffee needs
for fiscal 2016. We continue to expect to add approximately 1,650 net new stores globally. Of the 1,650, we expect 650
in the Americas, 150 in EMEA and 850 in China, Asia Pacific. The outlook for our effective tax rate continues to be
around 31%, and we expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2015.
In closing, Q1 represented another quarter of excellent global growth for Starbucks by any metric.
Our strong results in the quarter and confident outlook for the year reflect many of the critical strategic growth
initiatives we outlined during Investor Day. We expect EPS growth to accelerate as we move into the back half of the
year and coffee cost remain well under control, and our financial forecast includes an appropriate level of investment in
our store partners and in food, beverage and technology integration. We consider this as an investment and not an
expense as it is integral to our continued growth in sales and profits over the long term. We look forward to updating
you on our progress as we move throughout the year. With that, let me turn the call back over to Howard. Howard?
Howard S. Schultz
Scott, thank you very much. I have one more important announcement to share before moving on to Q&A. Today, I am
extremely pleased to announce that Kevin Johnson, former CEO of Juniper Networks and former President of
Microsoft's Platforms division, and a five-plus year Starbucks board member will be joining the Starbucks senior
leadership team as President and Chief Operating Officer effective March 1. Welcome, Kevin. Kevin has worked
closely with the Starbucks senior leadership team and me as a board member since 2009 collaborating and providing
deep insights and wise counsel in connection with our transformation in 2009, and many of the strategies we've
outlined at our Investor Conference last month and will be executing against for the next several years. Kevin and I
have been discussing his coming to the company in order to contribute his insights and expertise and help us as we
grow our business in North America and around the world for some time. These discussions were independent of
Troy's subsequent decision to take a sabbatical. Kevin will be reporting directly to me.
Now, as I said at our Investor Day and I want to underscore here, my passion and personal commitment to Starbucks
has never been greater. I also want to make it clear that Kevin's addition is not part of some unannounced succession
arrangement, because it's not. Instead, Kevin's public company experience and his deep management, technology,
global operating company, supply chain, mobile and digital expertise will be a fantastic addition to already the
strongest and most talented management team in our history.

Please join me in congratulating Kevin, who is with us this afternoon, and welcoming him to Starbucks, and I've asked
him to say a few words of introduction. Kevin?
Kevin R. Johnson
Thank you, Howard. Greetings, everyone. For nearly six years now I've had the great privilege of working closely with
Howard and the SLT in my role as a Starbucks board member. Through this involvement, I've gained a deep and
unique insight into Starbucks business, its values and culture, and the critical role that our 300,000 passionate partners
play in delivering an elevated Starbucks experience to millions of customers around the world each and every day. In
December, I attended the Starbucks Investor Day, at which time we outlined our strategies for the next several years.
I'm fully committed to working with Howard, the SLT and our partners around the world to fully operationalize those
strategies and to deliver results consistent with the expectations we shared, our core values and our culture. As always,
performance driven through the lens of humanity.
Troy and I are already engaged to ensure a smooth handoff as he begins his sabbatical on March 1. My prior business
experience leading global organizations, combined with my Starbucks board experience, should enable me to quickly
ramp up in my new role. I want our partners and shareholders to know the deep sense of responsibility and
accountability I feel to fulfill our aspirations and deliver results. Howard?
Howard S. Schultz
Kevin, thank you so much, and on behalf of all of us today, this is a wonderful opportunity to welcome you to
Starbucks. This also marks Troy's last earnings call before he takes his sabbatical, a coffee break in Starbucks parlance.
Troy has been a true friend, a great leader, and a passionate 23 years Starbucks partner who is beloved inside our
building and around the world. I'm going to miss Troy in my daily conversations and collaborations and look forward
to the day when he is ready to return to the company. Troy wants to say a few words to all of you in the financial
community before taking his leave. Troy?
Troy Alstead
Thank you, Howard. I have had the incredible opportunity to be part of Starbucks for 23 years, starting from the early
days as a small, privately-held coffee company with stores primarily just here in the Northwest. And while very
difficult to step away from this place that I know and love so deeply, I recently made the personal decision to dedicate
the next year to my family, with four school-aged children. What gives me great comfort in stepping away right now is
the incredible strength of the organization and momentum of the business. As we demonstrated during the Investor Day
here in Seattle in early December, the performance of the business around the world is stronger than ever. The
opportunities ahead of us are greater than ever, and the aspirations of the company are higher than ever before. The
holiday quarter we just reported underscores that strength and opportunity.
We are fortunate to have a leader of Kevin's caliber and experience able to join Starbucks at this time. I've worked with
Kevin in his role as a board member for many years and have benefited from his experience and insights. His
experience as a public company CEO combined with his years on the Starbucks' board position him to hit the ground
running. Kevin and I have already spent much time together in the transition and will engage further together over the
next month to ensure everything transitions smoothly.
Most of you on the call today I have come to know very well over the years. Thank you for your engagement and your
support of Starbucks and of me. I assure you that the best days for Starbucks are still ahead. And finally, I'd like to say
thank you to Howard for giving me incredible opportunities and support over many years and for supporting this
personal family decision at this time. Thank you, Howard.
With that, we'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A. Mike?

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.
<Q - Jeff Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you very much. Congratulations, Troy. A question on the mobile
payment platform, I know it got a lot of attention at the Analyst Day and it seems like that's probably the biggest
opportunity from a traffic driving standpoint. Sounds like Portland must've gone reasonably well. It sounds like you've
identified the next few markets in the rollout by the end of fiscal 2015. Just wondering whether you can give us some
color on maybe early learnings over the past couple of months in terms of any challenges or nuances you've had to
overcome or whether there is any insight into what kind of incremental sales or how it helps speed of service. I saw
there were some quotes from Scott earlier this afternoon in terms of the significant benefits that it provides. Trying to
get some insight in terms of your early learnings and what we can expect in the years still to come?
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Thanks, Jeff. This is Adam Brotman. I'll answer that. First of all, we're not breaking out
specifics. But what I can tell is we have completely hit the ground running in Portland and the experience to both of our
customers using the apps as well as the partners operationally has met and even exceeded our expectations. So we are
full steam ahead in terms of rolling this out around the country, as you mentioned, over the course of the rest of this
calendar year.
And what we've learned is that this is absolutely every bit of what we thought it would do in terms of helping us add
convenience for our customers, integrate it fully into not just our technologies, but our operational flow, and we are as
confident as the day we launched it that this is going to help drive incremental transactions, improve throughput and
capacity and even help us accelerate MSR.
<Q - Jeff Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John Glass>: Thanks very much. Scott, you outlined $1 billion in cost savings over the next four years and
there're several buckets. How much of that is in your thinking for 2015 guidance? And specifically, you commented on
you're expecting a second half acceleration in earnings growth. Is that largely due to these cost savings coming in or are
you – do you believe that there is a sales benefit – an uptick in sales in the back half to drive that?
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: Yeah. Thanks, John. Maybe I'll answer the back part of that first. There's a number of
things as we look into the second half of the year that will help us accelerate profit. It includes cost of goods sold
leverage, which I'll get to in a second, but also some of the work we've done around support costs. And then what we
believe will be accelerated revenue opportunities through things like Mobile Order and Pay, some of the things we have
around innovation with beverage and some of the things we see in our international operations. So all of that is driving
what's a slight acceleration in our earnings growth in the back half of the year. We're pretty confident we're going to see
that.
As far as the COGS savings, we think it'll be about $200 million this year. You may remember from Investor Day in
2013 we had $100 million that we booked. In 2014, it was $140 million. And in 2015, it's getting up close to $200
million, so great work by the supply chain team and all of the business units. And we're well on our way to recognizing
most of that. Most of that is already in the run rate.

The next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Karen Holthouse>: Hi. Congratulations on the quarter and on Troy on what comes next. Kind of a little bit of a
deep dive question. If you look in the Americas segment, we've now had a couple of quarters where licensed store
revenue growth has been pretty meaningfully exceeding unit growth plus comp growth. Is there something – at the
same time, coffee prices are going down, so you would think that would be the opposite? Is there something in store
composition or anything else in the model that we might be missing there?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Karen, hi. It's Cliff. The significant difference is with our approach to food and for the first
time ever most of our licensees are now taking the incredible [indiscernible] (43:03) range of food plus our breakfast
sandwiches. And that has allowed us to increase our revenue stream through our licensed stores. And it's been
extremely well received. It also helps us improve our offer to the customers with a greater consistency than we've ever
had before. So food is the meaningful change.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: And I would just add to that, we are seeing comp growth in our licensed stores that equal to
or greater than what we're seeing in our company-owned stores. So it's the combination of those two things that's
driving revenue.
<Q - Karen Holthouse>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
<Q - John William Ivankoe>: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to see how much of a change there was in this enhanced
partner experience and maybe what was driving that. And maybe what was driving that's just you are in a position of
strength, where you can just improve how you treat your employees and how you attract and retain the absolute best
talent that was out there, but just wanted to understand a little bit more substantive. How their day-to-day or their
year-to-year is going to be affected? And maybe if you were beginning to see some tick up in turnover or in execution
consistency as the labor market for the better people is starting to get a little bit tighter?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Hi, John, this is Howard. You probably better than almost anyone on the call, you've
covered the company since the IPO; you know firsthand that the culture, values and guiding principles of our company
are directly linked to the equity of the brand. And the equity of the brand is defined purely by the relationship we have
with our customers, which is defined by our people. There's no issue of increased turnover or anything like that. It's we
are in the business of doing everything we can not only to invest in customer-facing experiences and enhancements, but
we have to do everything we can to do the same thing with our people.
Starbucks has had a long history, as you know, of equity in the form of stock options, healthcare, now college
achievement, in which we're providing free tuition for juniors and seniors. We want to do everything we can to
demonstrate the humanity of the company, and we have felt, since day one that investing over the long term in our
people is the best investment we can make in the customer experience. So we're taking these steps not because we have
a problem. We're taking these steps because it's the right thing to do.
Operator
The next question is from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you very much and my congratulations to both Kevin and to Troy on these new
stages. I actually wanted to sort of ask about this transition in the context of a couple things. I mean, first of all sort of
how Kevin's responsibilities might be similar to or different from what Troy had in the sense that it sounds like Kevin

has a lot of experience, but not in retail or restaurants, per se. And then I don't know if you can talk at all about this, but
obviously, Kevin has been a board member since 2009, so not really new to the story, but – so I guess, is there any
sense of what – of maybe what kind of initiatives he might undertake or where he might see the opportunities there?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Well, look this is Howard. I'll start it out and give Kevin his initial opportunity to share his
own thoughts with you. If we were hiring someone from the outside who did not have almost six years of experience
with the company, I think this would be a different story. The transition would be longer, the learning curve would be
longer. But Kevin has lived and worked in Seattle for many years at Microsoft. So he has been a customer to Starbucks
for many years.
And as a board member, he has been the kind of board member that has been deeply involved in the strategies of the
company and specifically aligning himself and helping the digital side of the transformation of the company, which has
been so successful with Adam. His responsibilities in many ways will mirror Troy's, with the exception that he is
picking up digital with Adam and he'll have IT as well as supply chain, which Troy had.
Scott Maw who had been reporting to Troy will be reporting to me. And Kevin will have the geographies, which are
represented at this table with John and with Cliff. And I have spend many, many hours with Kevin over the many years
sharing with him the aspirations we have at the company and he is very, very well versed. And what we are trying to do
and the opportunity that lies ahead and we are very, very fortunate. In many ways, I said to a reporter a couple of hours
ago, having Troy leave the company is in no doubt a significant loss, but we are so fortunate at the same time to, in a
sense have a number one draft choice in Kevin Johnson. So Kevin, I'll give you your own opportunity.
<A - Kevin R. Johnson>: Yeah. Well, thanks for your question. I think clearly, my professional experience has been in
the tech industry, companies like IBM and Microsoft and Juniper, but in that experience, I've had the opportunity to
work with many retail industry customers on technology-based solutions and ways to help them drive their business.
Now, certainly, as Howard mentioned, my experience on the Starbucks board since 2009 has provided me a solid
understanding of the strategy and the culture and the leadership talent that we have here at Starbucks. And certainly,
Troy and I are working closely together on the transition just to ensure that this is a seamless smooth transition. And in
terms of what initiatives to undertake, I think at the Starbucks Investor Day in December, we outlined the strategy. And
so my focus is going to be working with the SLT and working with our partners to operationalize that strategy, and
that's going to be my priority.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Thank you, Kevin.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from David Palmer with RBC.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks. Congrats on the quarter and Troy, congrats on your career. Last year, Starbucks
talked about a significant fall-off in results after Black Friday. How did the growth rate change through this last quarter
and perhaps what did that tell you about your business?
And then separately, Scott, with regard to your COGS commentary, dairy and energy prices, they've come off lately. Is
that a factor in the back half? Thanks.
<A - Troy Alstead>: David, I'll take the holiday question and then give it to Scott. You're exactly right, I think we
were here last year at this time, and I think I said for the first time that the U.S. retail environment and the consumer,
we are in – we are experiencing a seismic change in consumer behavior. And as a result of that, bricks-and-mortar
retailers would have to redefine their relevance.
We went to work at this time last year in completely redefining and transforming not only our holiday season, but in
many ways the calendar year 2015, with leveraging all the assets we have, and specifically understanding how we
could utilize MSR, our digital platform, to lower our cost of customer acquisition and emotionally build a relationship

with them that was not only based on them being in our stores, but driving traffic in our stores.
And so, the results that we posted today is a manifestation of all of that, and specifically the merchandise relationship
that we built around the Dot Collection, the Starbucks Card, and we got very fortunate in once again hitting a bull's-eye
with Chestnut Praline Latte, and we may have another winner of that magnitude with Flat White, don't know yet. But
clearly, the beverage resonated with our customers, and we were in a position like – unlike many other retailers to
demonstrate such relevancy in-store with a beverage that created demand, and experience that was spot-on in terms of
the card and the gifts of choice, and Starbucks for Life just added to all of that in terms of the excitement.
And I would just add that our people were so proud of how we went to market for holiday, and they rose to the
challenge and were able to really develop that kind of relationship with our customers. I mean, serving millions of
customers more than we did last year, we should not underscore, we're talking about 9 million more customers. It's an
unbelievable number and that was U.S. alone, and we saw the same level of accretion worldwide with 12 million more
customers. It's a stunning number in any environment, especially when you consider the environment we're in with a
different type of consumer who's really turning away from traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers. Scott?
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: On the commodity piece, the way that it shapes up for the year, David, is we saw some
significant coffee favorability in the first quarter, not much on dairy and diesel, and you can see that coffee favorability
in the Channel Development margin improvement. That coffee favorability at that level is not going to continue in the
back half of the year, and so you'll see Channel's margin growth come down. However, we do see offsetting that some
favorability in dairy and diesel. So when you add that all the way – all up across the year, we think commodities will be
roughly neutral year-over-year. But that's kind of how it shapes up.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Keith Siegner with UBS.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thank you and similar congratulations to you everyone involved. I just want to circle back
and ask one more question on [ph] the XO payer – or the Mobile Order and Payment (53:16), since it's such an exciting
part of the story for this year. Scott, maybe you can help me think about this. When we think about that pace of rollout
and we know kind of what the completion date is but how does the pace of the rollout happen? Is it a slow build? And
we get a big boost right at the end? And then similarly, how do the costs associated with this role? Do they come a little
early? Maybe is that part of what leads to some of the cadence of the year? If you could help me with those two pieces,
it would be very helpful. Thanks.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Adam, why don't you start, and then Scott can jump in.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Okay. Keith, in terms of the rollout pace, it's going to be fairly evenly spread out
throughout the year. So it's not – it's neither front-loaded nor back-loaded, and so that's kind of how we're thinking
about it. And so far, everything seems on track for that.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: And as far as the cost goes, because of the rollout, the cost is pretty evenly spread as well.
And I'll just remind you, there's not a lot of cost. There's some incremental cost that'll happen this year, but because of
how integrated this is with our existing technology and how seamlessly it works with our existing systems, that cost is
manageable.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Can I do one thing also? There's lots of companies who are ringing the bell about Mobile
Order and Pay, but in my prepared remarks I specifically talked about, this is a proprietary, integrated relationship that
we're building with our infrastructure and in turn with the customer. Adam, can you just – you or Matt can just touch
on that for one minute?
<A - Matthew Ryan>: Well, yeah. I mean, this is – I mentioned this at the Investor Day, but this is – what's so unique
about what we're doing is, we're not starting from a cold start. We already have 13 million active mobile users, we have

the POS and payment capabilities, we have MSR now up to 9 million plus. And so for us, we are simply adding on
mobile ordering onto that stack of proprietary integrated technology that allow us to do something like that. And it sets
us up, frankly, for delivery as well. So, the kind of pace of innovation, our ability to roll it out, and positively influence
our business overall is because we have built this and integrated this in the way I just mentioned.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: And the other thing, I just want to say one more time is that traditional advertising and
marketing to try and overcome this seismic shift in consumer behavior is probably not going to work for most people.
The relationship that we have built with our customers through mobile payment, through MSR, through gold members
and now Mobile Order and Pay and delivery is a significant driver in not only elevating the relationship we have with
our customers but significantly lowering our traditional cost of customer acquisition, especially when you compare it to
other national retailers.

Next question is from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi, good afternoon, and congratulations again to everyone. My question is a follow-up on
the Mobile Order and Pay experience you've seen so far in Portland. And really, I wanted to focus on the operation side
of this. And I know there was some potential changes in how the back of the house or the baristas operate and some
potential conflicts with how customer timing and pickup might work. So I was wondering kind of if you could
comment on your experience so far and if your operations are running as smoothly as you would have envisioned at
this stage of the game?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: David, it's Cliff here. It's been incredibly smooth. We did a lot of work upfront. As Adam's
already said, we built off existing platforms. We integrated it with MSR. It is totally intuitive and we took the existing
flow in the store, have built a printer into the register lineup and so it's an absolutely seamless experience for our
baristas, and it doesn't change the routine for the bar, as consolidation area for our food and beverage come together.
Quite frankly, and I say it without fear of contradiction from any of my colleagues here, it has been seamless and we're
delighted by the way the customers from day one, when we were down in the market, and our partners have embraced
this and that's why we're so confident we can meet this 2015 rollout.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: And I guess one quick follow up. Have you run into issues with the timing of the order
being prepared and the timing of the customer picking it up? Is that – I know that was one potential watch out, but is
there any issues like that that you are still working through or is it working pretty smoothly?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: No, we have had, David, an incredible smoothness in this. There are obviously individuals
who will learn it, it's a new technology. We didn't go in with a narrow test or pilot. We went in replicating our final
rollout plans, we're learning along the way. But it has been – it's improved every day. Adoption has grown from day
one. And we are extremely confident about this.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Great. That sounds great. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Thank you. I just had a follow-up and then a question. I just wanted to understand. You made
a comment, Scott, regarding the investment in your partners and how that's going to be a little bit more – or it comes
into 2Q and that's somewhat of the 16% or the lower end of the full-year guidance in 2Q and then the somewhat ramp
in the back half. I'm just curious, isn't that, though, like wages? So I don't know why – is there like a level of
investment that is going on in 2Q or a conference of sorts or one-time training or something that's weighted in 2Q? If

you could give some color on that.
And then my question was with respect to Portland and the digital. I'm curious on if you have had an early read in the
first six weeks or so of the rollout or four weeks of the rollout, what you are seeing in winning over more people. Has
Portland outpaced bringing people on to the mobile app versus other regions? Obviously, everyone is moving over, but
are they moving over faster because of the added benefit of Mobile Order and Pay? Thank you.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: I'll go first and then I'll turn it over to you, Adam. Matt, what I was referring to was if you
look at analyst estimates for the second quarter, they're north of 20% on average. And I was trying to speak to what
might be missing in those forecasts, and I think this investment that's starting really in January, and you're right,
continuing all year in our forecasts, in partner wages and other benefits might be an explanation for that difference
between what we're seeing and what you're seeing. What's really driving the second half acceleration in earnings, and
by the way, it's a pretty slight acceleration from 16% to 18%, is all the things that we talked about on the top line, the
momentum we see in the business, and then the things we're doing in the middle of the P&L both within the stores and
within the supply chain, and support costs, we see that picking up a little bit in the back half of the year. Adam?
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: And again we're not like – I can't get into specifics, the answer is yes, we are seeing
incremental driving of MSR membership, usage of our app, and what's so exciting about that is we have – this is still in
beta mode in terms of – we haven't even put this on our Android platform yet, which is coming soon. We have
additional features to come, so we're just getting started and we like what we see early on in terms of all the drivers that
we talked about at the Analyst Conference.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: And Matt, while I'm clarifying some comments today I made earlier. I want to make sure
everyone's clear that Target stores that were closing in Canada are licensed stores, and then I want to make sure the
amount of non-GAAP EPS related to the Japan transaction is $0.49, I may have said $0.41, so clean all that up.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Thank you.

The next question is from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar.
<Q - R.J. Hottovy>: Thanks. Had a question about lowering the cost of customer acquisition. Specifically, the success
of the holiday promotions, like Starbucks for Life and other things you were running during the period. Just wanted to
get a sense of how you plan to keep this momentum going and other activities – promotional activities that you might
have planned for the rest of fiscal 2015? Thanks.
<A - Matthew Ryan>: Matt Ryan here. The reason why customer acquisition will continue to come down in terms of
cost is a confluence of a number of factors. As we add more features that are meaningful to the customer, things like
Mobile Order and Pay, down the road, delivery, we're going to be giving the customer added reasons to sign up for
MSR. That is an organic thing that happens. The second thing that happens is as we sell more and more gift cards, we
naturally get through the process of registration, incremental MSR customers. Those are probably the two most
important things we see rolling out. And that along with increased focus within our stores, which is a low cost customer
acquisition opportunity, builds out MSR as a platform. And the acceleration in MSR growth you saw last quarter was
the result of all three of those things.
<Q - R.J. Hottovy>: Thanks.

The next question is from Nick Setyan with Wedbush.
<Q - Nick Setyan>: Thank you. Congrats again on a great quarter. My question is on China, Asia Pacific. We saw a
very meaningful acceleration from last quarter, both on a one and three-year basis. And maybe – there's a lot of folks

on the U.S. comp drivers. Maybe you can maybe give us some color on the various drivers in China, Asia Pacific and
whether it's market-by-market or one product or another that would be great. Thank you.
<A - John Winchester Culver>: Yes, Nick, this is John. Thanks for the question. I think really we saw obviously 8%
comp growth in the quarter and it was all driven by traffic. And what I would say is that we have more customers now
coming in our stores than ever before in our history, across the 15 markets that we operate in.
That is being driven in large part as well in China. And when you look at the China comp, and I'm not going to quote
any specific number, but China comp actually outpaced the entire region. We opened our 1,500th store there, we
opened eight new Reserve stores there, and the relevance of the brand in China has never been stronger. We did a
consumer study in China and what we've seen is that we are looked at as the coffee leader in the market. That our
products, the localization of our products, are locally relevant, and we are building a strong trust between our baristas
as well as with our customers. And what we've been able to do is we've been able to take the awareness that we've built
around Starbucks in China as well as in other markets. We've been able to translate that into traffic into our stores. And
we've done a very good job of converting that awareness to actual visits. We had a very strong holiday season, our
promotional beverages did very well, and we feel that we are in a position to continue the momentum. When you look
at our two-year comp across the region, it's at about [ph] 16%. (64:59) And Starbucks card and mobile does very well
in China. We are at now over 40% of our transactions are done on the Starbucks card in China as well as two other
major markets. Japan had a very strong quarter as well, given the tough economic environment that's going on in Japan.
The acquisition, as Scott said, was accretive in the quarter. And we are in a good position in Japan to accelerate the
growth through new stores, through channels outside of our stores, as well as aggressively going after the digital
platform in Japan as well. So, feel very good about the job our team is doing across the region.
<Q - Nick Setyan>: Thank you.

We will take one last question. The last question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
<Q - John William Ivankoe>: A follow-up.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: John, you don't get two questions. Go ahead. Kidding.
<Q - John William Ivankoe>: I know a lot of people will probably ask this, so I'll just take the opportunity to ask it
publicly. It sounds like December was the high month of the quarter, if I'm listening to your comments in the right way.
And I think in your prepared remarks, you made some comments that you are already seeing and realizing the benefit
of increased activity in the stores, which I assume is January. So should I interpret the right way or are you saying that
there was further acceleration in January relative to December? Just trying to get a sense of what you're trying to
communicate regarding March in general year-over-year and relative to the first quarter, if I can ask that?
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: Yeah. Thanks, John. It's Scott. We haven't said anything about January. You are correct that
within the quarter we did see some acceleration and at the holiday period, our busiest period, we actually saw the
highest transaction comps we had in the U.S., and that is certainly encouraging as it relates to the first quarter.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Thanks, Scott.
<Q - John William Ivankoe>: Okay. Thanks.
