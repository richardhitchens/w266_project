My name is Marvin and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Third Quarter Earnings Conference
Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session
at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we
would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.
Arvind K. Sood
Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our third quarter conference call.
Unlike past quarters, our format today will be a bit different. As we are conducting a comprehensive business review
tomorrow morning, we'll limit our comments to reviewing our solid performance during the third quarter and keep this
call brief to about 30 minutes, including taking some of your questions.
Joining me today are Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO; and our CFO, David Meline, who will both make some
prepared comments outlining our operating performance during the quarter. Tony Hooper, who as you know is our

Head of Global Commercial Operations; and Sean Harper, our Head of R&D, are also here with us to address any
questions you might have for them.
To further help with the understanding of product sales drivers, we have posted some slides on our website. Our
comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our
presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary
materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?
Robert A. Bradway
Thanks, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss our strong third quarter
results. As Arvind indicated, David Meline and I will offer some brief commentary and context for the quarter and then
we'll take some questions together with Tony and Sean. Again, just to reiterate, since we're meeting tomorrow morning
for a comprehensive business review, we'll really try to keep the focus for this call on our quarterly results.
Our third quarter results just announced reflect strong sales performance across the portfolio, which when combined
with our ongoing expense discipline, generated 22% growth in operating income and 19% growth in earnings per share.
Given the strategic emphasis we've placed on growing our international presence, we were particularly pleased with the
14% growth in international sales during the quarter. Consistent with the strong underlying prescription trends that
we've seen through the first three quarters of the year, our product sales performance for the third quarter was up 4%
year-over-year.
If you recall, however, last year, we recognized a $155 million government order for NEUPOGEN that was reflected in
our Q3 2013 results. Sales grew 8% year-over-year excluding that one-time order from last year.
Overall then the Q3 performance was strong across the board. And on a year-to-date basis, revenues have increased 8%
with operating income increasing 24% reflecting on our improving margin structure. In a moment David will review
the drivers of our key products and the financials in more detail, but as you know R&D is the engine that will drive
future growth at Amgen and we continue to make good progress in advancing our registrational program, so I'll say a
few words about those.
We reported positive Phase 3 results from three innovative programs in the quarter. The second positive study for
AMG 416, which is our intravenous calcimimetic, which performed well on a study versus placebo. The Kyprolis
ASPIRE study, which generated exceptional progression free survival data in the relapsed multiple myeloma setting, as
well as evolocumab data in Japan which is also an important opportunity for us.
We submitted marketing authorizations for four programs in the quarter with ivabradine in the U.S., evolocumab,
blinatumomab and T-VEC in the U.S. and EU, with both ivabradine and blinatumomab currently under priority review
by the FDA. We also announced the first positive Phase 3 results for one of our biosimilar programs, that being ABP
501 in psoriasis as we prepare to begin launching our biosimilar portfolio beginning in 2017.
We'll talk about strategy tomorrow and we'll look forward to providing more granularity on our progressing pipeline,
our commercial plans for launching new products, our capital allocation plans, our business transformation initiatives
and progress, as well as an update on our biosimilar and manufacturing activities.
Now let me turn to David, who will walk you through the financials then we'll open it up for questions.
David W. Meline
Okay. Thanks, Bob. I want to take a moment to first briefly discuss the key drivers of product sales performance during
the quarter. Enbrel units grew 3% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter reflecting strong underlying demand, as

is reflected in the prescription data. I'd also like to point out that Enbrel continues to see strong segment growth in both
rheumatology and dermatology at 21% and 24%, respectively. Recall last quarter that we called out 60 million of
Enbrel inventory build in Q2 that we expected to burn off in Q3, masking the strength in demand.
Prolia sales increased 43% in the quarter due to strong unit demand. As you're aware, we normally see some
seasonality in Prolia in Q3 and we saw the expected sales ramp-up as we exited the quarter.
We continued to capture share in the growing markets with XGEVA, and despite generic competition over the past
year, XGEVA sales increased 22%. Our newest product, Kyprolis, realized sequential sales growth of 21% to $94
million, much of which was driven by strong unit demand. We remain confident that Kyprolis will become the
proteasome inhibitor of choice and you'll have the opportunity to hear from Pablo Cagnoni, who leads our Onyx
business, tomorrow.
Finally, I would also like to highlight Vectibix, which grew 29% year-over-year on the strength of our new first-line
label in the U.S., as well as growth in the EU. Let me now make a few brief comments on our operating performance.
Our operating expenses declined 5% due to Enbrel's improved profitability from the expired profit share agreement, as
well as due to efforts to manage cost. This led to a 47% operating margin, a 7-point increase compared to the third
quarter of 2013. Based on our progress through the first nine months of the year and our confidence in the underlying
trends of the business, we are again raising our 2014 revenue guidance to $19.8 billion to $20 billion, and our 2014
adjusted EPS guidance to $8.45 to $8.55 per share. I would also like to provide a brief update on our transformation
actions.
At the time of our announcement in July, we estimated a head count reduction of 12% to 15% of our global workforce
or 2,400 to 2,900 staff. We've now completed and largely implemented the adjustment, with a confirmed total in excess
of 2,900 reductions. On a U.S. GAAP basis, restructuring charges totaled $376 million in the third quarter. We now
expect the total cost of this action to be $835 million to $885 million through 2015, including an estimated $150
million charge in Q4 of 2014.
We are also updating our guidance for the 2014 tax rate today. Based on uncertainty concerning the timing for the
extension of the R&D tax credit within the 2014 calendar year, we've chosen to remove the benefit from our projected
2014 adjusted tax rate, resulting in guidance of 16% to 17% for this year versus our previous guidance of 15% to 16%.
We also saw in the quarter $1 billion increase in free cash flow to $2.6 billion, reflecting the benefit of higher product
sales and ongoing improvements in working capital.
Our cash balance increased $1.6 billion over the previous year, now totaling $28.1 billion. Our debt balance of $33
billion is $5.8 billion higher versus Q3 of 2013, due to the debt related to the Onyx acquisition.
That completes our review of the quarter. I will now turn the call back to Arvind for Q&A.
Arvind K. Sood
Excellent. Thank you, David. Marvin, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A. And let's do that for about the next 15
minutes to 20 minutes. If you want to start out by reviewing the procedure again for asking questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks a lot for taking my question, and congrats on a really strong performance in Q3. I
guess the question is for David on the guidance. Even with the bumped up tax rate in 2014, if you hit your revenue

guidance for the fourth quarter, it applies a pretty big decrease in operating margins, just kind of wondering what might
be behind that?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yes, Eric. So generally what we see in the fourth quarter is pickup of expenses. It's a seasonal
trend that occurs, I'm told, each year. And so what we're expecting is a similar pickup here in Q4. So I think nothing
unusual, but there's certainly some additional costs in Q4.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Eric, as you know, we're gearing up for some potential launches next year, including
launches that could take place early in the year. So that will be reflected as well when we get into the fourth quarter
OpEx.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Great. Thanks very much for take my question as well, and congrats on the nice results. So you
pointed out the expanding margin here in the second quarter and third quarter, certainly better than it's been in recent
years. And we understand that Enbrel profitability is part of that.
But these numbers also had a future year consensus estimate. So I just wanted to get a sense for with the caveat of an
uptick of expenses in the 4Q, and realizing that you can't really give guidance for 2015 at least today, just want to get a
sense for how sustainable you can keep this operating margin level and to what extent you think you can kind of grow
from that new level? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yeah, thanks for the question, Matt. It's Bob. That's an important question for us to
address tomorrow, and we look forward to addressing it head-on. As you pointed out, we benefited from an improved
profitability at Enbrel, but also from ongoing expense discipline across the rest of the business, and we'll have lots more
to say about that when we get together tomorrow.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a two-parter on Enbrel. So
first, in the slides you give price in inventory. And if you look at inventory, I know you called out the $60 million
headwind that you faced this quarter, it looks like it was about – by your slide, about $110 million. So would you
expect some inventory to reverse in the fourth quarter?
And then the second is, you've taken two 7% price increases this year, and yet you only showed about 1%
year-over-year price bump. Is that because you give most of the price back in terms of the contract? Or could you just
talk a little bit about that, too? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure. Matt, why don't we ask Tony to address those two questions. Go ahead, Tony.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Matt, the two questions. First of all, you're correct. We actually entered the quarter
carrying about $60 million. Inventory sort of is fairly normal during the week, but months and quarters tend to land in
different places in that week, which causes some shifting up and down. But in addition to the $60 million that we
carried into the quarter that we had to burn off, we actually closed the quarter at an unusually low level of inventory,
with about $40 million reduced inventory. So that $100 million will correctly flow into the fourth quarter.
And in the price number that you've seen from the third quarter, there's a lot ins and outs in this calculation. And I don't
think you can take this as a true reflection as the net impact of price that we're applying in the marketplace.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Marvin, let's take the next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mohit Bansal>: Great. Congratulations. This is Mohit Bansal for Robyn Karnauskas. Thanks for taking my
question and congratulations on a good quarter. My question is regarding Enbrel. So given that the recent launch of
OTEZLA in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, are you seeing any impact on Enbrel's sales there in the derm space?
And then you talked about geographical mix bringing up the tax rate. So just wanted to get some sense of how should
we think about it in the future? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. I think there are two separate questions there. We'll ask David, obviously, to
address the second. Tony, if you want to tackle the first?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Okay. So the product you're talking about was launched into psoriasis in late September.
So the actual data we have available is fairly light at the moment. I would assume that the fourth quarter will show a bit
more robust data around prescriptions. Net-net for the third quarter we don't see any reduction in the number of new
naïve patients going on to injectable biologics for psoriasis, and we also don't see dramatic change in the trend of our
market share. David?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. In terms of tax rate, so as I mentioned, I think you understood why we took the rate up
here in the quarter, and what's going to happen now is we'll look out and I think best address tomorrow – I've got a
piece where I'll talk about how to think about taxes going forward – and what are the key drivers of that. So if you don't
mind I'm going to take it up with you in the morning.
<Q - Mohit Bansal>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Yeah.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Looking forward to [ph] the free buffet
(15:47) tomorrow. I had a question for Tony. On NEUPOGEN, would it be possible to, in the U.S. for you to please
give us the unit share, that NEUPOGEN still enjoys of the short acting G-CSF market? And I noticed on that slide, the
impact of price on a year-on-year basis is not in the slide. What happened to price on a year-on-year basis? Thank you.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Mark, price of NEUPOGEN year-on-year is negligible. That's why it's not actually listed.
And in regards market share from a total [ph] progression (16:25) portfolio, we still hold just over 98% of the market.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: And short-acting?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: I'll have to get you that number, but the actual market share hasn't changed dramatically
versus the second quarter.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: All right. See you tomorrow. Thank you.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Okay. Sure.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: I had a follow-up question on NEUPOGEN as it relates to your last – I guess, as you are seeing
some competitive impacts you noted that in your slides on the short-acting. How would that be different, if at all, for

Neulasta? And what actually happens in terms of losing share is that a price issue? Is that just conceding some share?
What exactly is going on there and how does that relate to any risks from Neulasta in the future? Thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So I'm not quite sure of the details of your question, but obviously we are seeing Neulasta
continue the trend it's had for the last couple of quarters. We see little to no impact from the recently launched,
short-acting GRANIX. As you know we do have a long-acting competitor in Europe, and we've seen a fairly small
impact from them over the last year or so.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a couple. First one is, you guys had a decent quarter
sales for EPOGEN and its growth was primarily driven by price. So I was wondering if you can talk about the pricing
trend in that market. And then do you expect any competition to come in 2015 in U.S. or not?
Then I have a second question for maybe Sean. Have you guys looked at any post-talk analysis of cardiovascular events
in the [ph] heart (18:13) trial?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Okay. So let me respond to your questions. As regards price, obviously, we don't give any
forward guidance on price. We did take a 4.9% price increase on EPOGEN in May this year. And based on the
contracts we have some of that flow through. As regards competition, as you know, Mircera have the right to enter the
market effective July 2014, and we do lose patent in May of 2015.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: And regarding the analysis of the cardiovascular events in the Phase 3 studies, these analyses
are performed in some of the longer term exposure studies. And those are actually published in the literature. There's a
paper in circulation where you see about half the rate of cardiovascular events in the evolocumab arm versus the
placebo-controlled arm. I just caution interpretation around these very small numbers of events. It's extremely difficult
to know whether these are play of chance or a real drug effect. I would just remind you that the numbers of events that
are necessary generally to evaluate this thing is in the thousands of events versus double-digit numbers of events.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great. Nice quarter and also thanks for taking my question. So, Sean, it's a question for you
or I don't know if Tony wants to pick it up. Relating to evolocumab, so your Phase 3 actually hit the end point using the
[ph] EMA (20:00) definition of statin intolerance. Regeneron's compound missed using the U.S. definition, but at this
point you guys haven't completed your Phase 3 using the FDA definition of statin intolerance. And so my question
really has to do with, do you think that you can get approved in the U.S. before that data is generated? Thank you.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah. I think, first of all, it's – there has been discussion by companies in the space, the
European and the U.S. regulators, but I would not want you to think that there are a clear guidances or definitions
around this coming from the regulatory agencies. In fact, they are expressing to us the clear sense that they don't know
exactly how to define this population, how to study it. What the study designs that would be necessary to actually get
the specific language around statin intolerance. And it's unclear whether such language is necessary. For example, one
could define high-risk individuals who have not reached LDL treatment goals despite the use of available therapy. That
would cover statin-intolerant patients and non-statin intolerant patients. So it's a very difficult area.
We obviously are exploring different ways of studying this problem so that we can eventually describe those data
hopefully in our labeling. But it's not as clear a set of guidelines from the regulators as it might appear on first blush.

Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So we know Sandoz filed for approval of a biosimilar
version of NEUPOGEN this summer. Our team has done some work that suggests additional patents beyond the
composition of matter patent could be fairly significant impediments here in the U.S. to the first biosimilars just given
potential delays for litigation appeals. So just remind – I just want to know if you can remind us if you guys have any
additional patents beyond composition for NEUPOGEN and Neulasta and if we should place any weight on those
patents to potentially delay biosimilar entrants? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: I know there's been a lot of discussion of that recently in the investment community. And
again it's something that we'll talk about tomorrow, but I think as you're aware, we and Sandoz are litigating one
intellectual property issue now that relates to your question. And so we'll have an answer from the courts at some point
on important piece of the question that you're asking. And generally we expect that we will face competition for
NEUPOGEN through time on the biosimilar pathway in the U.S. And we also expect that you'll start to see some
challenges for the long-acting Neulasta product, as well in the U.S. probably at some point in 2016.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Marvin, before you move on to the next question, I just wanted to respond to Michael Yee's
question about the market share or about the segment share for Neulasta. So on a sequential basis we actually gained
about a percentage point and also on a year-over-year basis, we gained about a percentage point in terms of unit share
on Neulasta. Let's take the next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.
<Q - Eun K. Yang>: Thank you. A question on Kyprolis. So based on our discussions with the physicians, Kyprolis is
being used off-label beyond relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. So with positive interim ASPIRE data, do you
expect to see increases in sales in the next couple of quarters? Or do you think medical community is waiting for
overall survival data? Thank you.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So, this is Tony. As you know, the data is quite sparse. So what we do is we do about
1,000 chart orders and then we do an extrapolation each quarter to determine the market shares.
As I look at quarter 3, we saw a distinctive increase in our market share in third line. We also saw an increase in our
market share in fourth line plus. We have not seen a dramatic change in any second line usage at this particular stage.
We will be presenting the data at ASH. I think the publication would be – the ASH data will be public on about the 6th
of November.
<A>: That's right.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: And [] that study we'll (24:42) see what happens, but we haven't seen any dramatic change
in the marketplace to date, no.

Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Hoping you can help, I guess, elucidate the extent to
which in relevant territories your own internal projections have been able to accurately project biosimilar impact. And
then how confident are you that your internal projections, whatever they may be going forward for biosimilar erosion
of your mature franchise is really to capture the likely effect?

<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So let me try and respond. Obviously, there has never been a historical situation in the
U.S. where we can actually model anything on. The competition we have at the moment against NEUPOGEN and of
course not a biosimilar competition. We have, however, in Europe looked with the last five years, seven years a large
amount of biosimilar competition. And we have modeled Europe and worked successfully to defend our business in
Europe for the last five years, seven years. So we've done a combination of modeling Europe as a totality. We're taking
countries inside Europe that is best as possible would potentially emulate practices or behaviors in the U.S. and we use
those models to create our long-range plans. Obviously, these are our best assumptions at present, and only time will
tell in terms of where the market will actually go.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: I think, as well, Josh, what I'd add is if you look at the big picture, we have said that
reliably, safely supplying biosimilars is not something that can be taken for granted and if you look at the experience in
Europe, you see several suppliers have struggled to fulfill different tenders that they've won through time. So the
barriers to entry, the challenges of safely supplying the marketplace with biosimilars has proven a challenge and that's
reflected in how we see marketplace competition evolving. I suspect that as we get into more biologics going off patent
and more complex molecules, we'll continue to see that be an issue.
But generally, with the benefit of more than a handful of competitors, over more than a handful of years in a number of
markets in Europe, the competition has been fairly predictable both from a pricing and share standpoint.
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Got it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. So your last – you had a very strong quarter, but also managed a slight
impact by competition. Does that mean that there's some inventory buildup? Can you talk in general whether there's
some meaningful or significant inventory changes quarter-over-quarter for all the products?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So, for Neulasta there was a slight decline in inventory in fact, in the quarter. As you
know, Neulasta's clearly aligned to the number of myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens that take place in a
quarter. We have not seen a dramatic increase or decrease of those regimens that take place, Howard, at the moment.
So I don't think there's much inventory flow. You have maybe 20 million, 30 million that will flow into next quarter,
but the usage has not been impacted by Granix, and we continue to get long-acting usage in all the accounts we have at
the moment.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: So, Marvin, what I'm thinking is so we can get back to preparing for our business review and
have a more fulsome discussion tomorrow, why don't we take just two last questions.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for letting me jump in with a question. I just wanted to follow-up
with Tony, and perhaps for David. Tony, could you break out price by U.S. and ex-U.S.? You gave us the net, which
was very helpful, but just give us the trends there?
And then, David, could you just talk about currency effects during the quarter? And what we should be expecting for
the next couple quarters, presuming that things stay where they are? Thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Geoff, sorry. This is price in total, or price specific on the product?
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Just in aggregate for Europe versus or ex-U.S. versus the U.S. would be helpful.

<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Okay. So we deal only with price decreases outside the United States, right? So there are
continuous challenges around price in Europe and in Japan. Even though we don't have any [ph] business (29:10) there
yet, but the price increases are predominantly in the U.S., and not outside the U.S.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Okay. Thank you. And then the currency, David?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. Yeah. On currency, well first of all, as you would know we have a fairly limited
exposure right now as a company to currency movements, given the profile of the business. Secondly, the company has
a rolling hedge program, so we have quite an extensive portfolio against any of the traded currencies where there's a
forward market. And as a consequence, you don't see any impact this quarter in our results due to foreign exchange
movements, because they were all set by the hedge portfolio.
And then if you look into next quarter, it's around $0.02 of share negative, which is incorporated in the updated
guidance.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Terrific. Thanks very much.
<A>: Sure.

Our last question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Thanks for letting me slide in here. Just a question back on Kyprolis. So just noticing even
if you back out inventory in the other effects, the unit growth, it looks like you had really the strongest sequential
growth since around the beginning of the launch. And I know ASPIRE was just top-line, but can you just kind of –
what do you ascribe that reacceleration to generally? If you can maybe give a little bit more color on that, that would be
great.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Well, let me spend a few minutes there. The quarter-on-quarter growth was $16 million.
$10 million of that is U.S., and $6 million is outside the U.S. As you know outside the U.S. we are getting some
pre-approval sales in Europe and in Turkey, and we had the product approved in both Israel and Argentina, so $10
million growth in the U.S and $6 million outside the U.S. The $10 million in the U.S. is about a 13% growth, as I said
predominantly growing in third line and fourth line plus.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Okay.
Arvind K. Sood
Excellent. Thanks for that, Tony. I also want to thank all of you for your participation in our call this afternoon and
