Thanks, Nancy. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. We have a lot of news to share with you today about the
details of our March quarter as well as a significant increase to our capital return program.
First, I'd like to talk about our business and the road ahead. We're now halfway through our fiscal 2013 and we've
accomplished a tremendous amount. We've introduced and ramped production of an unprecedented number of new
products and we've set many new sales records. Our revenue for the first half was over $98 billion and our net income
was over $22 billion.
During that time we sold 85 million iPhones and 42 million iPads. These are very, very large numbers, unimaginable
even to us just a few years ago. Despite producing results that met or beat our guidance as we have done consistently
we know they didn't meet everyone's expectations. And though we've achieved incredible scale and financial success
we acknowledge that our growth rate has slowed and our margins have decreased from the exceptionally high level we
experienced in 2012.
Our revenues grew about $13 billion in the first half of this fiscal year. Even though that's like adding the total first half
revenue of five Fortune 500 companies, our average weekly growth slowed to 19% and our gross margins are closer to
the levels of a few years ago.
Our fiscal 2012 results were incredibly strong and that's making comparisons very difficult this year. Last year, our
business benefited from both high growth in demand for our products and a corresponding growth in channel
inventories along with a richer mix of higher gross margin products, a more favorable foreign currency environment
and historically low costs.
These compares are made further challenging until we anniversary the launch of the iPad mini, which as you know, we
strategically priced at a lower margin. As Peter will discuss we are guiding to flat revenues year-over-year for the June
quarter along with a slight sequential decline in gross margins.
The decline in Apple's stock price over the last couple of quarters has been very frustrating to all of us. But Apple
remains very strong and we will continue to do what we do best. We can't control items such as exchange rates and
world economies and even certain cost pressures but the most important objective for Apple will always be creating
innovative products and that is directly within our control.
We will continue to focus on the long-term and we remain very optimistic about our future. We're participating in large
and growing markets. We see great opportunities in front of us, particularly given the long-term prospects of the
smartphone and tablet markets, the strength of our incredible ecosystem which we plan to continue to augment with
new services, our plans for expanded distribution and the potential of exciting new product categories.
Take the smartphone market for example. IDC estimates that this market will double between 2012 and 2016 to an
incredible 1.4 billion units annually. And Gartner estimates that the tablet market is growing at an even faster rate from
125 million units in 2012 to a projected 375 million by 2016.
Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software and services that we can't wait to introduce this
fall and throughout 2014. We continue to be very confident in our future product plans.
Apple has many distinct and unique advantages as the only company in the industry with world-class skills in
hardware, software and services. We have the strongest ecosystem in the industry with app stores in 155 countries,
iTunes music stores in 119 countries, hundreds of millions of iCloud users around the world and most importantly, the
highest loyalty and customer satisfaction rates in the business. And of course, we have a tremendous culture of
innovation with a relentless focus on making the world's best products that change peoples' lives. This is the same
culture and company that brought the world the iPhone and the iPad and we've got a lot more surprises in the works.
A little over a year ago we announced a plan to return $45 billion to shareholders over three years. Since we began
paying dividends last August and began share buybacks last October we've already returned $10 billion under that
program. But we continue to generate cash in excess of our needs to operate the business, invest in our future and
maintain flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities. We remain firmly committed to our objective of
delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both our business performance and the return of capital.

So today, we are announcing an aggressive plan that more than doubles the size of the capital return program we
announced last year to a total of $100 billion by the end of calendar year 2015. The vast majority of our incremental
cash return will be in the form of share repurchases. As the board and management team deliberated among the various
alternatives of returning cash we concluded that investing in Apple was the best. In addition to share repurchases we
are increasing our current dividend by 15% to further appeal to investors seeking yield. And as part of our updated
program we will access the debt markets. Peter will provide more details about all of this in a moment.
We appreciate the input that so many of our shareholders have provided us on how best to deploy our cash. We will
review our cash allocation strategy each year and we will continue to invest confidently in the business to bring great
new products to market, strategically deploy capital in our supply chain, our retail stores and our infrastructure and
make acquisitions to expand our capabilities. We will be disciplined in what we do but we will not under-invest.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the details of the March quarter. Peter?
Peter Oppenheimer
Thank you, Tim.
We are pleased to report the results of our second fiscal quarter. We established new March quarter records for iPhone
and iPad sales and new all-time record for iTunes sales, leading to Apple's strongest March quarter revenue ever.
Revenue for the quarter was $43.6 billion compared to $39.2 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of $4.4 billion
or 11% and $600 million over the high end of our guidance range.
The year-over-year revenue increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPad and iTunes sales as well as
continued strong revenue from iPhone and Mac. Operating margin was $12.6 billion representing 28.8% of revenue.
Net income was $9.5 billion, translated to diluted earnings per share of $10.09.
As for the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We sold 37.4 million iPhones compared to 35.1 million
in the year ago quarter, an increase of over 2.3 million or 7%. We ended the quarter with about 11.6 million total
iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1 million iPhones and we ended the quarter within our
target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory.
Based on research published earlier this month by comScore iPhone garnered the number one spot in the U.S.
smartphone market for the three-month period ended in February with 39% share, up from 35% in the previous survey
period. And in Japan, IDC Japan announced that iPhone gained the number one position for all of calendar year 2012 as
well as for calendar Q4 2012 in both handsets and smartphones.
This is also the first time a non-Japanese company has achieved the number one spot for an entire year. In addition,
Apple is ranked number one in Nikkei's 2013 Japan brand survey, achieving the top spot for the second year in a row
which is unprecedented for a non-Japanese company.
Around the world, based on its latest published estimates, IDC ranked iPhone number one or two in smartphone sales
in over half the countries IDC tracks. A recent study by Kantar measured a 95% loyalty rate among iPhone owners,
substantially higher than the competition and iPhone remains top in customer experience. Last month, we were very
pleased to receive the number-one ranking in smartphone customer satisfaction from J.D. Power 7 Associates for the
ninth consecutive time.
Businesses around the world continue to scale iPhone across their workforces. Globally, nearly 30,000 companies are
developing and distributing iOS apps for corporate use by their employees. Cisco's bring your own device program
across 80 countries has resulted in a 50% increase in the number of iPhones connecting to its corporate network in the
past year.
GlaxoSmithKline has developed more than 50 in-house iOS apps to support the thousands of iPhones and iPads
connecting to its corporate network. Other companies such as AXA, Nordstrom's, Eaton Corporation and Takeda

Pharmaceuticals are supporting thousands of iPhones and are continually adding new in-house apps to better serve
customers and help employees work more efficiently.
Turning to iPad, we were thrilled to sell 19.5 million iPads during the quarter, compared to 11.8 million in the year-ago
quarter. That's an increase of 7.7 million units or 65%. iPad experienced very strong year-over-year growth in every
operating segment, particularly in greater China and Japan where sales more than doubled year-over-year.
Both iPad and iPad mini continue to be extremely popular and we were pleased with sales of both. We were able to sell
significantly more iPad minis in the March quarter, than in the December launch quarter, and to expand availability into
China. Customers love the combination of experience, performance and size that iPad mini offers and our early market
research indicates that the overwhelming majority of iPad mini purchasers are first-time iPad customers.
We ended the quarter with about 4.8 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.4 million. All
of the sequential increase was attributable to iPad mini. As we discussed previously, we were not able to meet demand
for iPad mini in the December quarter and entered the March quarter below our target range of channel inventory. This
sequential increase places us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of total iPad channel inventory.
The most recent survey published by ChangeWave indicated a 96% satisfaction rate among iPad customers. Not only is
iPad a huge hit among consumers, but it also continues to be widely adopted by business customers as well. iPad and
the iOS ecosystem are driving innovation across industries and in companies, large and small. We are delighted by the
number of companies that are choosing iPad for their most important business tasks, as well as the rapid adoption of
iPad in emerging countries around the world.
Doctors at the Colombia Cardiovascular Foundation in South America are using an in-house app to perform remote
diagnostics for patients in inaccessible parts of the country. First National Bank, the oldest bank in South Africa, has
issued iPads to wealth managers to help enhance customer relationships and interactions. And in the education market,
Grupo Santillana has developed Uno Internacional, an integrated educational system that uses iPads to create
digital-learning environments in more than 700 private K-to-12 schools in Latin America. Uno Internacional has
deployed more than 60,000 iPads to schools in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil, including 17,000 iPads for teachers and
students in Brazil in the March quarter alone.
Turning to Mac, we sold just under 4 million Macs, which is a 2% decline from the year-ago quarter. IDC estimates
that the global personal computer market contracted by 14% during the March quarter. We experienced strong
year-over-year growth in desktop sales following the December quarter launch of our stunning new iMacs, offset by a
decline in portable sales given a weaker personal computer market overall. We ended the quarter within our 4 to 5
week target range of back-channel inventory.
Moving to iPod, we sold 5.6 million iPods compared to 7.7 million in the year ago quarter. IPod Touch continues to
count for over half of all iPods sold during the March quarter. IPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over
70% in the March quarter based on the latest data published by NPD and iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3
player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK.
The Apple ecosystem continues to grow and thrive and we believe it's a very important driver of our incredibly strong
customer satisfaction and retention as well developer interest and success. This Sunday marks the 10th anniversary of
the introduction of the iTunes Music Store which revolutionized the distribution of digital content. Today, our iTunes
stores offer the broadest combination of geographic reach and content depth in the industry and they surpassed
quarterly billings of $4 billion for the first time ever in the March quarter. That's a $16 billion annual run rate making
our digital content stores the largest in the world.
The quarter's iTunes billings translated to record quarterly iTunes revenue of $2.4 billion, up 28% from the year ago
March quarter with new quarterly revenue records for music, movies and apps. The strong iTunes sales, in addition to
other service revenue, helped us achieve for the first time more than $4 billion in combined quarterly revenue from
iTunes, software and services. We are thrilled with the growth of these revenue streams.

Today, we have music stores in 119 countries offering a combined catalog of 35 million songs. We sell movies in 109
countries offering 60,000 titles and we have iBook stores in 155 countries offering 1.75 million iBooks for sale. And
with app stores in 155 countries that encompass almost 90% of the world's population our developers have created
more than 850,000 iOS apps including 350,000 apps made for iPad.
Cumulative app downloads have surpassed 45 billion and app developers have made over $9 billion for their sales
through the app store including $4.5 billion in the most recent four quarters alone. Analysis estimates that sales from
our app store accounted for 74% of all app sales worldwide in the March quarter. We believe this is in large part due to
the great development environment, broad distribution, large and active user base and seamless integration that the iOS
platform offers.
Developers such as Backflip Studios have seen explosive growth in their business thanks to the success of their apps on
the iOS platform. With 70 people, this company maintains a growing suite of titles that has seen over 275 million
downloads equating to nearly 5 million daily active users and 34 million monthly active users. With annual app store
sales approaching $100 million, Backflip's iOS sales comprised approximately 95% of the company's revenues in 2012.
Another tremendous success story is Supercell founded in 2010. Based in Finland, Supercell's Hay Day and Clash of
Clans titles, available only on iOS, have been the top grossing iPad games in over 60 countries helping the company
generate $8.5 million in revenue per employee in 2012.
And in the enterprise, iOS devices had a strong lead over Android. In its most recently published quarterly enterprise
device activations report, Good Technologies found that iOS devices accounted for 77% of all activations by its
corporate customers. And thanks to careful app store curation for the quality of apps, the iOS platform provides a much
more secure environment. Recently research by McAfee Labs found that 97% of identified mobile malware was on the
Android platform with the remainder primarily on the Symbian and Java ME platforms.
But perhaps the most important measure of the success of our ecosystem is how engaged our customers are with our
products and services. In its most recently published update, Chitika found that iPad accounted for 82% of all North
American tablet web traffic in March. Interest in apps remains strong in the March quarter with over 800 apps
downloaded per second and year-over-year iOS app revenue more than doubling in the quarter.
And since launching iCloud just 18 months ago we now have 300 million people using it every day. We will continue
to invest in the ecosystem and have some great new features and capabilities in the pipeline.
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue for the quarter was $5.2 billion compared to $4.4 billion in the
year ago quarter, an increase of 19%. This growth was fueled primarily by strong sales of iPhone and iPad. We ended
the quarter with a total of 402 stores including 151 outside the United States. We expect to open about 30 new stores in
total in fiscal 2013 and to complete at least 20 store remodels.
With an average of 401 stores open in the March quarter average revenue per store was $13.1 million compared to
$12.2 million in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.1 billion. We hosted 91 million visitors to our
stores during the quarter compared to 85 million in the year ago quarter. That translates to 17.5 thousand visitors per
store per week. Total company gross margin was 37.5% which was at the low end of our guidance range of 37.5% to
38.5%. Operating expenses were $3.8 billion and included $488 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E
was $347 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%.
And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $144.7 billion in cash plus short-term and long-term marketable
securities compared to $137.1 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $7.6 billion. Over
$102 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the March quarter and cash flow from operations was $12.5
billion.
We paid $2.5 billion in dividends in the March quarter and earlier this month we concluded the $1.95 billion
accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in the December quarter resulting in cumulative retirement of
over 4 million shares of Apple stock.

As Tim discussed, we are pleased to announce that we are more than doubling our return of capital program to $100
billion by the end of calendar year 2015 which translates to an average of about $30 billion per year. We will continue
to turn capital to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and cash used to net share settle vesting RSUs. To
facilitate our program we will access the debt markets. Let me provide more details regarding the three key elements of
our plans.
First, our board has increased the share buyback authorization to $60 billion from the original $10 billion announced
last year. That's a $50 billion increase. This is the largest share buyback authorization of any company in history. We
are very confident in Apple's future and believe so strongly that repurchasing our shares represents an attractive use of
our capital that we have dedicated the vast majority of the increase in our capital return program to share repurchases.
We will buy shares under this authorization beginning this month. We will also continue to net share settle employee
RSUs as they vest and expect to use about $1 billion of cash annually to do this.
Second, we are increasing our quarterly dividend from $2.65 to $3.05 per share, a 15% increase. We plan to review our
quarterly dividend payment annually. Our board of directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share
payable on May 16, 2013 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 13, 2013. We are very proud that
Apple is among the largest dividend payers in the world with annual payments of about $11 billion.
Third, we will access the U.S. debt markets over time and have recently secured credit ratings from S&P and Moody's.
We are continuing to generate significant cash offshore and repatriating this cash will result in significant tax
consequences under current U.S. tax law. Incorporating debt into our capital structure will provide several benefits
including access to attractively priced capital, a reduction in our overall cost of capital and an efficient leverage of our
very strong balance sheet.
We expect to fund the capital return program from existing domestic cash, future cash generated in the U.S. and from
borrowing in the U.S. We will maintain sufficient domestic liquidity to grow the business and execute capital
expenditures and acquisitions. The program announced today will result in returning an average of $30 billion annually
to shareholders. To put this in perspective, the $30 billion would have represented substantially all of our fiscal year
2012 fully tax free cash flow had we repatriated our foreign earnings. Between now and the end of calendar year 2015
we would expect both our foreign cash and our domestic borrowing to grow. We will continue to review each element
of our capital return program on an annual basis.
In conclusion, our capital return program is designed to facilitate our objective of delivering attractive returns to our
shareholders on an efficient basis while maintaining the flexibility to invest in the incredible opportunities that we
continue to see for our business.
Now, as we move ahead into the June quarter I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of
forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
We expect revenue to be between $33.5 billion and $35.5 billion compared to $35 billion in the year ago quarter. We
expect gross margin to be between 36% and 37% reflecting approximately $90 billion related to stock-based
compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $3.85 billion and $3.95 billion including about $500 million
related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about
26%.
In closing, we're pleased with our record March quarter revenue and record March quarter iPhone and iPad sales. We're
very proud of the breadth and depth of our tremendous ecosystem and our new all-time record for iTunes sales. We are
also in the fortunate position to be able to more than double our return of capital program to $100 billion with the
largest share repurchase authorization in history and to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world with annual
payments of about $11 billion. We remain very confident in our product pipeline.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.

Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Operator, may we have the first
question, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] First we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Peter, given gross margin did come in at the low of guidance this
quarter and you're looking for another downtick in June, can you just rank for us the biggest factors that are limiting the
margin recovery even as I assume costs are coming down for the new products? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. In the March quarter our gross margin was 37.5%, at the low-end of our range. We
had a few items that on balance resulted in us reporting at the low end. They included: mix, in particular, selling more
iPads that we had planned including getting iPad mini into our four to six week channel inventory range; some changes
in our service policies that required us to make provisions for prior quarter sales; and we had some unfavorable
adjustments.
As I look forward to the June quarter we're guiding gross margin to be down between 50 and 150 basis points
sequentially. We see two factors impacting gross margin sequentially. First and the largest of the two is the loss of
leverage on sequentially lower revenue and second a different product mix. We expect both of these headwinds to be
partially offset by better costs in the quarter.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay. Thank you and, Tim, a question for you on China. Growth did slow in that market to
single digits this quarter. Curious your perspective as to whether Apple's hitting a wall given you don't have the largest
carrier formally selling your products and then just any thoughts around the stickiness of customers in China given you
don't have an iTunes store there and data shows that they download fewer apps than in developed countries? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Katy, thanks for the question. We actually had our best quarter ever in greater China. So it
was a record for us. The revenue came in at $8.8 billion. That includes our retail stores that are in that region. That's up
11% year-on-year. Again that includes our retail stores that are in that region which is the same as Apple is growing.
The highlights for the quarter in China were that iPads grew 138% year-on-year and we set new records for
sell-through for iPhone and iPad during the quarter. There were some significant year-over-year timing differences with
regard to channel inventory relative to iPhone that affected the compares year-over-year.
In particular, in the year-ago quarter we increased iPhone channel inventories globally by 2.6 million, as you probably
recall. 1.6 of the 2.6 occurred in greater China to support the launches that were in the March quarter of last year. And
so if you look at revenue on a sell-through basis, greater China revenue was actually up approximately 18%. And so it's
a bit better than it first looks. As I said, in the year ago quarter we launched the iPhone 4S with China Unicom in
January and we launched China telecom in March. This year the iPhone 5 launched in December and so it's a very
different set of dynamics on a year-on-year basis.
Going forward we still see a significant opportunity in China. It's a great market. We have 11 stores there. We expect to
double those in less than two years. We have added about 8,000 iPhone point of sales in the indirect channel to about
19,000 today and we obviously have a plan to add more and further grow our distribution. This number is obviously too
low currently. We're also innovating with our online store there and adding different functionality to the store.
China has an unusually large number of potential first-time smartphone buyers and that's not lost on us. We've seen a
significant interest in iPhone 4 there and have recently made it even more affordable to make it even more attractive to
those first-time buyers. And so we're hopeful that that will help iPhone sales in the future.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thank you.

<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Goldman Sachs we'll go to Bill Shope.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Thanks. Tim, you mentioned several factors that were compressing growth and gross
margins in recent quarters and this year. Can you comment a bit more on the competitive landscape in 2013 verses
2012? How has it surprised you and what do you think the company needs to do to reinvigorate your share gains across
your key product categories?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Bill, I think the smartphone market has always been competitive. The names have been
changed – the names of competitors have changed. In the beginning RIM was the very – the strongest player because
the smartphone as you know really got going in the enterprise area. And of course today our top competitor from a
hardware point of view would be Samsung and married to Google on the operating system side.
They're obviously tough competitors but we feel that we have the best products by far and we are continuing to invest
in innovative products and feel really, really confident about our product pipeline in both hardware, software and also
services. We have the best ecosystem by far. And we're just going to keep augmenting it and making it better and
better. And that shows up in both our loyalty ratings and our customer sat. And so I feel very good about our
competitive position.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: One more question if I may. Can you comment on how you're thinking about the pace of your
buyback program and what factors are you going to consider to determine purchase timing over the next few years?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. Bill, it's Peter. I'll take that. We're going to begin buying shares under the
authorization beginning this month. We expect to utilize the remaining $58 billion under the authorization by the end of
calendar year 2015, which spans 32 months from now. We expect to use accelerating share repurchase programs and to
buy in the open market.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?

From UBS we'll go to Steve Milunovich.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you very much. Tim, you alluded to fall announcements of products. Is that
indicating that there may not be substantial new products until literally fall – late September which means the
September quarter could look a lot like the June quarter? Is that part of what you're implying or were you just being
more general?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I don't want to be more specific but I'm just saying we've got some really great stuff coming
in the fall and across all of 2014.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Okay. And then could you talk a bit about the supply chain? There's been some concern
with the some of the product limitations late last year. I mean it's got to be getting so huge relative to what you used to
run. What's your confidence level in the supply chain, particularly as you're potentially moving to new types of vendors
over time as the units continue to increase?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I have incredible confidence. We exited the March quarter with no shortages while achieving
inventory turns of over 90, which is still to this day staggering for our industry. The December quarter that you are
referring to was the largest quarter ever in the history of Apple and the technology industry as a whole. And as you

know it included for us a number of new products, an unprecedented number, and of new product ramps. The reality is
the work we do to produce truly innovative products is very hard and there have always been challenges I'm sure we
will face in the future. However, I would assure you we are working very closely with our manufacturing partners to
execute what we feel is a very exciting roadmap.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Sanford Bernstein we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yeah, thank you. I wanted to revisit the gross margin question and specifically, I was
hoping you could comment on whether you feel you're experiencing the normal kinds of experience curves or declining
cost curves that you do in typical product ramps, and whether you can comment on the sequential decline in iPhone
ASPs, which were down nearly $30 sequentially. I presume that reflects a mix of 4 and 4S relative to the 5, but perhaps
you can confirm that and what its impact might have on gross margins and how we should think about that? And then I
have a follow-up please.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Toni, it's Peter. I'll take your first two. We are very pleased with the progress we are
making on getting down cost curves, and this will help to partially offset the loss of leverage and the different product
mix that we expect to see in the June quarter. And we have factored these cost improvements into the guidance we're
providing for the quarter.
The iPhone ASPs were down sequentially about $28 as you noted, and this was driven primarily by mix. The largest
factors were an increase in the iPhone 4 mix which resulted from our making the iPhone 4 more affordable in many
markets and also, mix within the iPhone 5 as it was in its second full quarter.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: And its impact on margins? How do we think about relative margins for 4 relative to 5 on
balance?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Toni, we don't provide margins by product or within product lines. But I talked about two
factors that were impacting gross margin on a sequential basis. The first is leverage, and that's the largest of the two on
the lower sequential revenue. But we also expect to see a different product mix, and that's primarily related to iPhone.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Okay.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Toni, just one other point on that. As you get further – you see this on most of our product
lines. As you get further from a previous product launch, there is a general within a line, a general lower mix than
where it starts. And so you'd – all things being equal you'd expect to see that on most of our products.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Okay. Thank you. Tim, I wanted to follow-up with you on a statement you made in a
previous response. You talked earlier about how you were excited about the large addressable markets you have,
particularly the smartphone and tablet marketplaces. And you talked about how strongly and confidently you feel about
competitive advantages in your products and ecosystems. If I step back and look at the data for this quarter on the
phone side, if I adjust for inventory, the iPhone was up very low to mid-single digits. I think most third-party market
data would say that the smartphone market probably grew about 30%.
If I look broadly, incorporating your guidance for next quarter and thinking about fiscal Q1, it appears very unlikely
that Apple will grow at that market rate of 30% or more. So I'm wondering if you could comment on: A, whether that
ostensible loss in market share is something that Apple is focused on or cares about as a principal financial objective?
And if so, why do you think there is this disconnect between the very attractive products that you are offering and the
market data that I just cited?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: So, Toni, let me try to address. You mentioned both smartphones and tablet so let me try to
address both of those.

First, let me start with the tablet side. The numbers that we've seen from IDC would indicate that they believe the
market in March declined by 30% from December, December being obviously a seasonally high quarter with a holiday.
As you can see from our numbers we declined 15%. And so if that holds, we did much better than the market and had a
very nice pick up in market share. And obviously on iPad, we continue to have an ecosystem story that is unparalleled.
We have 350,000 apps that are optimized for iPad versus a few hundred for our competition and the overall experience
in the fit and finish of the product, I think you would agree, is substantially better than the options there.
On the phone side, the numbers that you talked about, the sell-in comparisons year-over-year you really have to convert
that to sell-through to look at the underlying demand and as I've gone through before, we did grow channel inventory in
the year-ago quarter because we were catching up on the rollout of the iPhone 4S. In fact we grew it by 2.6 million. So
you have to factor in to get at the real sell-through. However, I take your point if the market did grow by 30%, we still
after that normalization we grew less than that.
And so I think the question or the point is not lost and we do want to grow faster. We don't view it however as the only
measure of our health. The things that are very important to us in addition to market share and unit volumes include
things like: customer sat, which were the highest by far with winning J.D. Power nine times consecutively; the
customer loyalty and repurchase rates which were the highest by far, the 95% according to Kantar; and the ecosystem
commerce which attracts developers is incredible. Canalys says that we have 74%, so basically $3 out of $4 that are
spent on apps are spent in our ecosystem. And if you then look at usage statistics, they're staggering at the usage of iOS
versus other operating systems.
And so market share is important and unit volumes are important but these other things for us are extremely important
because we're all about customer experience and enriching lives. Now that said, we see an enormous number of
first-time smartphone buyers coming to market, particularly in certain countries around the world. And so what we've
done with that and we started last quarter is we've made the iPhone 4 even more affordable, and which has made it
more attractive to first-time buyers and we caught up on the supply – call it demand toward the – late in the quarter last
quarter and we're continuing to do that in other markets and we believe that the phone for the price point that we're
offering it is an incredible value for people that allows them to get into the ecosystem with a really, really phenomenal
product.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Barclays we'll go to Ben Reitzes.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Tim and Peter, can you comment on gross margin beyond next
quarter? Maybe – what does it say about long-term gross margins if 36% to 37% is the margin that you're calling for
when your highest margin product, let's hope is at a trough for the year? And I think you are implying that when you
say all these new products are coming in the fall. So, is there an implied margin philosophy here with this 2Q guide,
that 36% is as low as you want it to get and that maybe it gets better from there, or is there nothing that we should
imply in terms of how the company views gross margins?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Ben, it's Peter. I will start on that one. It has been our long-term practice – we're not
providing specific gross margin guidance beyond the June quarter. We don't do this because there are many factors that
can influence gross margins in a specific quarter and cause them to vary widely over time, including product cycles,
commodity markets, product mix and currencies.
So while we don't want to make a forecast beyond June, let me tell you how we think about gross margin and hopefully
this will help. We are managing the business for the long term and are willing to trade off short-term profits where we
see long-term potential. The iPod is a great example of this. When we launched it in 2001, its margins were
significantly below the margins of Apple at that time. Four years later, the iPod and the iTunes music store comprised
half of Apple's revenues and inspired us to build the iPhone.

Now the iPad mini, is another great example. We have priced it aggressively and its margins are significantly below the
corporate average. However, we believe deeply in the long-term potential of the tablet market and think that we've
made a great strategic decision. We will only make great products, and this precludes us from making cheap products
that don't deliver a great experience. We believe deeply that there are people in every part of the world that want great
products.
Looking back over the last several years, we have made very good business decisions balancing units, revenues and the
bottom line. We think about all three, and as I said, we are willing to make short-term trade-offs in profits where we see
long-term potential and we are managing Apple with a very long-term horizon.
Some of our revenues and profits occur after we ship our products. We were thrilled to exceed this quarter $4 billion in
revenue for our services for the first time. And as Tim mentioned, we will augment our very strong ecosystem with new
services and make the current ones even better. So we remain very confident in our strategy and we will use our
world-class skills in engineering and operations to manage our business well in the future.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: All right. Thanks. And, Tim, my follow up is for you. Just maybe asking you this every quarter
in different ways, but I just wanted to get your reaction to what you thought of the five-inch phone market at this time
versus three months ago? And if anything has changed in your view as to that market and its place in the smartphone
world versus your four-inch product? And that's it from me.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes, that's a good question. My view continues to be that iPhone 5 has the absolute best
display in the industry. And we always strive to create the very best display for our customers. Some customers value
large screen size. Others value also other factors such as resolution, color quality, white balance, brightness,
reflectivity, screen longevity, power consumption, portability, compatibility with apps, many things. Other – our
competitors have made some significant trade-offs in many of these areas in order to ship a larger display. We would
not ship a larger display iPhone while these trade-offs exist.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Got it.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Does that answer your question?
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yes, got it.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?

We'll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Good afternoon. Tim, I just wanted to confirm, did you mention in your prepared remarks
that – something about new product categories or did I not hear you correctly?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I did, Gene. I said that one of our areas for growth are potential new categories and we're
very excited about those.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: And that would presumably be kind of in the next year?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Well, I didn't announce a specific timeframe, but...
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Okay. And, Peter, you mentioned new services and – that you can kind of build and kind of
improve on existing services. And I guess beyond just the natural evolution of maybe Macs and the iCloud, are there
any other kind of key assets that you guys have which you can leverage into new services?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Well, nothing specific, Gene, but we are very fortunate to have the largest and broadest
ecosystem in the world. We have app stores in 155 countries and iTunes stores in over 110 countries. We have
hundreds of millions of users. We've just crossed a $16 billion run rate on the iTunes stores in terms of billings and just

achieved for the first time $4 billion in revenue for our services. So we are really thrilled with what we've just reported
this quarter, but we see opportunity that we're going to invest in tremendously to delight our customers and continue to
grow our business in those areas.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I would just add to that, that because we are not fragmented like our competition, we can
update an OS with a major release and a substantial percentage of our customers will update to the – to our latest
software. We've made that very elegant and very easy. Also, because the usage for iOS is so much higher, when we
integrate things well, people use them a lot more. And so just those concepts by itself are huge advantages from a
customer experience point of view, and from a – more of the metrics that you're thinking about point of view.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Okay. Let me ask it this way. In terms of just the payments market specifically, I mean do
you feel that, that market is well addressed today with the offerings out there?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I think it's in its infancy, Gene. I think it's just getting started and just out of the starting
block.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Gene. Can we get the next question, please?

From Cross Research, we'll go to Shannon Cross.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Tim, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what you're
thinking about within the Mac market and the PC market because obviously you outperformed substantially the
competition, but were still down about 2%. So I'm curious as to whether or not you think elasticity of demand with
lower prices, or what you're hearing from your customers in terms of their reluctance to buy a new Mac and then also
how you're thinking about the cannibalization potential coming out of the iPad?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I think the – Shannon, I think the reason that we were down last quarter – we were down 2%
as you've mentioned – but the market for PCs are incredibly weak. IDC said that the market for the March quarter was
down 14% year-on-year, which is the largest decline that I remember from being in this industry for a long time. At the
same time, we sold almost 20 million iPads and I – it's certainly true that some of those iPads cannibalize some Macs. I
personally don't think it was a huge number, but I do think it's some and I think probably the larger thing, at least for
the – maybe not so much on the Mac side, but on the PC side, it's people are probably extending their upgrade cycles.
That said, I don't think this market is a dead market or a bad market by any means. I think it has a lot of life to it. We're
going to continue to innovate in it. We believe that if anything, the huge growth in tablets may wind up benefiting the
Mac because it pushes people to think about that product they're buying in a different manner and people may be even
more willing to buy a Mac, where today they may be buying a PC and so we're going to continue making the best
personal computers.
Our strategy is not changing and we feel really good about it. We delivered some incredible innovation last year with
the Retina Display, with the MacBook Pro, an incredible thin and light package, and we've got some more great stuff
planned. So this is an area we're continuing to invest in.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. And then just as a follow-up question with regard to the tablet market, we've met with
some of your competitors recently and they're starting to talk about wins in the enterprise and touting the benefits of
Microsoft and some of the other OSs that are out there in terms of security and interoperability in some of the
enterprise companies. So I'm curious what you've heard from your customers. Have you seen much displacement, and
what are sort of the discussions that you have with enterprise customers with regard to iPads and fitting into their
system? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We seem to be doing really well. I mean, Peter had referenced earlier the Good Technology
data that says that iOS accounted for 77% of all their activations by their corporate customers. Now, that would not
include Blackberry, but it would include all of the other guys. And so, we seem to be doing really well. And honestly, I

don't see the recent announcements changing that at all. I see more and more people developing more and more custom
apps for their businesses on iOS to be used on iPad, and we're very, very bullish on it.
And as a matter of fact, just to give you, quote you some numbers, iPad now is being used in 95% of the Fortune 500.
And what's even more impressive probably is, on the Global 500 companies, we're now in 89%.

We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you. Tim, earlier you talked about how the December quarter had a very big and
broad product refresh. Were there any learning points from that experience in terms of maybe it's better to stage or kind
of stagger out launches over multi-quarters versus one quarter? How should we think about that going forward?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: That's a good question. I don't spend a lot of time looking back except to learn from it. But if
we could run it over, frankly I would have announced the iMac after the turn of the year, because we felt our customers
had to wait too long for that specific product. Where the iPad mini was in shortage in the month of – or in the quarter,
in the December quarter, I would not have done that differently because we were able to get the iPad mini out to many
millions of customers who really wanted that for – wanted that product for their holiday. And so yes, we did do a lot.
Our teams fortunately can do a lot. But in retrospect, that one – yeah, I sort of wish it were after the turn of the year,
because our customers would not have had to wait as long as they did.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. And then my follow-up question is back to the ecosystem. Are there other metrics
or mileposts you can share with us? You acknowledged earlier that the growth of revenue at Apple has slowed for some
of your key products, but how about the ecosystem in terms of usage rates? Are you seeing slowing there or are you
actually seeing the opposite where there's maybe acceleration within each user?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We see incredible usage in every study that we see. These aren't just done by us. As a matter
of fact, the vast majority of them come from other people. The usage of iOS devices are staggering compared to others.
It's a phenomenal difference, and I think that shows the strength of the ecosystem.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: And, Mark, I will add that we are now paying very happily our developers more than $1
billion every quarter.
