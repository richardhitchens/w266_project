release, and to the Investors section of PepsiCo's website under the Events and Presentations tab.
As we discuss today's results, please keep in mind that our second quarter comprises the 12 weeks ended June 14 for
our North American operations and the months of March, April and May for most of our operations outside of North
America. As we mentioned in our earnings release this morning, core operating profit growth rates are impacted by
lapping a $137 million gain from the refranchising of our Vietnam beverage operations in the second quarter of 2013,
partially offset by incremental investments of $46 million made in the prior-year quarter.
Now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
Indra K. Nooyi
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. We are pleased with our
second quarter and our first half results. Despite operating in what continues to be a challenging and volatile macro
environment, we've been consistently meeting or exceeding our financial goals over the last 2.5 years. I believe our
results reflect the hard work we've done over the last several years to position our business for sustainable success,
specifically, our investments to strengthen our brands, innovate more effectively, expand our geographic footprint with
strategic acquisitions, drive better execution, and operate more efficiently by leveraging our global scale and
complementary product portfolio.
Today, these actions and investments are producing consistent tangible results. Based on the strength of our first half
results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full-year core constant currency 2014 EPS
growth outlook to 8%.
So let me share with you some of the performance highlights of the second quarter. Organic revenue grew
approximately 4%, with global snacks up 5%, and global beverages up 2%. We managed the business responsibly,
achieving three points of effective net pricing through effective price-pack revenue management.
Each of our four business units delivered organic revenue growth, led by high single digit growth in AMEA and
mid-single digit growth in Europe and PepsiCo Americas Foods.
Developing and emerging markets posted solid 8% organic revenue growth, led by low double digit growth in China,
high single digit growth in Brazil, and mid-single digit growth in Russia.
Innovation continued to play an important role in our top-line growth and accounted for 9% of our net revenue. Core
gross margins improved by 60 basis points. Excluding the Vietnam gain, net of incremental investments from the
second quarter of 2013, our core constant currency operating profit rose 6%, core operating margin improved by 65
basis points, and core constant currency EPS grew 9%.
On a rolling four quarter basis, our core net return on invested capital improved by 30 basis points and now stands at
16.5%. In the first half of 2014, we returned $4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a
46% increase versus last year.
As we previously announced, we expect to return $8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014 in the form of dividends and
share repurchases, a 35% increase over our 2013 cash return to shareholders.
Importantly, we achieved our targeted productivity savings in the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full-year
target of $1 billion, which represents approximately 3.5% of our operating cost base, excluding commodities and A&M
expense.
This year, we expect to successfully complete the three-year $3 billion productivity program we launched in 2012. And
we are now focused on our next-generation five-year $5 billion productivity program through 2019 announced earlier
this year, which is really centered on four key areas: first, embedding more automation in our operations to replace
labor with capital; second, expanding shared services, including global financial shared services for the handling of
routine back-office transaction processing; third, restructuring manufacturing to optimize our global manufacturing

footprint; and fourth, restructuring our go-to-market systems to optimize our distribution network.
As a result of these initiatives, we expect to see continued improvement in net revenue and core earnings before interest
and taxes per employee, as well as margin expansion and returns in invested capital.
So with that as a backdrop, let's take a look at how the businesses performed, starting in North America. The North
American consumer picture continues to be weak, with retail sales among the top three food and beverage
manufacturers roughly flat in the quarter, a slight deceleration from the first quarter. In this challenging environment,
PepsiCo grew sales at retail across each of its North American snacks and beverage businesses, and was the largest
contributor to retail sales growth among the top 30 manufacturers.
Frito-Lay North America performed well, with organic revenue growth of 2% and core constant currency operating
profit growth of 5%. Net price realization was somewhat muted in the quarter as we benefited from commodity cost
deflation.
Core operating margins expanded 80 basis points, despite an increase in advertising and marketing and reflected
savings from our productivity efforts. Our top-line growth was driven by strength across most of our largest
trademarks, with Lay's, Doritos and Cheetos each posting revenue growth in the low to high single digits.
Our broader macro snack offerings are also doing well, with strong performance in shelf-stable dips, crackers, our line
of Smartfood snacks, and the Sabra line of refrigerated hummus, dips and spreads.
As we look to the second half, we're encouraged by the strength of our innovation and consumer engagement programs,
leveraging some of our biggest brands. In April, we launched Doritos Jacked mystery flavors with nationwide
distribution. Consumers voted for their favorite mystery flavor online. Earlier this month, we revealed the three flavors:
Spicy Street Taco, Chocolate Chipotle Bacon and Caribbean Citrus Jerk. Spicy Street Taco was the consumer-voted
favorite and we launched it this fall as a permanent Jacked flavor.
We also brought back to the U.S. the highly successful Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign. We received more than 14
million consumer submissions, nearly four times the submissions we received for last year's campaign. On July 17, we
announced the four finalists among consumer-submitted flavors: Cappuccino, Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese, Mango
Salsa and Wasabi Ginger. And these products are now hitting store shelves. Our consumers will now have the
opportunity to vote for their favorite new Lay's flavor.
And we're especially excited about the progress we're making in foodservice innovation. On July 2, we launched
Doritos Loaded exclusively at more than 5,500 7-Eleven stores nationwide. Doritos Loaded is a delicious hot snack
filled with melted nacho cheese and encrusted with Doritos. Our launch of Loaded created a great deal of traditional
and social media buzz, generating more than 750 million impressions to-date and was also featured on Jimmy Kimmel
Live. Each of these programs is a strong demonstration of how we are leveraging our culinary center to create unique,
great-tasting new products and driving excitement [ph] and innovation (10:03) through creative consumer engagement.
Turning now to Quaker Foods North America, despite continued challenges across most center-of-store food
categories, we gained value share at retail in each of Quakers' key categories, hot cereal, ready-to-eat cereal and snack
bars, both in the quarter and year-to-date. Core constant currency operating profit rose 5% in the quarter, with operating
profit margins expanding 155 basis points. We are pleased with the performance of our recent innovation in 2014. We
launched Quaker express cups, which provide Quaker instant oatmeal in a convenient on-the-go cup. We also
introduced the first of its kind hot cereal, Quaker Warm & Crunchy Granola, which delivers both the wholesome
goodness of Quaker oatmeal and the satisfying crunch of multigrain granola. And finally, we're continuing to build on
the success of our Real Medleys platform, this time in a ready-to-eat cereal form.
In North American Beverages, we are encouraged with the continued progress we are making. In the second quarter
and in the first half, we gained U.S. LRB value share and achieved positive net price realization at retail. Notably,
PepsiCo has held or gained relative U.S. LRB value share in measured channels versus our closest competitor in each
of the last five quarters. In the quarter, we also achieved greater net price realization at retail than our primary
competitor and the category overall.

Within the LRB category, we held or gained value share across a number of important subcategories, including CSDs,
sports drinks, ready-to-drink tea and chilled juice. And we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for:
regular CSDs, led by trademark Mountain Dew, which was up mid-single digits; and within our non-carb portfolio for
Gatorade, Lipton Tea, Starbucks coffee and Naked Juice. In the quarter, PAB grew both organic revenue and core
constant currency operating profit, with core operating profit margin expanding by 25 basis points.
We're also excited about the progress we are making on the innovation front. In the second quarter, we introduced
Pepsi Spire, our state-of-the-art beverage dispensers which allow consumers to create more than 1,000 customized
beverages with a touch of the screen, while providing our foodservice partners flexible, cost effective, reliable
equipment that best fits their needs. Pepsi Spire is currently available in select U.S. locations and will continue to
roll-out through the rest of the year.
On May 5, we also brought Mountain Dew Baja Blast to the shelves for a limited time, leveraging on the success that
the fountain brand has had at Taco Bell. Mountain Dew Baja Blast is the second largest and fastest-growing fountain
beverage sold at Taco Bell. And we're now expanding the reach of this fan favorite brand. And concurrent with the
launch of Doritos Loaded, we introduced Solar Flare, our tropical punch take on Mountain Dew, exclusively at
7-Eleven. We're leveraging the high purchase coincidence of Dew and Doritos with joint advertising, point-of-sale
communication and promotion.
And we are pleased with the performance of our expanded package offerings, with strong double digit growth in Mini
Cans, as well as 12-ounce glass bottles in the second quarter. These new packages have enabled us to realize new
price-pack revenue benefits while maintaining flexibility for price competitiveness. So that's the North America story.
Western Europe performed well, with organic revenue up 3% in the second quarter in a difficult retail and competitive
environment.
Turning now to developing and emerging markets, in Mexico, we continue to navigate through the new taxes on certain
foods and beverages. And as a reminder, we've taken pricing in snacks and our bottler has taken pricing in beverages to
pass the taxes through to the consumer. In the quarter, in Mexico, our volume decline in snacks moderated sequentially,
while beverage volume returned to growth, as consumers began to adjust to the higher prices. And our system drove
beverage share gains through improved marketplace execution. We'll be dealing with the tax-driven price increase
throughout the year and expect some quantity volatility to continue, but results so far are in line with our expectations.
In Venezuela, we're managing through high inflation, political unrest, supply chain disruptions, and continued
uncertainty regarding the applicable exchange rate. Despite all the challenges, our businesses in Venezuela performed
very well in the quarter, with revenue up strong double digits across both snacks and beverages.
Brazil delivered high single digit organic revenue growth, led by double digit organic revenue growth in beverages and
high single digit organic revenue growth in snacks. We did a particularly effective job leveraging our global soccer
properties in this market during a time when soccer was very much top-of-mind. Our integrated campaign featured an
impressive roster of the world's premium soccer players and included television advertising as well as digital,
out-of-home, in-store, and point-of-sale marketing.
In Russia, organic revenue rose mid-single digits, with double digit growth in snacks and low single digit growth in
Beverages. And we saw strong organic revenue growth in a number of other East European markets, including high
single digit growth in Turkey and low double digit growth in Poland.
Moving across AMEA, organic revenue growth was led by Thailand, with strong double digit organic revenue growth,
followed by Egypt and the Philippines, which also grew double digits. China organic revenue grew low double digits,
driven by strong growth in our snacks business. The productivity restructuring program initiated by our bottling partner
in the first quarter has achieved solid progress. Our partner has taken a well planned, deliberate approach to execute the
program to ensure that our entire system is positioned to capture its full long-term efficiency and effectiveness benefits.
We remain committed to the developing and emerging markets, as we believe they have a long runway for growth,
driven by increasing demand for our convenient, on-trend affordable products, supported by a rapidly growing middle
class. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.

So to conclude, we're off to a terrific start in 2014, with the pieces of our complementary portfolio working together to
generate healthy top-line and bottom-line performance, as we also step up returns on investment and cash returns to
shareholders. Clearly, there are a number of challenges around the globe, but the shape and resilience of our portfolio,
combined with strong execution and aggressive productivity, should enable us to navigate successfully through the
current environment.
Let me now turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?
Hugh F. Johnston
Great. Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and our
upwardly revised core constant currency earnings per share outlook for 2014. First, for Q2, organic revenue grew 3.6%.
On a reported basis, net revenue was up 0.5 point versus year-ago, reflecting three points of unfavorable foreign
exchange translation and a slight negative structural impact, primarily from the refranchising of our Vietnam bottling
operation. Commodity cost had low single digit inflation. Our core gross margins improved about 60 basis points. And
core operating margins rose 10 basis points. Core operating margin rose 65 basis points, when excluding the gain from
refranchising Vietnam, net of incremental investments from last year.
Core constant currency operating profit grew 3% and approximately 6% excluding the Vietnam gain and investments
from last year. Our core effective tax rate was 26.3%, two percentage points above Q2 2013. Our fully diluted share
count declined 2%, reflecting the benefits of our ongoing share repurchase program. And core constant currency EPS
grew 3% and 9% when excluding the Vietnam gain and investments from last year. And we returned $4 billion to
shareholders in the first half in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which was 46% above year-ago levels and
reflective of our commitment to return cash to shareholders.
Now, turning to guidance, as Indra mentioned, based on the strength of our first half results and our outlook for the
balance of year, we've increased our full-year core constant currency EPS growth target to 8%, up from 7% previously.
Our other targets remain unchanged. We expect mid-single digit organic revenue growth, low single digit commodity
inflation, and productivity savings of approximately $1 billion. Below the division operating profit line, we expect
corporate cost efficiency driven by productivity initiatives, a core effective tax rate of approximately 25%, and a
reduced share count from our share repurchase program. Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact net
revenue by three percentage points and core earnings per share by four percentage points for the full-year 2014, based
on current market consensus rates. Taking our 2013 core EPS of $4.37 and applying our guidance implies 2014 core
EPS of approximately $4.54.
As many of you know, the foreign exchange picture in Venezuela is very dynamic at the moment, with three different
exchange rates and the possibility for a converged mechanism. Our second quarter results were translated to U.S.
dollars at 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. Our current FX forecast, which is based on current market consensus rates,
assumes a blended rate of approximately nine Bolivar's to the U.S. dollar for the balance of the year.
As you model out the third quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. We expect foreign exchange translation to
have an approximate two point unfavorable impact on both third quarter revenue and third quarter EPS, based on
current market consensus rates. We do expect to ramp up advertising and marketing expense in the quarter. And below
the division operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the third quarter versus last year,
primarily reflecting higher debt balances and higher rates.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full-year free cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $7
billion. We'll continue to drive cash flow through efficient working capital management and continued tight controls
over capital spending. Net capital spending should approximate $3 billion, which is well within our long-term target of
less than or equal to 5% of net revenue. We expect to return approximately $8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014, a 35%
increase over 2013, through a combination of $3.7 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases.

So to summarize, we've increased our core constant currency EPS growth outlook for the full year 2014 to 8% from
7%. We expect to drive improved full-year margins and net ROIC. And disciplined capital allocation and returning
cash to our shareholders remain top priorities for the company.
With that, Operator, we'll take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, John.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, John.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Morning, Indra. Wanted to follow up on the Frito results, from an organic revenue
standpoint, it's the weakest quarter you guys have put up in a while. You had some promotional activity, or Give Us A
Flavor (sic) [Do Us A Flavor] in the year-ago period. So I guess can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the
general environment out there? How much of the weakness for the quarter was what you saw generally in FDM in Q2?
And then, as we look to the back half of the year, you talked about maybe a little bit more new product activity, et
cetera, what's the confidence level in terms of Frito volumes and/or organic revenue improving in the back half of the
year? And sort of as part of that, is the promotional environment getting any worse, given some of the weakness in
volumes we've seen across the food industry? Thanks.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Thank you, John, and thank you for your question. We are not particularly concerned about the
Frito-Lay performance. Clearly, the North American retail environment saw an abrupt slowdown in period five. And
we were very careful to manage this business responsibly and not hit the promotional lever in order to just drive
revenue or volume growth. We also delayed one marketing activity from Q2 to Q3. And we're already beginning to see
a ramp up in performance. So at this point, based on all the trends we are seeing, the strength of the marketing calendar
in the second half, our A&M spending that we're expecting the second half, the productivity programs, we feel pretty
good about Frito-Lay.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: As we looked at the gross margins for the quarter, can you just parse out for us how much
benefit you've gotten from gross margins from just pure pricing and how much of it was maybe just from commodity
cost inflation coming down? Just trying to get, I guess, an understanding as we're pacing forward if there's more
momentum here on gross margins?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Go ahead, Hugh.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, good morning, Bryan. Obviously, it was a combination of a couple things, Bryan.
Number one, the commodity inflation environment right now is relatively muted. It was in line with our expectations,
because of the previously discussed forward buying program that we have for commodities. And at this point in the

year, we're about 85% bought for 2014, so we're comfortable with what our outlook is on that front.
Number two, without a doubt, particularly in more inflationary countries, we are getting some pricing. And we expect
to continue to do that. In businesses where we don't see a lot of inflation, we're not taking a whole lot of pricing. We are
taking a bit, but where we have commodity deflation, we don't feel forced to do that.
And number three, I'd point out is the fact that innovation continues to ramp up, it's about 9% of sales. Innovation does
allow us to realize net effective pricing. So without parsing all of the individual pieces, they're all contributors. And I
think we expect them all to continue, so I think you're going to continue to see good gross margin improvement.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: How are you?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Very well. Thank you.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Wanted to ask a little bit about the sustainability of these clearly good results that we've seen so far
and, in particular, when you look at each of the segments, Europe is the only segment, out of the six, where you call out
advertising and marketing being up. In fact, a couple times you say lapping of incremental investments, so this is now
the second quarter in a row where we see a similar narrative. So I'm trying to get a sense from you guys of what is
overall happening to advertising and marketing in the first half of the year, because it seems like it's going down as a
percent of sales. And do you view that as sustainable going forward or do you expect there to be a ramp up on
advertising?
And as you talk about that, which is the core question on sustainability, if you could throw in a comment about Russia,
I think there's some concerns about that. We've heard that from some other companies for sure in your sector and the
sustainability there, as well as your Latin America growth being driven by Venezuela and Argentina, where there's a
question mark. But advertising is the main question, and the other two add-ons, if you could, please.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: So, Ali, it's a great question. One of the things we've said, and we've been very, very clear in
this even within our company, is that whatever we've set out as an A&M goal for the year, we will not cut it. We will
spend it based on the marketing calendar and to make sure that it's spent properly during the year, but we are not going
to cut A&M budgets for any year. When we took the big A&M and step-up in 2012, we made a commitment to
ourselves and to you that A&M is something that we will hold as a percentage of sales. And we are going to keep that
number through the year. So you should feel very, very comfortable that across the company, the number is going to
remain at...
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: 5.9%.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: 5.9% of sales.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: So, Ali, it hasn't been cut at all, it's rising with sales.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: It has not been cut and it will stay at that number, to rise with sales and it'll stay that way. And
that's true for every segment. Let's talk about Russia and Latin America, all the questions. Russia, clearly, there are
some geopolitical issues. Our business is doing just fine at this moment, but we are basic food and beverage. And the
Russian consumer still needs to eat and drink. And so, except for the FX issues, the business seems to be doing okay.
And, Hugh, I don't know if you want to comment about Venezuela.

<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, certainly, the Latin America environment is an inflationary environment. The good
news, from our perspective, is that we do have strong market positions in the snack food business and our beverage
business is doing, actually, quite well down there right now. As a result, we are able to get the pricing to cover the
inflation that we're facing down in that market. And as a result, we feel comfortable with the trajectory of the Latin
American business. So to tie all of that together, Ali, your question around the sustainability of the results, obviously,
we contemplate the volatile world that we live in. We contemplate what's happening inside of the company. We've
made commitments around R&D and A&M and not cutting those things. And as a result, we feel comfortable raising
the guidance, in spite of all those volatile factors. And that's why we did raise the guidance for the year.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Bill.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Can you guys just take a stab at why you think the categories, especially in the U.S., have been
so weak recently and then maybe what you think it's going to take to get them accelerating again, because obviously
they're trending – way below trend?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Well, I think overall, food and beverage has decelerated from years ago. People are consuming
differently. I think there's been a trend towards fresh produce, fresh grocery products, more making your food at home
as opposed to buying packaged foods and beverages. And I think people have also been eating out. So
food-away-from-home is growing just a little bit. And I think from PepsiCo's perspective, the strength of our brands,
the strength of our innovation, strength of the complementarity of the portfolio and the fact that we have very powerful
distribution systems into the retail stores is what's enabling us to be the largest contributor to growth among the 30
largest manufacturers in the U.S. retail environment.
So I think as long as we keep innovating and leveraging our distribution system and really helping the retailers offset
some of their labor costs through our DSD systems in high velocity categories, we should be able to drive growth. And
then on the foodservice side, now with the culinary centers, both in beverages and snacks, and all the work we are
doing on complementary offerings between snacks and beverages, is beginning to drive a lot of excitement in
foodservice.
Whether it be Buffalo Wild Wings or 7-Eleven foodservice or Taco Bell, I think more and more foodservice customers
are coming to us and saying what can you do for us to drive traffic and to drive ticket, so it doesn't matter if somebody
comes in to buy a product from the C-store, can they also be attracted to stop by the foodservice side and pick up
something for immediate consumption. So that's really what we are working on, taking a relatively low growth North
American retail environment and positioning ourselves to be the highest growth food and beverage company. And
that's really our strategy. And I think our portfolio, the fact we have high velocity categories, is making us a very
valuable partner to retailers all across the country.

Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Clearly, at the corporate level, you realized significant pricing in Q2. It drove mostly
organic sales growth, so I'm just wondering how comfortable you are going forward that that strong pricing can
continue, given the moderate commodity environment as well as the challenged consumer. And then secondly, Hugh,
we've really started to see a turn in the operating margin performance for the company the last couple of quarters here,

if one strips out the Vietnam gain, so I was hoping you could also give us an update on the key drivers behind that
year-to-date performance and sustainability going forward as we look to the back half.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Yeah, in terms of pricing, remember, pricing, as Hugh mentioned earlier, it's not an across the
board pricing we just implemented. It's done very surgically. Innovation helps us drive pricing. In countries where we
believe that inflation is high, we take pricing to cover inflation to the extent we can. We do a lot of revenue
management in order to get pricing. So pricing is something we realize through surgical management of innovation,
in-market pricing, revenue management and very careful execution based on the different channels. And for balance of
the year, we feel comfortable that we can sustain our pricing. And our goal is to focus on value share always, because I
think in categories that are slowing down in particular, a focus just on volume is an unhealthy trend. So we are very,
very careful to make sure that we very carefully balance pricing with volume growth and not try to go for volume at all
costs. And that's what's really allowed us to get good revenue growth and get good pricing realization.
Now, let me turn to Hugh to talk about the operating margin.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Sure, Dara. Obviously, we saw very good operating margin accretion in Q1. And then in
Q2, the number was 65 basis points. I think you will continue to see good operating margin improvement
year-over-year as we progress through the coming quarters. I don't know that it's going to stay quite at the levels that
we've seen in the first two quarters of the year, but I do think you're going to continue to see good operating margin
improvement. And the big driver behind that, of course, is the $1 billion productivity program that we've put out there.
That productivity program directly attacks the $28 billion operating cost structure that we have. And as we work
through the productivity program, you are seeing an, in fact, flow-through to the bottom line, which is why you're
seeing good leverage from revenue down to EPS.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Morning. Thanks. I guess maybe on the margin a little bit more, overseas and really outside of
the Americas, you've made good progress on the profit growth and margin expansion this year in Europe especially, a
bit less so, though, in AMEA, even adjusting for that Vietnam gain. Can you talk about the puts and takes there in each
region, perhaps if you could, differentiating between progress in snacks versus beverages in each region? And maybe
as you do, given that we've seen you refranchise beverage businesses in China, Mexico and Vietnam recently, what's
the likelihood that you might pursue similar efforts in other geographies, whether Western Europe, Russia, or India,
where you still hold the bottlers? Thanks.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Thanks for your question, Steve. Again, we don't get into the puts and takes by region. But
broadly speaking, Europe has been relatively stable, even though the retail environment is difficult. Geopolitically, it's
been stable year-over-year. And we've put through productivity programs. We've become more efficient in terms of
how we run the whole region. And that's why you saw improving margin trends. We have been one of the strong
performers from the top-line basis in Europe. And again, the complementarity of our categories is really helping drive
traffic and top-line growth at many retailers. I just had a series of top-to-tops with many European retailers. And I must
say, looking at the numbers, we have outperformed same-store sales at many of those retailers by a significant factor.
So I feel pretty good about the European trend.
In the case of AMEA, there are parts of AMEA that are going through significant geopolitical issues. The Middle East
has got significant issues. We've had [ph] the iqama (36:18) issue in Saudi Arabia. So the reason you're seeing a little
bit muted margin trends in AMEA is because we've had to power through those geopolitical issues, coupled with the
fact that, as we mentioned in our script, in China, we are going through the transition of our system into Tingyi, and we
want to make sure we don't rush it. We want to make sure we do it responsibly. We want to make sure we do it right,
because, at the end of the day, we are trying to build a very efficient and an effective system. And we are making sure

that we work constructively with our bottling partner, Tingyi, to end up with a system that really plays at its strength,
which is almost 1.6 times the size of the next competitor. So that's really why you saw better margin expansion in
Europe.
In terms of refranchising our business, where we think it makes sense, where we think our partner is stronger, and
where we think we have a partner where we refranchise the business to ensure the continued health of the business, we
will look at it. But if we believe that refranchising could jeopardize a business, we will not refranchise it. So we look at
it on a case-by-case basis. And in Vietnam, you saw that we did refranchise the business, Mexico we did, business is
performing very well. Vietnam, I mean, countries where it makes sense, we do do it. So stay tuned. As we find
interesting opportunities, we will be back to talk to you.

Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So I just wanted to go back to maybe North America Beverages and talk about the pricing
environment. Clearly, you think some of the industry participants have become a little bit more rational in terms of the
pricing strategy. We're going to start to lap the pretty heavy promotional period you saw a year ago around Labor Day,
so just your thoughts on the competitive environment and the pricing outlook in North America CSD. And then
secondarily, just thinking about the diet trends, and we're lapping a big decline that you started to see in a year-ago
period, so what are you seeing just in terms of now more consumer perception around the diet portfolio and your efforts
to perhaps address that issue?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: In every pricing environment, it's just fine. I think that we have rational pricing. And we've
always said we were going to price responsibly and we've continued doing that and we're glad the industry is being
responsible, too. On the diet trend, you've seen the numbers, Judy. We continue to see declines in diet and this is
something that seems to continue.

Our next question comes from the line of Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Amit Sharma>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Amit.
<Q - Amit Sharma>: Indra, just wondered quickly if you could talk about Mexico, especially the beverage
performance, pretty encouraging. Is that in line with expectations, that you will see year-over-year growth so soon after
the higher tax implementation there? And also, does this reduce the threat of similar taxation efforts in the U.S., or what
you will model if some similar tax is adopted here?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: On the Mexico beverage performance, I think when we refranchised our business, the
combination of Polar and GEUSA and created GEP, that company is performing very well. In-market execution is
excellent. And they're doing a very good job. So I think the reason we are growing the business is because of superior
execution.
In the case of taxes in North America, the good news, Amit, is we have a total portfolio of carbonated, non-carbonated,
full sugar, low sugar, all kinds of products. So from a consumer perspective, if they shift from one category to another,
there's always a PepsiCo product they can have for any need state, for any sugar level, for any taste, for any flavor. So I
think that that is the advantage of the PepsiCo portfolio. And incidentally, they can also pair it with a great snack. So

we feel good about the complementarity of the portfolio, the breadth of the portfolio in North America. And our goal is
to make sure there are no discriminatory taxes, but to vote constructively with state governments and other
organizations to make sure that whatever is done, is done responsibly.

Our final question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Thanks. Morning, Indra. Morning, Hugh.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Obviously, you're not going to change the company's view on a break up in this call, but
there are two data items I wanted to ask you about, one is on the corporate unallocated and how it's built up. So you
intend to share that build up? And then the second one is on the subject of dis-synergies. It's been a couple years now
since you put a number out there. You put the $800 million to $1 billion number out there, talking about separation
related to synergies. Is that still a number you abide by? And do you have any plans, if it is the number you abide by, to
share that build up?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Mark, I was hoping you'll talk about the good quarter, but having said that, corporate
unallocated, we have given you the numbers. We've said that if you look at the total corporate cost, what happens with
the compliance costs, which is about the lowest of any company, the other half is either division costs we carry at
corporate because we want to manage the volatility. For example, like pension costs or...
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Commodity mark-to-market.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Commodity mark-to-market. The other is smaller bucket, which is centrally-driven capability
costs, because we want to make sure that we protect those costs and build the capability. So the numbers we put out
remain unchanged. In terms of dis-synergies, there's no reason for those numbers to change. We've spent an incredible
amount of time kicking the tires on this. And this is a conservative estimate. And this company is engineered as one
and we feel very comfortable about the rigor with which we analyzed the proposals. And we stand by our $800 million
to $1 billion number, so thank you for the question.
Indra K. Nooyi
So let me close by reiterating that we are pleased with our results for the first half. We are confident that our plans are
working and believe we are on track to deliver our financial targets for 2014. I want to thank you all for your time and
questions this morning and, more importantly, for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment. Have a
wonderful day.
