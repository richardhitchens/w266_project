I'll start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page 2 of the conference call slide presentation.
First quarter sales increased 5% to $5.6 billion, with underlying sales growing 6%. Sales trends were mixed across end
markets and geographies, with the strongest growth in Process Management driven by robust energy end markets and
favorable comparisons from supply chain disruption in the prior year.
Gross margin of 39.7% improved 100 basis points and EBIT margin expanded 160 basis points to 13.1%, as strong
volume leverage and cost reduction benefits offset mix headwinds. Earnings per share of $0.62 increased 24% from the
prior year. Cash generation was strong with free cash flow up 115% to $439 million. The results reflected solid growth
in margin amid a tenuous global economic environment and kept Emerson on pace for financial – the record financial
performance 2013.
Next slide, P&L summary. As I mentioned, total sales grew 5% and underlying sales grew 6%. Operating profit margin
of 14.6% increased 140 basis points despite a stock compensation increase of $22 million and a $12 million pension
expense increase. Earnings per share of $0.62 increased 24%, benefiting from share repurchases of 2.1 million shares.
Next slide, underlying sales by geography: underlying sales in the U.S. grew 6%; Europe declined 2%; Asia increased
6%; Latin America increased 19%; Canada grew 6%; and Middle East and Africa was up 22%. Total underlying sales
increased 6%. Currency translation and divestitures deducted 1%, for reported sales growth of 5%. We expect Asia to
gain orders growth momentum in the second quarter, especially in China and India.
Moving to slide 5, cash flow and balance sheet; operating cash flow grew 66%, driven by strong earnings and lower
working capital growth. Free cash flow was up 115%, reflecting 97% conversion from earnings. Working capital as a
percent of sales increased 90 basis points, as strong payables performance and lower inventory was more than offset by
higher receivables.
Next slide, business segment earnings; business segment margin, which reflects $12 million of incremental pension
expense, improved 130 basis points. Corporate expense decreased slightly as retiree medical charge in the prior year
was offset by higher stock compensation expense. Interest was down $4 million and the tax rate was slightly lower than
prior year.
Moving to slide 7, Process Management: Process Management net and underlying sales increased 24%; with the U.S.
up 26%; Asia up 25%; Europe up 11%; Latin America up 44%; and Middle East and Africa up 36%.
The oil and gas, chemical and power industries continued strong growth, particularly in Asia, where orders grew 11%
in the quarter. Segment margin expanded 520 basis points as strong volume leverage and cost reduction benefit offset
less favorable project mix especially in the U.S. The near-term outlook remains solid, supported by energy end market
strength and high backlog.
Next slide Industrial Automation: Industrial Automation reported sales declined 7% and underlying sales decreased 6%
with the U.S. down 7%; Asia down 7%; Europe down 9%; Latin America up 9%; and Middle East and Africa up 4%.
Global demand for industrial goods remains anemic, which was particularly pronounced in the power generating
alternators business. Weakness continued in the electrical drives and industrial motors business as well, which was
partly offset by solid growth in the hermetic motors business.
Segment margin declined 40 basis points, primarily due to volume deleverage. Industrial Automation's cost structure is
well positioned for the expectation for continued sluggish demand for industrial capital goods in the near-term.
Moving to slide 9, Network Power: Network Power reported and underlying sales declined 2%; the U.S. flat; Asia
down 3%; Europe down 8%; Latin America up 8%; and Middle East and Africa down 2%.
Softness continued in global telecommunications and IT end markets, especially in Europe. AC power systems were
strong in the U.S. and Latin America. And sales were flat in the embedded computing and power business.
Segment margin declined to 7.2% as volume deleverage and unfavorable mix more than offset cost reduction benefits.
Order trends have started to improve, supported by telecommunications infrastructure investments; Emerson expects

solid margin expansion in 2013.
Next slide, Climate Technologies: Climate Technologies' reported sales grew 2% and underlying sales increased 3%;
with the U.S. up 1%; Asia up 7%; Europe up 2%; Latin America down 4%; and Middle East and Africa up 32%.
Strong growth in Asia benefited from improved residential air conditioning end markets, particularly in China and U.S.
growth reflected more favorable conditions in residential end markets as well.
Global refrigeration demand remains weak, particularly transportation. Segment margin declined 20 basis points,
primarily due to unfavorable mix from the residential growth. We expect demand to remain steady in the near term
from continued recovery of residential end markets in the U.S. and Asia.
Moving to slide 11, Commercial & Residential Solutions: Commercial & Residential Solutions' reported sales declined
1%, while underlying sales grew 4%, as the Knaack business unit divestiture deducted 5%. By region, the U.S. was up
7%, Asia down 2%, Europe down 3%, Latin America down 6% and Middle East and Africa down 14%.
U.S. residential end markets remained steady, led by robust growth in the food waste disposers business.
Segment margins improved 30 basis points, benefiting from the Knaack divestiture and cost reductions. The recovery
in North America residential end markets is expected to continue in the near term.
Finally, slide 12, 2013 detailed outlook. We expect reported and underlying sales to grow 2% to 5%, EBIT margin
expansion of 10 basis points to 20 basis points, despite pension and stock compensation headwinds, and earnings per
share growth of 4% to 7%. We also expect strong operating cash flow growth of 8% to 11%.
With that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much, Pat. First, I want to thank everyone for joining us today and I appreciate your time. And I'm also
looking forward to our Investor Conference next Monday and Tuesday in Columbus, Ohio, where we're going to share
a lot more information relative to our business segments and also some insights into our Network Power systems
business.
Also, I want to thank all of the Emerson employees around the world for their excellent performance and the strong
execution in our first fiscal quarter. Obviously, the first fiscal quarter is always very important, relative to delivering
the full year. Last year, we really struggled with a supply chain issue, but this year, the performance is greatly improved
and on track to delivering what I think can be a very strong, exceptional 2013 at all levels.
As we look at the global economy today and the environment around the world, it is slightly better than 60 days ago,
but still below trend line and still not a typical recovery that you would see from the typical economies that we face and
serve around the world. We'll talk more about that next week, but fundamentally, the trend is positive, but the trend is
not going to be a sharp recovery, and I think that clearly, strategic investment is going to be very, very important to
drive growth again as we move into the 2013 and 2014.
Also, I want to remind people out there, that Emerson presents GAAP numbers, which means that we include all
pension costs, all intangible amortization, and our performance share stock programs in the consolidated numbers.
We present GAAP numbers. Also, I want to make sure people understand, in the business segments, we include the
pension costs and goodwill amortization of the businesses, which is also very appropriate, given they are making
investments and those employees are creating the business well for this shareholders going forward. So, I feel it's very
appropriate that we hold them accountable for those costs, and delivering the profit improvements across those business
segments.
We will be funding our pension plan again this year at $150 million level, about the same number we've funded last
year, and I think that's very appropriate, given what's going on around the world in a low interest rate environment. And

to make sure that we keep our pension plan, which is not a huge cost, in line to what I think is appropriate for the
employees that have built this company over 130 years.
Again, I'm looking forward to our Investor Conference next week. We have a lot of interesting things to share with you,
the time to spend with the management team, and to talk about what's going on across this company and the exciting
opportunities we see as we move into 2013 and 2014.
One last point before I open up for Q&A. I want to remind the investors, as I said on the last conference call – remind
the investors as I said in the last conference call that 70% to 80% of our earnings this year; EPS delta, will occur in the
first half. 70% to 80% of our earnings delta will occur in the first half. We just did the first quarter, a delta of $0.12;
pretty easy to calculate what the second quarter should be in the range of.
So, with that, I'll open up the phone lines to make sure that we answer some of the interesting questions, but also I will
not get into a lot of great detail about the business segments now, because we'll be doing that in Columbus next week
on Monday and Tuesday.
We shared with you more detail on that one page, the financial chart that we normally would give you at the
conference, but I thought you should have that as you finalize the numbers coming out of our first quarter and look at
your own models for the investors out there for the whole year, and not have to wait until next week. So, that's why we
gave you that one page with all the detailed information in there, so you can factor that into your own financial models.
With that, I'll open up the lines. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Hi. Thanks a lot. Yes, so firstly, I guess just on the [audio gap] (13:30) more positive than
what we heard throughout last year. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about what's driven that, if it's something
you're seeing in the January order intake or something in a specific region?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, I mean, as we've been reporting in monthly orders, we've been a little bit more positive on
the monthly order statements for the last couple months.
The last – since September, October our order trends have turned up, in some of the businesses now in Climate
Technologies, Network Power systems, Residential Solutions, have all now become positive and driving on a
continuing basis on a three-month roll.
So from my perspective, this trend has been improving. It's – I would say a moderate amount of improvement from that
standpoint, but just the global economies have stabilized and feel more comfortable for the financial institutions and I
think money is again flowing and people are starting to make those investments. No, it's not a – it's not a real robust
economic environment out there, just look what happened on average the second half of the United States' economy.
And so, in total, it's still – basically you're looking about 2% to 3% type of growth. And we'll get into the various
regions of the world next week, but I still see a 2%, 3%, 4% underlying growth in the general economic trends that
we'll be facing this year.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Got it. Thanks. And then just secondly, the issue of mix comes up a lot in the slides in the
different segments and how that affects your margin. How do you see that playing out over the balance of the year?
Because, I guess, as you emphasized, the margin growth is very front end loaded. Is that because there's mix or
something you think will carry on weighing on the margins over the balance of the year?

<A - David N. Farr>: No, Julian. I think, from my perspective, we – our business; in particular, Process business or
the Climate business or the Residential Solutions business in a given month or quarter, we could have a surge of sales
shipments from the standpoint of the systems versus our instrumentation.
The last – I would say the last three quarters, not the most recent quarter, but the last three quarters, we've had pretty
good mix and we – from last year as the profitability of some of these businesses things went our way, and so Climate,
even though they had down sales last year, we had pretty good mix from the type of business, and therefore there have
improved in profitability. Same thing with Process.
If you look at the underlying quarter, Process had a very, very strong systems and solutions orders and shipment
quarter. Instrumentation a little bit weaker, driven by – the product just came in quite strong, a lot – and that will create
a lower margin in the Process world. Same thing in the Climate Technology.
We expect that mix to come back as we look at the – our order books right now. We look at the order pace. I would
expect that margin to come back, that's why we still believe that we'll have 10 basis points to 20 basis points
improvement consolidated. And I'll give you the [ph] business (16:27) margins by each of the segments; the forecast
next week, but it's not uncommon as you hear me talk, we'll have a quarter, the mix goes the wrong way; quarter goes
the right way. And I would say, we had good margin improvement this quarter, it could have been better with the right
mix, but we'll make that back up as we go into that second quarter. It just moves around. That's what happens.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly...
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: ...just quickly on the Network Power specifically. The decremental margins have been
pretty severe the last six months. Is that again mostly kind of just mix-related?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's mix-related and we expect that will start turning here. It is starting to turn as we see that
business starting to recover. As I expect, that will continue to improve now as we move into the year in the second
quarter. Yes.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Got it. Thanks a lot.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much, Julian.

And your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Mike.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Could you elaborate a bit more on the comments about expecting the Asian orders to gain
momentum? And in particular, what's your visibility like in front of the Chinese New Year?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, we have pretty good visibility. We've been doing business there a long time. We see what
the order pace is. I mean some of the businesses will not have a good couple of weeks before the Chinese New Year,
then it'll come back. Clearly, every year there's a Chinese New Year, it just comes up at a different time. We've just
seen – I mean, we just came – Ed Monser and I just came back from an Asia trip, talking versus just couple of months
ago. You're seeing a recovery now in China, pretty raw across all of our businesses – early cycle guides have already
started coming into play.
I would say what you'll see for our businesses right now is a recovery will start happening in the second half for more
of the Industrial and Network Power systems, and Process and Climate will go earlier and they're starting to move right
now. So, that visibility is pretty good relative to order pace and just what's happening. So we feel good about that.

Same thing in India. We see that recovery going on right now.
The one market I think is going to be weaker for us this year will be Australia, because of huge investments the last
couple of years. But overall, visibility right now in China, India, Southeast Asia, pretty good. The order book, pretty
good. And I think that we'll progress, things will get better, assuming the economic progression continues to happen as
it is, we'll get better as the year progresses. But I think you're going to see in the second half that really get better, much
better.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Okay. And you also called out in the press release, a negative margin mix and Process from the
lack of higher margin maintenance type projects. Is that already in the results this quarter or...
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Okay. So, we saw that impact?
<A - David N. Farr>: You mean, what happen is, with a lot of discussion – and I was just talking to Julian a few
minutes ago, the same thing.
In a quarter, we have things that – clearly, the MRO business which had been extremely strong in North America for us
prior to last quarter was a little bit – people got a little bit nervous about what was being discussed and concerned about
the U.S. economy. So, they really pulled back a little bit. And I would expect that as we go forward, you will see that
turn loose. But that mix is already built into the quarter. That's a pretty quick – MRO is a pretty quick type of situation
for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Thanks, and good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Steve.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Dave, you took up the top line, you held – the bottom end of the top line. You held EPS.
Maybe just describe a little bit of your thinking on that front?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think from my perspective, we're just looking at the general mix and I'm not going to get
carried away with my earnings forecast.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. All right. And is Process fully...
<A - David N. Farr>: You know what, I've barely grown my skin back from what you guys did to me last year. It's
barely grown back. You'll see me, it's been grafted on and it's just going to take hold root a little bit.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: All right. But I'm sure it's just as handsome as always.
<A - David N. Farr>: I wouldn't go that far.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Is Process fully caught up with the backlog?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, it caught up pretty well amongst last year, if you push and shove last year and it's hard to
track it, but by the time, we finished the year we're there. In my opinion, we're there.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: So, now you're just in a natural demand shipping mode, then?

<A - David N. Farr>: Correct. Yes, exactly right. Projects moving in and out and things like that. And the key thing
for me right now to be honest is the last gentleman asked a good question on the MRO with North America. That is, we
need that to come back a little bit. People, I think, were a little bit cautious in the first three months and I'm hoping as
we get into this – deep into the second quarter, we'll start seeing that MRO business activity comes in.
Now we – if you remember correctly, we grew over 20% last year on North America in Process. And so, the question
is, do they have to digest some of that and maybe the first six months this year could be kind of slow. So, that's where
we're watching carefully right now.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And then just on receivables, maybe a quick comment on just the higher level this
quarter.
<A - David N. Farr>: We're still versus last year, we're still catching up. We did make headway relative to the
receivables we built at the end of the fiscal year. We will continue to make headway here as we go forward. Part of the
receivable delta is, about a third of it is basically prepayments from large projects and basically that's good thing. I
mean, we've got large projects coming down the road in Network Power systems and also Process. So, that creates a
balance sheet issue for us, but that's a good sign, but we are making good headway. We had good cash flow. I feel very
good about the cash flow this year and if we have a strong second quarter, we will set a record year in cash flow in
2013.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. See you next week. Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: See you later. Take care, Steve.

Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Hey, Dave, you don't often talk about hermetic motors, but maybe give us some color about
the HVAC market there. How does that relate to the compressor side and how do inventories look?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, a hermetic motor goes in every compressor we sell. So, and we only – we basically –
we're a captive type of business here. And from that standpoint, you saw in the quarter, our Climate Technology
business did grow and we had a good quarter; we had good orders. Our Climate Technology orders are above the line,
as we say, and I expect them, when we see the final January numbers, to be above the line. I do know in January, they
had another good global order book.
So, from my perspective, Climate Technology has turned, and we had two tough years after one really strong year, and
I expect them to have good growth in 2013 and 2014. We'll talk about it. We maintained our investments in a big way
in that Climate Technology area, and we're going to start seeing some payback in that and I think in 2013 and 2014. I'm
very positive about that right now.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: How do you feel about the compressor inventory in the channel today?
<A - David N. Farr>: Low. Low.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: And then...
<A - David N. Farr>: And I don't think it – by the way, I think, they expect us to serve them without rebuilding
compressor inventory. I don't think they're going to rebuild inventory. I think they expect us – we ship within days.
They expect us to rotate, move around, change our lines and go. So, I don't worry about that too much, but I just – let's
put it this way, it's low.

<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Good to hear. And then, any comment update on the sale of embedded power; how's the
process?

the documents will be going out to a select group of people, and it is a process that will take – I would say looking at
calendar year, I don't want to rush. I mean, we're into this right, but it's moving forward.

you've had this huge revenue surge. Is actual physical backlog strong or it's just what you see coming in the pipeline
kind of bid and proposal work. Any color you could share there?
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say both the physical is very strong and the pipeline is very strong. One of the things,
and somebody asked me the question earlier, we raised the top-line a little bit in sales growth. We have a little more
head – we're going to have – currency is going to help us as the year finishes, and that does not give you a lot of
margin, as you know. So, that's one of the reasons why I should have said that earlier, that we look at that – the dollar
definitely right now is a little bit weaker, and therefore it helps us. But, we don't get a lot of earnings out of that.
The backlog from the standpoint of the Process is still at record levels, maybe not quite as high as it was a smidgen
below September, and the pipeline that we see is very, very strong around the world. Not a lot of – I hear about delays
out there from other people, but I don't – we have not had a lot of delays. The short-term impact to us has been more
than North America MRO businesses, as those guys slowed down a little bit and they're just digesting all they did last

year. But right now, it looks pretty good.
I expect to have a good second quarter. We're coming off very – we grew [ph] 50-50 (26:48). I mean, we added $1
billion a year for two years.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right.
<A - David N. Farr>: Those are big numbers. And so, we still expect solid single-digit growth in the Process sales this
year, solid single-digit. And I expect pretty good profitability out of them.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And are you seeing kind of the downstream kind of more gas-driven, I guess, but oil and
gas-driven projects moving forward on people's drawing boards? Do you think there's delays there?
<A - David N. Farr>: Right now, we're not seeing delays. The projects are moving forward. We're bidding on them.
We're winning them. That's going to help us as the year progresses and as we move into 2014.
In particular, North America, the oil and gas downstream projects are enormous. And that's why I've been so excited
about trying to get the pipelines open, why I believe in having natural gas, shipping – even exporting natural gas, we
need to have that natural gas flowing out there to make those investments happen. I just came back from South Africa, I
was just in India, and we're all seeing the downstream numbers coming both around the world and then also here in
North America, which I'm pretty good – excited about.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And maybe just finally, any thoughts on kind of M&A versus share repo? You started to kind
of lean into the share repo a little bit more here. What's the thought for the year? Any change?
<A - David N. Farr>: No change. I expect share repurchase to be in the $600 million to $800 million range. No change
at that point in time, pretty much in line with what we did last year.
At this point in time, we'll be talking next week, I do not see any big, big acquisitions. I expect us to spend somewhere
around $400 million or $500 million this year. When I look at the quality of assets out there, it's not very high at this
point in time, and therefore, we're going to generate very high levels of cash. We'll pay the dividend, we'll buy share
repurchase, and keep our balance sheet ready to go for an acquisition. But right now, it's going to be both, we're going
to be passing back close to 60% of our cash to our shareholders in 2013.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great. Thanks. I'll see you next week.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Can you – I want to go back and talk a little bit about the drives and the motors business. I
mean, I think there was a new product launch that you guys were doing, I just can't recall the timing and how that may
be impacting results. Can you update us there?
<A - David N. Farr>: Good. Yeah, we will talk again about this next week, but the new drives are coming out. They're
being introduced. We're starting to take orders. Our motors and drives business right now is being negatively impacted
by the strength in Europe. We are very, very strong in Europe and that's been a tough marketplace. But the new drive
launch is going. It's going to be very positive and it's going to expand a certain market. I would expect we'll start seeing
that impact more in the second half of 2013 and in particular in 2014. It's started, therefore we typically have a lag as
people wait for the new drives. So, with the European slowdown and that product launch, it was pretty predictable that
we would have about – I would say, about five, six quarter slowdown. That's where we are right now.

<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And it looks like embedded had a pretty good quarter, and that's a
positive surprise versus, I think most of us were probably expecting it to continue to bleed down for the year. I mean, is
this kind of low-water mark? You said this quarter, I expect them to have another good quarter. And how do you – and
since you're just talking about revenues, what about profits? Are margins picking up there?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes. Yes. We've – they've gone through enormous restructuring. My hat's off to Jay and his
team here. I mean, first of all, we announced we're going to sell them. That's hard to do. We took out a lot of what I call
deadwood business. We've got a few things going on on the customer base, like Dell, HP, guys like that, a little few
things going on out there.
And from my perspective, it looks to me like the order pace has actually turned up. You can't see that yet but we will
show this next week too, I think we'll actually show you a curve, and you'll be able to see that the curve for embedded
has actually started to turn up. It's still negative, but it's getting – I think it might cross the line real soon. So, I expect
growth to start happening and I expect profitability to continue to improve.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. That's great. So, that's all the questions...
<A - David N. Farr>: But, it's still, still, still low single digits. I mean, you're talking pretty low-margin business here.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. All right. That's all I have. Thanks, guys.

And your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, Dave. So, what about your own CapEx? I mean, it was down a little bit
year-over-year in the quarter. You're talking about taking it up a little bit, but not a lot for the year. What are you
looking for to sort of loosen the purse strings a little bit with your own capital spending? What would you need to see?
<A - David N. Farr>: Serious top line growth in growth fixed investment on the world, which we haven't seen. I mean,
you haven't seen it at all. And our forecast is for this year, global GFI will probably be up somewhere around 3%, 4%,
5%, and we can cover most of that – a lot of that with productivity.
So, I mean, I expect us to have a little bit of increase. If Climate business continues to trend nicely and other business
come along, we can always increase that as the year goes on. We have the cash, but I'm just going to be very careful
metering out that capacity that we don't need until we need it. So, that's what it caused me.
We're running at around $700 million, which is not a bad number, and I think it's going to stay that way. If we got the
opportunity and the growth – let's say that growth started coming up nicely, then you'd see us maybe take that up a little
bit. But right now, I think that the growth rate we're looking at, we're in pretty good shape.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And then just in terms of thinking about Network Power margin improvement
through the year, some of the pickup in orders recently has been in telecom which isn't quite as favorable mix as data
center might be. I mean, are you – I think, you thought the mix would get a little better from here, but is it mix or is it
the restructuring benefits from last year following through? How do we think about what drives the margin
improvement through the year in Network Power?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, you're going to see the restructuring kick in. And we're also starting to see some of the
better mix of products. The telecom business is – yes, is improving, but the other parts of the business are starting to
have pretty good standpoint.

The other issues – in the first half of the first quarter, particularly last year, our China Network Power systems business
was extremely strong and that's a very profitable business for us. And really it started tailing off last year including this
quarter here and the quarter we just finished. That business order pace is starting to pick back up, that mix is starting to
pick back up, so I would expect this – as we get into the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, that business is
going to help us and that will help us mix up and also grow. So, there are a couple of things that are starting to kick into
gear here that will be – will really help us as we get into that second half of the year.
I keep reminding everyone, we're going to have 78% of our earnings per share in the first six months for the reason; we
had record, record levels the last year. So, I'm – this mix is going to come and help us, but I want a driver – most of our
earnings opportunity is really in the first half when we got hit last year with the Thailand flood situation. So, things are
starting to mix the right way for us.

And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Oh, thanks. Afternoon, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hello, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: So, by the way your comments on GAAP earnings are well taken.
<A - David N. Farr>: I just wanted to point out – I mean, a lot of people don't even report segments with GAAP.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Right. Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: We pushed the pension cost down – our pension cost down the businesses and they don't like
that, but that's where the cost is and we also pushed the amortization. We did the acquisition and I expect them to
recover.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: No, there's definitely a drift away from GAAP in the sector. So, just interested in your comments on
China. You definitely called the recovery fairly early in 2013, but I think you've been quite skeptical about the
sustainability of the growth beyond 2013. Do you still feel that way?
<A - David N. Farr>: I – we'll talk about it next week. I have a lower growth expectation in China for 2014 and 2015,
though I still expect it to grow a very solid single-digit. I like the way they're unfolding this, to be honest, Nigel. I think
they're trying – they're not trying to prime the pump way too fast. I like what they're doing right now. They're being
very measured. And I like some of the actions being taken by the new leadership team. And so right now, based – and
I'll be going back over there early in March. I'm very encouraged by what I see right now and if that continues for the
next three or four months, then I'll feel better about that 2014 and 2015. But right now, we're going to have a pretty
good recovery here as the year progresses in 2013 for sure.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's great. And then on India. I think that's the first time I've heard positive comments on
India for at least a year-and-a-half, two years. So, just wondering what are you seeing over there right now?

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Same as the U.S., I guess. And then...
<A - David N. Farr>: They're going to put money out. I mean, India's been in a tough place for the last couple years. I
think 2013 and maybe even the first part of 2014 for us will be okay; then I get concerned again. But right now, they
are priming the pump and the money's being spent and I look at my order pace, it wasn't great in the first quarter, but I
look at what's going on in the activity, the bookings, and I think India will get better as the year progresses.

<A - David N. Farr>: Frank? Frank who?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Is Frank there?
<A - David N. Farr>: He's laughing. Yes. Go ahead.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: The corporate expense – just the $120 million or so this quarter, is that a good run rate for the full
year?
<A - Patrick Fitzgerald>: No, that's going to ramp up on us as we go through the year, because the overlap in the
performance shares is going to be more back loaded.

<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: No, I didn't. Quick one on the macro. China. So, last quarter when you gave initial guidance,
you said China for you would be up 5% to 10% in 2013. And I've seen the presentation you have a GFI expectation of
6% to 7%. And that assumes maybe growth, a multiple over GFI for you, but is that 5% to 10% change or is that a
potential room for upside later in the year depending on what you see?

<A - David N. Farr>: Right now my answer would be no change, if it unfolds the way I'm seeing it unfold, we could
probably have some upside. But right now, it's too early to say from my perspective, because I think that the changes
we're seeing in China are just starting to happen. I mean, as you know, I try to be very open and I see this and I feel
better about it, and I'll be back there in 30 days, so if I walk away feeling better about it, then the answer would be yes,
we should do a little bit better, more like towards the 10%. But we've got to start getting it there first.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay. Understood. And then just what's the euro assumption here going forward?
<A - David N. Farr>: We've been basically looking around $1.30, $1.32, and now it's obviously – and not it's at $1.35,
but it's – so that's why part of it raised, for guys who said earlier. But we're always talking about $1.30 originally in the
plan, and now we're – now it's up a little bit, so...
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: [indiscernible] (39:24) so we got a serious problem.
<A - David N. Farr>: [indiscernible] (39:26) it will help us in the second half. I mean we will not have much currency
impact in the second quarter, but it's going to start ramping up at over a point in the third and fourth quarter.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay. But you're not assuming the spot rate for the rest of the year, at $1.35, you're assuming
$1.32? That's because...
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean, right now I raised a little bit, for like $1.35, second half of the year, yeah.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay. So, you're at $1.35. Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: That's how we look at it. That's one of the reasons there's a five, sitting in that thing there so...

And your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thank you. Hi, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hello, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Hi. So, Europe kind of continues to disproportionately drag your ops. This quarter seemed to hit
Industrial Automation, Network Power. Are you seeing these markets begin to inflect perhaps more positively any
aspect of this? And I know you've done a lot of restructuring there, I mean presumably when you start to get some of
these volumes, these margins could ramp back at pretty high incrementals. Is that a fair statement? Or maybe we should
be thinking about this somewhat differently. How do you think about it?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, I think if we can get – I mean, you've got to get a reasonable level of margin. I mean, I'm
sorry, growth. One or two points of growth aren't a lot of ramp through a factory. Now if all of a sudden – I mean, I feel
better about Europe today than I did 60 days ago. So, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we don't grow – our European
business doesn't grow in the second quarter.
So, what I – I think to get the margin improvement – a significant margin improvement in Europe you've got a get
above 5% type underlying growth for us. I mean at 2%, 3%, 4%, that's not enough to really ramp at margin, but if you
start getting up above that 5% with the restructuring underway, we should see a pretty good margin improvement. And
that will help us obviously in our overall business. But that's where you have to get to. And I don't have a forecast that
Europe's going to grow 4%, 5%. So, I think that's the type of growth you need to see, and I don't see that happening for
a while.
<Q - John G. Inch>: No, but does your forecast assume it starts to get better in the second half?

<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, we assumed our European business starts to have growth. And like I said, I wouldn't be
surprised if we don't have growth in the second quarter. But it's going to be moderate growth, probably like onesie-2s,
which is not a whole lot of incremental volume. I mean, when it's no growth and there's negative growth that you
deleverage pretty hard, even though with the cost reductions, because you have cost inflation there. But with the – you
get above that 2%, 3%, I start feeling better. When you get above 5% it really feels good. But right now, I think you're
– we're talking about onesies-twosies as this recovers in the second half. That's where my gut lies.
<Q - John G. Inch>: No, that makes sense. I was going to save the European strategy questions for next week, but I
did want to ask you about China restructuring. You had called out, I think a year ago, your plans to automate in China
and as you're seeing these markets turn and you're not the only company that has done this, does that suggest, it's
almost a similar question to Europe, because that suggests as China comes back, which presumably can come back a lot
more forcefully than Europe that your margins there in terms of contribution benefits do much better than they have
historically.
<A - David N. Farr>: The answer is yes, they should. If we got the restructuring and the automation done properly in
the right locations – we are profitable, pretty profitable in China already, but it should help us be more profitable and
more competitive. So, from my perspective, I think profitability, and we'll talk about this, I think we have room to go in
this cycle on profitability. This year, we've got a couple of things we have to overcome and we're working our way
through that from the pension standpoint and then also from the performance shares and amortization, but we'll work
through that. And then, if we don't add any additional cost, you're going to see us continue to leverage quite nicely. So,
I feel good about upward mobility and profitability as we get into that 2014 and 2015 range. And that's what I'm going
to tell you. We're going to be setting pretty margins in 2014 and 2015.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Got it. Thank you. See you next week.

<A - David N. Farr>: I understand you were just recently with my climate guys. Did you harass them? Or were you
good to them? Was he good to them?
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: No. I didn't meet with the head of the business side, I just kind of kicked around, met with...
<A - David N. Farr>: Kicked around. Kicked around there.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: ...the Goodman guys, the LG guys, Carrier guys, all the big guys. So, just on Process
Management, there is a lot of noise in the numbers here. What was the – again the ultimate tailwind, I guess,
year-over-year from Thailand this quarter?
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean it's hard to measure, because it's not an accounting type of number, but I mean, I look at
overall for the total Emerson, you're looking – the underlying growth rate was probably in the 1% to 2% range.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: And so, that's how I look at it. I mean, we try to keep track, but it's impossible to say what you
didn't ship in a quarter or first six months of the year and what we shipped back. I mean, it's – and you just – I did not
want to create an accounting nightmare out there. So, this is sort of our gut in looking at what we looked at and so on
and so forth. So, obviously, we didn't grow at 24% underlying in the quarter for Process, so. But they were still up very
solid in the quarter.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Yes, so then you said it's going to be mid-single digits for the year, you are up 24%. I guess your
orders are kind of comping flattish right now. Will there be a quarter this year with a tough comp in the back half where
Process is negative?
<A - David N. Farr>: Right now, we don't see it.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: When I'm talking for the year, I would say that we're going to be up somewhere between, I'm
saying 6% to 8%. And right now, we do not see – they get real flat. Frank's giving me the detail [indiscernible] (46:15),
Frank, they get real flat by that fourth quarter. So, if things – if they hit a bump in the fourth quarter, you could have a
top-line, underlying negative fixed rate. And then they're going to get currency helping them too.
So, I would say the one risk I see right now is the fourth quarter. That's why I've been so focused on the 7% to 8%,
because we had, as you well know, a very strong fourth quarter as things clicked in, reductions and the sales and stuff
like that. And so, I get a little bit nervous about our fourth quarter. From a profit standpoint, growth standpoint it was a
phenomenal quarter last year, but I think that would be the one quarter that I would be worried about for Process.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And the margin there, again a very strong second half. You had stuff that was shipping.
We did have kind of an unusual benefit to the margin. I mean it didn't look like it from an incremental perspective. You
are still 35% to 40% incremental there in the back half...
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: ...which is pretty damn good, but kind of normal. So, is there any weird comp on the margin that
we have to think about in the second half at Process?
<A - David N. Farr>: No. I think Process had a phenomenal, I'm looking at EBIT margin, they had a phenomenal –
their EBIT margin in the second half was close to 23.5%, if I read this correct. And so, I see – yeah. So, what I see
going on forward here is that they're going to trend towards – they basically from an EBIT standpoint, they were
around 20% last year, and I expect them to be slightly higher than that for the whole year. And clearly, they need to
make margin – good margin in the first half from an EBIT standpoint. And then they're going to struggle from a
comparison standpoint in the second half. So, that's why I watch them right now. I would expect them to be down in the
second half in EBIT margin and up significantly in the first half.

The other thing we had in there last year, the best that we can tell, about – probably about $40 million of costs that we –
when we made the decision to protect our customer base at all costs, we spent a lot of money to do that. And we're
having to overcome that $40 million this year. And so a lot of that's going to work our way out, but right now, the first
half good margins. Second half, I think they'll be down slightly. For the whole year, they'll be up slightly.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Got you. And then on the Network Power...
<A - David N. Farr>: You can do a forecast off that. It's pretty quick. You want me to do it for you?
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: And then on the Network Power ramp that you guys are expecting, you said it's going be up
year-over-year, but we're obviously starting from a hole, down 100 bps this quarter. I mean you kind of snapped back
last year, I think you averaged 30% to 40% sequential incrementals, it was a little volatile around that line. But anyway,
I mean is – should we think about last year as the appropriate sequential from a margin perspective? Or is it a little
more back-end weighted? Or how do we think about the Network?
<A - David N. Farr>: I expect – I want to see these guys, to be honest. From an EBIT standpoint, I want to see them
close to 10% in that second quarter. Now, they don't want to hear that, but that's where I want to see them. And then
you're going to start moving up from there on a sequential basis like we did last year. So, I mean, if you go 10%, you
go 12%; then you're going 14%, 15% type stuff in the fourth quarter. So, that's basically how I expect them to see that
unfold. But I really would hope they're going to get close. They may not get quite 10% in the second quarter, but
they're going to be closer to 10% than they are 5%.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So, that's almost 300 basis point increase sequentially?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, we just did – what did we just do? 7%? 7.2%. So, if you can get up, yeah, I'm hoping to
get to above 9% and close to 10%. That's what I'd like to see. Yes.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Wow. Okay. Thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: We got to get – I mean, we – I feel that's how we have to move it. We – again, our first and
second quarter, we have going on right now, and you've been around a long time, you've watched this, we have
different segments of our business starting to shift into play here, as I always refer to them; horses. And Climate shift
upfront now, I've got Pat's Slides business, Residential, and I've got Network Power systems and Network Power
starting to improve, and the sales are going to be down slightly probably in the second quarter still as we rake off, but
they're going to start improving, hit positive growth in that third and fourth. But I still feel with cost reductions and the
right mix that we should have a good – we should have a better second quarter than we had first quarter profitability.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: So, all your Network Power guys out there would be thinking about that.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome. See you next week.

<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: I got to survive next week, I got to be nice. You know that.
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, I got plenty of guns I'll bring next week; so I'll protect myself.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Just a quick question. We listened to the Eaton call earlier today and they were sort of
talking, bragging, they said the data centers are slow, but they've gotten a lot of orders and a lots of wins. Is there
anything going on in the dynamics of that marketplace that Eaton claimed they had a whole bunch of wins now, or is it
just the timing and peculiar for certain contracts?
<A - David N. Farr>: Just the timing. I don't think – I think the marketplace is fairly stable right now, and I think we –
I could brag, I've got a couple of wins too. So, I don't – I mean, I don't feel worried about it at all. I think right now,
we'll present to you guys next year, I think we have a very strong hand and a recovery plan underway. And so, Network
Power systems orders are green, they're above the line, and that's a good sign. So, I feel good about where we are right
now, we're on a good progression there. And I want to share next week with how we're building this business and how
we're going to make this a very strong value creator for our Emerson shareholder going forward.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Yeah, and with Climate beginning to turn, one of the big complaints we hear from Ingersoll
and the people involved in that part of the business is the adverse shift downward to lower share products, that's
continuing and not changing. Is there anything going on in the marketplace or anything you have to do to reflect the big
change that seems to be going on? And it looks like, it's almost – it's semi-permanent at this point in this business?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, I don't – we don't have to – I mean, I don't – I mean, we've created the product for the
lower-tier, lower performance type of product, but what we have is a pretty broad offering between – from the
residential up to the commercial to the transportation. So, we have a broader offering capability than something like an
IR. So, I don't think that – we're still running pretty good levels of profitability, I expect us to run record levels of
profitability this year, even with the mix that we're going to – I think residential, we're going to be very strong, but
you're going to see a good story, where our things are taking off and this – the investments we're making and the cost
reductions that will show that we will have again a pretty good growth year and coming back. And then, also with that
some good profitability.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Yeah.
<A - David N. Farr>: So, I think, you know we deal with the mix everyday of the week in our business, and we work
our way through it.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: All right. And I'll see you next week.
David N. Farr
See you next week. With that, I want to thank everybody. I'm looking forward to seeing you next week. And again,
thanks for joining us here today and thanks for – I'm looking forward to seeing everybody next week. Take care now,
bye.
