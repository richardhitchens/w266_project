Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include
some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially
from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are
summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.
And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Ajay Banga. Ajay?
Ajaypal Singh Banga
Thank you, Barbara, and good morning, everybody. We're very pleased with our results this quarter. We've had a net
revenue growth of 16% or 15% when adjusted for currency, and that's been driven by solid volume and transaction
growth in every region around the world. And I think that revenue growth allowed us to invest more back into the
business in the areas such as digital products and the safety and security around them. We were able to make these
additional investments while still delivering a net income growth of 14% or 13% adjusted for currency and an EPS
growth of 18% or 17% on an FX adjusted basis.
So let's start in our normal way by looking at the underlying economic trends. And if you start with the United States,
consumer spending was relatively flat from the second quarter's better-than-expected growth. Our SpendingPulse data
for the third quarter shows that U.S. retail sales growth, ex-automobiles, is about 3.8%. Now that's down just slightly
from the 4% of the second quarter. Over the last three monthsor four months, we've seen a slow steady decline in the
confidence numbers and that's probably the reason behind the slight deceleration of our SpendingPulse data.
And of course, the recent circumstances in Washington have contributed, I think, to a sharp decline in October's
consumer confidence. But what that means for consumer spending for the remainder of the year remains to be seen as
yet. The fact is that for us, as a company, despite the relatively flat growth in overall consumer spending in the U.S., we
saw an increase in our U.S. business in the third quarter where volume grew 9%, up from last quarter driven by
improvements in consumer credit.
In Europe, overall economic growth was subdued in the third quarter, and we expect to remain that way through the
end of the year. But European consumer confidence continued the recovery that has started in the second quarter and
it's now back up to the 2010 levels. Business sentiment has also improved over the quarter across major European
markets like Germany, France, the U.K. and even Italy. And the combination of an improved environment in some
markets, along with the continued secular shift and most importantly our business wins, have driven third quarter
volume growth of 17%, up from 14% last quarter with Poland, Russia, Sweden as some of the key contributors to those
numbers.
Now looking elsewhere in the world, in Asia, consumer spending in the third quarter increased in key markets.
Consumer confidence levels have remained by and large steady across the region. However, business sentiment
continues to be mixed because of lingering concerns about the global economy. Our business in this region continues to
do well. We had strong volume growth of 22%, up from the 21% that we showed last quarter.
In Latin America, consumer confidence in Brazil improved, but Mexico edged down slightly in September and across
the region, forecast for the rest of the year seemed to indicate that GDP growth would probably remain sluggish. Our
business in the region continues at a healthy pace. We had a 17% growth this quarter similar to our growth rate of the
last quarter.
So overall, you step back from all this and it feels like the underlying global economy is showing the right trends to get
back on to a more solid footing. What we kind of need to see is a more balanced and practical approach on the part of
the political leadership to allow those underlying improving economic trends to take hold and bear fruit.
But before moving on to business highlights, I'd like to say a few words on where things currently stand on the legal
and regulatory front. First, on the U.S. merchant litigation, nothing new to report. Judge Gleeson held the final

settlement approval hearing, as you know, on September 12. We're all awaiting his ruling. We should expect it some
time late this year.
On the debit front, as you know, the Federal Reserve appeal the District Court's July decision. The judge issued a stay
of the existing rules pending the outcome of an expedited appeal and the Fed recently filed a brief presenting their
arguments in response to the judge's decision. The appeals court probably will issue their ruling some time in 2014.
The European Commission's proposed legislation is the third one. Both the European Parliament and the Council of
Ministers need to review, potentially amend, and finally vote on the commissioner's proposal. The Parliament has
begun the process and though it's still early days, they have now appointed what they call a rapporteur, who has the
responsibility for both drafting and then shepherding the legislation through their parliamentary process. He has
announced a draft timeline that includes the session on the 5th of November to officially kick it off. He will also be
meeting with us next week. The commission has indicated they would like their proposal to be adopted before
Parliament goes into recess in the spring. And as we said before, that timeline appears ambitious in light of what needs
to be accomplished before vote can actually be taken in the European Parliament.
So now, let's move on to some of our recent business activity. You've heard enough from us at Investor Day relatively
recently in September, you had an opportunity to see firsthand a number of the product innovations we were rolling out
from our simplified commerce, acceptance solution, to social benefit programs, to ShopThis! with a 3D avatar and so
I'm not going to go into all that, but I'm going to talk about a couple of different items.
And the first one is that last quarter, there were several new partnerships established with the U.S. merchants. In
addition to the agreement with Virgin Atlantic that Chris McWilton probably mentioned, I think, on Investor Day, we
have now signed three more new credit cobrand relationships and partnerships, with Hawaiian Airlines being the
largest of those three.
The second big area of focus for us, and frankly it's true of everybody in the payments industry as you heard on the
Visa call yesterday, is safety and security, the importance of which is second to none as our physical and digital worlds
converge. Historically, how this has worked is that when you developed industry standards and specs, we did it with
traditional payments partners, banks, other networks. Today, we are working with those also but with a broader group
as well that includes technology companies and merchants. The idea is that by expanding this participation, we'll kind
of get to create better consumer, better merchant experiences and at the same time, ensure safer and more secure
transactions. And the drive to continually upgrade to newer technology is going to mean that all of us have to ensure
that payment security standards adapt more quickly to changing consumer and merchant needs than they have in the
past.
So one interesting new development in that area is tokenization. And as you know, earlier this month, we along with
Visa and American Express, proposed global standards to replace these traditional account numbers with digital tokens
for online and mobile transactions. What that ensures is that the cardholder's bank has access to their card information
and only the cardholder's bank has that access. It eases the merchant's requirement of having to keep that specific card
information secure. What the merchant sees is a token. We can connect that token back to that specific information
with the bank. Work is being done in collaboration with issuers as well as other industry stakeholders and the idea
generally is all of us is to improve cardholder security, reduce the impact of fraud and yet provide a good consumer and
merchant experience.
So in addition to that, we've joined the board of Fast Identify Online Alliance (sic) [Fast IDentity Online Alliance]
(10:13), an industry consortium. Members there include Google and PayPal. The consortium promotes standards in
support of authentication technologies such as biometrics. And you've heard us talk about biometrics a number of
times, but along with existing solutions like chip cards and NFC. I think doing this will help us to ensure that the
development of standards that happens, which everybody can innovate in, is in an environment that is safer and more
secure for online commerce.
But supporting safer and more secure transactions is more than just creating new standards. You can also do it in
platforms, such as what we are doing through our DataCash business to provide a more secure environment for

e-commerce merchants. For example, in Brazil, Brazil is one of the largest and fastest growing e-commerce markets in
the world. We announced a new partnership last year with DataCash and Redecard, one of Brazil's largest acquirers. As
a result of the partnership, Redecard recently launched an e-commerce gateway with fraud and risk management
services. They are the only ones, by the way, in the Brazilian market to offer payment processing and fraud tools
together in one place, making it much simpler for merchants to accept cards without the need to sign up with multiple
vendors for these different needs of theirs.
So finally on this topic, security can also be about using our technology, our data and the expertise around it to provide
services that help reduce the costs of our customers in ways they sometimes cannot do themselves. So let me give you
an example. We used our global network in data analytics and leveraged it and we're helping our customers right now
by monitoring interregional activity on all of our cards in all our 150 countries and at more than 1 million ATMs
around the world.
What that allows us to do is gives us a chance to provide better insight to our issuers about potential fraud threats that
go well beyond what they can see themselves just through their own card activity. So we introduced what's called
Fraud Rule Manager at ATMs in April. And this resulted in significant reductions in interregional ATM fraud on
Maestro cards and that reduction is up to 70% in some regions. Now, in the context of all our ATM volume, fraud is
small, but that's not the point I'm trying to make. I'm trying to make the point that the level of improvement up to 70%
represents a powerful example of what we can do with data and technology.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for a conversation on our financial results and operational metrics.
Martina?
Martina Hund-Mejean
Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.
Let me begin on page 3 of our slide deck where you see that this quarter, the difference between as reported and FX
adjusted growth rates is one percentage point for each line item. All of my comments today will pertain to the FX
adjusted growth rates.
To reiterate what Ajay said, we continue to be pleased with our performance. Even with a relatively difficult economic
environment, we're able to make progress on the conversion from cash to electronic forms of payment and win business
around the world.
Net revenue grew 15%, which combines with operating expense growth of 13%, resulted in net income growth of 13%.
EPS growth was 17% benefiting from our share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we purchased almost
575,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $345 million, with $912 million remaining under
our current authorization. We did not repurchase any additional shares in October, given the parameters of the 10b51
plan that we set a couple of months ago. Our strategy remains unchanged: we will continue to look to repurchase shares
on an opportunistic basis.
Cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid
investments of about $6 billion.
So let me now turn to page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Our worldwide gross
dollar volume, or GDV, was up 15% on a local currency basis to over $1 trillion. U.S. GDV grew 9% with credit
volumes growing 7%. U.S. commercial credit growth was in the mid-teens, higher than last quarter. And U.S.
consumer credit growth was positive and it continued improvement over prior quarters. Our U.S. debit growth was 11%
driven by growth from consumer, commercial debit and prepaid programs.
And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 18% on a local currency basis and this continues to be driven by APMEA
with a 22% growth rate and solid 17% growth in both Europe and Latin America. Cross-border volume grew 19% on a
local currency basis including more than 25% in Latin America and APMEA and growth in the high-teens in Europe.

Turning to page 5, here you see processed transactions grew 16% globally to more than $10 billion for the first time. In
the U.S., we saw good growth due to increases in debit and credit card transactions. And outside the U.S., processed
transactions grew 23%. We saw increased growth from the second quarter in all regions with particular strength in
Europe, driven by our business wins in Sweden and continued good growth in Russia and Poland. And globally, the
number of cards grew to – grew 8% to almost 2 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
Now, let's turn to page 6 for some insights on our revenue. Within our net revenue growth of 15%, gross revenue grew
13% in line with volume and transaction drivers along with some contribution from pricing. Rebates and incentives
increased by 8%. As I said last quarter, the rebates and incentive line can move around on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
Similar to what we saw last quarter, there were a couple of factors impacting the growth rate in the quarter. First, while
we signed a significant number of contracts during the quarter, there were a few that we now expect to sign in the
fourth quarter instead of the third quarter. And second, we have a couple of contracts that paid out at a lower level of
incentives than in the past, very similar to last quarter.
Similar to the prior quarters, growth in domestic assessment was again driven by strong growth outside of the U.S. A
lot of this growth is coming from the work we're doing in places like Russia and South Africa around financial
inclusion. These countries will initially produce lower yielding transactions as people first use the cards at ATMs
before beginning to use them at merchants. And just one last note on revenue. Excluding pricing, cross-border revenue
growth was 9%. The result in GAAP between the cross-border volume and revenue growth numbers is mainly due to
the higher mix of inter-Europe activity.
So let me move to page 7 where you can see the total operating expenses were up 13% in the quarter, growing
significantly higher than in recent quarters. First, given the revenue growth that we saw in the third quarter, we took the
opportunity to increase our advertising and marketing. As a result, you can see that this line item is up by 16% mainly
due to higher media spend. And second, the 13% increase in G&A expenses continue to be primarily driven by
investments related to all aspect of our growth strategy.
Turning to slide 8, let's discuss what we've seen in October through this past Monday. Each of our business drivers is
slightly lower in this period compared to the third quarter, but when we adjust for the extra processing day that we have
in the third quarter of this year versus last year, the growth rates are actually very similar. For our processed volume
and transaction metrics only, that extra processing day provided a tailwind of about one to two percentage point to our
growth in Q3.
So here are the numbers. Through October 28, globally, our cross-border volumes grew about 18%. In the U.S., our
processed volume grew 9%. Processed volume growth outside of the U.S. grew 16%. And in particular, since I know
you are all very interested in that, our European processed volume growth continued in the teens, the range that we
have seen throughout 2013. And globally, processed transaction growth was 14%.
Looking forward, let's start with our long-term performance objectives for the 2013 to 2015 period, which has not
changed. We remain confident that our business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR, which still includes a
modest contribution from pricing over the three-year period and at least a 20% EPS CAGR. These growth rates are on a
constant currency basis and exclude any new acquisitions. We also remain committed to our annual operating margin
target of at least 50%.
So now, I'd like to share with you some thoughts about the rest of 2013, which has slightly improved versus what we
said at our September Investor Day. Given our strong – our continued stronger-than-expected net revenue growth and
the level of rebates and incentives we expect for the balance of the year, we now believe that second half net revenue
growth will be slightly better than the 12% growth rate that we produced in the first half. This includes an assumption
of a significantly higher growth rate and rebates and incentives in the fourth quarter versus what we have seen to date
this year, at least in the mid to high-teens range. We now anticipate total 2013 operating expenses to grow a bit more
than the 8% currency adjusted growth rate we had in 2012. As we are able to put a little more into A&M than we
planned and our G&A growth has proven to be more back-end loaded than we originally expected.

Even with this higher expense level, we still expect to deliver some operating margin expansion in 2013. And for your
modeling purposes, we continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 31%. So with respect to FX, the rates remain
similar to where we are today, that is, the euro trading at the 1.37 level and the Brazilian real at the 2.19 level for the
rest of the year, the net impact of the euro and the real would be a slight tailwind for the full year of 2013.
Now, let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?
Barbara L. Gasper
Thank you, Martina. We are now ready to begin the question-and-answer period. And in order to get to as many people
as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you maybe repeat – I wasn't quite sure you said
about cross-border, I think you said that revenue growth without pricing was only 9% compared to almost 20%
transaction growth. Is that correct, Martina?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: That is absolutely correct. And you know, this is exactly the trend that we have seen in
prior quarters. And this quarter was a bit more pronounced because actually our intra-European cross-border activity
grew fairly large versus the rest of the cross-border activity as well as when you have the appreciation of the euro
factored in, you see that the gap is widening.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Got you. And so my other question on the same topic was, can you give us any more
color around domestic?
The cross-border volume trend is almost 20% growth, it's phenomenal. Is most of that sequential increase Europe?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: You mean on domestic assessment?
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: No, still on cross-border transaction.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: No. All regions contributed in a very significant way to the cross-border volumes. But
when you just look at the intra-European volume just from a pure dollar point of view, it is larger than what you have in
general across the world.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Okay, got it. And then on a separate topic, I think you're...
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Chris, we're going to try to limit it to one question just to get through people. So please
queue back in.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Okay. No problem. Thanks.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Thanks, guys. Just a question on a couple of metrics. Can you just go into a little more
detail on the U.S. credit side of the story, because it was obviously great to see the acceleration there? I know you

mentioned both commercial and consumer accelerated but maybe you can parse that a little further. Which accelerated
more or kind of where you're running more precisely on U.S. consumer? And then can you just clarify if the processed
transaction growth actually accelerated in the month of September, because it looked like the full quarter number was
quite a bit better than the July, August mid-quarter update? Thanks.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So, Jason, Ajay. On the first part, the part about U.S. credit, the commercial credit of
course did pick up well, but the good news is that even in consumer credit, we saw continued positive improvement. In
fact, last quarter, we told you that our U.S. consumer credit was actually a very small growth rate. This quarter, it's
better than that. I'm actually not going to give you the exact number but it's headed in the right direction. It's not where
I'd like it to be, but it's headed in the right direction. On Investor Day, we told you we had won more than 60% of the
co-brands that have been up for bid in the U.S. Over the past 12 months, we haven't lost any where we were the
incumbent, that remains the case. In fact, we got a few extra as I just announced as well.
So we're kind of working on that. This is going to be, as I said, a bunch of doubles and singles and stolen bases but
appropriate for yesterday's World Series game although Chris McWilton is probably a happy boy given that his team
won. But it's a bunch of doubles and singles and stolen bases to get our share back to where it should be for a company
of our type. We have in the past lost share in that space and I've said so but we're making progress. And that's what's
giving our numbers here.
Commercial credit just continues to do well. And that's just the steady, steady growth in what we are doing in driving
our acceptance advantage, our capabilities with Smart Data. We've put people on the Street that actually go sell this
product with our issuers to different corporate clients as well as small businesses. And it's beginning to show the result
of the effort.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: And, Jason, with respect to your second question, actually, when you look at the July,
August and September data, processed transactions grew fairly similar. There was a little bit of an up one, down one
point. But it was very similar through the whole quarter, and is very similar to what we're actually seeing in October.
And this in both in the United States as well as outside of the United States, we're seeing these kind of improvements
over last quarter.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. Good morning. Just a question for Martina. I guess when I look at the domestic
assessment yield, that's been coming down quite a bit over the last couple of years. And I was just wondering at what
point it might stabilize, given the fact that you are seeing credit pick up and I guess the mix shift has played out a little
bit. Thank you.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, I mean, it's a good question. But we're doing this significant work around the
globe, in particular, in countries that have a lot of work – to be – happening on the financial inclusion side. And when
you look at these countries, South Africa, Nigeria or even when you go back into Russia, you know how this starts first,
right? You want to put the cards out to people first. They are going to get used first, how to use these cards, which will
be at ATMs. And that's where you're seeing a little bit of a lower yield coming in for ATM transactions.
And then we're working on the infrastructure for those consumers to be able to use the cards at merchants, which at that
point in time, you're starting to see some different pricing for those kind of transactions. So it's an evolution. And by
the way, Sanjay, if we are doing our job correctly that means expanding in those countries in a significant way, we
should continue to be seeing some of these factors coming through over time and not stopping.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thanks, good morning. Can you talk about how much of the strength that you saw in your U.S.
consumer – in your U.S. credit volume growth was driven by the success that you are having in the co-brand space
specifically? And how does the pipeline look for potential new co-brand wins? Has that dimmed, given all the wins
you've had recently, or do you still see room for growth, specifically in co-brand?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So there's room for growth, definitely. The co-brand business is a relatively large
business in the U.S., and there's a constant cycle of brands that come up for renewal. And we're in strong and
continuous dialogue, as are all our competitors in the space, with a very large number of merchants, as well as airlines,
hotels, and banks. So I think there's a long runway here for growth and possibilities.
I am not going to give you specific numbers on what came out of the growth specifically from the wins we had versus
what came out of general improvement in some of the underlying mix of our portfolios versus that of our consumers,
versus what came out from consumers going back to [ph] creditors (30:08). Those three are the big factors in there and
I'm not really going to give you specifics on that, but all three played a role.
Our mix, some of our stronger issuers have had better sales volume growth recovering over a period of time. We have
seen the consumer using credit a little more than they used to, although debit is still clearly growing very handsomely,
as is prepaid. But we've also seen the results of our first efforts around co-brands as those cards are getting replaced and
changed that their volumes are coming through. I would tell you that those volumes are smaller than the impact of the
first two topics just because it takes time after you win a deal to convert the cards onto our brand.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Yeah.

Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn T. Fodor>: Hi, good morning. Martina, just a quick question. Would you say a greater portion of the
investments you made this quarter are related to initiatives that you expect to drive revenue growth by 2015 that are
within your financial goals period, or were they more heavily weighted to longer-term type return projects that are
more in their infancy right now?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Glenn, It's really a mixture. As you know, we always look at investments that are in
the short-term bucket, which means that they're really returning over the next 12 months to 18 months a return; the
medium term bucket, which is more like a three-year to four-year timeframe; and the longer-term bucket, which is kind
of the five plus return. And so there are a number of things in there, as we did, but of course, when you see all of the
comments that we made about digital convergence and all the investments that have to go in there from a security and a
safety point of view, from a consumer – how you put the product together from a consumer and merchant experience
point of view, we do have, of course, some investments going in there and we'll see how that's going to play out for the
future but it's a mixture.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Glenn, things like tokenization will probably only pay back in terms of better consumer
experience and better fraud control out there in some period. When it's things like simplified commerce, if it gets
picked up well in the marketplace, which we are very hopeful of, then you will find that to be a more interesting item
closer in this period.
So it's actually a mixed bag of stuff, but that's not just this quarter. What's going on in our G&A line is the result of
continued and sustained investments organically and then some inorganically which then become organic in our base,
as we say, after a period of time. So Access Prepaid is now in our base. The money we put into expanding the

capabilities of Access Prepaid show up in our G&A line, whereas a new product, if you were to buy, once we conclude
the acquisition of Provus, that's going to show up for a while as separate from being in our base.
So it's actually a very complicated question to answer, but the way we manage this inside the company is we look at
our strategy, which we lay out for you on Investor Day, we make sure we've got adequate resources going towards the
basic elements in that strategy of new merchants, new consumers, digital-physical convergence, and all the spaces of
safety and security, and then we put a certain amount of energy into more short-term kind of growth and revenue. So
it's a mixed bag.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - David M. Togut>: Thank you. Ajay, could you size for us...
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: David, we can hardly hear you. Could you speak up, please?
<Q - David M. Togut>: Is that better?
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Much better.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Oh, yeah, much better.
<Q - David M. Togut>: Great. Could you size for us your European debit processing pipeline and in particular, are
there any large transactions that we might see on the horizon?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So I guess you're talking about the whole stuff in SEPA, right, what goes on there. The
fact is that we're now seeing domestic volumes in virtually every one of the SEPA countries. And as you know, a few
years back, we only saw cross-border. So in the third quarter, the processing of domestic Maestro transaction increased
by 19% in the SEPA region. We've grown in the Netherlands. We've had very attractive percentage of growth in
Austria and Belgium, but off a lower base. The Netherlands is actually the much higher base, as you'll remember, from
all the work we did.
So we're kind of moving along in that range, and we're going to keep, I think, getting breakthroughs in a number of
countries in this space. Acquisitions of things like Provus actually could be helpful in driving this number, as is all the
work that we have done with a similar company that we built up in Poland over the last four, five years. And those are
the kind of things that we're trying to do to get to a better play in those domestic transactions.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: And it's that one other region that you're really seeing or SEPA region that you're
really going to see in our numbers as we already said is really the Nordics and, in particular, Sweden. And that is on the
debit portfolio too.
<Q - David M. Togut>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding the cross-border volume growth that really
is separating itself from your largest competitor, the 13 consecutive wins you've had in China and the fact that that's
only cross-border, is that a major contributor to that separation? I obviously understand the intra-Europe discussion.
And also is the recent revelation regarding the NSA impacting any of your discussions with issuers around the globe?
Thanks.

<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Hey, Craig. So there's no doubt that China, as you know, is a pretty attractive
cross-border spending market. Every country around the world is targeting Chinese tourists. And so that's a pretty
obvious one. We have benefited certainly from that, but you know, in the context of our overall numbers, I don't want
to overstate the importance of China to our total numbers. We've got very good cross-border volume growth in every
region. And so China contributes to the Asian growth in terms of cross-border, but there's a lot of other countries in
Asia that are driving very attractive cross-border. I mean countries like Australia and New Zealand are outstanding in
cross-border volume growth. Countries across ASEAN are giving us good benefits. When you come to Latin America,
you've got growth. You go to Europe... so it's a mixed bag. I'd be careful to overstate the importance of one country.
But I love the position we're in, in China in terms of winning those co-brands, and we're still winning some despite all
the changes that are going on with the WTO ruling in China which, as you know, is still not completely clear where
that's going, but we're still winning some brands there.
The NSA discussion is a much deeper discussion, way beyond just us, but right now, we're not having a direct situation
with any issuers in countries overseas that impact us. I think the longer, bigger term issue for a lot of global companies
is that if the fears about privacy go to a point where people would attempt to find ways to have more localization, then
that certainly impacts the way that you construct your business model over time.
Now, we're a little more fortunate than some of our competitors in that when Bob Selander built the technology system
in our company, he built it in a distributed way, so more than 80% of our transactions in any country are approved at
local servers in that country, installed by us, called MIPS. And I have no idea what the damn thing stand for, it's
MasterCard something. But they are black boxes lying in different banks and retailers. I have been told the name and
what it stands for regularly. I keep forgetting it. So basically a black box with blinking lights there that helps you to
clear transactions locally.
And we download an intelligent logic into that regularly over the course of a day that enables us to say card number so
and so tends to behave like this, and therefore, a transaction that comes in of that type get approved locally, on soil, on
the ground, in that country. Very few transactions actually come back to St. Louis in our case, for being diagnosed and
approved. And during the time that we had, for example, an undersea cable break between Taiwan and the U.S., we
were able to dial that 80% to 100%. So our continuity of business is also better than a number of our competitors.
So we're using all those discussions as we're out there overseas, but you know that nationalistic tendencies are a
tendency not just in our industry but in a number of industries. So the NSA is just one small pimple on a dimple on the
ant's left cheek on that issue.

Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: How do I follow that comment? I was still laughing. I had to control myself. So I do just have
a – I have a broad-based question. Both yourselves and Visa have put forth in prepared remarks on the calls the safety
and security and the integrity of the network. And I am just wondering, is this just a push for your tokenization agenda,
or is there something else that's happened over the course of the past year even, where other technology players have
come in; they have seen how difficult it is. You guys act as the grownup in the room, and so they are kind of gravitating
back towards the security of the network. If you could just elaborate on that I would appreciate it.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So the timing of – the fact that Visa has this in yesterday's call and the fact that we're
talking about it today is just crazy coincidence. And I don't even know how, I think I should give Charlie a call after
this and say was he prescient or what? But I have no idea, right, about this. The fact is that tokenization happened in
this quarter. And to us, tokenization is a material change and move forward in the way that we believe as an industry,
not just Visa, us, and Amex, who put this out together, but even the issuing community with whom we've been in very
good dialogue with who frankly are very interested in this themselves.

The idea is to find a way, as you can clearly guess, to find a way to protect the weakest link in the security chain, which
is the smaller merchant who you cannot afford or you cannot expect them to spending the same kind of money as we
would on data encryption both at storage and in motion on the managing of that data and so on.
So we're trying to, as an industry, find a responsible way to help control that while at the same time allow for what I
believe in the digital world will be the Holy Grail, which is the least friction from a consumer's point of view, in how to
execute a transaction. Millennials these days don't like friction in hunting and shopping. And it's just a very important
part of what we're trying to go at.
So we talked about safety and security because of the tokenization event this quarter. I would otherwise have chosen a
different topic. I'm trying to pick one topic of interest every quarter to you guys, and talk about that in some depth. And
till I run out of topics, and I'll start again, but that's kind of what I am trying to do. And safety and security happened to
be the one for this quarter.
Now, the aspect of – our networks have great barriers of safety and security in terms of what we've built and invested
over a long period of time, and there are a lot of others who've said they could just do this business, realized that being
in the payments business is more than having a network of some type that exchanges data. Yes, absolutely for three,
four years now, we've been talking to mobile network operators, we've been talking to banks, we've talked to
merchants, we've talked to others and said what we bring to the table are our assets, one of which is the safety, security,
and reliability of our network. Because we've got other assets too, like the one I just described about how 80% of our
transactions are approved locally. And so some of our assets are common across the industry, some of our assets are
differentiated for us compared to others and we are certainly using all of them in our conversations.
<Q - Daniel R. Perlin>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn E. Greene>: Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple real quick. I guess from your comments, Martina,
sort of talking about the extra processing day in the quarter. I just want to be real clear, because obviously it was a topic
of conversation last night on Visa's call. But did you see any slowdown in volume trends toward the end of the quarter
and through October? It doesn't sound like it; I want to be clear on that. And then maybe you could just help us parse
the acceleration in the European volume trends with some particulars on the Eastern Europe part of the business, how
fast did that grow and what's the proportion of the European pie from Eastern and Central Europe at this point?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Okay. So first of all, for the first question, yes, there was, as I said, an extra processing
day in the third quarter, but when I look at July, August, and September, other than what we saw from an oil price
impact in the United States, we really haven't seen any significant impact from a change in the growth rates. It was
relatively even. You could see in September just being just a tad lower, but then you see it quite coming up in October
again. So truly, even when you adjust for the processing day, there wasn't really impact on that. And then when you
compare the third quarter versus October just to get a sense of how the fourth quarter is starting, again, very, very
similar growth [ph] scape (44:03) if you compare like-for-like, okay?
So on your second question, on the detail of growth in Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe for us, this is part of our
European region includes a lot of very high growth markets such as Russia, Poland, a number of other countries that are
sitting in Eastern Europe. And a lot of things that are driving there is that you have a lot of uses of cash, okay, quite
frankly, and they're putting all of those cards out in the market and people are getting more used to be using cards
rather than cash, right, from a security point of view, from a convenience point of view, from an ease point of view, et
cetera. And that is really what's driving our growth and we really have not seen any letting up in those kind of countries
from a growth perspective, and as long as we continue to do our work there, you should see quite a bit of contribution
from that secular trend coming.

The economic environment is, depending how it is. You guys know that we have three influences of growth: one is the
economic environment, the second is the secular trends, and the third is obviously market share. But we control the last
two things and that's what you're seeing, in particular, in that region.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: We're really trying very hard to influence the second one, which is the secular trend
compared to just waiting for this to happen due to population changes or urban demographics or middle class
demographics and so on. That's why the financial inclusion angle is such an important part of what we're doing and
why we're spending so much time, effort, and energy on it. So that's what we're trying to influence there. The share,
yes, that's what we're fighting for, and fortunately we're doing okay there. It's the economic trends that we don't control.
But, yes, Eastern European countries are growing for all those reasons.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. I was just thinking about rebates and incentives in the industry. I know Visa
yesterday highlighted a pickup for their fiscal year 2014 in rebates and incentives. Your rebates and incentives growth
rate for the first three quarters has been pretty modest. You talk about a little bit of a pickup in the fourth quarter. But I
guess the overriding question is, are you seeing a pickup in rebate and incentives in the industry? Because one of your
comments was that you thought rebates and incentives were lower in some contracts than in the past. So I'm just trying
to reconcile all these comments. Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: No, what we've – yeah, so first of all, I don't expect a significant change from our
rebates and incentives line point of view, when I look over the last three years and when I look in the future. And by the
way, all my comments on rebates and incentives are always included when I talk about our net revenues, right? We
don't really talk about growth and rebates in the sense that we talk about net revenues. So I don't see any major change.
We just had an interesting development here for the last couple of quarters in this year, which is that we had a couple of
contracts where customers did not perform to what the performance hurdles were in the contract, and therefore, we
didn't pay out the level of incentives that were agreed as part of the contract, okay? That was really what was driving.
When you pull that apart, our rebates and incentives line is really going back to the kind of growth rates that we had
produced over the last three years and that's what I have said now about the fourth quarter. We're going right back to
the kind of growth rates on rebates and incentives as what you have seen in the past, so no difference.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So really it's an in and out issue. Those couple of clients that we've had this conversation
with about performance versus contracts have made adequate difference with total numbers, as you are seeing this
change. You shouldn't expect that that should be something which persists in the future, because the fact of what
Martina is saying is the underlying conversations, the underlying deals being signed, the kind of rebates that go into
them, the construct of them may change from client to client. Some may be constructed one way, some the other way,
but basically they're there and going on.
And then the other big aspect of rebates and incentives, the damn thing is lumpy. You go sign a couple of big new
deals, and they're lumpy. You will get things come in that quarter which may not be quite what we expected. It is a
challenge with that line in our P&L.

Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Jeffrey>: Hi. Good morning. Ajay, just a follow-up or maybe a point of clarification on tokenization. I
understand the rationale and it makes perfect sense to me [indiscernible] (49:03) friction is an increasingly important
topic in payments and P2P and in other areas. I can't help but think a little bit in the back of my mind that tokenization
also offers a very convenient Trojan horse by which the established networks can perhaps smooth the path for
payments and increased security on traditional card-based payments, and simultaneously potentially throw up a
roadblock to some of the disruptors who might not be able to accommodate the tokenization technology that's being
advanced by the established participants. Am I way off in left field somewhere?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: You have a more devious mind than I do, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Jeffrey>: Perhaps that's too much time.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Yeah, no. Honestly, it's not coming in at that. I'll tell you it's a very simple issue. If you
go back to the days of introducing standards and mandates around requiring a certain level of payment system integrity
in the industry, which we put out, the idea was to enable issuers and merchants and not only enable, but ask them to
raise their thinking, their quality, and their capability in that space so we could help provide protection for consumer
data. That's where this is coming from.
And it's worked in some ways because a number of people have raised their bar. But frankly, it hasn't worked in others,
because smaller merchants, smaller banks, smaller acquirers, are always going to find it more difficult to keep pace
with what is a very well-funded industry, which is aiming at fraud. The digital world, the onset of a digital-physical
converging world, creates a whole new challenge in that space in terms of the number of different players and the way
data moves around among those players. All we are trying to do is to find a way to use our capacity and our capability
as banks and networks to provide a protection filter in this process.
Now, if you think back, Orbiscom, which we bought years ago, and had the ability to create virtual card numbers, or
the virtual card number facility that Citibank used to offer when I was still working there, for you to be able to purchase
things online by using a different card number, these are all elements of tokenization, the early elements. What you're
seeing us do now is a systemic methodological process-driven method for getting at tokenization where not only will
you get your current payment instrument, be it a card or your account or a fingerprint that's connected to your card or
whatever the heck it is, some account number in the sky will remain in the sky protected, and the data that will flow out
will flow out differently to different mobile devices that you choose to interact with.
So not only will your number never reach the last point in the chain, it will also reach differently for each device you
work with. And therefore, it gives me yet another methodology of preventing people from using numbers on the wrong
device, which you haven't registered your original account with, and so on and so forth.
So it's actually planning for tomorrow's world of digitization rather than the current world of digitization. So what we're
trying to do is to create these industry standards. There's going to be a ton of open APIs and the like that we are
working with. If you look at MasterPass, it's full of open APIs. The idea is to allow players in the industry to get our
standard as a fundamental system and then innovate on top of it, no differently, by the way, from what a lot of people
do in Silicon Valley. You create a standard, and you allow people to innovate on it. That's what we're trying to do. It's
quite the opposite of what you're thinking.

<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks, guys. Listen, I just want to touch on the other revenue line. It increased by a little
more than we expected and I think last quarter there were certain fees in there, the staged wallet fee and I think the
acquirer fee, one of the acquirer fees also that anniversaried. So I might have expected that growth rate to be a little bit
lower this quarter. Can you just give us a sense of what's driving that segment or that line?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, so first of all, Darrin, on the other income line – on the other income and
expense line, actually what we said at the beginning of the year is that you should be seeing a decrease actually going
into negative on this simply because we had – oh, I'm sorry.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Other revenue.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, we had other revenues. I'm sorry; I just missed your question. So from an other
revenue point of view...
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: I think you can answer both.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: I'll answer both.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: I thought I'd get two questions in one.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: There you go.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Exactly. So from an other revenue point of view that – you should continue to see
some of the things that are not really related to our volume-based business and our transaction-based business going
into here. So, for instance, some of the acquisitions that we made, from an Access Prepaid point of view, from a
DataCash point of view, et cetera, you would be seeing increases there. Pricing actually had a very, very, very little
impact on this. But over time, you should be seeing this number going up from a growth perspective.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Advisors revenue also comes in here.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yeah, advisors revenue in there. We have a number of information services we have in
here. So we have a number of other things in there.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay. So overall, that line could be growing at a faster than corporate pace?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: It depends, right? It depends how these businesses are basically developing and the
care and the feed that we've put into these businesses. They're more of our newer businesses. But all of that is pretty
much included in our net revenue performance objective target for the next three years.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: But for sure, if we can build our data and analytics business the right way, that's an
example – that's one of the items in other revenue.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Sure.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: And that should get a better percentage growth rate than the traditional transaction based
business.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Sure.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: In the beginning, at least, when it becomes of a certain size and scale. It's getting to a
decent number these days and so it's all there. These are all – it's all behind that other revenue line.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So given that I went off the track on this question, I think you all get a free one here.
So...

<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So other income and expenses. We have been saying for a number of quarters now that
you should really expect that line to be trending into negative territory because really we have some of our joint venture
activity in the investments that we make in those joint ventures, one of which has been since the Telefónica JV that we
have in Latin America, the two of them that we have. So you should be seeing that line trending down over time into
negative territory until we obviously get the return of the investment.
However, that trend has been masked this quarter. We had a couple of items in there that basically increased this line
item and you saw it in positive territory. There were really two things. One, we had some gains on some bonds that we
sold, so on the investment side. And two, we actually had some reversal of interest related to our FIN 48. So this is our
tax reserve accruals that we do from time to time. So – but other than that, when you pull those items out, you really
should again see that line item trending down.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: This reminds me of being in college when no matter what people asked me I answered
what I wanted to answer.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: [indiscernible] (56:26) all right.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Okay. Next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Hi. Thanks. Could you give us a little more color on what you're spending incrementally in
advertising and marketing? What – where you're finding opportunities? What you're doing differently?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Yeah, sure. Actually, in addition to the core base, we're doing a lot of things in A&M
and around changing the way our money was spent. So a fair amount of money has gone into activation-oriented
spending. That's why the Priceless Cities campaign started. It was being built out now in 26 plus cities and headed for
more. That costs us some money to create both the asset base in those cities but also the actual marketing locally in
those cities. And we keep building the asset base. So as I get an opportunity, I spend some money and put another city
on to the map, on the Priceless City area. That's one kind of thing.
Another one is we're changing the way we spend our money with sponsorships. And so earlier, we would pay a lot of
that money to the organization that facilitated the sponsorship. We've kind of changed that to say, let's spend the money
on activation in that location. So if you're watching the Red Sox game over the last few days with the Cardinals, you
would have seen Stand Up to Cancer coming up with us a couple of times in there. That's the kind of thing we're trying
to do. We're trying to get exposure and benefits of that exposure through partnering with the right kind of elements and
partners.
And then we're doing some money on traditional media advertising. You probably saw some advertising on our
Acceptance Matters campaign, because we believe we have a competitive advantage there over other players in the
commercial and T&E card space. So these are very targeted. They're all under the Priceless umbrella, but executed
based on opportunities we see at that time.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Okay. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
Operator
Okay. Our last question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hi. Good morning. I will try and keep it quick. Just one clarification and one follow-up. Just
on G&A was up a little bit. How much of that was driven by head count, Martina? Just trying to gauge how sustainable
that level is. And then just as a follow-up, just thinking about M&A. I know you talked about that a little bit at the
Investor Meeting, looking at PayPal buying Braintree; does MasterCard need to own a gateway in the U.S.? I have been
thinking about that topic a lot and thought I'd ask you on the call. Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Okay. I take the first question on G&A. So when you actually look, you know that
most of our G&A numbers really related to investments and people. I mean you look at the trajectory that we are in
terms of hiring rates in the United States since December 31 of 2012, we hired about 500 people at this point in time.
So you are seeing that coming in too and you should expect to see that coming into the fourth quarter too.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So we're hiring, Tien-tsin, across the world. I mean it's not just in the U.S. We're hiring
in different parts of the world. We're hiring in London and Singapore and so on and so forth to kind of get our footprint
improved, but also our technical and technological capacities. One little number that will give you a hint on that front is
four years ago, the millennials in our population were 4%. They're now 30% of our population in our employment
population. Not all caused by hiring. Part of it is caused by the acquisitions. DataCash and Access had a different age
profile. Truaxis had a different age profile but also by the hiring. And all the founded and hiring isn't incremental; some
of it is to replace the people who leave for various reasons. So it's a mixed bag. But there's a lot of money that's going
into the people, there's a lot of money going into technology. So tokenization is a required investment. It's a real
technological platform that's been invested and sustained and will require investment for a little period of time to come.
So there's a lot of that going on.
As far as the gateway question is concerned, you're absolutely right. But I'd love to get into a bigger gateway position
in the United States. The fact is we've got – now that we feel comfortable with where we are with DataCash and MiGS.
We have MiGS earlier, if you remember, we bought DataCash. Put them together. We've got that management team
pretty well organized. They are doing a very good job of executing, and they've entered into Latin America and they've
entered into a few global merchants, including some in the U.S.
So there are lots of ways to get into that space, and one of those could be not just through buying gateway, but buying
adjacent businesses that allow our gateway capability to connect well with that adjacent business to get a footprint into
the U.S. And so we're working on a ton of those ideas and just one of them hasn't fructified yet and hasn't come in at
the value that I'd be happy to pay for some of the things that have got acquired by other people.
Barbara L. Gasper
Okay. Ajay?
Ajaypal Singh Banga
Do you want me to keep going? After that brilliant comment on MIGS? Okay. So I'll leave you with a few closing
thoughts that go beyond MIPS. We are pleased with our solid third quarter results. We are, as Martina said, we've used
the opportunity to put some money back into A&M, but we're also continuing to invest in a more sustained way in the
longer-term aspects of our business. And she and I talked about this in some detail, she in particular, at the Investor
Day when she laid out the manner of which our investments were going. Those, in essence, can be organic in areas
such as the convergence of physical and digital or in areas like technology that support safety and security. But they
can also be through acquisitions like Truaxis and Access Prepaid. And we've recently announced Provus, which hasn't
got, as you know, approved yet. Hopefully, we'll get it all sorted out in the fourth quarter and we can talk about it after
that.
So these are only a few examples of many initiatives that we're into that hopefully should drive long-term growth. And
it connects back to the kind of question Tien-tsin just asked about how we're trying to grow. Our business continues to
have strong momentum. We're focused on delivering another good year and I just want to thank you for your support
