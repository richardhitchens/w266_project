Note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margins, operating
expenses, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the
most directly comparable GAAP measures in the web deck posted in the Investor Relations section at dell.com and in
our press release and 8-K filed today. I encourage you to review these documents. Please also note that unless
otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress.
Consistent with last quarter, we will not take any questions on the pending transaction to take the company private.
Now I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden
Thanks, Rob. As we head into the new fiscal year, we continue to execute our strategy to be the leading provider of
end-to-end scalable solutions. Our strategy is differentiated based on our focus on practical innovation, efficient and
affordable solutions, and our superior customer relationship model.
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we delivered revenue of $14.1 billion, down 2%. The Enterprise Solutions,
Services, & Software business was up 12% to $5.5 billion. Our continued focus on our customers and our ability to
meet their needs with differentiated solutions is evident in numerous customer wins that Tom will highlight in the
segment section later.
Over the past few years, we've acquired many new capabilities in areas like scalable storage solutions, application
migration, and software. We continue to invest in strategic capabilities additionally. And less than two weeks ago, we
announced and closed the acquisition of Enstratius, which improves our end-to-end solutions capabilities by enabling
our customers to more effectively manage and integrate their cloud environments.
I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures going forward. Gross margin was $2.9 billion, at 20.6% of revenue, which
was down 40 basis points sequentially when adjusting for last quarter's vendor settlements. We continued to face a
competitive pricing environment and have aligned our pricing strategy to invest in growth ahead of planned reductions
in our cost structure, and this has affected our profitability. We remain focused on pursuing strategic revenue
opportunities that will drive long-term profitability and cash flow.
SG&A increased 4% and as a percentage of revenue increased 20 basis points sequentially to 14.2%. R&D spending
increased 33% and as a percent of revenue increased 10 basis points sequentially to 2.2%. Of note, there were almost
$90 million in expenses related to the pending go-private transaction that were excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Operating income was $590 million or 4.2% of revenue. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 28.7% is driven by a greater
portion of our business in higher tax jurisdictions during the quarter. Earnings per share were $0.21, declining 51%.
Cash used in operations in the quarter was $39 million, as the first quarter is typically a seasonal low for cash flow. On
a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.4 billion, down 31%. Our cash and investments balance
ended at $13.2 billion, as we repaid approximately $2 billion in debt during the quarter.
Now let me turn to our operating segment results. As we announced in February, this is the first quarter we're reporting
results under the new segment structure. We have aligned our operating segments to our end-to-end solutions portfolio
in the Enterprise Solutions Group, Dell Services, Dell Software, and End User Computing group.
The Enterprise Solutions Group and the End User Computing Group receive revenue from Dell Services to align our
reporting structure and drive accountability in each of the respective operating segments. As a result, the sum of our
operating segment revenue will not equal our consolidated non-GAAP results. In addition, there are unallocated costs
that remain at a corporate level that are reconciling items between the total segment and consolidated operating income.
The reconciliation of all these items to our consolidated results can be found in the tables that are available on the Dell
Investor Relations website.
Now let me turn it over to Tom Sweet, who will take you through our new business segment results.

Thomas W. Sweet
Thanks, Brian. Let me take you through the financial results for each segment, and I will also share a few important
customer wins. Let's start with the Enterprise Solutions Group, or ESG. This business includes servers, networking,
storage, and ESG related peripherals. We continued to see strong growth in ESG of 10% on revenue of $3.1 billion and
operating income of $136 million, or 4.4% of revenue. Within ESG, our server, networking, and enterprise peripheral
business delivered revenue of $2.7 billion, which equates to 14% growth. This was driven by strong growth in our
hyperscale data center servers. In this space, Dell servers power four of the top five search engines and 75% of the top
social media sites worldwide.
Our networking business increased 24% on strong Force10 results. This represents the ninth straight quarter of both
year-over-year and sequential growth in this business.
Dell storage revenue was down 10% to $424 million. We are focused on continuing to more effectively position the
right solutions based on customer needs and optimizing our selling motion to improve revenue momentum. While we
have made progress, we have more work to do in this area.
The ESG market is rapidly changing and migrating to converged solutions that blur the lines between traditional
product sets. A great example of this was a win with Statoil Norway as our global capabilities and converged solutions
displaced legacy vendors in each of the traditional product sets. We are now rolling out a solution that includes Dell
branded servers, storage, and networking for their new data centers in 70 locations worldwide.
The services business includes a broad range of IT and business services, including support and deployment services,
infrastructure, cloud, security services, application, and business process services. This business was up 2% to $2.1
billion. OpInc for this business increased to $370 million or 17.6% of revenue, up from 16.3% of revenue in the first
quarter of last year. We have been reshaping this portfolio to focus on more profitable solutions that are aligned to our
strategic capabilities, and we continue to improve our cost structure.
Within services, support and deployment increased 2% with revenue of $1.2 billion. Enhanced and new solutions such
as ProSupport Plus are adding capabilities to our portfolio that focus on proactively improving the performance and
stability of critical systems by leveraging our expertise and deep understanding of the customer's IT environment.
These solutions and strong attach rates have resulted in revenue streams, partially mitigating the downward pressure
caused by the decline in EUC hardware sales.
Infrastructure, cloud, and security services were up 11% to $612 million, which includes an increase of 20% in our
security business. Security continues to be one of the top concerns of our customers, and we have continued to develop
and deliver new and innovative solutions to accommodate the constantly changing threats.
We had a 15% decline and our apps and BPO business, driven by a divestiture and select contract expirations as we
continue working to improve the profitability of this business.
Our services capabilities combined with our vertical expertise continue to position us well to address the needs of our
customers. A great example of this was a win with UK-based Locala Community Partnerships, a social enterprise that
delivers community healthcare to over 400,000 people. Our solution focused on improving the management of patient
records and simplifying their IT environment by delivering customized services, hardware, and software through a
cloud-based solution.
Our software business includes systems management, security software solutions, and information management. This
business delivered revenue of $295 million and an operating loss of $85 million for the quarter. Consistent with our
prior communication and business plan, we remain confident that the Quest acquisition will be accretive in the first
quarter of fiscal year 2015 as we invest to grow the business. We are enhancing our software capabilities and increasing
our investment in this business with additional sales capacity and R&D. Software is the glue for many of our
end-to-end solutions, and it will play an increasingly important role in our competitive differentiation.

Our End User Computing business, or EUC, includes desktops, including thin client, notebooks, including tablets,
third-party software, and client related peripherals. This business delivered revenue of $8.9 billion, down 9%.
Operating income of $224 million was down 65%, at 2.5% of revenue.
As we discussed last quarter, we are investing and acquiring new customer accounts that will benefit our long-term
profitability and cash flow. We continue to expect relatively weak demand in this business and continued market
competitiveness. These dynamics reinforce the importance of our cost-out initiatives for EUC, where we are targeting
greater than $1 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2015. In addition, during the quarter we increased our investment
to improve sales coverage for key areas of the business.
The desktop and thin client business revenue was $3.3 billion, down 2%. The trajectory of the desktop business
continues to improve as we maintain a strong position in the traditional desktop space and are seeing good traction with
new desktop form factors, such as our innovative all-in-one designs.
Mobility revenue of $3.6 billion was down 16%, as demand in this space continues to be pressured by customers
diverting spending to alternative mobile solutions. We are encouraged by the industry-based enhancements coming to
the notebook touch ecosystem, and we will bring new and innovative solutions to the market to enhance our position in
this space. We are seeing a good ramp in our tablet-based solutions, led by our Latitude 10 business-focused tablet.
Our third-party software and EUC peripherals delivered revenue of $2 billion, down 6%. A great example of our ability
to deliver differentiated solutions for our customers is a recently awarded $60 million client refresh with Marsh &
McLennan. We were able to offer a broad array of EUC solutions, including our Latitude notebooks, OptiPlex
desktops, as well as Precision workstations and XPS systems for higher-end users. Our warranty, product quality,
value, and partnership were all key points of differentiation. We will be rolling out these solutions to 55,000 end users
globally, displacing a key competitor that was a longtime incumbent.
Before I turn it back to Rob, I want to remind everyone that consistent with last quarter, given our pending merger
agreement, we will not be providing an outlook. Now I'll turn it back to Rob to begin Q&A.
Robert L. Williams II
Thanks, Tom. Please limit your questions to one with no follow-ups. Mackenzie, can we have the first question?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Given the significant change in profitability, can you just take a
step back and talk about whether the margin deterioration this quarter is what you expected when you rolled out a more
aggressive pricing strategy? And if it was what you expected, can you just go into a little bit more detail around what it
is you're trying to accomplish given that segment operating income dollars were almost cut in half and it still didn't
drive top line growth? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Katy, I would say we've been talking about this for a couple quarters about our need to
adjust pricing. We did that. You saw some of that last quarter. It was affected by the settlements that we had as well,
and it wasn't quite as apparent in the P&L. But clearly, we've been focused on this for a while.
I think there are parts of the business where we are beginning to see some elasticity. Demand has been, I would say,
weaker than we expected as we headed into the year. And I think the reality is in many cases, these are accounts that
we're gaining that we feel very good about the long-term profitability and the impact on our cash flow over time. So
while we may not see that showing up as a positive in the P&L in the short term, we think for the long term, it's the

right thing to do to get ourselves back in price position to scale the business. And I think as you look at the sheer
dynamics that played out in the first quarter, we actually did improve our position on a share basis in a market that's
pretty tough; so a fairly conscious effort to position the business and something we've been working on for few quarters
now.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to follow up on that. Is there a minimum acceptable level of
profitability in the End User Computing Group that you are willing to sustain on an ongoing basis in your effort to hold
or gain share? And related to that, you talked about making investments in advance of your cost-cutting. I think a year
ago at your Analyst Day, you talked about this cost-cutting. Given that you've started to be more price aggressive, why
have you not been able to undertake any of this cost-cutting to date? What's holding you back, and wouldn't it make a
lot more sense to be doing the cost-cutting and more aggressive pricing concurrently?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Toni. Look, I wouldn't – without providing the details of the specific initiatives, I
wouldn't say we haven't executed on the cost initiatives. I think we have continued to take cost out of the business. We
are just choosing consciously to reinvest those dollars in sales resources and R&D resources in the software business,
things that we've talked about over time being important to the future of the company. So I think those things are going
on concurrently. And in this time right now, we've chosen to reinvest those savings that we're driving as part of that
initiative and important investments for the future of the company. That's just what we've decided to do.
In terms of profitability, and I assume you're talking about the EUC business, look, I think we're not managing that
business for one quarter at a time. I think there's a network effect to the impact of what we do there and the scale of that
business and the customer relationships that we gain. We are clearly focused on cost in that business. In this
environment, we have been focused on gaining and improving the growth of that business and gaining share. We've
been able to do that. And as we execute on cost and continue to execute the strategy there, we're confident that will be
an important part of the portfolio, but not focused on a 90-day target relative to the profitability of that business.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Thanks. I guess following up on pricing, Brian, maybe just talk about why Dell has
embraced such an abrupt change in pricing strategy in the client business the last two quarters. What has really caused
such a sharp change in management's thinking? And related to that, how much of this is self-inflicted to retain
customers during this period of uncertainty, and how much of this would you say is market driven?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think it's hard to separate those two, Brian. As you think about how market dynamics play
out, clearly there are parts of the business, segments of the business where we are being more aggressive. And we
recognize that places where we have a strong foothold or historically have had a strong foothold and can ultimately
build on those relationships and benefit the entire portfolio of solutions, those are places where clearly we'd like to be a
bit more aggressive and have over the last couple quarters.
I wouldn't say this has been an abrupt change. Clearly recognizing as demand weakened over the course of the last
year, we've recognized the need to stop shrinking at a rate faster than the market. And we've made those adjustments
over the course of a few different quarters here and have seen the impact of that improve in terms of growth rates and at
the same time impact short-term profitability for sure.

We'll take our next question from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thank you. Can you talk about your customer engagements and how those discussions are
going in light of everything that's happening? How much of your time is being spent explaining what's happening? And
are customers showing any indication of potentially holding out or lengthening sales cycles, just to wait and see what
happens? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Maynard. I think in general the customer base has been very supportive of the
company. And long-term relationships, the quality of our solutions, the new solutions we're adding to the portfolio have
really carried those relationships. Not to say there aren't some areas where we've seen questions and we've had to spend
time with customers; we've looked at it as a chance to spend more time with our customers and to make sure they're
comfortable with the strategy of the company and where we're taking it. And I would say for those conversations that
I've been part of, those have been very good conversations that in many cases have resulted in more opportunities for
the company.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Could you talk more about your increased investment in sales and
distribution in key regions and segments?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: This isn't new, Shannon. We've been adding resources in the sales model really over the last
couple years. And some of that was adding specialist capability around key technologies that we've been adding to the
portfolio and doing that organically. But also many of the acquisitions, obviously, have brought capability from a
commercial standpoint with them. That has been one primary focus. I think the other is some specific regions and
sub-segments of the market where we've got strong capability. And where we've seen good progress in terms of
building out and adding salespeople, we have not hesitated to add more. And tracking the progress and productivity of
those sales resources, making sure they're delivering and bringing new business to the company, and really taking
advantage of places where we have strength has been the focus.
Clearly, the acquisition of Quest and the software business has brought significant sales capacity to the company, and
that has been one big area. And as you know and we've talked about a lot, the mid-market is a place where we have
focused and added resources as well.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Steve Milunovich with UBS.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. Back to the end-user pricing question, could you give a sense how much of
a strategic change this is because in the proxy materials, one of your consultants suggested shifting from a margin to a
margin dollar, more commodity-driven strategy, and we're obviously seeing some of that. Michael Dell has indicated
apparently that he's going to endorse that approach and shift. So on a scale from 0% which is no change to 100% which
is a complete change, are you tweaking things now, or do you feel like this is really taking it to the full extent that we're
likely to see over time in terms of going after more of a low-end strategy?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes look, Steve, I wouldn't say our strategy has changed really at all. I think tactically we've
recognized the need to be competitive. We've adjusted our pricing appropriately. We are expanding our offerings
across the portfolio of really offerings at high price bands or higher value products, mid-value products, lower value
products to play in key markets around the world, as we've done over time, and I think you'll continue to see us do that.
This is not a new strategy. This is not a new business model for us. I would say it's adjusting tactics given what the
market is doing and really where we need to be in the portfolio.

<A - Robert L. Williams II>: And, Steve, I would say that I think it's fair to say that when you think about our
portfolio of customers, the vast majority of those being commercial customers on a global basis, as we've thought
through and made decisions to increase our focus on those customers, there's acquisition business that you engage in.
And as Brian alluded to earlier, you think it's absolutely the right thing to do for the long term, but these are accounts
that you have to go out and take a different tack and a pricing strategy with them, and that's often to provide an entry
level into that account. And so I think you're seeing a little bit of that in the P&L.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you. Brian, just a couple of follow-ups from everything that has been asked today.
One of them is just on the end-user computing side. I take the point you're not managing the business for the next 90
days, and that's quite clear. But I guess in terms of this pursuit of new customers, can you speak about where we are in
that process? Have you put the investments in sales, pricing, or otherwise that you need to, or is there significant more
amount of that effort to come through? That's one question.
And the second one is just at the broad level. Given the uncertainty that's going on at Dell over the last few months, I
understand that sales cycles may not have lengthened. But what financial impact would you say is happening or having
on either your results or on how you're managing the business from a cost perspective? I'm trying to understand, with
the margins that you are producing overall now, they are lower than we've seen for some time. And some of that is
market, but some of that I think has to be down to what's been going on with Dell. So any kind of insight there you can
provide would be helpful.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I'll try to answer the second part first, Kulbinder. We haven't changed the way we're
running the business. The strategy for the company has endured, and I would say we continue to adapt that strategy
given the market conditions and things that we learn as we go. But we have made no changes to the strategy in how
we're running the company as a result of this process. I think that's clear. And I would say it's very difficult to quantify
what impact the process that we're going through has had on the results of the company. We did call out incremental
costs that we're incurring, the transaction costs that we've excluded from our non-GAAP reporting. But clearly, there is
a chance to spend more time with customers and some level of customer – just uncertainty that we are working our way
through. That said, we feel like we've done a good job with that during this period.
In terms of the EUC business and where we're positioned and where we are in that, I think, look, we've made a
conscious decision here to improve the competitiveness and specifically the pricing. We've got a lot of ongoing work
around the productivity and cost structure of that business that will continue to allow us to be competitive there. And I
don't think this is something that we think about as an initiative. I think it's really how we run the business and quarter
to quarter manage the market conditions and the demand environment that we're in.
<A - Robert L. Williams II>: I would also offer that acquiring new customers and continuing to build that acquisition
pipeline is an ongoing and continual effort. It's just not just a one-quarter or a two-quarter effort. You build the
acquisition pipeline, you continue to acquire new customers, and you migrate those customers up to your business
model and your other LOBs [lines of business]. So I think that process continues.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: And to some extent, we over some period of time as we were driving the business, had in
some ways lost that ability to do the acquisition investments that we really needed. So we've had obviously some
success there, and we're getting a lot of very positive feedback from customers as we get back into that part of our
business.

<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Thanks very much. Brian, I wanted to ask about servers and whether or not you see a
similar type of opportunity to drive some of elasticity of demand around pricing servers a bit more aggressively. And
related to that, in the whole strategy of attaching incremental products to that base, I'm curious to understand what's
happening in storage. It doesn't seem like you're getting that attach to the installed base that you had hoped for in
storage, particularly with the Dell branded IP. Can you talk a little bit about that as well? Thanks a lot.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Chris. Clearly, the server business has had a nice run. This for us is the ninth
consecutive quarter of solid growth there. The 12th-generation servers that we launched about a year ago have
contributed very nicely to the ramp in that business. They have, as we've talked about before, helped us improve our
average selling price in that business, move to higher-end workloads within the server space, and that has all been part
of very strong progress. And we think we're winning in the marketplace as a result of the technology and how we're
positioned with that product.
In addition, when you look at density-optimized servers, that market is growing very, very quickly, and that has as well
contributed to the growth in this business. We see that as an important part of our offering and continue to make
investments there. So the server business is in a good spot. And we feel good about the technology, and it's not really a
place where you see us trading at the low end, price for growth there. I think we're growing on the basis of the
technology.
The storage business I think is a little bit different discussion. We feel like that business is growing about in line with
the market. It's shrinking at the market. The market is shrinking, and we're seeing that from the data we see in the
market right now. I would say that's not what we'd like to see obviously, and that's not acceptable to us. We've got
some things from an execution standpoint in the business that we are working on. We're confident in the portfolio.
We've added commercial resources over the last really 18 months in this business. And we feel like we're positioned to
actually outperform the market. Again, there are some execution things we're working through, and we expect to see
that as we move forward.

We'll take our next question from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montréal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, guys. Number one, Brian, can you talk a little bit about how your M&A strategy might
differ if this transaction goes through versus would not? How might the incremental debt make you think about
conducting M&A? And just a clarification to add onto that, can you talk about what your employee retention has been
during this time of uncertainty, shall we say, over the last few months while this deal is being contemplated?
<A - Robert L. Williams II>: Hi, Keith. It's Rob. I appreciate your question and your interest. But given the current
situation and the pending transaction, we're really not going to comment on that or any of the material information
that's related to the transaction. So you're welcome to take another crack at another question or you can drop back in the
queue and we'll come back to you.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: How about just employee retention over the last three months, Rob? Can you address that,
if employees are sticking on board?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Keith, it's Brian. I would say attrition has been about normal for us, so we haven't seen
unusual attrition.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, that's it for me.
<A - Robert L. Williams II>: Thanks, Keith.

<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I was wondering if we
could just get your thoughts I guess on the PC market over the next four to six quarters. Do you think it gets softer? Do
you think it gets stronger? And if it were to get meaningfully softer from here, would that move you to reconsider the
pricing strategy that you've employed the last couple of quarters? Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, Look, I think it's a good question and it's one we've spent a lot of time debating and
talking about. There are multiple dynamics playing out. I think you continue to see Win 7 on the commercial side of the
business that's driving a refresh cycle. But at the same time and I would say even recently, we're seeing improved
demand on the corporate and SMB markets. But you look at consumer, you look at government, you look at federal,
those have been rather challenged. And it's some of the things we've been talking about over the last few quarters where
you have competing devices in some cases. Windows 8 has been from our standpoint not necessarily the catalyst to
drive accelerated growth that we had hoped it would be.
We're encouraged by what's going to play out with new chipsets and some the work that's going on within the Windows
ecosystem to hopefully over the next few months create some catalysts. But you look at the recent external data from
any of the third-party sources. We would expect to continue to see over the next few quarters year-over-year declines in
PC demand. And I think that's – we're trying to run the business based on that and be in a position where we're in this
thing for the long term and we've positioned the business for success for the long term.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Got it, thanks a lot.

We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just real quickly on your new Software segment group,
last quarter you talked about Quest actually performing better than your initial plan of $180 million to $200 million.
Can you update us on the performance of Quest in the quarter? And then also how are we to think about the
profitability in that segment with a negative 29% operating margin this quarter?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, look, I think it's progressing as we expected. And as we said in the talking points, we
expect to be accretive to the company in the first quarter next fiscal year. That was the plan we talked about when we
announced the acquisition, and we're tracking towards that. I think the plan that we've put together for that business
with John Swainson clearly does have incremental investment as we look at adding R&D resources, as we look at more
sales capacity in that business, and it's got to grow into the cost structure that we have in the software business. That's
the way we're thinking about it. I would say we're tracking to that and the team is making good progress there, and we
still feel good about this. Now the operating loss in the quarter, that's what we had expected as we put this business
together and really got it started up. So we feel good about it.

We'll take our next question from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, thanks guys. I wanted to get some color on how you're targeting these pricing actions
we've been discussing. Can you give us perhaps an example of how you determine which accounts are strategic enough
for aggressive client pricing, at least pricing that's beyond the norm in terms of discounting, and then what areas you
may be more focused on profit preservation? I'm just trying to figure out where you draw the line, so to speak, in terms
of profit versus market share focus.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, I'll give you a couple thoughts, Bill. I think we know where long-term strategic
accounts are where we can really leverage the relationship and being in as the leader on the client side creates nice
pull-through in other parts of the portfolio. In many cases, those are places that we've been before and had that business

and in many ways over the last couple of years walked away. So I would say those are obvious places that we know we
can actually create a nice network effect for us and sell the broader set of solutions as well, including the services. So I
think we've been somewhat selective and tried to focus in that part of the business. There are clearly unit volume
opportunities in places like consumer through indirect channels where we could sell a lot of units, but those don't really
create for us any other profit or cash flow benefits. And therefore, we're going to prioritize accounts where we can get
that broader network benefit.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities.
<Q - Abhey Lamba>: Yes, thanks. Brian, you talked about corporate demand for PCs doing well. Can you touch upon,
is there a risk of it falling off in a few quarters as people have migrated over to Win 7? And part of that, can you also
talk about desktop virtualization? What are you seeing in the market for that? And what are your expectations for that
given your thin client business?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: I think the data would suggest there's still a significant Win 7 refresh opportunity over the
next year really until XP is sort of retired. We look at that in our discussions with customers. In many cases, they
pushed those decisions out, and they're catching up now and have to get that done in the next year. Beyond that,
obviously it becomes a broader opportunity around touch and how that plays out in the corporate customer base,
whether it's tablets or whether it's the next-generation Windows 8 kinds of devices. So again, it's really up to us to
create that opportunity and that ecosystem to drive that growth going forward with great products and great technology
there. But I think that's clearly something we're watching. And it was for us as we headed into the new budget year for
corporate customers, something we expected to see was some of that Windows 7 work had to happen, and we're
starting to see some of that.
<Q - Abhey Lamba>: And desktop virtualization?
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: Yes, desktop virtualization continues to be a space that is I think of high interest to our
customers in some parts of their business. And there's a lot of customers that are looking at desktop virtualization for
key subsets of their workforce where the work fits into that kind of a model, very few customers looking at broad
company-wide desktop virtualization kinds of implementations. So we're seeing good demand there. The Wyse
business is performing well for us. And an important part of our offering as you think about broader end-user
computing devices.
<A - Robert L. Williams II>: I think we're also happy with the pull through from the Wyse devices into our ESG
business in terms of our server and data center business. So we have seen good attach and good connectivity between
those two product lines. Great, thanks, and just we want to be respectful of Brocade, who has a call starting in just a
few minutes. So, Mackenzie, let's take one more question.

We'll now take our final question from Brian Marshall with ISI Group.
<Q - Stephen Patel>: Hi, thanks. This is Stephen Patel calling in for Brian. I've got a question on your support and
deployment revenue. It was up a little bit in the quarter; and if you have any thoughts on how sustainable that is in light
of the decline in PC units and whether we can continue seeing increased attach rates going forward. Thanks.
<A - Thomas W. Sweet>: Hey, Brian (sic) [Stephen]. It's Tom. I would tell you that we're happy with the attach rate
and the SRUs we've been able to drive off of that services business. The team is doing a great job of creating new and
innovative offers like the ProSupport Plus and some of the other types of products that we're rolling out. As a result of

that, we've been able to keep the attach rate relatively high and pretty happy with the pricing that goes with that. So
despite some pressure from the downward unit volume, it has been a good business for us, and I think we continue to
believe it will continue to be a good business.
<A - Brian T. Gladden>: And we're seeing good growth on support and deployment on the enterprise side of the
business and nice attach rates there. So we think there are opportunities to continue to grow that business even going
forward.
