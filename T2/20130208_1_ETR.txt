MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's
call is being recorded.
At this time, for instructions and opening comments, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor
Relations, Ms. Paula Waters. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Paula Waters
Good morning and thank you for joining us. We'll begin today with comments from Entergy's Chairman and CEO, Leo
Denault; and then Drew Marsh, our CFO, will review results.
In an effort to accommodate everyone with questions this morning, we request that each person ask no more than two
questions. As part of today's conference call, Entergy Corporation makes certain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve a number of
risks and uncertainties. And there are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or
implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. On September 25, 2012, ITC
Holdings Corp. filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, registering shares of ITC common stock to be
issued to Entergy's shareholders in connection with the proposed spin/merge of our transmission business with ITC, but
this registration statement has not become effective. In addition, our subsidiary Mid South TransCo will file a
registration statement with the SEC registering TransCo common units to be issued to Entergy's shareholders in
connection with the proposed transactions.

Entergy shareholders are urged to read the proxy statement prospectus included in the ITC registration statement and
the prospectus to be included in the TransCo registration statement and other relevant documents when available,
because they contain important information about ITC, TransCo, and the proposed transactions. These documents,
when they are available, can be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and can also be
obtained free of charge upon written request to Entergy or ITC.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Leo Denault
Thank you, Paula. Good morning, everyone. Today marks the turning of the page in Entergy's story. Last week, Wayne
Leonard officially retired after a long and successful career that spanned nearly 40 years. He leaves behind a legacy as
a tremendous and inspiring leader to all of us. Rick Smith also retired last week. Both Wayne and Rick will be missed.
They will be missed not only because of their tremendous leadership and counsel, but also as dear friends of the many
of us they have touched throughout more than a decade here at Entergy. That said, they leave the company and the
management team well prepared for the challenges and opportunities ahead.
As a result, we have two new participants on the call with us today, Drew Marsh, Chief Financial Officer, who you will
hear from shortly to review results; and Bill Mohl, President of Entergy Wholesale Commodities who assumed the top
EWC box from Rick. They join those you already know, Rod West, our Chief Administrative Officer; Theo Bunting,
Group President of Utility Operations; Mark Savoff, Chief Operating Officer; Renae Conley, Executive Vice President
of Human Resources and Administration; and Marcus Brown, General Counsel.
Also with me today for his last earnings call is John Herron. When he announced his retirement as our Chief Nuclear
Officer in December, John agreed to stay on through March to help with the transition. During his 12 years at Entergy
and over his 33-year career, John made significant contributions to safe and successful nuclear operations. Most
recently, he oversaw the nuclear organization through two major construction projects completed last year; the
178-megawatt Grand Gulf upgrade in June and the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project in December.
John is succeeded by Jeff Forbes. Over the past 14 years, the depth of our nuclear leadership has been clear through
seamless transition at the Chief Nuclear Officer role. We have no doubt and time is right for Jeff to take the reins. You
will meet and get to know Jeff in future earnings calls and conferences and other events.
I've said before but it bears repeating. One of the greatest gifts Wayne left to me was this leadership team. Together we
have a combined industry experience of nearly 240 years. We are facing a period of not just the well-documented
challenges, but also opportunities. I know the team assembled here today is up to the task. Everyone is focused on one
overarching goal, to create sustainable value for our four key stakeholders; our owners, our customers, our
communities, and our employees. I know all of those stakeholders are listening in today. And many of you have asked
what would change, undoubtedly some things will.
First of all, the world around us will continue to evolve. Entergy's point of view driven business focus that led to
significant value created over the last 14 years will not change. It is designed to identify and adapt to changes in our
business, technology, economy, and a host of other factors. But I can also promise you this, our values as a company
will not change. Safety is the top priority. I can also assure you, we will never change our commitment to integrity, to
transparency, to community service, and to just doing the right thing.
Another thing that won't change is our commitment to successfully execute on the initiatives before us now. And now
as in the past, I'll give you an update on where things stand. But before I get there, let me take a quick moment to talk
about what's been in the news a lot since Sunday night and that's the power outage that occurred during the Super
Bowl.
We spent the past week doing everything we can to see what happened and you might have seen this morning that we
traced the cause of Sunday's outage to an electrical relay device. We've now taken the device out of service and we

certainly do regret the interruption that occurred that night. Overall, the Super Bowl game itself and the festivities
surrounding was a huge success. We're also proud to have been a part of it and thought the city did a fabulous job. A
true showcase for a city ideally suited for such events. Our objective like everyone else's is to get the Super Bowl back
in New Orleans in 2018, the 300th anniversary of the city.
Now, moving to our proposal for each utility operating company to join the Midwest Independent Transmission System
Operator, or MISO following favorable actions by Louisiana Public Service Commission, the Public Utility
Commission of Texas, and the Arkansas Public Service Commission, a milestone was reached on November 15.
On that day, the Mississippi Public Service Commission and the City Council of New Orleans granted their approvals
of the MISO request subject to certain conditions. The teams are fully focused on completing the numerous operational
and regulatory steps required for cutover to MISO on December 19 of this year.
Following the PUCT's decision granting Entergy Texas' application to transfer operational control of its transmission
assets to MISO, subject to certain conditions, significant issues arose relating to certain power purchase agreements that
were put in place at the time of the jurisdictional separation of the Entergy Gulf States some five years ago.
Before briefly going through the details, I want to say this, our priority right now is to continue to work with the staff of
the PUCT to resolve this issue. We believe their concerns, as well as those with the commission, can be addressed in
the way that works for everyone.
To summarize, at issue our PPAs between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas that relate to natural gas
and oil fired units. At the time that Entergy Gulf States was split into two companies, plant ownership was assigned
according to state lines. The cross PPA has allowed for each company to have access to the capacity of the others
planned on the same ratio as before the split.
These arrangements helped to minimize shifts in production costs as a result of the jurisdictional separation. Much
discussion and analysis have occurred in the course of the last two months with respect to the effect upon those PPAs
of either joining MISO or Entergy Texas exiting from the system agreement.
But what's important here is that our update and analysis has concluded that Entergy Texas will be in essentially the
same position with or without the PPAs. An evaluation by an independent third-party is underway now to thoroughly
bet this update analysis, including its inputs, assumptions, and the methodology.
In any event, we have committed to preserving the principles of jurisdictional separation I mentioned earlier. Clearly
we had a misunderstanding that we wished had not happened, but we are working to resolve the issue and move
forward, so that all of our customers can realize the benefits of joining MISO.
Additional benefits for customers and other stakeholders can and should be achieved through complete independence
of the transmission business. The proposed transaction to spin off and merge the transmission business with ITC
Holdings does just that and it is clearly a superior business model.
We now have procedural schedules in all retail jurisdictions where we filed. Generally, they call for direct testimony of
staff or in the case of New Orleans, the advisors and interveners, to begin in March and continue through mid-year.
Successive hearing dates are set for late June through early August. Specific dates in each procedural schedule are
provided in the appendix to the webcast slides.
Other upcoming steps at the retail jurisdiction level include filing a transaction approval request in Texas and Missouri.
As a reminder, Texas must render a decision on change of control within 180 days of filing. As a result, the timing of
the Texas filing will take into account the status of the change in control filings in other jurisdictions.
At the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, protests and interventions were filed by the January deadline. We are
reviewing the filings and we'll submit Entergy's and ITC's response to the issues to help clarify the record. But I would
say this. The issues raised are consistent with those that have come out of the stakeholder engagement process we've
been jointly undertaking with ITC since the announcement in December of 2011.

We did clear one requirement for the transaction. On January 14, the waiting period expired under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act without action. We continue to target closing in 2013.
In other utility developments, I am pleased to report significant strides in our investment program over the past three
months. On November 30, we closed the acquisitions of the Hot Spring and Hinds power plants in Arkansas and
Mississippi. These modern, efficient natural gas fired plants provide benefits for our customers in the form of lower
energy costs.
Then in December, we put in service the Waterford 3's steam generator replacement project. It will allow for continued
safe operation, providing fuel diversity to mitigate risks for our customers today and well into the future.
In all three investments, our regulators were supportive by approving cost recovery mechanisms to reduce regulatory
lag to a matter of days and weeks. In doing so, regulators recognized the importance to customers to facilitate
investments through timely recovery mechanisms that help to maintain the utility's credit rating at a reasonable level
and support access to capital on reasonable terms.
Recovery in rates today for the Waterford 3 cost is subject to a standard prudence review to be initiated no later than
April 30. Our regulators' foresight helps to position the utilities well for the future as the need for investment continue
at elevated levels to deliver reliable, affordable power to our customers.
Long established legal principles also provide the foundation as we enter the year with three major rate cases and the
ROE inquiry in Mississippi. Clearly, we have concerns in Texas. After a disappointing rate case decision last year, we
are pursuing three parallel paths. First, on November 30, we filed a request for special circumstances recovery of
approximately $15.5 million annually of capacity cost through the fuel adjustment clause. We are seeking to remedy
through a good cause exception of the Commission's denial in our base rate case of recovery of capacity costs that
provide economic and reliability benefits to our customers.
Second, that same day, a draft purchase capacity rider rule was published in the Texas Register. Procedurally, the
PUCT must act by May 31. If approved, Entergy Texas will immediately assess options in planning for cost recovery.
Third, we appealed the 2012 rate case decision in Travis County District Court. We expect to know more as the year
progresses. In addition, we always have the option of filing a new base rate case at the appropriate time. To that last
point, the due date for the Louisiana rate cases was extended by two weeks and the Entergy Arkansas rate case will be
filed in March.
Before moving on, I know many of you are tracking the ROE proceeding in the Entergy Gulf States Louisiana natural
gas business. We do not believe the 9.4% draft recommendation from the administrative law judge is supported by the
facts. Our testimony points to no less than 10.1%. A final ALJ recommendation is pending. After that, inevitably, we'll
be referred to the LPSC for decision at a future meeting. It is important to note that all parties have acknowledged that
ROEs for natural gas distribution businesses are lower than for electric utilities.
Turning to Entergy Wholesale Commodities, I would point out that once again the fleet ran safely and securely this
quarter. The nuclear plants operated on a 90% capacity factor, even with a two-week outage caused by a transformer
failure at FitzPatrick. For the non-nuclear fleet, capacity factor was 39%.
In addition, we continued hedging efforts. Notably, we increased 2015 nuclear energy hedge by 14%. We continue to
evaluate the costs, opportunities and risks associated with all hedging product options consistent with the objectives of
providing downside protection against the nuclear fleet cost structures and protecting our credit metrics.
Our point of view guides our evaluation of hedging products and execution timing. As we've said before, we are bullish
longer term relative to the current forward curve. That said, prices are what they are. Near-term power prices are
challenging for some merchant nuclear generating units in certain competitive markets.
We have not made any decisions to shut down any of our merchant nuclear plants. We're continually assessing our
businesses and investments based on our analytical dynamic point of view approach. Our business plans must be
flexible to adapt to high and low-priced markets and must balance short and long-term views.

The fact is, some plants are in more challenging economic situation for a variety of factors, such as their market for
both energy and capacity, their size, their contracted positions and the investment required to maintain the safety and
integrity of the plants.
It will come as no surprise to you that some of our EWC nuclear plants are challenged. While we will not get into the
specifics around individual EWC plant economics, I will say that there are years when certain plants' cash flows can be
negative at today's forward price curve. In the near term, we will continue to be diligent and operate as efficiently as
possible. We will do whatever it takes to maintain the safety and the integrity of the plants.
We will also advocate for efficient markets in recognition of the many benefits nuclear plants offer to our communities
and our customers, including the source of clean energy with effectively zero air emissions, grid reliability supported
by low forced outage rates and fuel diversity and jobs and other contributions to the regional economy.
In addition to economics, EWC efforts continued towards securing necessary approvals for long-term operation of
Vermont Yankee and Indian Point. Regarding Vermont Yankee, the oral argument at the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals was held on January 14 before a three-judge panel. As a reminder, this case involves the state of Vermont's
appeal of the January 2012 Federal District Court ruling in validating certain state laws regarding continued operation
and barring the state from requiring a below-market PPA as a condition for continued operation.
A decision could come by mid-year. Two days later, we participated in the hearing at the Vermont Supreme Court. The
state court hearing concerned a claim by an intervener group that Vermont Yankee was operating in violation of past
Vermont Public Service Board orders. Next steps will be established by the state court. However, given the Federal
District Court rulings and the absence of any state ruling prohibiting operation, we will continue to operate until final
decisions are reached in the Federal case and in the Certificate of Public Good proceeding before the VPSB. Our right
to continue operating is supported by representations to the Federal District Court by the Vermont Attorney General.
Also at the state level, hearings on direct testimony in the CPG proceeding will be held next week. Additional
testimony, hearings and briefings are scheduled through August of this year. A board decision is expected by yearend.
Regarding Indian Point, proceedings continued concerning the various license renewal efforts at the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and in the state of New York. We expect these processes to continue for many years during
which we have the right to continue to operate the units.
In addition, I know many of you are tracking the Energy Highway initiative and other developments in New York. In
November, the New York State Public Service Commission directed Con Edison in consultation with the New York
Power Authority to develop a reliability contingency plan for the potential retirement of Indian Point by the end of
2015. The Public Service Commission stated it was not taking the position of the potential closure of Indian Point, but
providing potential solutions to maintain reliability in New York in the event of power plant closures. Such planning is
common by utilities and appropriate. EWC has and will continue to participate in this process.
Because we submitted a timely and sufficient application for renewed license and given the status of the NRC
proceeding, we fully expect that the plant will be operating well beyond 2015.
In 2013, I know I don't have to remind you we have a full regulatory agenda at the Utility. In the first quarter, we will
make base rate case filings for Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Gulf States, Louisiana, and Entergy Arkansas. Final
decisions are expected by year-end or in early 2014. The first quarter will also include the annual formula rate plan
filing in Mississippi.
Just this week, the MPSC approved the settlement in the 2011 test year filing, confirming performance within the ROE
bandwidth, therefore no change in rates. In addition, Entergy New Orleans will continue its efforts to resolve its 2011
test year FRP filing.
In conjunction with those negotiations, ENOI will be seeking a short-term extension of its FRP for an additional year
until the next full base rate filing currently targeted for 2014. This rate case filing is a condition in the City Council's
approval for Entergy New Orleans 20% participation in the 550-megawatt Ninemile 6 combined cycle plant, which is

under construction now. The new plant is currently expected to go into service the first part of 2015 and the base rate
case is to be filed one year prior to the estimated in-service date.
In addition, five of the six utility operating companies will seek cost recovery of extraordinary storm costs in 2012. In
January, we used cash storm reserves for Hurricane Isaac in the amount of $187 million for Entergy Louisiana and $65
million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy New Orleans will also seek to recover Isaac costs as well as
replenish its cash storm reserves. Recall that the City Council originally approved a $75 million fund to be accumulated
over 10 years.
Since that approval in 2006, damages from Hurricanes Gustav, Ike and Isaac have totaled approximately $80 million.
Entergy Arkansas will present a cost recovery proposal to the APSC in its some upcoming base rate filing to recover
the $55 million to $65 million of costs for the December 25 ice storm. And finally, Entergy Mississippi will consider
the level of storm accrual in its now annual audit process.
2012 was once again a year when the Entergy region was hit by both hurricanes and ice storms. We also assisted in the
June Mid-Atlantic and Midwest Windstorm event and Superstorm Sandy recovery event. I am proud to tell you that the
Edison Electric Institute has awarded us the 2012 Emergency Response and Assistance Award. This makes 19 awards
we have won in 15 consecutive years.
As you know, but it doesn't hurt to repeat it, we are the only Utility in the country to win a response award every year
since the inception in 1998. This year, EEI recognized our restoration work on Isaac and our assistant work on the
windstorms and Sandy.
Finally, in 2013, the Utility will focus on regulatory and operational efforts. Those include the successful completion
and integration into MISO, and the closing of the ITC transaction as well as continuing the utilities construction
program, including the Ninemile 6 plant.
At EWC, we will continue our ongoing hedging efforts to meet the objectives I discussed earlier. While we expect the
Indian Point license renewal proceedings to continue for some time, you will likely see decisions regarding Vermont
Yankee before the Federal and State Courts as well as the Vermont Public Service Board. We will analyze those
carefully and evaluate next steps from there.
While there are a number of regulatory operation with legal initiatives underway throughout the company, I know that
each and every day safety and operational excellence will be at the forefront for all employees, providing safe, secure,
reliable and affordable power to our customers is central to each and every one of us.
Looking back, 2012 was an eventful year. We achieved many operational and financial accomplishments. After ups
and downs during the year, our final 2012 operational earnings per share exceeded our original guidance range. I
understand that many of you take out items like tax settlements. To that end, excluding the net tax benefits above the
original guidance assumption of a 34% effective income tax rate puts us around the midpoint of our revised 2012
operational guidance range of $5.25 per share.
As you'll recall, the reduction in our guidance range was driven by external factors, mainly higher pension expense due
to lower interest rates and updated actuarial experience studies, milder than normal weather to Utility and lower market
power prices at EWC.
Operationally, there were numerous accomplishments company-wide last year. I've mentioned a number of them
already. Other operational achievements include all of the Utility company's continued gains in the J.D. Power and
Associates 2012 Electric Utility Customer Satisfaction Study. Entergy New Orleans was named the most improved
Utility company and four of our utilities were among the top eight performance in proactive outage communications.
The nuclear fleet completed breaker-to-breaker runs at Grand Gulf and Cooper and two back-to-back
breaker-to-breaker runs at Fitzpatrick. The company received multiple awards and recognition for community relations,
corporate citizenship, climate protection and customer service.
In closing, as you look at Entergy today, it represents a strong Utility in service territories with solid economic growth,
constructive regulatory relationships, manageable environmental risks and low cost electricity during a time of rising

investment needs and a merchant generation business with safe and reliable plants that will benefit from the recovery of
power markets.
These businesses have and will continue to support return of capital to our owners, to our financial outlook with our
current mix of businesses that supports the dividend at the current level, dividend growth potential for shareholders
upon execution of the ITC transaction through the combination of Entergy and ITC dividends and a strong balance
sheet and financial flexibility.
At the same time, this leadership team will not relent on looking for opportunities to make things better for all of our
stakeholders, even if they are hard, even if they take time. The MISO and ITC transactions are examples of that.
Throughout all of this, you can be assured we are fully focused on executing on your high expectations for us every
day.
Now, I will turn the call over to Drew. Drew?
Andrew Marsh
Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover fourth quarter and full year 2012
financial results, cash performance for the quarter and the full year and 2013 earnings guidance.
Now let's turn to the financial results for the quarter. Slide two summarizes fourth quarter 2012 results on an
as-reported and operational basis. Operational earnings per share were $0.78 higher compared to a year ago driven by
higher earnings at Utility and Parent & Other while results were lower at EWC.
Fourth quarter as-reported earnings included a special item for expenses incurred in connection with the proposed
spin-off and merger of introduced transmission business with ITC Holdings Corp. Spending on our spin-merge
initiative reduced earnings per share by $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus the $0.07 per share recorded for this
item in 2011.
Slide three summarizes the major drivers by segment. Starting at the Utility, results were higher in 2012 due primarily
to lower income tax expense and higher net revenue. These were partially offset by higher depreciation expense.
Utility's income tax expense was lower due primarily to the recent settlement with the IRS on the tax treatment of the
utilities de-commissioning liabilities. In this settlement, we conceded a position that we took in the 2004 return on
including Utility's nuclear decommissioning liabilities and cost of goods sold.
As part of the settlement, Entergy Louisiana also increased the tax bases of its assets, which entitled the company to
approximately $550 million of additional tax depreciation for the tax years 2006 and beyond. This part of the
settlement created a permanent book-to-tax difference, and as a result, an income tax expense benefits net of interest of
approximately $155 million was recorded in the fourth quarter.
Utility also realized higher net revenue compared to the same period in 2011. The net revenue increase was due
primarily to weather-adjusted sales growth and the net effect of pricing adjustments from regulatory actions and
investments, some of which were partially offset by increased expenses.
Weather for the quarter was milder than normal, but roughly in line with the fourth quarter of 2011. On a
weather-adjusted basis, retail sales were up 0.8% quarter-over-quarter. Growth in the residential and commercial
sectors more than offset lower industrial sales. Furthermore, the decline in build industrial sales volumes was driven by
temporary outages at two major customers.
At EWC, earnings declined due largely to lower operational adjusted EBITDA, which I will review shortly. Other
factors included a higher effective income tax rate and higher decommissioning expense. Decommissioning expense
increased quarter-over-quarter due to a favorable adjustment to the decommissioning liability recorded in 2011 at
Vermont Yankee.
At Parent & Other, results improved quarter-over-quarter due primarily to lower income tax expense.

Slide four summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of each year. The
quarter-over-quarter decline of $32 million was due primarily to lower net revenue driven by lower nuclear energy
power prices.
Slide 5 recaps our cash flow performance for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $720 million,
approximately $280 million lower than the prior year. The main drivers of the overall decrease were; lower deferred
fuel collections, non-capital cost from Hurricane Isaac restoration and lower net revenue at EWC. These decreases were
offset partially by lower pension contributions.
Now, I'll move to full year results. Slide six compares 2012 as reported and operational earnings for 2011. On an
operational basis, 2012 earnings per share ended the year at $6.23, down from $7.62 per share in 2011. Lower
operational earnings at the Utility and EWC were partially offset by higher results at Parent & Other. The main drivers
for the decrease were; differences in tax benefits resulting largely from the net effects of agreements with the IRS in
2011 and 2012 as well as other income tax adjustments; lower operational adjusted EBITDA at EWC and higher
non-fuel operation and maintenance expense at the Utility, due partly to higher compensation and benefit costs. Other
factors in the year-over-year decline were increases in interest expense and depreciation expense. Higher Utility net
revenue partially offset these items.
Slide seven summarizes EWC's operational adjusted EBITDA for 2011 and 2012. As with the quarterly drivers, a
decline in net revenue on lower energy pricing was the primary factor in the $244 million decrease. The decrease was
partially offset by additional net revenue from the RISEC facility, which was acquired in December of 2011. Higher
non-fuel operation maintenance expense and higher taxes other than income taxes also reduced EWC's operational
adjusted EBITDA.
Slide eight summarizes our cash flow performance for the full year. For 2012, operating cash flow was $2.9 billion,
down from $3.1 billion in 2011. Drivers of the decrease included lower net revenue at EWC, non-capital cost from
Hurricane Isaac restoration, and higher income tax payments. These items were partially offset by lower pension
contributions.
Slide nine summarizes our 2013 earnings guidance range. The as reported guidance does not reflect potential future
expenses for the special item in connection with the proposed spin-merge of Entergy's transmission business. As
reported, earnings guidance will be updated as actual costs are incurred. In keeping with past practice, we've updated a
few line items in the guidance table including final 2012 results, major income tax variances and final 2012 weather
effects.
In affirming our earnings guidance, we have noted that current expectations point to the lower half of the $0.80 range
due to updated pension and post-retirement cost estimates, which came in approximately $0.17 per share below the
midpoint assumption.
With 11 months to go in the year, it's still early. And even though current estimates do point to the bottom half of the
guidance range, we are committed to deliver optimal results. We'll continue to focus on opportunities to improve our
business, including managing everyday costs and looking for ways to safely improve efficiency and effectiveness
through continuous improvement and operational excellence.
One last point on 2013 as it relates to quarterly results. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, slide 10 outlines
some key events to keep in mind when considering the quarters. We had several tax items in 2012, both positive and
negative. In addition, the second quarter results included a regulatory charge to reflect sharing of certain tax benefits
with customers. 2012 EPS also reflected some variation from quarter-to-quarter associated with weather and normal
seasonality.
Regulatory action and completion of major projects such as the Grand Gulf extended power upgrade which was placed
in service in mid-2012, can also affect the quarterly timing. At EWC, the second quarter of 2012 included an
adjustment to the decommissioning liability which reduced expense by $0.16 per share. Third and fourth quarter results
also reflected awards for Indian Point 2 and Vermont Yankee respectively arising out of the Department of Energy

study to provide timely spent fuel storage. These awards resulted in a reversal of certain previously recorded expenses.
In closing, Leo outlined the vision to create sustainable value for each of the four key stakeholders through focus on
both operational excellence and portfolio management. We must successfully identify productive investments at
Utility, which benefit customers and grow the business; execute on hedging strategies at EWC that protects the value of
those assets while also providing upside price opportunity, develop ways to improve efficiency and manage risk more
effectively throughout the company and execute on key initiatives, initiatives such as the effort to join MISO, the
spin-merge to the transmission business and ongoing efforts to ensure our ability to run our nuclear plant through an
extended license period. These actions will enable us to achieve the vision and to meet our long-term financial outlook
for robust Utility earnings growth, EWC option value preservation, solid capital deployment and strong liquidity and
credit quality.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for
questions. And we'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: A quick first question here for you. On the – given all the rate cases that are coming,
what were your earned regulatory ROEs across your jurisdictions and I'm specifically thinking about 2012 or those
jurisdictions were your filing?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: Leo?
<A - Leo Denault>: Hi, Julien. How are you doing? In 2012, I mean if you look at what the earned ROEs were, they
were, actually well – they were within a little above the allowed ROEs in the jurisdictions we were talking about filing,
principally Arkansas and Louisiana. So as it relates to 2012, the ROEs in those jurisdictions were fairly close to slightly
above the allowed ROEs.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And you said Arkansas and Louisiana, and then...
<A - Leo Denault>: Correct.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: ...with respect to Texas, if you could just comment where that is and perhaps
specifically in the back half of the year and how that's trending given the PPA?
<A - Andrew Marsh>: I mean obviously as Leo spoke earlier, we have our challenges in Texas, and as you would
expect given the impacts we talked about realistically in the filing of our rate case, if you remember back a couple of
quarters ago an impact not recovering that capacity cost we have on ROEs, we talked about ROEs maybe impacting
earned ROEs to a level of somewhere close to 6% and obviously you'll see that impact in 2012 in Texas.
So, obviously, it's not as nice a picture as say, Arkansas and Louisiana. But, as Leo laid out, we do have options in
terms of how we'll work to address that and that's our objective and goal in 2013 is to pursue the path we have available
to improve that result.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And then just turning to the EWC segment for a quick second, obviously, the
New England results came out the other day. Can you indicate whether you committed Vermont Yankee into that
auction and whether it cleared by chance?

<A - Leo Denault>: Bill?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: I tried.
<A - Bill Mohl>: Hi, Julien, this is Bill. We did actually commit VY and it did clear and you may ask the question why
did we do that as we haven't in the past, but now that that unit has been delisted, it's not considered a reliability
must-run unit. It takes away a lot of our relicensing risk as it relates to the CPG issue. So in the event that we would
encounter any problems, we could replace it with a fungible product.

And we will take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey good morning, guys.
<A - Leo Denault>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Leo, just kind of following up on the comment you made earlier, just you looking at the cash
generation of the assets, and how you evaluate keeping the plants in service. What do you need to see market
condition-wise, maybe to change your opinion on whether these assets stay in service? And is there some sort of
timeline you guys think about to try and address some of those questions?
<A - Leo Denault>: Well, as far as the timeline goes, Dan, as you might guess, it's an ongoing timeline. We never stop
and we never start, it's just always something that we would be doing regardless of what's going on. As far as absolute
levels, we're not going to get in to the specifics around plant economics, this price or that price, but suffice to say that
it's the kind of thing that we look at on an ongoing basis. We've always looked at on an ongoing basis as it relates to
every decision we make, whether it be a continued operation, whether it would be hedging or whether it would be any
kind of portfolio management activity that might be around those assets. So there is no specific timeline, other than
making sure that we're doing everything with our eyes wide open.
The big time periods are obviously when you have CapEx that goes into it or something like that where you've got to
make an assessment of how much money you're going to spend going forward. And so, if there is a timeframe around
which you make more decisions rather than less, it has to do with big changes in cost structure, for example, a big
CapEx program or if there was something else that happens. But, otherwise, it's just an ongoing evaluation.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And, I guess, the Utility's – the weather normalized demand growth was seemingly well
above the trend for what we saw across the country, although we did see Industrial trail off a bit in the fourth quarter.
Can you talk about the mix of the 1.25% growth for 2013 and where you see the most positive signs from the most
concerning issues right now?
<A - Leo Denault>: You really faded out there Dan, so I'm not sure. I think you asked the load growth question. So I
think Theo can answer that.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Dan, do you mind kind of just repeating the last portion of that. As Leo said, you were
fading out.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Sure, sorry about that, Theo. I was just wondering with power demand growth, you guys had a
good 2012 weather normalized relative to the rest of the country. What do you guys see as the trend for 2013 and from
a mix perspective, is residential going to continue to be so strong or is commercial catching up or how do you guys see
that kind of evolving this year?

Page 11 of 14
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I think when we think about 2012, the 2012 ended up pretty much in line with what we
expected as it relates to growth, not only overall, but really even among some of the specific customer classes,
particularly residential. As we looked at 2013, I think as we said earlier, we had – I believe 2012, we ended at about
1.9%, weather adjusted, 2013, I believe we've mentioned on the last call we were expecting somewhere in the range of
1.3%, so obviously you see that moving down a little bit.
And I think we will obviously – it's moving down because of the things you probably see with other companies
primarily in the area of residential, energy efficiency programs that have caused changes relative to – I mean speak to
government programs around lighting in and such. So we do see some impacts in residential as it relates to that. We're
optimistic that maybe it won't be as impacting us as much as we may think at this point in time.
In the industrial, we tailed off second half of the year much as we had expected primarily because of outages. In 2012,
we continue to see GDP much above the national average, which as we've spoken of many times, has helped to
differentiate us to some extent as it relates to sales volumes. I think as you go on to 2013, if you look at some of the
projections around GDP, that gap starts to close.
So, we will probably tend to trend more to what you may see with across other utilities in the country. What we'll also
say is we still continue to be a place for opportunities as it relates to economic development and potential new
industrial customers so we'll continue to keep our eyes on that. And obviously, as those things materialize and mature,
you'll start to see the impact of those. Hopefully, we'll see them in our service area. If not our service area, you will see
the impact they may create even if they are in other service areas where they could potentially affect us through some
of the impacts of changes as it relates to commercial and residential, even in support of those if those industrial
customers are not in our area.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
And we will go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - Leo Denault>: Yes. Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: I just want to ask you guys about, there's a decommissioning dispute that was talked about in
the press this week with another company, nothing to do with you guys. I'm just wondering – I'm not asking you to
comment on that, but I'm just wondering have you guys had any interaction with the NRC? Is this something that
you've heard about either in your neck of the woods – I mean, with your [ph] re-plants (44:24) or what have you or just
any ideas about have there been any disputes about decommissioning calculations or any kind of review that serve
generally generically happening at the NRC?
<A - Leo Denault>: I'll let John Herron address that.
<A - John T. Herron>: Yeah. We're very familiar with the issue that you're talking about. Again, we don't have all the
details. The Office of Investigation has concluded their investigation on that issue. I will tell you that we're very
familiar with the decommissioning rules and regulations and the submittals that we have to provide to the NRC. We've
had some discussions with the NRC about one of our sites. We worked that out and resolved that issue, but clearly, not
a 50.9 issue which is what the NRC concluded with that utility decommissioning submittal. We're familiar with it,
certainly have done a lot of detailed understanding of what went behind that and clearly we don't have that same issue.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, great. But there was article just today, I think that I saw on how the State of Vermont, I
guess, is perhaps looking at some legislation, it doesn't sound like it's a huge amount of money, but it looks like there's
about $40 million potential that they're concerned about higher needs for decommissioning expense from a state
perspective, it sounded to me from reading the article as opposed to the federal level.

Does the state have any – I mean generally speaking, my understanding is decommissioning and requirements
associated with that are completely federal. Is that pretty much the case or is there – are there some others sort of
decommissioning or cleanup costs that states might have if there was, in fact, decommissioning happening, if you know
what I'm asking.
<A - Roderick K. West>: This is Rod West. The rules relative to decommissioning are federal jurisdiction in nature.
We're not at all, and have not been surprised by Vermont's efforts to test the limits of the federal jurisdiction and to
assert whatever states' rights or concerns they'd have around the decommissioning issue from a state interest
perspective. But it is, from our point of view, primarily a federal question and those are the rules that we're seeking to
abide by.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And there's no examples of – or do you know of any examples where a state actually does have
authority over something like that?
<A - Roderick K. West>: I can't comment on it.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. I don't mean to get [indiscernible] (47:12).
<A - Roderick K. West>: I wish I could be more helpful there.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks so much.

And we will go next to Kit Konolige with BGC Brokerage.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Leo Denault>: Good morning, Kit.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Thanks, Paul. To follow up a little bit on the question about the earned ROEs. Would it be
possible to project in the guidance for 2013 what earned ROEs are embedded in those expectations?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Kit, this is Theo. I mean, we just don't get into that discussion.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Okay. Fair enough. And the other area I just wanted to follow on a little bit was on the PPA issue
with the Texas Commission, do you have a sense of what the timing might be on that and kind of what boxes need to
be checked there? Who needs to be satisfied about what at this point?
<A - Leo Denault>: Theo?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Sure. At this point, as Leo mentioned, we've prepared an update and analysis, that
analysis is now being reviewed by what we consider kind of an independent third party. Again, as Leo discussed and
we expect that process to go on through the month of February, more than likely. And at that point we would hope that
their analysis will be complete somewhere within that timeline. And we would then have an opportunity to see the
result – all other parties see the result.
And if that analysis obviously aligns with what we have done, then we would hope we could move this forward and
folks would be comfortable. Again, that whether the PPAs – whether you exit the system agreement, the PPAs stay in
place or not, the economic effect is effectively the same. And we do believe that's a major concern and we understand
that concern. And so removing that, we're optimistic it will allow us to move this issue along.
If you had an opportunity to view the open meeting at which this was discussed, there was some discussion around how
that would move. It wasn't completely clear, but obviously we know our starting points with the staff of the PUCT and
getting the staff comfortable with the body of work that's being done and giving them an opportunity to weigh in on

that from their perspective and obviously what the staff's views will be communicated up to the Commission and we'll
just have to see how it moves at that point.
But our expectation is we're doing everything we can and we believe other parties are as well to move this along as
quickly as possible. We believe all signatories within the U.S. are obviously interested in getting to MISO as quickly as
possible so customers can achieve those benefits. So we're optimistic this will move along on a quick pace.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Very good. Thank you.
<A - Leo Denault>: Thanks, Kit.

And we will take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. Just real quickly on Texas. At what point – I guess, my question there is there's
something about Gulf States Texas that leads to a lower earned ROE than what some of the other regulated utilities in
Texas can really earn. I guess, there's something that is specific to Gulf States that tends to drive that. Now, I'm
thinking not just in 2012 or 2013, but just over the last five or 10 years. I'm trying to think about whether it's a
structural issue with the market or a structural issue with the company.
<A - Leo Denault>: Theo?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I mean, obviously, we operate in a market where we're still a vertically integrated utility
and subject to full jurisdiction by the PUCT. So there is no kind of a market – wholesale market-type issues.
If you go back a few years, I mean, over the past three to four years, we've had successful rate outcomes in Texas, and
we're moving our view toward a very positive path as it relates to returning to a position to earn out all ROEs. The last
rate case we took a step back. And right now, our objective is to get back on that path of moving in a positive direction
and heading in a positive direction of earning allowed ROE.
I can't say that structurally there's anything different from us as it relates to operating in a vertically integrated utility
market than any other vertically integrated utility. We'll keep working it and we've had past success and we believe
we'll have success in the future.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.
<A - Leo Denault>: Thanks, Michael.
Operator
And we'll take our final question from Neel Mitra with Tudor Pickering & Holt.
<Q - Neel Mitra>: Hey. Good morning. A question on kind of the weak nuclear economics. How are you looking at
unit contingent hedging right now? Are you thinking about using less of those hedges and would you be open to
acquiring another CCGT like in New England, like in New York, to maybe help back up some of the nuclear plants?
<A - Leo Denault>: Bill?
<A - Bill Mohl>: A certain part of our portfolio continues to include unit contingent hedges. As Leo mentioned, we've
taken more of an approach to protect our downside and leave opportunities for the upside. And right now, we think
that's probably the best way to approach it.
As it relates to adding additional assets, it's pretty similar to anything that we would do. We are always looking at
opportunities in the marketplace, but those opportunities have to provide value. And so I wouldn't exclude that. As a
specific opportunity, we currently have no specific plans to acquire any specific assets at this point in time.

<Q - Neel Mitra>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the New York capacity markets, could you update us with
your thoughts for the expectation for a Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone and maybe the timing of that?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Sure. We are optimistic – cautiously optimistic that we will see that zone go into effect in the summer
of 2014. However, there's still a lot of details to be worked out regarding the various rules and procedures that will
apply to that pricing zone. So we're actively engaged in that and trying to make sure that when that zone is put in place
that the capacity prices associated with that are consistent with the competitive market and not suppressed due to issues
such as minimum offer price rules or out of market entry, that type of thing. So we are optimistic that's going to
happen.
