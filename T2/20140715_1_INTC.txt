Thanks, Mark. The second quarter exceeded our expectations. The improving economic environment, PC refresh, form
factor innovation and the end of life of Windows XP combined to drive better than expected demand. In fact,
microprocessor volume in the second quarter was an all time record. From the most powerful supercomputers to the
smallest energy efficient embedded machines, the breadth and strength of our results suggest that our reach is
extending.
The PC Client Group's results reflect the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year unit growth. In Q2, both the
desktop platform revenue and the notebook platform revenue grew year-over-year. The installed base of PCs that are at
least four years old is now roughly 600 million units and we are seeing clear signs of a refresh in the enterprise in small
and medium businesses.
While there are some signs of renewed consumer interest and activity, the consumer segment remains challenging
primarily in the emerging markets. The Bay Trail family of SoCs has been a standout that has helped us expand into
new segments. Bay Trail's performance allows us to deliver a much smaller and lower cost Atom-based core in our
Pentium and Celeron brands for the first time.
Our Bay Trail SoC volume in desktops and clamshells more than doubled over the last quarter and now represents
more than 60% of our Pentium and Celeron mix and nearly 20% of our notebook mix. This is enabling our growth at
lower price points and in new segments like Chrome-based systems without sacrificing margin.
The Data Center business had a strong quarter with 19% growth year-over-year leading to all time record revenue of
$3.5 billion. Following last quarter's launch of the Ivy Bridge-based Xeon E7 processor family, we saw strong [ph] NP
(03:35) volume and a richer product mix and ASP mix. Cloud, networking, high-performance computing and enterprise
revenue all grew more than 15% in the second quarter.
Demand and revenue growth in several segments demonstrated the growing reach of Intel technology beyond CPUs for
PCs and servers. Our Internet of Things Group grew 24% year-over-year and set a revenue record as the retail and
manufacturing sectors performed especially well. NAND revenue grew 20% and McAfee revenue grew 5%. Finally,
we are squarely on track to our 40 million unit tablet goal, shipping 10 million units in the second quarter.
We also achieved some important milestones during the quarter. We qualified the first Broadwell-based Core M
processor. And at Computex we highlighted the form factor innovation that 14-nanometer Core M product family will
enable; systems like our Llama Mountain reference design, a fanless detachable 2-in-1 that is razor thin at 7.2
millimeters and weighs just 24 ounces. We also announced a landmark strategic relationship with Rockchip to
accelerate and expand our SoC roadmap for the value and entry tablet market segment. In our foundry business,
announced that Panasonic joined the growing list of companies that will use our leading-edge 14-nanometer process
technology.
While I'm pleased with the second quarter results and the strength in the enterprise and small and medium businesses,
we're watching for signs of sell-through in consumer PCs in the second half of this year. Additionally, we have
important work to do in the months ahead. We are working towards qualification of our 7260, our category 6 LTE
product with carrier aggregation early this quarter. And later this quarter we'll launch our next generation
Haswell-based Xeon E5 platform, code named Grantley.
We also expect the first 14-nanometer Broadwell Core M processor-based systems, including fanless 2-in-1s will be on
shelves for the holiday selling season followed by broader OEM availability in the first half of 2015. And SoFIA, our
integrated baseband and apps processor for smartphones and tablets, remains on track for Q4 of this year. All of this

work is critical to growing the business.
Along with our earning results, we announced a $20 billion increase to our buyback authorization and we intend to
pursue a sizeable repurchase of stock over the second half of the year. Stacy will talk more specifically about our plans,
but this change to our capital structure and allocation is a direct result of our ongoing commitment to delivering
shareholder value and the thoughtful stewardship of our owners' capital.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Brian. The second quarter came in above the expectations we provided in the April earnings call and consistent
with the revised outlook we released on June 12. It was a good quarter representing financial growth and solid
momentum as we entered the second half of the year.
Focusing on our second quarter results, revenue came in at $13.8 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Both the PC Client
Group and the Data Center Group achieved better growth than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. PC Client
Group revenue was up 6% from a year ago. We saw PC Client Group platform and unit volumes grow 9%
year-over-year. And inclusive of the tablets, we saw almost 20% unit growth. PC platform average selling prices
declined 4% on a year-on-year basis. Our Data Center Group revenue grew 19% from a year ago with platform
volumes up 9% and platform average selling prices up 11% over the same period.
Looking beyond the PC and Data Center businesses, the Mobile and Communications Group is down 83% from a year
ago. The underlying dynamics are consistent with what we shared at the Investor Meeting last November. We are ahead
of our expectations in tablet volume with the billing increases being offset with an increase in contra-revenue dollars.
We are seeing a decline in our feature phone and 2G, 3G multi-comm business as the industry transition to integrated
LTE solutions.
The Internet of Things Group was up 24% year-on-year. We continue to see robust growth across segments with
particular strength in the retail and manufacturing segments. Gross margin of 64.5% was up almost five points from the
first quarter and 1.5 points above our original Q2 guidance. The five-point increase relative to the first quarter is due to
lower 14-nanometer start-up costs, higher platform volumes and lower platform unit costs. Spending came in at $4.9
billion, in line with our revised outlook provided on June 12. Net income for the second quarter was $2.8 billion, up
40% from a year ago and earnings per share was $0.55, up 41% from a year ago.
The business continued to generate significant cash with over $5 billion of cash from operations in Q2. We purchased
$2.8 billion in capital assets, paid $1.1 billion in dividends, and repurchased over $2 billion of stock. Total cash balance
at the end of the quarter was roughly $17 billion, down approximately $1.7 billion from the prior quarter. Our net cash
balance, total cash less debt, is approximately $4 billion, and inclusive of our other longer-term investments is closer to
$7.5 billion.
Our capital allocation philosophy is to first invest in our business then generate shareholder return through our dividend
and then to return cash to shareholders via stock repurchases. Our business generates healthy free cash flow through
economic cycles but as a result of this capital allocation philosophy we have brought down our net cash balances plus
longer-term investments from over $23 billion in 2010 to around $7.5 billion today.
We plan to continue our journey of returning cash to our shareholders by adjusting our capital structure to further bring
down our net cash balances. The intention is to repurchase $4 billion of stock in the third quarter with additional
buybacks in Q4. This strategy enables the sufficient liquidity for our operations and provides strategic flexibility to
invest in our business while continuing to return cash to our shareholders.
As we look forward to the third quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $14.4 billion,
up 4% from the second quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal increase for the third quarter that we
have seen over the last several years. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the third quarter to

be 66%. The 1.5 point increase from the second quarter is primarily driven by lower platform unit costs and higher
platform volumes. This is partially offset by lower platform average selling prices.
Turning to full year 2014, we are planning for revenue growth relative to last year that is approximately 5%. We are
forecasting the midpoint of our gross margin range at 63%, up two points from the midpoint of the outlook provided on
April 15. This increase is primarily driven by lower platform unit costs, higher platform volumes partially offset by
lower platform average selling prices.
As I reflect on the first half of 2014, I believe the strategies that we put in place for this year are playing out nicely to
extend the reach of Intel technologies across the spectrum of the smallest embedded devices to the most powerful
supercomputers. We have seen better than expected trends in the overall PC market with strength in both non-consumer
and desktop segments. We are enabling innovative 2-in-1 devices and lower price points and we are growing our
market segment share.
We have brought new products into the Data Center, which drive a strong return on investment for our customers to
upgrade their infrastructure, and we are benefiting from both our product lineup and the build out of the cloud. The
Internet of Things business is growing fast as we bring intelligence to more and more devices, and we are making
investments in communications and tablets that benefit the breadth of our businesses and set us up for improving
financial results going forward.
As a result of these trends and our execution, our financial results are improving, we are generating free cash flow and
we are returning more of that cash to our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
Okay. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving onto the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to
ask one question and just one follow up if you have one.
Saied, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is
open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thank you for taking my question. I have the first question on the PC side and the second one on
smartphones. So, Brian, on the PC side, obviously, good growth in enterprise and obvious question is how long does
that last? And then I think you had mentioned in your comments that the consumer has not yet recovered and the
industry has tried lots of things, different form factors, price points, et cetera, but it has not seemed to revive the
consumer. So what will it take to revive the consumer side, because that will be an important factor for next year on the
PC market?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. So let me try and answer your questions. The first one was good growth on the
enterprise side, small and medium business. How long will it last? We think it's driven by multi factors. It's driven by
the good form factors, the 600 million systems four years older, new price points, and Windows XP end-of-lifing. So
all of those things are coming together to drive this. We see it at least lasting through this year, we believe. And that's
built into our forecast. So that's kind of as far as we're looking out today.
The second part of your question was, what does it take to reinvigorate the consumer. We've got a lot of things lined up
for the second half of this year to work on that, everything from marketing to really we talked about in the call, the

Core M Broadwells. Those are going to allow really a whole new class of system as we go out through the holidays and
into next year where they're 2-in-1 devices but they now become fanless, ultra thin, very portable, long battery life,
strong core performance or core like performance.
We believe that will bring another class of system into the market as well along with just some overall general refresh
of many, many of the form factors. We think that all of those things will start to move it. But that is part of why we've
put this caution on we're still going to watch as the consumer trend goes through the second half of this year.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Understand. And as my follow up, you had said previously that you plan to bring baseband
production in-house, right? It's at TSMC today. But I think you have said in the past that you plan to bring it in-house
sometime late next year or 2016. Is that still an important milestone? Are you on track to do that? And importantly, will
it require any incremental CapEx or OpEx? Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So, yes, we're still – it is still important to bring the baseband and it's always important.
One of the real advantages of Intel is it is an integrated device manufacturer an IDM. And we believe that integration of
the process technology and the design and our leadership in Moore's law just gives us a real advantage when you look
at that whole ecosystem. So it's always critical for all of our products to move them inside as fast as we can. And yes,
we're still targeting towards the end of 2015 or beginning of 2016 to move those products inside.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And I'd just say to the last part of your second question, from an OpEx standpoint it's in our run
rate. We're investing in the modern technology today. And from a CapEx standpoint, it won't meaningfully move the
needle in terms of CapEx.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line's open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Great. Thank you. It's really nice gross margin guidance and if I look back historically a couple
years ago and I think four years ago, you had some gross margin headwinds in mid-year when you ramped all of the
fabs on the new process as once. And obviously you don't seem to be seeing those headwinds in Q3. Is that – am I
thinking about that the right way? And is there still some cost of ramping 14-nanometer that's still ahead of us?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. So, yes, you're thinking about that the right way. And I think if you do the algebra and
you look at our actual gross margin in Q1 and Q2 and the projection for Q3, you're going to come up with a number in
Q4 that comes down a few points from what we're forecasting for Q3. We haven't locked in on the forecast yet but it's
down a bit. And that is exactly the phenomenon of what you said.
When we get to Q4, we are ramping multiple 14-nanometer factories simultaneously. We think we'll see a little bit of
an increase in cost in Q4. And in addition in the fourth quarter because our 14-nanometer products Broadwell is a
family of products, we'll still see some pre-PRQ quals that will cause reserves to go up a little bit and Q4 is our best
prediction at this time.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then separately looking at the buyback, what's the timeframe of
the $20 billion repurchase? And can you talk about what's kind of the optimal net cash level that you'd like to maintain
or the balance sheet?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. Great question. Let me answer the second one first, because I'm not actually giving you a
ton of clarity on the timeline to the $20 billion. But the – if you think about this as a multi-year focus that we've had I
think you can see this playing out. And if you go back to 2010, as I said in my prepared remarks, and you look at net
cash plus some of the other investments that the treasury group makes, we had a net cash balance that was running in
the mid to high $20 billions back then.

We've brought it down to sub $10 billion as of Q2. I think it's really a sign. And along the way we've stress tested our
business in terms of cash generation through things like the economic downturn and it's increased our confidence that
we generate free cash flow even in kind of macroeconomic situations that are less favorable.
So we're taking the next step there moving cash balances down further. From my perspective as CFO if we're targeting
kind of with the definition of cash I just gave, something around zero net cash it still gives us a positive gross cash
balance. We have plenty of cash for strategic reasons and operational reasons. That feels like a pretty comfortable
number.
And then to do that we'll do $4 billion of buyback in Q3 on top of the $2 billion that we executed to in Q2. We'll do
another sizeable buyback in Q4 TBD exactly the size of that. That will get us pretty close to that goal. And then you
can do the math of cash generation next year and kind of figure out how in your model we'll go through the $20 billion.
But I think we'll go through a chunk of it just over the next six months.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line's open. Please go ahead.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Brian and Stacy, congratulations on the strong results. Brian, I guess my first question is just
whether or not you can go into a little bit more detail into DCG with ASPs being up 11%. I know you gave us some
color in your commentary, but I'm kind of curious, to what extent was that a better mix of enterprise? Was it hyperscale
mixing up even more than they did in the calendar first quarter? And to the extent that you said that Grantley doesn't
come until this calendar quarter, I'm kind of curious as to how you see that ramp playing out and how accretive that
might be to the Data Center business?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. I'll start and then Stacy can add in since you've got a mix of the product and then how
the financials roll into that as well. I think if you just take a look, what we said is, if you look back at the remarks, we
said almost all of the segments of the enterprise were up 15%. That was a mix of volume and ASPs across the board
there. You are correct that Grantley doesn't go until this quarter, but we did continue to launch the E7 during this
quarter and see that ramp, which definitely helps our ASP and overall product mix.
Every one of these launches is a little bit different. They always have a mix of kind of what are our customers doing. If
you just take a look at the data center volume in general, it tends be a bit lumpy. There are big orders as people fill out
their data centers. Whether it's an HPC order or a cloud order or an enterprise order, they tend to come in big pieces.
And so as we move into the Grantley launch, we'll have to see how the customers place their orders and what the
volume is. So we don't look at it on a quarterly basis. When we look at something like a Grantley launch, we really
look at it over a longer period of time. Over a longer period of time, we think it's going to be a very powerful product.
But exactly how that transition will occur, we don't try and look at it that closely on a quarterly basis.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, John, let me --
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Brian...
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: If I may just add a couple of things, John, and so in terms of the Q2 ASP uplift, as Brian said,
it's a combination of things, but one thing you need to keep in mind. We are shipping and selling Grantley today into
cloud and HPC customers and we saw the E7 moving into production. So you got a combination of things in the second
quarter.
And I think where Brian was taking you is, we're really happy with that 19% growth rate in the second quarter, but
we're not – we're expecting a nice robust growth rate when we move into the back-half, but not 19%. We think there

was some specific purchasing going on with some of the large cloud providers that probably don't repeat exactly as we
get into the back-half.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: That's helpful, Stacy. Now, Stacy, going to the solving the algebraic equation for Q4 gross
margins, it kind of implies gross margins could be down as much as 400 basis points sequentially if I'm doing the math
right. And that would be about 2x kind of the hit you saw as you were ramping the 22-nanometer node about a year
ago.
And I'm just kind of curious, is that because you're ramping more volume? And there's clearly been a lot of speculation
about how 14-nanometer is going and how Broadwell is going in the popular press. So I'm wondering if you can
comment whether or not the margin trends you're seeing in the calendar fourth quarter are kind of as expected and
generally just kind of characterize how that 14-nanometer Broadwell ramp is going from your perspective?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure. And I'll let Brian come in on the 14-nanometer, but I'll help you with the algebra. So first,
I think we have to be careful not to get trapped in the rounding here, because if you're 0.2% on gross margin, you get to
a different answer for the Q4 number. I'd expect it to be down a bit, but there's nothing untoward there other than the
fact that we're ramping multiple factories at once and that we'll still have some – the way Broadwell's rolling out as a
family of products, we'll have some pre-production builds that will cause reserves to go up. So I guess, I'd be cautious
about – it'll be down some, but I wouldn't hit any alarm bells. There's nothing beyond that that's happening in the fourth
quarter. In terms of 14-nanometer, I'll let Brian take that more from the operational standpoint.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah. 14-nanometer, it's going along exactly as we said in April. We said we would,
during this quarter, qualify and we did qualify our 14-nanometer product. And we actually are shipping product today
to our customers and partners. We said we would have products on shelves for the holiday season and we continue to
work with our partners and we're on schedule to have product on shelves in the holiday. We talked to you about this.
We focused on Core M, which is the Broadwell part that we think really highlights the power of 14-nanometers and the
Broadwell architecture. As I said, it'll be the first class of PC, core level PC products that are fanless. We talked to you
about the Llama Mountain product, 7.2 millimeters thick, 24 ounces in weight, fanless. Those are going to be devices
that we think will start to transform how people think about a 2-in-1 device and the PC versus the tablet. That's where
we're focused on. The rest of the products, as we said, will launch and ramp as we go through 2015.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Great. Thanks, guys, and congratulations again.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Hey, guys. Congratulations. Thanks for letting me ask a question. You guys, Stacy, have
been real helpful in giving us some idea on the algebra for the gross margins in the fourth quarter. If I do the same on
the revenues, it looks like kind of flattish revenues, which will be a little bit below seasonal. You guys have done a
great job executing versus your plan in the last couple of quarters. Are you leaving some room for conservatism in
there? Or is that more of a function of kind of the XP end of life, which Brian referred to, sort of playing itself out?
Thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure. I wouldn't say conservatism. It's exactly what Brian said, which is we've seen some nice
indications of strength in enterprise and mature and we can see those selling through. What we're seeing from our
customers is more optimism on the back-half than we've seen the last couple of years for the consumer segment, but we
won't see the sell-through data on that for a while yet. And so what we have in for Q3 is a roughly seasonal third
quarter. And I think if you look at the last few years you'd see a flattish Q4 as also being roughly seasonal.
So I'd say nothing unusual there and we're really watching carefully what happens in the consumer segment. We've got
some great devices coming to the market. And to add on Brian's answer earlier, one of the things that's really exciting is

the price points that we're enabling with Bay Trail in terms of touch-enabled clamshells, we think that those will shift
share and drive excitement in the market, but we just have to watch it.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: And, Jim, the only thing I would add is what I said was we believe the XP end of life
replacement will at least play through the end of the year and that's as far as we've looked at it. It could go beyond that.
What I'm not doing is predicting on 2015 yet and that was really – I don't want you to walk away with I think that's the
end of it, versus we just haven't really started to put our predictions and our estimates for 2015 together yet.
<Q - James V. Covello>: That's very, very helpful and I'll leave it there on the questions. That's great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Hi, guys. One clarification I think might be helpful to people. Can you just give us a rough
idea in your PC Client Group how much of that is the commercial side and how much is consumer?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Of the overall – you're saying how much is of the business?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: ...in terms of the TAM. So I'll give you some high level numbers. I actually haven't looked at it
this way in a while, Ross, so I'll put a asterisk by this data that could be off a little bit. But what we've seen generally in
the PC market is a shift. If you go back four or five years, it was kind of 60% plus business and 40% consumer. And
those numbers have shifted. It's 60% plus consumer now and 40% business. Just in rough numbers I think that's true for
the market.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: And that is our estimate and it's very difficult to track this down to the percentage, because
especially small and medium business, they go into the same place consumers do a lot to buy a system. So tracking
where did that system go and end up is a bit difficult. But 60/40 is probably not far off.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: And I guess really what I was getting at is, is that representative for Intel as well or are you a
little more skewed? I realize you have the dominant market share, but it's within good enough for government's work to
have that sort of approximation?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, that would be indicative of our mix. Our mix is going to look like the market's mix for the
most part.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Got you. And then getting off that topic to one that's a little more specific to you guys, Stacy,
you talked in an earlier question, I think John asked about the gross margin in the fourth quarter and how much it was
implied being down. When you have those multiple fabs ramping at 14-nanometer, can you walk us through what a
typical duration is of that higher cost inventory working its way through before the lower cost benefits actually start to
kick in?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: It's probably a couple of quarters is the way to think about it. The first wafers from qualification
for sale you have the phenomenon of a big factory that's fully equipped with pretty small amounts of volume going
through it, but we ramp the factories pretty fast. So within a couple of quarters we're getting to the point that the
factories are ramped and then the cost would continue to come down for another 12 months or so after that.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - David M. Wong>: Thanks very much. With the current schedule for the Broadwell ramp on 14-nanometers, what
are your expectations for 10-nanometer timing? And will there be a follow-on 14-nanometer family after Broadwell or
would you go straight to 10-nanometers?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So let me try and answer your question. There's a series of products that are on
14-nanometers. We always, remember, do a tick-tock kind of products plus we do a refresh of the Atom line, basically.
So we have Cherry Trail coming in at the end of this year and ramping in the first half. We have Foxton, which is the
follow-on Atom product as well and then the talk or the real architectural shift on 14-nanometers is Skylink, which is
also scheduled for 2015. We've done no changes or shifts to our 10-nanometer schedule, but we won't really talk about
10-nanometer schedules until next year.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay. Great. And could you give us any numbers on your 4G baseband unit shipments or
revenue for June and the growth momentum going into September for 4G basebands?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, low. LTE, and this is pretty consistent with what we showed at the investor meeting,
we're just moving into qualification of LTE. As Brian said in his remarks, it's a little bit later than we thought. So we
kind of thought it was going be end of Q2. It's now going to be early part of Q3. And then we'll see a ramp that is
offset. It's going be more towards the end of this year, early next year. And in the meantime the market is transitioning
hard away from the 2G, 3G platform to LTE. So that part of the curve is consistent with what we saw and you can see it
in our overall revenue results in the second quarter for the segment.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, David.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McConnell from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line's open. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Michael C. McConnell>: Thanks, guys. Looking at just the traditional enterprise segment of DCG is encouraging
to see that recovery here in Q2. Regarding sustainability, with Grantley kind of coming out this fall and then Microsoft
planning to end of life Windows Server 2003 in July, can you comment on kind of the sustainability within that bucket
within DCG? Are you getting more confident that we could see multiple quarters of recovery there, please?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. I'll start and Stacy can jump in. When we take a look at the data center in general and
this gets back to that comment we made earlier about just the lumpiness of each one of these segments,. we said that we
believe we can continue to grow the data center in the low double-digits out into time of which the enterprise is a
portion of that.
As we said, this quarter was extremely strong in the enterprise and we don't necessarily – there was a lumpiness or kind
of a pattern to the orders where customers came in and made some purchases. What we've built into that low double
digits for the whole data center is a enterprise that's in the mid-ish single digits growth over time. So that's more of
what we've projected. We do believe Grantley will be a good product, the enterprise. So we think it's still going to grow
at about that mid range.
<Q - Michael C. McConnell>: Okay. And then just from my follow-up I wanted to ask about market share in Q2. If I
look at PCG, volumes were up about 4% year-over-year. IDC just reported about a 2% decline in overall PC sales. And
you had some pretty optimistic commentary on volumes for Bay Trail on the desktop and the notebook side. So that
growth relative to the market, that outsize growth, was that mostly market share gain or was there something else to do
with maybe inventory build, et cetera?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I think it's couple of things. One is I think that it's pretty clear to us that we are gaining
some share and it's not just from the traditional competitors. I think we're seeing at these price points some shift back of
tablet where we're shipping a really nice 2-in-1 type clamshell, touch enabled clamshell into these price points. So that's

a piece of it.
And then I think the other piece is if you're, as you look at this in terms of year-on-year comparisons if you recall last
year, what we saw is our customers were managing inventories very, very lean. I think they had very little confidence
in a back-half seasonal selling season. And so part of it's just the year-on-year comparison. What they're doing now is
putting in more of a normal build for a more seasonal back-half and last year that was not the case. So it's a
combination of those two things.
<Q - Michael C. McConnell>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Guys, thanks for taking my questions. I had a first question on the tablets and the
contra-revenue. Presumably you've got tablets ramping into Q3 and into the back-half, but you're not calling out
contra-revenues as a margin driver for Q3. Is this a function of the tablet volume? Or is this a function of
contra-revenues rolling off? I think they were supposed to start to decline as we go through the year. Any color you
could give us on that would be helpful.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So let me start with just kind of an overall, Stacy, discussion on the tablets and I'll let our
Stacy comment on the contra versus margin discussion. We are on schedule for our $40 million. We did $10 million in
Q2. So we did roughly $5 million in the first quarter, $10 million in the second quarter. So you can kind of break out
how the rest of the $40 million come in Q3 and Q4 with clearly Q4 being probably the bigger of the two quarters
remaining.
We did say that we would continue to drive down our cost and hence the contra-revenue. We're continuing to do that.
Bay Trail adds to that capability as we exit this year. We said that we're on schedule with SoFIA. SoFIA, fully
integrated part really designed for this segment. That allows us to move into 2015 with a much, much better cost
structure and really drive down the contra-revenue to near zero on those products. So we are on schedule as far as we
had stated through the year of what we're doing on our cost reductions and driving down the contra. I'll let Stacy
comment on how contra is reported versus the margin.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. So you're getting into a little bit of, I think, a math issue here, Stacy. Let me walk you
through it. First, we saw more or less a full point of margin in Q2 associated with that ramp of tablets. If you think
about the volume curve that Brian just laid out, let's take a precise number of $40 million just to anchor. We did $15
million in the first half. That says that we did $10 million in Q2. That says you have $25 million to do in Q3 and Q4.
Let's say it's $12.5 million per quarter. It's not really that linear, but just take that for the sake of argument. The change
isn't that great. So you're really into a kind of change in gross margin dollars. It doesn't add up to something that's
significant or else it would have been on my gross margin recon.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. So you're close to the run rate anyways, I got it.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, exactly. So you saw the big change in Q1 to Q2 where it was kind of a full point of gross
margin impact. It was a little hidden, but it's on the recon, but it's a little hidden in the fact that we were up five points
quarter-on-quarter.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. That's helpful. For my follow-up question I wanted to dig into mobile a little bit. I
don't want to take away from the results of the rest of the business, which arguably look quite strong. But at this point,
until it picks up, there really isn't much of a mobile business to speak of anymore.
I was wondering if you could give us more of a feeling for how mobile presence fits into the long-term goals. Are you
in this for I guess the profit pool that's available? Or is this a strategic imperative for the rest of your businesses to
succeed here? I guess, what milestones should we be looking for? And how do you see the loss rate in this business
trending I guess into the second half and into 2015 as presumably some of the new products from 4G hopefully start to

ramp?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. So I'll start this, and again, Stacy can jump in kind of on the profit side. The answer
to your question, Stacy, is a bit of yes to both. I mean, clearly, we don't go into businesses to lose money, and we
believe that over time we can make this a profitable business. We have some ground to make up, both in getting our
LTE to cat 6 and our products being specifically designed for this segment.
We said we moved some of the early products, Clover Trail and Bay Trail that were really targeted towards clamshells
and almost the netbook era down into the space to get there quickly. And as we turn into SoFIA next year, you'll see a
family of products in SoFIA, including some from Rockchip. You'll see us really targeting this space, and that's how
we become profitable in this space.
But aside from that, this is, we believe, a strategic area for us. We are seeing – we've talked about all of our products
that'd be coming more personal, more mobile, more connected. We're seeing modems work their way into PCs for
example, especially 2-in-1 devices. It's going to probably start with Chromebooks. Chromebooks are best when they're
connected. And so the always-connected requirement's going to drive modems into there, for example.
But you can go from a PC down through tablets, phones and into the Internet of Things in the industrial space where
you're looking at a pump that's out in the middle of the desert someplace or wherever, it's going to want a 2G or 3G
connection probably to get that data back into the system. So we believe modems and connectivity in this space is
critical to almost every segment of our business. But we also believe that we can be in this mobile space and make
money. We just got to get our products there and get the right price structures.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. And...
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well said. Let me – I'll specifically answer the second part of your question, too. So and just –
looking at it from the reciprocal from the CFO seat, if we don't have the ability to integrate in comms, I think three,
four years from now we are locked out of large segments of the market. So it's a critical capability.
That said, we acknowledge that's a big loss and our goal and our plans would suggest that we'll have a significant
improvement in this segment next year. It won't be profitable, but we should be able to improve it nicely next year and
that's the trend. That what we're driving the business to.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. Thank you, guys.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Thanks, Stacy.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Thank you. Great quarter. I was hoping for some more color on the PC client business here in
Q3, specifically how you're projecting business versus consumer PC?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Boy, Romit, we don't break out that level of detail. Did you mean Q3 or did you mean Q2?
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Q3.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. We don't break out that level of detail. We don't even forecast a segment level much less
at a consumer versus enterprise inside the segment. I guess I'd say from a market trend standpoint, we would expect
that the same market trends that we've seen, which is relatively stronger enterprise, relatively stronger, mature markets
are kind of the more dominant factors in the quarter. And then consumer market that's maybe a bit more seasonal and
continue to see some weakness in emerging markets, but none of that is new news. That's just what we're seeing now
and so it would be continuing those trends.

<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Okay. Thanks. And my follow up is on the buyback and trying to figure out the pace of the $20
billion repurchase. Stacy, you shared with us that roughly $6 billion is in U.S. cash, which is about a third of your total
cash balance. If I just flow that through to cash flow it would imply roughly $2 billion a quarter in U.S. cash flow
before $1 billion in dividend and the CapEx commitments. So I'm just struggling to see how you can fund this $20
billion buyback without going into a net debt position. Appreciate your perspective on that.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well, I think – it was a little hard to follow that math on the fly, so I apologize. But the way I
would look at it is we'll do $4 billion in Q3 that as you mentioned comes out of U.S. cash. As we get into the back-half
of the year I expect that I'm generating cash and a reasonable amount of cash is available to me in the U.S. So just
simple math, net of any cash generation I'll still have a couple billion dollars in the U.S. I'll generate some cash. That
gives me a reasonable amount of potential to do another leg of this buyback in Q4. Did that answer your question?
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: All right.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Hans C. Mosesmann>: Thanks. Congratulations on the quarter. Brian, just going back to the 14-nanometer
Broadwell, the availability to OEMs in the first half of 2015 seems to be about a year late. I understand you made
comments about Core M in April and that's on track. But what's driving the delay for the broader portfolio of Broadwell
products? And the follow-up is, what does that do if anything to the cadence of tick-tock? Thanks.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah, I wouldn't have said we're a year late. I'd tell you we're six months. We targeted
Broadwell-M, the Core M because we really feel like it's the product that highlights – the real power of 14-nanometer is
in Broadwell, right? It's the one that's going to really target the fanless thin and light, highly mobile systems, which is
really going to differentiate I think in my mind 14-nanometer from prior technologies. It'll be the technology that
brought the fanless PC to your laptop.
Every one of these process nodes that we do takes – if you take a look at it, going all the way out through the mobile
products, the desktop products, the server products, the Atom products, it's always a year and a half of product launch
to be honest with you, every one of these. By the time you get to the E7 version, I mean, look, we're still launching the
Haswell server products this quarter and that's a technology that's more than two years old.
So that part and the broader availability of more SKUs out into next year – six months, yeah. It's not a year, and you'll
see a series of products through next year. Right now we are still – it's always a shift between our customers and the
OEM partners' availability and readiness to do a new SKU at our readiness of the product. They'll move as we move
through the year next year. I think what's key to me is that the process is healthy. We've got the product in a yield
capability, right, to be able to launch. We have a set of criteria that we use on every technology, to be shipping to
customers, it's met that quality requirement, those yield requirements and that's – we're shipping to customers today.
And you're going to have product on shelf.
<Q - Hans C. Mosesmann>: Okay. And just as a follow-up, does that delay Skylark (sic) [Skylink] by six months?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Skylink?
<Q - Hans C. Mosesmann>: Skylink, sorry.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: We're still looking at the actual launch date. We've said it's in 2015, so it's a pretty broad
window there. We're trying to pin down – and I think as we go through the second half of this year, we'll pin down
exactly when Skylink will come to market. Again, it's going be a – as we launch these other Broadwell products, when
do the OEMs, the consumers, everybody, when are they ready for Skylink? That will drive it as much as anything on
the process readiness and the product readiness.

<Q - Hans C. Mosesmann>: Thank you.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Hans. And operator, we'll go ahead and take two more questions.
Operator
Our next question comes from Christopher Roland from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Rolland>: Hey, guys. Great quarter. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I missed a brief segment
there. So forgive me if this was asked, but on PC guidance and operating profits for the PC segment, you guys
previously said down I think it was mid single digits there and op profits were flat. And I guess given the strong results
here and guidance, can you update us for the year?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure. Well, I would say that guidance is no longer valid based on what we saw in the first half.
So on the PC market, when you – if you go and look at some of the third parties out there you get a range of estimates
and actually they're fairly divergent at this point. But some of the ones I was looking at earlier today kind of show a PC
TAM that's flat, maybe down a little bit once you adjust for things like Chromebooks and 2-in-1s and detachables. I
don't think we'd be far off of that from the standpoint of our view of the TAM.
And then we'll see we believe some unit growth based on the things we talked about earlier, more normal inventory
levels and more importantly some share gain, and that will equate to some revenue growth for us. We haven't gotten
more granular than that. And probably won't get more granular than that at this point. We'll just watch the results play
out in the back half.
<Q - Christopher Rolland>: Okay. The last time I looked I think Gartner was down maybe 3%, so that discrepancy is
growing pretty dramatically there I would say.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, just one caveat, and it's gotten really confusing because we see these form factors all
coming together and so you have to get really precise about what you call a PC client. In our PCCG results we would
include Chromebooks, we would include 2-in-1s, things like the Microsoft Surface. We would include detachable. So
yeah, the definitions become pretty important here in terms of what are they counting versus what shows up in PCCG.
<Q - Christopher Rolland>: Okay. Great. And then on the 4% sequential growth for next quarter maybe you guys can
give us a little color onto, sort of force rank perhaps the segments where you see the most strength.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Hey, Chris, we'll go ahead and answer that one as a courtesy. But I just want to remind
everyone we ask people to ask just one question and one follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And I'm sorry, say the question again.
<Q - Christopher Rolland>: Yeah, just some color on the 4% sequential growth for next quarter, how that sort of
shakes out between the segments.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. Again, we're not going provide that level of granularity. Just step back and say it's
roughly seasonal based on what we've seen the last several years. And it kind of feels like the right place to be after a
fairly strong first half.
<Q - Christopher Rolland>: Great. Thanks, guys. Great quarter.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Chris.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ian L. Ing>: And first question in foundry. You've been highlighting this three-and-a-half-year manufacturing
lead. Any other improvements in your foundry offerings or collateral as you target the next node? It seems the
window's closing here to go after some new 14-nanometer customers?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So, yeah, I mean,. you saw we signed up Panasonic this quarter there. We're still in
discussions with several other potential partners. So I wouldn't necessarily agree that the window is closing even on
14-nanometers. We have already started carrying the learning though we've had on 14-nanometers from all segments
both from our own efforts into the mobile space, our partnerships with our current foundry partners, the work we've
done with third parties in design like Synopsis and Cadence.
So we are carrying that off into the 10-nanometer space and we already have people that are talking to us about
10-nanometer foundry. But I guess I wouldn't have said that the 14-nanometer window was closing. I mean, if you still
take a look at the 14-nanometer technology relative to what anything else is available out there, we're still the only
company on the planet who is shipping a FinFET transistor of any geometry. And we're clearly the only people out
shipping 14-nanometer products. So I think our leadership is – we've got some window where people could still jump
in and have a leadership product.
<Q - Ian L. Ing>: Okay. Thanks, Brian. And then housekeeping for Stacy, domestic versus overseas cash, is there a
mix there? And should there be a repatriation holiday, would that free up more cash for buybacks and dividends or are
those already being invested overseas?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: So there is a mix and we disclose it. If you look at domestic cash and this is not taking into
account some of the longer-term investments, it's on the order of $6 billion out of the total. In terms of our priorities
from the standpoint of tax reform, we actually like to see a more comprehensive tax reform for corporations that bring
down our tax rate to make it more in line with what we see in other industrialized countries. That's a bigger issue for us.
We're a big manufacturer. So the manufacturing credits become important. We think those help us create jobs here in
the U.S.
The cash piece for us is less important than it is for maybe others because remember, we generate cash all over the
world but we also make investments all over the world. We have factories in Ireland and Israel and China and the U.S.
And so we consume cash. So we don't end up with the same kind of trapped cash problem that companies do that have
minimal operations outside the U.S.
