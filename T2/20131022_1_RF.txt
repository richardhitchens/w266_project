Thank you and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Regions and participation in our third quarter
2013 earnings conference call. Today we reported earnings of $285 million for the quarter, demonstrating our steady
focus on executing our strategic priorities and business plans. Our continued progress is reflected by many key
measures. We grew total loans for the second consecutive quarter. We expanded our customer base. We increased net
interest income both year-over-year and linked quarter and we achieved broad-based asset quality improvement.
Year-to-date we grew loans nearly $2 billion, including just over $900 million in the third quarter. Importantly, this
loan growth extended to both consumer and business lending portfolios. Looking first at business lending, commercial
lending remained a significant driver of overall loan growth. We have a simple and yet effective model that focuses on
relationship banking through high quality customer service coupled with industry expertise. The model is enabling us
to expand our customer base and grow our loans outstanding. Despite this modest growth, uncertainties surrounding
economic and political conditions as well as interest rates continue to weigh on business demand for new loans and our
overall business marketplace.
On the consumer side, we have realized steady increases in new credit card production with active cardholders rising to
the highest number since we purchased the card portfolio two years ago. Over the last year, we've increased our
customer penetration rate by approximately 110 basis points, demonstrating the success of our marketing and sales
effort. Further, we grew our indirect auto loan portfolio for the 11th consecutive quarter. We currently have
relationships with approximately 25% of the auto dealers across our 16-state franchise, and we continue to build upon
our dealer network. However, we do this while adhering to disciplined credit parameters.
In line with our expectations, mortgage loan production declined 16% in the third quarter. As we transition from a
refinance to a purchase-driven market, we are adapting our business model to adjust for the overall production
slowdown. Customers remain at the center of our overall strategy, and our commitment to providing products and
services that customers need and want remains steadfast.
This means constantly building and improving our technology infrastructure for both our consumer products and
services and back office platforms. To that end, we have made strategic investments in our people and technology.
During the third quarter, we added almost 400 new positions, many in customer-facing, revenue-generating and
compliance areas. We're also making investments in our risk management and compliance infrastructure and will
continue to do so in order to effectively manage the evolving industry demands. As we have consistently said, we will
continue to make prudent investments in our future while adhering to an expense discipline.
At the core of our strategy is Regions360, which as you may recall, is the approach we take to serving our customers
and our communities. We believe this strategy of building a stronger relationship banking culture at Regions will drive
revenue, increase associate retention and ultimately drive sustainable growth.
Prudent risk management, another key component of our sustainable growth strategy, also continued to pay off in the
third quarter. Net charge-offs as a percent of loans was 0.6% at the end of the quarter as net charge-offs declined to the
lowest level in more than five years. We achieved improvement in virtually every credit metric as our credit asset
quality continues to improve.
Finally, we were able to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and have now completed
essentially all of the $350 million of authorized share repurchases.
In summary, overall third quarter results reflect positive momentum as we stay focused on moving the company
forward. We still have work to do, but continue to successfully execute our strategic priorities and business plans to
deliver long-term value to our shareholders.
I'll now turn it over to David for a more detailed look at third quarter results. David?

Thank you and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with the balance sheet. As Grayson mentioned, we achieved solid
loan growth again this quarter, as total loans increased over $900 million or 1% from the second quarter. We grew
almost every loan category with both business and consumer lending up quarter over quarter.
Starting with business lending, which includes our commercial and investor real estate portfolios, in total these loans
increased 2% from the end of the prior quarter. This growth continues to be led by our commercial and industrial
portfolio as ending loans grew 3% quarter over quarter. The growth in this portfolio was driven by our real estate
corporate banking group or REIT lending, and our specialized lending groups also had a strong quarter with healthcare
and technology lending, in particular, achieving significant growth. Asset-based lending was also a strong contributor
to loan growth in the quarter.
Total business lending production was $13.8 billion, an increase of 18% over the prior year. Commitments for new
loans were up $306 million or 6% from the prior quarter. And pipelines remained solid, and we are beginning to see
some pickup in M&A activity among our client base and modest increases in small business lending.
Production in the investor real estate portfolio increased from the second quarter and offset the pace of derisking, which
has slowed considerably. Investor real estate loan balances totaled $7 billion at quarter-end, a decline of $84 million or
1% from the prior quarter. Growth in the investor real estate production was driven by single family and multi-family
construction. And July and August were the highest production months in the last three years. While balances in the
investor real estate portfolio may fluctuate depending on production levels, derisking and payoff activity, we believe
that we may be close to stabilization in the portfolio.
Now turning to consumer lending, this portfolio increased 1% from the previous quarter, marking a pivotal shift in
balance trends. Our indirect auto portfolio achieved 7% loan growth from the prior quarter. In addition to expanding
our dealer network, we are focused on increasing our number of loans per dealer by developing technology that will
improve response time for loan requests, which should ultimately serve to increase loan production. However, we will
remain disciplined with respect to our conservative credit requirements and policies.
Credit card balances were also up this quarter, as our number of active cardholders increased almost 4%. Period end
balances totaled approximately $900 million, an increase of 3.5% as we experienced five consecutive months of
balance increases. Much of this growth was driven by our marketing efforts through balance transfer offers extending
to our existing customer base.
Mortgage balances were steady from the previous quarter due to the slowdown of mortgage refinancing activity. In
addition, declines in our home equity portfolio have slowed considerably.
Strong customer demand for our fixed rate home equity loan product is offsetting the impact of customer deleveraging
on the variable rate home equity line product. As a result, we expect the pace of decline in our overall home equity
portfolio to slow. All in all, our third quarter loan growth was stronger than anticipated. And looking ahead to the
fourth quarter, we expect loan growth to continue, but at a more moderate pace.
Let's move on to the liability side of the balance sheet. Deposit mix and costs continued to improve in the third quarter.
Total average low cost deposits increased $473 million from the previous quarter, and time deposits fell to just 11% of
total deposits. This positive repricing and mix shift resulted in deposit cost declining 2 basis points, down to 13 basis
points. As a result, total funding cost for the company declined 5 basis points to 35 basis points. Although opportunities
to further reduce deposit costs are diminishing, we still have an additional $4.6 billion of CDs maturing in the next 12
months at an average rate of 31 basis points. Now, this compares to our current average going-on rates for new CDs of
approximately 19 basis points.
Now let's look at how all this has impacted net interest income and the margin. Net interest income on a fully taxable
equivalent basis was $838 million, up $17 million or 2% from the previous quarter. The resulting net interest margin
was higher than we expected at 3.24%, an increase of 8 basis points from the previous quarter. The liability
management and investment portfolio actions we took late in the second quarter provided a 7 basis point lift to third
quarter margins. These actions, as well as continued improvements in deposit costs, have helped to offset the effects of
a persistently low interest rate environment.

Although lower loan and investment yield pressure net interest margin, this effect has been largely offset in recent
quarters by our improving mix and cost of deposits and borrowings. The opportunity for the margin to further benefit
from lower deposit costs will subside in future quarters. However, the increase in long-term rates has provided some
tailwind. Rising rates are expected to be beneficial to our net interest margin as our asset sensitive balance sheet reacts
favorably to increases in both short-term and long-term rates.
Higher long-term rates affect prepayment behavior. As a result, we experienced a positive impact from lower premium
amortization in our securities portfolio. Lower premium amortization contributed approximately 5 basis points increase
to the margin and totaled $59 million for the quarter. Of course, higher long-term rates also benefit reinvestment yields
on fixed-rate loans and securities. With rates at their present level, we expect net interest margin to remain relatively
stable. Additional details surrounding our interest rate sensitivity can be found in the appendix of the accompanying
presentation.
Let's take a look now at noninterest revenue. Third quarter noninterest revenue was relatively flat from the previous
quarter due to an increase in service charges that was offset by a decline in mortgage income. Also during the quarter,
we divested a non-core portion of our wealth management business, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $24 million. As
expected, mortgage income declined in the third quarter as production slowed as a result of fewer refinances due to the
recent rise in interest rates. Mortgage revenue declined 25% and loan production declined 16% over the prior quarter.
New home purchases continue to drive mortgage origination volume and accounted for 60% of total mortgage
originations compared to 37% a year ago. Importantly, we have already started adjusting our mortgage operations
model to account for the reduction in applications. Some costs, like commission expense, decline immediately.
However, there are other expenses that will experience a lag before the savings are realized. We expect fourth quarter
production volumes to continue to decline another 15% to 20% from third quarter levels.
Service charges increased $14 million from the previous quarter. Importantly, new checking account production
increased 4% over the second quarter, which should serve to facilitate future cross-sell and revenue opportunities.
Products like our Now Banking suite continue to gain traction, and the number of households using these products
increased 66% over the past year. Of note, almost 60% of these customers are new to Regions, providing us with
additional opportunities for revenue growth. Also, Now Banking prepaid cards increased 57%.
Let's take a look at expenses on the next slide. Noninterest expenses totaled $884 million in the third quarter. As you
may recall, expenses benefited last quarter from a lower level of legal and professional fees and unfunded commitment
expense. Also, last quarter included $56 million of debt extinguishment costs related to the early termination of certain
debt and preferred securities compared to the $5 million we incurred this quarter. Also, this quarter legal and
professional fees increased 6% compared to the prior year and totaled $34 million.
Salaries and benefits increased slightly this quarter due to additional staffing in many revenue-generating and
customer-facing areas. Expenses have also increased related to investments that we have made to our compliance and
risk management infrastructure. We continue to rigorously review all expenses on an ongoing basis, which includes
personnel, occupancy, furniture and equipment, as well as branch rationalization opportunities.
And you should expect some fluctuation in expenses on a quarter-to-quarter basis as we make investments to generate
revenue growth in the future. However, if the revenue does not materialize, we will reduce expenses accordingly. We
expect fourth quarter expenses will approximate those of this quarter, and that 2013 expenses will be modestly lower
than those of 2012.
Let's move on to asset quality. We are very pleased with the overall improvement of our asset quality. Net charge-offs
declined 21% linked quarter and 64% from the prior year and reached the lowest level in more than five years,
representing 60 basis points of total average loans. Total loan loss provision was $18 million, which was $96 million
less than net charge-offs. As a result, the allowance to loans declined 15 basis points and was 2.03% at quarter end. Our
non-performing loans declined 10%. In addition, inflows of non-performing loans declined 39% to $199 million.

Our loan loss allowance to nonperforming loans was 114% at the end of the third quarter. Notably, criticized and
classified loans, which is one of the best and earliest indicators of asset quality, continued to decline with commercial
and investor real estate criticized loans down 10% from the second quarter. Classified loans have declined 67% from
the peak in the fourth quarter of 2009. And based on what we know today, we expect continued improvement in asset
quality going forward.
Take a look at capital and liquidity. Our capital position remains strong as our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the
quarter stood at 11.6%. Our estimated Tier 1 common ratio was 11.1%, which is relatively consistent with the prior
quarter. We estimate our fully phased-in pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will be approximately 10.4%, and is
well above the minimum threshold. Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company remains solid, with a
loan-to-deposit ratio of 82%. And lastly, based on our understanding of the new amendments, Regions remains
well-positioned to be fully compliant with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio.
So I'd say in summary, our third quarter results reflect our focus on moving the company forward, and we will continue
to seek opportunities to build on this positive momentum and maximize shareholder returns.
I'll now turn it back to List for instructions on the Q&A portion of our call.
M. List Underwood
Thanks, David. We are ready to begin the Q&A session, and in order to accommodate as many participants as possible
this morning, I would like to ask each caller to please limit yourself to one primary question and one related follow-up
question. Now, let's open it up the line, operator.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, so a couple of questions. One is on loan growth. You indicated that you are likely to
see a little bit of a deceleration rate in loan growth as we go into 4Q. And I just wanted to understand where that's
coming from because you do have good momentum in many of your asset classes, and you indicated that home equity
was likely to shrink less. So if you could give us some color on where the moderation comes from.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Well I think that when you look at the loan growth that we had in the third quarter, it
was a little stronger than we had initially anticipated. We began the third quarter, we had signaled that we thought the
third quarter typically, which is a seasonably slow quarter for a lot of our lending activities, we fully expected it to be a
little more modest than it was in this quarter. We exceeded our expectations.
We still continue to temper our expectations for the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter typically is a strong seasonable
quarter for us in terms of lending activity. Last year in particular was strong due to a lot of anticipated tax structure
changes. We don't anticipate a repeat of that this year, but we do anticipate that fourth quarter will be a good quarter.
We've got good, solid momentum, but we are being a little conservative, if you will, on what we think our opportunities
are in the fourth quarter. We'd certainly be delighted to exceed those expectations, but right now we've tried to
moderate our expectations given the economy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. But you're also looking at year-on-year growth as opposed to linked quarter
annualized growth?

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: That's correct.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just as a follow up, in direct auto, nice increase there. Could you maybe give
us a bit of more color? I know that you have been increasing the auto dealers that you've been working with. Could you
give us a sense as to what types of products or are there incremental product types that you're going into as well?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Yes, we really have not expanded our product types. We've stayed pretty close to the
structure we've had all along. We've continued to be encouraged by the growth in that market, although that market has
become more competitive and I do see some competitions on both rate and term in that segment of our portfolio. What
we've tried to do is continue to grow our dealer network, and we've been pleased with the number of dealers that we've
been able to add. But we've been very focused on trying to sell deeper into the existing dealers that we have on board to
try to generate more volume from those dealers. But we really have not expanded our product set or our credit criteria
for that space. We tried to remain very disciplined. We probably may be giving up some volume given the credit
disciplines we've got in place, but we still believe it's the correct strategy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hey, good morning guys.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning Ryan.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Just a follow up on the expense outlook. So, you talked about 4Q being flat with 3Q. And just
as you're looking forward to 2014, I mean you're one of the few banks that actually generates some top line growth.
And I understand that this is showing that some of the investments are working, but just beyond 4Q, how do we think
about the trajectory of expenses into 2014? Should we expect expenses to be down again, or are you more targeting
positive operating leverage? And how should we think about the path of the efficiency ratio?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes Ryan, this is David. I will tell you, it's a little premature for us to give you the 2014
expense numbers, but let me try to frame it up. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, we have made investments to
grow our revenue. We've done a pretty good job of managing expenses. If you look at our non-interest expense in just
about any category, average assets, FTEs, we're one of the lowest in our industry. We need to grow our revenue, which
is why we've made the investments that we have.
So an example of that would be in wealth management, where that is a relatively new business group for us where
we've invested in financial consultants, and we expect that revenue to come. It just doesn't happen in a particular
quarter. So I think you kind of nailed it with the operating leverage. Our goal is to generate positive operating leverage,
and we think we can do that by making smart investments. If you look at the efficiency ratio, obviously, our efficiency
ratio was up this quarter. We still expect over time to be in that 55%, 59% range, need a rate increase to help us do that.
But our focus is on growing revenue, because that's really where we think overall the generation of shareholder value
comes from. And that's really what our game plan is.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: I'd say, Ryan, I'd say additionally, as we've seen a slowdown in mortgage, that's going
to take a little while to play out from an expense standpoint. Clearly, we're adjusting our operating model to what we
anticipate to be the volume of activity coming through that channel.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it. And then just as a follow-up on the net interest margin. Does this contemplate any
changes in rates or liability management actions from here? I mean your outlook is calling for stable, but you still have
some funding levers. The securities portfolio appears to have bottomed. Loan yields are declining at a decelerating
pace. So I'm just trying to understand given the move in the margin this quarter, is this just your guidance is coming in
a bit conservative or is the competition that intense such that you see a pickup in asset yield pressure from here?

Page 7 of 16
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Well we had an increase of 8 points on NIM, and we're calling for that to be stable. It's
obviously dependent on rates. We benefit from short-term and long-term rates. And so I think we need to see what
impact the prepayments will have. That was a big driver of our improvement in NIM as our premium amortization
came down from about $72 million to $59 million. We think if the rates will stay kind of where they are right now, we
know we've had a little bit of a rally today in rates, but we think that stability in the margin for the fourth quarter in
particular can continue.
We do have a couple of levers as I mentioned on deposit costs. There's not as much there as we have seen in the past,
but we can pick up a couple of points perhaps, and we still have some, as we look at long-term debt and think about
that, that's less available to us because most of those debt instruments are really tied to capital. So we'll have to consider
that in our CCAR process. But we worked our funding cost down to 35 basis points. We have a little bit more to go
there, but again, I think our focus is on generating the asset side of the balance sheet and we're seeing growth. We've
now grown in a couple of quarters, and that's encouraging to us.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Yes and I would just add from a loan competition, loan pricing, loan yields
perspective, then I would agree with your earlier comment. You saw pressure on that for several quarters, but the level
of pressure seems to have subsided to a degree. Rates seem to have stabilized sort of where they're at today. That could
change over time, but right now we don't see a lot of pressure on that particular category.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. Back to the loan yields quickly, as a follow-up there to that discussion, the loan
yield was only off about 2 bps in the quarter. Based upon your commentary, you sound pretty confident in the
sustainability there. I mean, should we expect that this is the range of a quarterly compression that we could see in that
yield, or could it accelerate a bit?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: John, I think that our guidance was really all in NIM versus breaking it into its individual
parts. I think we did have a modest decline in loan yields there. A lot of that is really dependent on mix changes that
you see. I think that in this low rate environment, the longer it persists, you should continue to see a grind down in
terms of loan yields, albeit our pace, which was only 2 basis points, maybe it's not quite that low. Maybe we have a
little more of a decline, but I think our funding side protects us quite a bit there. So that's why we're able to give you
confidence on the stability of the margin all-in.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. And then on the loan growth front, can you talk a little bit more about, I know
you mentioned it quickly in your prepared comments, around the commercial real estate inflection, and particularly in
the investor CRE book. Can you talk about your confidence of seeing that and when we could really see a material turn
in that book?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Well I think that what we said this time is that we've seen new production improve,
albeit from a very low level, and we also would say that new production is more broad across different commercial real
estate asset classes than you would have seen a quarter or two before. But it's still relatively small, and we think that
given we are a commercial real estate investor, commercial real estate portfolio is today, is that we could be reaching a
point of stabilization. An inflection point would assume that we had rapid growth beyond that point. I do think we'll
stabilize and start to grow modestly in that portfolio, but we're remaining very disciplined and prudent in what we put
into that portfolio, and but I would say that at this juncture we're encouraged by some of the increased demand for that
product.
<Q - John Pancari>: And is that a quarter or two away, that stabilization, Grayson?

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: I think a lot of it, knowing what we know today, I think that's a reasonable assumption,
but some of this is the entities behind these assets sometimes accelerate payoffs and paydowns that we can't necessarily
anticipate.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good morning. My first question is a follow-up to Ryan. We're calculating an adjusted
efficiency ratio of 68% this quarter, which is higher than the mid 60s that you've been trending over the past quarter. As
we look out into your near-term efficiency goals next year, could you get back to that mid 60% level, and is the
message on this call is that getting back to that mid 60% level really going to come on the revenue side at this point?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Erika, I think it predominantly comes from the revenue side, but it will also come from
expense reduction on the mortgage side of our business as well. David, anything you want to add?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes, I think we've been at the 63% range. We popped up to 67%. We expect to work that
down on both sides. Obviously, we have levers on expense all the time. But we really want to be careful that we don't
just shoot for a particular goal in any given quarter on efficiency. We want to make the proper investments for the
long-term growth of our business. So, I think the predominant driver will be revenue and we expect that to come
through our investments that we've made. If it doesn't, we adjust expenses accordingly to work that down, because
we're not going to sit here and accept a 67% efficiency ratio.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And as a follow-up to that, could you give us a little bit more color on which
business lines you're currently investing in?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Well, it's been across the board. So, I gave one example earlier. Wealth management was
our new business group that we started investing in this year. We've hired quite a few financial consultants. If you look
at our head count additions, almost half of those are revenue generation folks. So wealth management is one area.
We've hired additional people in our branch distribution channel. That's where the vast majority of our products are
sold, and we needed more people to grow revenue, grow households out in that channel. So those are two. We've also
invested in relationship managers across the board in multiple geographies and especially lending and general business.
We have the capital liquidity. We're ready to go. We're ready to invest and make and grow our revenue, because you
cannot generate shareholder value in the long-term from expense reductions. You got to make prudent investments to
get the revenue going. And we are, that's our bet we're making, and if that doesn't come, we'll adjust accordingly. But
it's really across the board. There's no one particular place.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Good morning.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Keith.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: I'm going to beat the expense horse one more time. Just curious, when you think about the
head count additions let's say in areas like wealth management, how much more hiring do you think needs to occur?
And then, what kind of revenue lift or productivity goals do you have there and sort of what's the breakeven? Does it

take six months, 12 months, 18 months? I'm just curious on that.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes, I think when we make – so you picked on wealth management, on that particular
one. We make investments in people who pay for themselves within a year, and so it's pretty quick. And different
businesses have different timeframes in terms of when they pay for the investment. So again, we can react pretty
quickly. We mentioned the reaction we can make on mortgage. Our mortgage, the production for purchases is up. We
have mortgage loan originators dealing with that, but then we have adjusted the back office. So we're moving our
expenses around to give us the best return we can. But these investments that we're making in revenue generation areas,
we should see revenue growing quarter to quarter to quarter. The question is different investments have a different
length of time to return.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Okay. And then could we switch sides to the overall balance sheet? I know loan growth was
very healthy this quarter, but total interest-earning assets declined a little bit versus second quarter. Where do you see
the overall balance sheet heading, and should we just expect more of a mix change, meaning more loans, less securities
going forward?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes, Keith, what you saw on the earning asset change was really the recognition of the
transaction that we made last quarter, the deleverage. We sold some investment securities late in that quarter, last
quarter, so they didn't manifest themselves into a decline in the average assets until this quarter. We're kind of there.
We think we've stabilized the earning asset levels and we grow from here, so that was really the anomaly that you saw.
If you go back and look at ending, you can kind of see what I'm talking about.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning. As we think about some of the compliance and regulatory costs that you
mentioned, are you able to size how big they are, either in absolute terms or maybe the change versus a year ago? And
are you fully ramped there or is there still some increase to come related to those areas?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Matt, I think that clearly in the environment we're all operating in, it's an evolving
environment that we continue to make investments in audit and compliance and in risk management. I think those
investments will continue to mature over time. As we're obviously able to mechanize more of these processes and be
more productive, you'll see some rationalization of those resources. But for right now, I think we still see an evolving
and increasing risk management environment, and we're continuing to make investments as we see appropriate.
That being said, we have to figure out a way to fund that, to pay for that on the business side of the house. And that's
why we're investing equally in the customer-facing revenue-producing side. That tends to be somewhat opportunistic
because we are looking for talented team members to add to our team, because our primary focus is serving our
customers, and we need good bankers to be able to do that. And we're finding those in select markets and making those
investments when we believe they have got a fairly rapid payback.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, and then just switching gears on the premium amortization. I think it's about a 23
basis point drag to the net interest margin this quarter. And as we think about that drag going away over time, assuming
rates stay here, do we just think about kind of an average life of the portfolio of three to four years and it's probably not
exactly straight-lined, but that thought process, or?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes, Matt, so we were down quite a bit. Our duration is right at four years. You can't
straight-line it, but you can do that as a proxy. I think starting the quarter we had right at $800 million of amortizable
premium. We amortized $59 million, so the delta that's left, we do make investments each quarter, but so we're down to
$740 million-ish of amortizable premium. So, you can do your math to get a proxy for that over the four-year duration.

<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: I guess with where rates are right now, are you still buying bonds or premiums? I'm sure
the premiums are a lot smaller than they were before, but is it still mostly premiums that you're buying?

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Hey, Marty. Good morning.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Good morning. I was going to ask you about deposits. As you're making the significant
shift to the lower-cost deposits, you've seen total deposits kind of continuing to move lower. It does look like if you
look at the period-end numbers, you're at an inflection point that you might start to see deposits growing again. Is that
kind of what you're thinking about and starting to see some stabilization, even growth there?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Yes, Marty, as we sort of go on through this cycle, and to David's earlier point, deposit
costs are down to 13 basis points. Not sure how much room there is to go lower. Maybe it's 1 point or 2. But what
we've seen is, now time deposits are 11% of our book. We're still growing low-cost deposits, but not growing the time
book. As that time deposit book, as they have maturities, we're retaining just over 70% of the customers who have
maturing CDs in the time deposit segment.
Those that we don't retain, some portion of them are putting monies into money market or into savings. We're very
close to a point where we believe we can start showing net growth in total deposits, depending on customer behavior.
But as we've got our book down to this roughly 11% mix of time deposits, I think we're in a much better position as
you look forward. We think this has been a good strategy for us. We think it's really helped us during this point in time.
That being said, as rates increase, we're trying to model what happens to deposits. There's not a lot of historical models
for how deposits react in this kind of market, because we've never really been here before. But we're spending an awful
lot of time understanding what we believe to be customer behaviors in a rising rate environment.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Marty, I'll add something that's quite interesting this quarter on deposits. So, we had been
retaining in total about 70% of our deposits, whether it be in CDs, rolling over into a new CD, or other core deposits.
That number was up to about 80%. So 70% of it, as Grayson mentioned, went into retained as a CD, but we had the
delta there going into core deposits. So it wasn't the runoff we had seen earlier, and we can suspect that was related to
rates have just been lower and the delta between what's maturing and what's going on is not as great as it was. But we
feel good about our deposit balances. The investments we've made that we talked about in terms of people should also
help us grow those deposits. And we're looking forward to that, because you can never have enough low-cost deposits.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: When I was just looking at the period-end numbers, if you look at interest-bearing and
noninterest-bearing, the total number actually was up over the average. So it looked like it was starting to signal that
inflection point. And then lastly, David, I'm just curious. As you've made this big shift out of time deposits, when rates
start to go up, do you think you can kind of go back in and recapturing some of that market share when the time in the
market is appropriate? Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Marty, what we've tried to do is during this time period, we're actually running some
number of different strategies in some of our markets to try to determine what customer behavior will be. Today our
loan to deposit ratio is 82%. So, we don't necessarily need additional deposits today. Although, we're always looking
for new customers and trying to grow our deposit base, and so we are running a number of different strategies across
our markets so that we can find what's the best strategy for raising deposits when that time occurs.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Good morning. Just a couple of questions. First, looking at charge-offs, it looks like much
of the sequential improvement came from lower C&I and owner-occupied CRE. And I'm curious to know there if that
was a function of lower units of charge-off or a lesser degree of severity or higher degrees of recovery, or what the loss
content experience was.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: We've got our Chief Credit Officer, Barb Godin, with us today. We'll ask Barb if she'd
answer that question.
<A - Barbara Godin>: Certainly. It's a little bit of both. What we've seen is the granularity of our portfolio has clearly
gotten a lot smaller. We really don't have that many credits, particularly those that charged off that were more than $1
million. We only had a handful. So that explains a lot of those averages coming down. Same thing with number of units
came down. And the loss severity per unit also came down.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Thanks, Barb.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And then maybe just jumping back to the NIM for a moment. It looks like you've got a
couple of chunks of long-term debt coming up in 2014. I think it's $350 million and something like $850 million in
2015. What would be your intent with respect to refunding those maturities at this point?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes, we constantly look at our maturities a couple of years in advance. We will get to a
point where we need to add new long-term debt. So we do have a slug coming due in the latter part of 2014. And we've
dealt with that already in our liquidity profile because of our policy. So you should expect us to be in the market in the
not too distant future.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And if I may just sneak in one more. With respect to, it looks like – sorry back to credit, the
30 to 89-day past dues seem to be sneaking up in a number of buckets, and I'm just wondering how we reconcile that
with the overall decline in asset quality trends? So, that's it for me. Thank you.
<A - Barbara Godin>: It's Barb Godin again. A lot of that does have to do with seasonality, especially as you think of
any of the consumer buckets, back to school, et cetera, happening, we typically do see the 30 to 89-day delinquencies
go up. On the business services side, in general, that's usually one or two accounts. We've looked at all of them. There's
nothing in there that suggests that there's any trends at all.

<Q - Michael E. Rose>: Hey, just wanted to get a little sense on the Now Banking initiative. It seems like there was
good increase in utilization there. Can we just get an overview for what that contributed to deposit service charges and
what your outlook is there? Thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: I mean, we continue to look at ways to improve our product set to serve our customers.
And the Now Banking suite has been an attractive offering for us. It's growing from a relatively low base, so the
contribution to our earnings from that product set are still relatively small but growing. And so, but more importantly,
it's given us the opportunity to really serve our customers and to try to attract new customers into our branches. I think
the most exciting part is of 60% of the customers are new to Regions, so it's given us an opportunity to really attract
more people into our branch offices and garner more utilization of that branch channel to try to serve an even greater
number of customers. David, you want to talk a little bit about contribution?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes. I think as Grayson mentioned, it's still relatively small. I think if you look at the run
rate for the year, we'd be in the $15 million to $20 million range and growing. So we're encouraged by the growth, not
because of just the dollars today, but where we think it can go over time serving a customer segment that hadn't been
served before as well. And it gives us a chance to grow households there, and if you look at our footprint and you look
at the opportunities for Now Banking suite, it's pretty large. So we're encouraged by that.
<Q - Michael E. Rose>: Okay, and then just a follow-on to that. Is there any updates in working with the CFPB in
regards to this product and have they given you any additional feedback? Thanks.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Not on this product, no. This is really a prepaid debit card and check cashing and
expedited bill pay. Those are the kind of products.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Funds transfer.
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: And funds transfer. So it's really not – these are good core products and we don't see
issues relative to that agency on this.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on commercial loan utilization
rates. A number of your competitors have said that those softened in the third quarter versus the second quarter. I'm
curious if you've had the same experience and what your expectations are for the fourth quarter.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: You know, Matt, we haven't seen that. I mean, our utilization rates of lines is relatively
flat. It didn't move much at all during the quarter. If fourth quarter follows historical trends, we'll probably see a little
increase in utilization, but so far just really haven't seen much movement in it this quarter.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then, just pulling up a little bit. In terms of the buyback, you mentioned that you
pretty fully used your current authorization, and is it fair to assume that you would not really plan on doing much more
on the buyback front until you are out of the 2014 capital planning process?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Yes, I mean as you know, any capital action requires approval from our regulatory
supervisors. So we executed, as we mentioned when CCAR came out, what our plan was. We executed in accordance
with that plan as our board allowed and as the regulatory supervisors authorized. So if we want to have additional
return to the shareholders via buyback or dividend, it requires us to submit a CCAR filing and ask for permission.
We're evaluating that as we do 2014 CCAR.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Right, okay, thanks very much for taking my questions. .

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Good morning. Thank you. I had to jump off, so I apologize if you have answered this
question. Can you guys share with us on the indirect auto, you've had obviously good growth here. There's been some
commentary in the media about the Consumer Protection Bureau going after the dealers with the dealer reserve. What's
your guys' view on that? How can you manage that process if they're forced, the dealers, to lower that reserve going
forward?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: A couple things, Gerard, that I'd point to. First, banks represent about 42% of this market,
so there are captives and others that are in this market. There has been some indication of wanting to get that down. We
have seen competition come down to where we've been, and we continue to monitor that, monitor our dealers. We have
an aggressive program to go in and make sure our dealers are being fair to the customer, and when we find a dealer that
is not, we don't do business with the dealer. It's pretty straightforward, and we feel very confident with what we're
doing. That being said, we have to wait and see and as we know, there's a regulatory environment can change, and we
have to adapt and overcome. We've done that over and over through the numerous changes that have occurred over the
past several years, and we'll continue to do that in this case. But we feel confident where we are right now that we're
doing the right thing by our customer.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. Thank you. And on the second question, shifting gears, obviously you guys are very
well capitalized and I know regional banks do not know what their Basel III Tier I common ratios will be under the
new rulings. Clearly 7% is the minimum but maybe there will be a small SIFI buffer. When you do your CCAR, what's
to prevent you from for asking for 100% payback of return of capital, I should say, of earnings for 2014?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Physically nothing's to prevent us. What we don't want to happen is – it's incumbent upon
us to manage our capital in an appropriate manner. And that starts with our Board of Directors and goes through all of
us that manage capital. And there's a lot of us through this capital planning process to do that. So we want to make sure
that we have an appropriate amount of capital, and then whatever we deem to be appropriate is submitted to our
regulatory supervisors for their signoff. And that includes spot capital and stress capital.
So nothing prevents it. It just needs, we need to put in something that makes sense, is credible. It's based on our
strategy and what we're going to do with our balance sheet. And there are a lot of factors that go into managing capital,
so it's not as easy to say just you clearly have plenty of capital today to be able to return 100%. You haven't seen that in
our industry. We clearly want to utilize our capital in the most efficient way, whether it be dividend or share buybacks.
But most importantly, we use the capital that the shareholders gave us and that we generated through operations to
invest in our business going forward. And that's what we primarily want to do first. And we think loan growth,
investing in businesses like our credit card portfolio that we bought. At some time M&A will come back and that will
be a place to utilize capital. And if we can't do those things, returning it to the shareholders is the right thing to do.
So all of that goes into our thought process. We're in the middle of that as we speak, and we think we have a very good
capital planning process with good governance and we'll exercise that and file our CCAR in 2014 and you'll see the
results of that soon afterwards. But nothing's technically to prevent you from doing it.

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Good morning, Gaston.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the issue of
loan growth for a second. As you look across our key markets, whether you are looking at Florida or Alabama or some
of the other large ones, is there any way to kind of parse through quickly and get some color on how loan growth is
behaving different, demand for loans is behaving differently in some of these key markets or is it pretty even across the
board, would you say?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: No, I think that if you look at our loan growth, then I would say we've dissected it both
geographically and also by lending segment. And you've got geographically, clearly a lot of the growth has come out of
the markets that have energy-related activities, Louisiana and Texas. A lot of our growth also has come out of some of
the Midwest markets, in St. Louis and also Indianapolis, been particularly strong in those markets. But even in the
markets that have been the most challenged, if you will, like Florida, we're seeing the pace of loan runoff there
materially slow, and the pace of new production improve.
So, as I mentioned earlier in my comments, I believe I mentioned this, is that we grew in our 16-state footprint, we
grew loans in 70% of our markets. So we divide those 16 states and 19 markets and we grew in 70% of those. And so
it's broader this quarter than it was last quarter geographically. It's also broader from a lending segment as well. Still a
lot of dominance in the large commercial and corporate space. But we did see more activity in the commercial middle
market and even in the small business and even in consumer this quarter than we saw previous quarter. So
incrementally better, incrementally broader is what I would say, and geographically not all geographies are behaving
the same today, but closer than they were.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: And are you growing any more optimistic about Florida, would you say, or not?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Ask your question again, please.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: I'm sorry. Are you growing more optimistic about Florida getting even better, or not, just
holding steady?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: Yes, we are. The housing recovery we say is real. Florida was at the center of this
economic storm, and so recovering a little slower and later than some of our other markets, but clearly recovering and
we're optimistic about it. We think long term it's going to be a good market for us. We've just got to be disciplined in
how we do business there.
<Q - Gaston F. Ceron>: Great. Thanks for the color.

Your final question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of cleanup ones here. So Dave, I was just wondering, can you
help us dimensionalize the magnitude of the cost reduction that could come out of the mortgage business as you get
around to that point of level setting that back to the new revenue run rate?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Ken, it's hard to come up with a point estimate on the dollars. I think what we need to do
is adjust it according to what the revenue opportunities. Our revenue opportunities are different than the other areas.
Remember, we're more of a purchase shop than we were a refinance shop. So I think that we've seen still pretty strong
demand over purchase mortgage. We want to make sure we have mortgage loan originators out there. We've grown
that. But we've reduced our back office 22% thus far, and that's primarily through reductions in temporary staff and
overtime at some people. But that's really what the driver is. Obviously if revenue is down, commissions are down.
You see that pretty quick.
So I think what I'd leave you with is we're confident we can adjust mortgage pretty rapidly. It just may not follow a
given quarter. That being said, that business was very strong over the past couple of years. Gains on sale were large.

All that is starting to rationalize a little bit, but it's a great shop. They do a fabulous job in the mortgage group and the
mortgage servicing group. And we will continue to make investments in appropriate places, and we will cut back on
other areas and adjust accordingly.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: All right. And then just in terms of just you continuing to fund this growth buildout, is there
anything you guys are contemplating or have in place on the branch and staffing side to also cut out of that side of it as
well?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.>: You know, that's a great question. We spend an awful lot of time looking at all of our
sales and service channel. And the branch channel is one that is one of our more expensive channels, and we continue
to monitor the behavior of our customers and the utilization of our customers of those offices. You will continue to see
us. We got 1,700, a little over 1,700 offices. We continue to look at the size of those offices, the technology that is
embedded in the offices and in terms of where there's opportunities for us to make that delivery system more efficient
and more effective. And you'll continue to see that out of us. We don't have anything to announce today, but when you
look at the way we're servicing our customers, we continue to invest in each channel, but we continue to rationalize
each channel at the same time, and we do that on a regular basis in our branch channel.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: All right and another little clean up one. Relative to this wealth management business sale, can
you talk about any revenue and expense impact that that will have going forward?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Well, we made investments in our wealth management group, the financial consultants I
was talking to you about. We've added probably over 100 people during the year, and if you just compare our third
quarter of 2013 in terms of some of our fee income related to that business, we're up 67%. And I think that that's really
important to us. We have cut businesses out. You saw us, we had a disposal of a segment in wealth management that
wasn't as profitable as we wanted it to be. So we've made adjustments there. But wealth management is relatively new.
And we'll continue to make investments to grow that revenue, and feel very confident that revenue comes pretty
quickly.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Yes, so David, on that sale piece, will that be a noticeable change, either the revenues that go
away or the expenses that go with it to the point of it not being a very profitable part of the business? Does it have a
noticeable effect on the financials going forward?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Ken, I doubt you'll even notice, that you'll even see it. It does impact us some, but it was
pretty negligible, so I don't think you'll miss it net/net after expenses that were taken out of the revenue loss.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay, and my then my last, last one on expenses is, professional fees you guys are spending for
the regulatory side and getting ready for CCAR and whatnot, does that eventually crest and roll back over? Is that a bit
of a temporary blip that you're seeing there, or does that roll over at all?
<A - David J. Turner, Jr.>: Well, you can see volatility in professional fees. You can look at any particular quarter
and see the kind of volatility we have. We're in a unique environment. Our whole industry is, and so you've seen that be
a little higher than we want it to be. So, we think in time, if we get the environment to stabilize, we think that those
costs rationalize as well and come down to a more acceptable level, I should say.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: All right. Thanks very much.
O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.
All right. Thank you for everyone's time. There being no more questions, we'll stand adjourned. Thank you.
