And now, I'd like to introduce the Priceline Group speakers for this afternoon: Jeffery Boyd and Daniel Finnegan. Go
ahead, gentlemen.
Jeffery H. Boyd
Thank you, and welcome to Priceline's second quarter conference call. I'm here with Priceline's CFO, Dan Finnegan. I
will make some opening remarks and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take
questions.
The Priceline Group reported consolidated gross bookings for the second quarter of approximately $10.1 billion, up
38% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $508 million or $9.70 per share, up 24% versus prior year. Second
quarter results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $9.38 per share and our guidance for the quarter.
Worldwide hotel room night reservations were $69.4 million for the quarter, up 38% year-over-year. Our international
business recorded 44% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, roughly consistent with Q1's growth rate.
Growth rates benefited from good results in Europe and continued high growth rates in Asia-Pacific and the Americas.
International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at rentalcars.com.
Booking.com's platform now has over 330,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 40% over last year.
Booking.com's growth in Europe has held up well this year, despite continuing economic and political uncertainty. We
believe the steady international room night growth we have posted this year is driving market share gains.
Booking.com continued its aggressive development of markets outside Europe. These markets continue to grow faster
than the core European markets, contributing to more overall growth, as they become a larger percentage of the whole
business.
We are investing in growing hotel and accommodation supply and in marketing, including Booking.com's offline
marketing experiment in the United States, which we believe is contributing to the room night growth Booking.com is
seeing in the U.S.
Agoda delivered good room night growth in the quarter and continues to build its business as a leading site for
Asia-Pacific bookers. With Agoda and Booking.com, whose Asia-Pacific business does particularly well with
international bookers, we believe the group is strengthening its position in this part of the world with attractive
prospects as the region grows.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 12% in the second quarter, showing continued improvement, aided by growth
in domestic rental car reservations as well as improved hotel room night gross bookings, with Express Deals becoming
a larger part of the opaque hotel business. Priceline.com has done a good job building Express Deals for customers who
want Priceline savings without the bidding. And the response of some new ads we are running, featuring William
Shatner and Kaley Cuoco, seems positive.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 30% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and rentalcars.com. Growth in rental car
days increased sequentially from 43% to 46%, driven by strong growth at rentalcars.com and continuing improved
results at Priceline.com. Rentalcars.com continued to perform well as it builds out its international footprint. We closed
the KAYAK transaction on May 21, and Dan will discuss the impact, including their financial results for the stub
period. KAYAK is being run independently, and we're encouraged as we start look at opportunities to promote
KAYAK's growth.
The group's business performance exceeded expectations in the quarter. And operating margins, while down, came in
within the range of our forecast. Advertising efficiency continues to be an important variable, which is difficult to
forecast with precision. Efficiencies are impacted not only by changing business mix and competitive and seasonal
factors but by substantial, ongoing changes to our most important distribution channels, including the growth in mobile
and changing interfaces at our largest partners. Based on what we see in the marketplace, I believe our online and
offline teams are executing well in a challenging environment.

I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review.
Daniel J. Finnegan
Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide
guidance for the third quarter of 2013. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year
comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
KAYAK is included in our income statement from the acquisition close date of May 21 through the end of the quarter
as well as in our guidance for all of Q3. KAYAK revenue included in Q2 results, net of intercompany activity,
amounted to $31.1 million. We will report KAYAK's revenue for the first year to help investors understand the impact
of the acquisition on our top line growth. We expect that the impact of the KAYAK acquisition on our non-GAAP EPS
for 2013 will be minimis.
Q2 was a strong quarter from a top line perspective. Hotel room nights booked grew by 38% in the second quarter,
consistent with the unit growth rates achieved in both Q1 and Q4. Our international business performed well in all of
our key markets. Our Priceline.com U.S. business achieved accelerating room night growth in Q2 compared to Q1.
Average daily rates or ADRs for Q2 2013 were up on a local currency basis by about 1% for the consolidated group.
Rental car days booked were up by 46%, reflecting strong results for both rentalcars.com and Priceline.com.
For the second quarter compared to the prior year, the FX rate for the euro to the U.S. dollar was favorable by about
2%. And the FX rate for the British pound to the U.S. dollar was unfavorable by about 3%. As a result, currency
exchange rates had little impact on our year-over-year growth rates, expressed in U.S. dollars for gross bookings,
revenue, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and net income. The FX rate for the euro to the U.S. dollar was about 1%
unfavorable to our guidance forecast assumption.
In summary, strong unit growth rates drove solid results compared to our guidance on all key operating metrics.
Q2 gross bookings grew by 38% compared to prior year. Our Q2 international gross bookings grew by 44% on both the
U.S. dollar and local currency basis. Gross bookings grew by 12% for our Priceline.com brand business in the U.S.
Growth in both retail and opaque reservation services contributed to year-over-year growth.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.4 billion and grew 38% as compared to prior year. Year-over-year gross profit
growth for Q2 was hindered slightly by Easter falling on March 31 this year, which resulted in some revenue related to
the holiday shifting into Q1. The inclusion of KAYAK in our results contributed about three percentage points of
inorganic growth for the quarter.
Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.2 billion, which constituted an increase of 40% as compared to
the prior year, and an increase of 39% on a local currency basis.
Gross profit for our U.S. business, including KAYAK, amounted to $183 million, which represented 26% growth
versus prior year. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of non-GAAP gross profit amounted to 44.1% for Q2
compared to 48.2% for the prior-year Q2.
The operating margin declined by 410 bps compared to prior year but was near the better end of the range of 400 to 500
of operating deleverage assumed in our guidance forecast.
As we've discussed over the last several quarters, operating margins were impacted by lower year-over-year advertising
ROIs, business mix as well as offline advertising spend for KAYAK and Booking.com.
Also, as we discussed last quarter, Q2 margins are negatively impacted by an earlier Easter this year, which caused the
shift of some gross profit into Q1, as well as a tough prior-year margin comp. Other OpEx besides advertising
de-levered by 60 bps, as we invested in personnel and other expenses to keep up with current and future business

growth. We excluded $6.4 million of deal costs incurred in Q2 related to the KAYAK acquisition from non-GAAP net
income because the expenses are not driven by core operating results and render comparisons with prior periods less
meaningful.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 amounted to $621 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $560 million to $595
million and represents 26% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income also grew by 26%. And non-GAAP EPS
grew by 24%, reflecting the impact of higher fully diluted share count.
In terms of cash flow, it was a busy quarter. We generated approximately $593 million of cash from operations during
second quarter 2013, which is about 37% higher than last year. Operating cash flow for the quarter benefits from our
decision to prepay in the first quarter $224 million of income taxes for Booking.com in return for an early payment
cash discount. These taxes would otherwise have been paid monthly over the year and so second quarter and
subsequent quarters of 2013 have a lower payment burden as a result.
We spent about $21 million on CapEx in the quarter and $193 million to acquire the remaining non-controlling interest
in rentalcars.com. We also paid cash of $328 million, net of cash acquired, and $1.55 billion in shares of our common
stock and assumed KAYAK stock options to close the KAYAK acquisition.
As we announced in May, we completed a $1 billion convertible debt offering during the second quarter. We believe
this represents attractive financing for the company, with a coupon interest rate of 0.35% and a conversion price of
$1,315 per share. The debt has a seven-year term and generally cannot be converted prior to maturity, unless our stock
trades above $1,973 per share.
Concurrent with the offering, we announced an authorization from our Board of Directors to purchase up to $1 billion
of our common stock. We repurchased $347 million of our common stock in Q2. The remaining proceeds, as well as
our other cash and investments totaling about $6 billion at quarter close, are available for general corporate purposes,
including additional share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment.
Now for third quarter 2013 guidance. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 27% to 34% and to grow on a
local currency basis by approximately 25% to 32%, with U.S. gross bookings growing by 5% to 10%. We expect
international gross bookings expressed in U.S. dollars to grow by 32% to 39% and to grow on a local currency basis by
approximately 30% to 37%.
Our Q3 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by about 1% compared to
prior year. Our Q3 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.33 per euro and $1.55 per
British pound as yesterday's closing rates, which results in average exchange rates that would be stronger by about
5.5% for the euro and weaker by about 2% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our third quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any
fluctuation in the euro or the pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not
offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our
earnings beyond the third quarter. We expect Q3 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 23% to 30% and
gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 32% to 39%.
We expect about 250 bps of de-leverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit compared to
prior year. We assume that margins in Q3 will again be impacted by de-leverage in online advertising expense, due to
lower year-over-year ROIs, business mix continuing to shift to our international brands and to pay channels for certain
of our brands. We will continue our investment in TV advertising in the U.S. market for our Booking.com brand, and
the inclusion of KAYAK will also increase offline advertising compared to prior year.
Other OpEx is stable as a percentage of gross profit, reflecting continued investment in people and related expenses to
support business growth, offset by a favorable comp because Q3 2012 included a $13 million one-time payroll tax
charge in the Netherlands. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $990 million and $1.055 billion, which at
the midpoint represents 31% growth versus prior year.

Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 16%, comprised of
international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. We are targeting non-GAAP
fully diluted EPS of approximately $15.30 to $16.30 per share which, at the midpoint, represents 27% growth over
prior year.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 53.3 million shares, based upon yesterday's
closing stock price of $927.58, and reflects the impact of shares issued and options assumed as part of the KAYAK
acquisition, net of shares repurchased during Q2.
We forecast GAAP EPS between $13.75 and $14.75 per share for Q3. The difference between our GAAP and
non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
We're pleased by the strong and steady unit growth the group has delivered over the last several quarters and that is
inherent in our forecast. Over the trailing 12 months, the company has facilitated travel bookings accounting for about
234 million hotel room nights and total gross bookings of $33.7 billion. I highlight that our guidance reflects
deceleration in growth experienced to date in the quarter and our expectation that such a large business, comparing
against high transaction growth rates, will experience sequentially decelerating growth rates.
Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general and conditions in the
consumer travel market, in particular.
We will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your
line is open.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks, guys. Just two quick questions. So we've seen, Dan – as you mentioned, we've seen a
lot of change in some of your core customer acquisition channels, so Google Hotel Finder going meta; Trip Advisor
going meta. Do you guys view these kinds of changing dynamics as an opportunity for Priceline to take market share
versus OTAs and supplier direct? And then with the concept of changing dynamics in mind, how do you view your
opportunity to gain market share in mobile versus, maybe, some of the smaller OTAs and supplier direct? Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: With respect to the first channel. Whenever you have changing interfaces in important
advertising channels, it represents both a risk and an opportunity. We have done particularly well in the legacy
environments. And so I think we have risk when the interfaces change. But I think our teams have done a good job in
executing against those changes and trying to build the processes and the understanding to do well in those
marketplaces as they change.
The fundamental asset that we have is a great website that converts customers very well, and that is an asset that has
high value in all of these interfaces. Whether it's metasearch or pop-ups, we tend to do well once we get a visitor to the
website. And that continues to be a very important part of how we try to improve our product and help build share in
these markets. So we look at it both as a risk and as an opportunity. And I think it's a given in our space that these
markets will continue to change; that the media model businesses will continue to try to optimize for their customer
flows and for revenue. And all of us just have to be prepared to deal with those changes.
With respect to mobile, I think the teams have also done a very good job of building terrific mobile websites, building
functionality in our regular websites that work well in a tablet environment and building mobile apps. If you look at the
number of downloads that we have as a group, it's in the tens of millions. And I think we're doing a good job in
building apps that consumers want to download. And our focus is really to try to build downloads that consumers will
actually use those apps to buy product because they tend to be quite loyal. And I think we're doing well there, based on

the disclosures that have come out from competitors in the space. We're comfortable that we're tracking nicely in terms
of mobile share.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Khan of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Jeff, can you talk a little bit about the efficacy of your TV ad campaign in the U.S.? And how
much did it contributed to your performance versus your own expectations in the quarter? And how do you see it
tracking going into the second half? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: So I assume you're asking about the Booking.com campaign here in the United States because
keep in mind, now we have three brands that are advertising.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Correct.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: Priceline, Booking and KAYAK. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're happy with
the results we've seen to date, and we think that the ad campaign is contributing to the growth that Booking.com is
seeing here in the United States. So it's an ongoing experiment, and we continue to the monitor results. But we're
pleased with what see so far. Then you had a follow-up?
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Yes, I do, actually. So just – I think going back to your – with your comments on your
earnings call for the last quarter. I think you talked about seeing some easier comps in the second half for advertising,
just because you start to anniversary some of the spending that you had in the last year. So are you still comfortable
with that? Or how would you – would you want to revisit that and give us an update on how you look at that?
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: I think that best update we have is the guidance that Dan gave you for overall pressure on
operating margins, which is going from 410 basis points in the second quarter to our guidance for approximately 250
basis points in the third quarter. The components of that pressure, while lower than in the second quarter, continue to be
pressure on ROIs. And as I've said in previous calls, we, first and foremost, want to make sure that we're adequately
investing in distribution and building the franchise. And while we haven't changed the fundamental way that we do that
or the disciplines that we apply to that process, we want to make sure that we're adequately supporting the business.
And so whether it's offline or online, if we think there's an opportunity to – an attractive opportunity to spend money to
build the business, we'll do so.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Ronald V. Josey III>: Thanks for taking my questions. So two, really – they're sort of combined. The first is just
on macro. And I think, Jeff, you said that summer travel was off to a strong start and seeing sustained improvement in
Europe. I think you said good results over there. Wondering if that's just – if you're seeing maybe a change in macro in
the travel vertical over in Europe, such that things are getting better? Or you just know how to operate better in a
challenging environment? And then the second part of the question is, any update on, say, 3Q trends? I think some of
your competitors have been out there saying July might be a little bit slow. Thank you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: Sure. So with respect to the macro, I think what I said in my prepared remarks really is a good
summary of how we look at it. I – we still view it as a challenging environment from an economic standpoint because
there is continuing economic and political uncertainty. Having said that, the market has been relatively stable – and I
say relatively, relative to six months ago and to parts of last year where we're having civil unrest in Greece and a lot
more headline activity around the economy and the potential for sovereign default. Those headlines have abated in
recent months.

And so as both Dan and I mention, we were relatively pleased with sort of the growth rates that we saw in Europe and
are not calling out any particular market or region as being particularly problematic compared to others.
With respect to the third quarter, I – basically, what we said in the guidance is that we've guided to what we think are
attractive growth rates. They represent a deceleration from what we reported in 2Q. And we said that, that deceleration
is something that we would witness so far in the quarter. And I don't think we'd go beyond that in terms of
characterizing the sort of month-to-month kind of results.
<Q - Ronald V. Josey III>: Great. Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your question, please.
<Q - Mike J. Olson>: All right. Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe a question on domestic, then. You've come in at the
high end or above the high end of your domestic bookings growth over the last couple quarters, and I think the
midpoint of your domestic guidance, 5% to 10%, would suggest a kind of 400 to 500 basis point deceleration. Is there
anything that you expect to change during the quarter or that you're already seeing that may have changed in the quarter
that leads you to expect decel? Or is it just for conservatism? Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: It's just deceleration in the business. We think it was a great quarter in Q2, and we think the
guidance for Q3 is strong. Top end of that range would be very similar to the growth that was delivered in Q2. So really
nothing in particular there, Mike, that we're calling out, but just the expectation for some deceleration.
<Q - Mike J. Olson>: All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Jeff, I know you get a lot of questions around mobile. But I'm curious, if you take a step
back and look at the broader impact that you see mobile having, particularly in the cost of customer acquisition as well
as adding incremental users, especially now that KAYAK is sort of in house. Are you noticing that mobile in general is
driving to you a newer or a different customer base than you've typically seen online? And is it doing it at either a
different cost of customer acquisition, or do those customers have kind of a different economic profile?
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: I – Heath, I think it really is still too early to say with certainty how mobile advertising and
mobile customer flows are going change acquisition costs. The thing that is still – and there's a couple of things that are
still in play that we and others haven't figured out. First of all, I think most major brands are investing heavily in mobile
to make sure that they understand how the channel works and that they're holding share and they're not missing
something. And those levels of spend and the efficiency of those spends may not be steady state. There may be more
aggressively spending in the early days of the development of the marketplace to build the capacity and the confidence
to win in that marketplace over the long term. But you really don't know what the steady state spend is going to be
because we're still early days.
Second thing we don't know is how sticky, ultimately, the customer is. And I think that you could hypothesize that, app
customers, for example, would be stickier. If you get them to download and use the app, you don't have to pay for them
again. Therefore they would have high lifetime value relative to advertising cost. And those theories are being acted out
not just in the travel space but all over the Internet, trying to figure out what the real value of an app download is and
how to drive one that's effective in terms of usage. And again, I just think it's too early to map that out.
And finally, a lot of this activity doesn't happen exclusively on the mobile device. And people are still trying to figure
out how to attribute marketing spend that results in a search on a mobile phone and a booking on the desktop or

vice-versa. And that's stuff that we're all looking at and we'll get a lot better at. So I think this is a field that is new,
exciting. It's going to change. And we're very hopeful that we'll be able to execute effectively and build a nice loyal
customer following in mobile. But I really couldn't tell you right now whether it's, over the long haul, going to make
our customer acquisition costs go up or go down.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: No, I appreciate that. That's really helpful. One other question. You've been able to – lot of
focus, obviously, on advertising deleverage, but you've able to get for that additional advertising accelerating growth,
particularly from a bookings perspective. Can you gauge for us your willingness to push that growth accelerator
forward, particularly as, at least some of your competitors seem to be maybe pulling back a little bit?
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: No, I think that we will try to be consistent and sustainable. Those are the two things that we
would try to focus on. We're an opportunistic company. So if there is an opportunistic – an opportunity to build
business with decent efficiencies, we'll take it. But we want to make sure that we have a disciplined approach that we
apply across channels and that we can stick with as the channels change. And we want it to be sustainable.
I don't – it's just like offline advertising. You're not going to accomplish anything if you spend a tremendous amount of
money in a given year but then you can't spend that money in a future year. And so – and by the way, there's been some
variability in the television spend of our competition. As they're trying to work their way through that, that variability
doesn't seem to me to serve a brand well. You want have an advertising program that is sustainable over time so that
whatever benefits you get from building your brand in the consumer's mind, you can continue to reinforce and
maintain.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Really appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: My question. Jeff, I was hoping you could help us understand the reason for the KAYAK
slowdown that we've seen over the last few quarters. And then also, how you're thinking about the booking path for
KAYAK strategically going forward. Thanks.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: So with respect to KAYAKs revenue, I'm probably not going to say much more than what's
been reported publicly and the separate financials and the disclosures that Dan gave you. Because intercompany
advertising with KAYAK is eliminated, you really can't get a good impression of the revenue trajectory just by looking
at the stub revenue we reported.
And because we're continuing to evaluate how our brands work with KAYAK – and I think it's fair to say traditionally
that Priceline Group brands were underrepresented in KAYAK's products; that we didn't sort of fight to our weight in
their various marketplaces. And now that we're one company, of course, we're going to make – want to make sure that
we have a reasonable share of KAYAK's business, given the size of our brands. And that will benefit both our brands
and KAYAK. I think that's sort of how – as far as we really want to go on that.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie. Your question, please.
<Q - Tom Cauthorn White>: Thanks for taking my question. Firstly on EBITDA margins. I was wondering if maybe
you guys could talk about whether your margin expectations for the business, say, over the next couple of years have
changed in any way, given the fact that your overall unit growth rates haven't really decelerated to the extent you guys
have sort of talked about in the past. I understand you guys are making new investments in new geographies, but how
should we think about I guess overall leverage in the model over the next couple of years?

And then just quickly on China. It's been a about year since you announced the Ctrip partnership. Any updated
learnings you can share about the market there? Or has your view on how you want to participate in that market longer
term changed in any way? Thanks
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: I think with respect to long-term margins, I don't have any particular guidance for you. I can
you give you an historical perspective, which might be helpful for you coming to your own conclusions about where do
you think it's going to go. For many years, we were very fortunate to be able to hold or even improve margins as the
business grew at very high rates. And we felt that at that point in time, we were investing adequately in the business,
and we were building very substantial share gains in the course of those years.
And at that time, we said it was our goal to deliver growing business and to essentially maintain our margins. We
haven't been saying that for the last couple of years. And I think that reflects the statement that I've been making now
for many quarters that to the degree that we think it's necessary to invest in people or in marketing or technology to
basically capitalize on the global growth opportunity that we have, we are willing to do so. And we will tip the balance
between trying to improve operating margins versus growing the franchises where the opportunities are so attractive
and important. We're going to tip the balance in favor of growing.
And I think that's particularly the right strategy for our group, given the fact that our absolute margins are so much
higher than our nearest competitor. We've got the resources to do it, and shame on us if we didn't capitalize on that
asset and use it to our greatest advantage.
I've also said that we don't foresee a situation where we're forced to completely capitulate on margins and not be able to
deliver earnings growth as we invest in the business. I think the model is still robust enough to do that and, in fact, we
are doing it. So we don't – I don't foresee a time when we're in a position of an Amazon where the things that they're
working on are so – so big and costly and obviously have such massive potential that they are prepared for a period of
time to, in effect, reinvest all of their earnings growth in those new opportunities. I don't see us as being in that
position, at least not in the foreseeable future.
<Q - Tom Cauthorn White>: Thank you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: And I guess there was a question about China there, a second question. Dan, why don't you...
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: So we've had the partnership with Ctrip for the past year, and we're happy with the results
to date. Our approach in China remains pretty consistent, which is continuing to add hotels in China to our extranet for
Booking.com and Agoda.com. We've had good success with inbound travel into China, and we've also had good
success with Chinese travelers travelling within APAC and outside of the region. And so we hope that over time, we
can continue to build our supply there and build our brand recognition with Chinese travelers and participate to a
greater extent in the domestic market as well.
<Q - Tom Cauthorn White>: Great. Thanks for the color, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: ... please. First, if you could talk a little bit more about the rentalcars.com strategy, extent of
the cross-selling opportunity, the unit economics, how attractive that segment is versus your core business. And then
secondly, Jeff, you described the U.S. advertising, the brand support – TV ad support for Booking.com as experimental.
But it sounds like you're also making the comment that sustained branding helps businesses. So when does the
experimental stage end, and when do you go to full-fledged advertising support for Booking.com in the U.S.? Thank
you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: Okay. Thank you, Mark. So with respect to rentalcars.com, their business model is to build out
a global platform for rental cars, much the way that Booking.com has done for hotels. And it's a very similar approach.

One product, simple website, focused on conversion and with a significant investment in online marketing to support
building the customer base. The unit economics for the rental car business, while probably not as attractive to a degree,
as hotels might be, certainly attractive enough, especially in international markets, to support that strategy. And you've
seen the unit growth that we've been reporting for rental cars group wide. And renaltcars.com is a big part of it and
doing very, very well.
Cross-sell has been a piece of that. Renaltcars.com is an option post transaction for Booking.com customers. It also
provides some support for U.S. customers of Priceline.com. And over time, it will advertise and be available on
KAYAK. And so we'll promote cross-sell where we can; Agoda as well. Keep in mind that because our biggest
business is hotel, the cross-sell opportunity, while a valuable and good opportunity, it's not huge because the cross-sell
from hotel to rental car is not as material as it is – for example, the cross sell from an airline ticket here in the United
States to rental car. But an opportunity that we value and that we're pursuing.
With respect to Booking.com, when does it not become an experiment? I think that the culture of Booking.com is that
everything is an experiment permanently and that you're always evaluating what the return on investment is and all of
the quantitative aspects of the spend and the impact on traffic and conversion on the website. Having said that,
Booking.com is going to have a decision to make as early as the end of this year as to whether they continue the
campaign next year. And that decision hasn't been made yet. But as I said previously and in my prepared remarks, we
think the ads are contributing to the growth that Booking.com is seeing here in the United States. And we're happy with
the results so far.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks a lot, Jeff.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your question, please.
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: As the industry is pushing on the various marketing channels offline, online display,
search, et cetera. Are you seeing different dynamics in terms of conversion rates? And then maybe a little more
specifically on mobile, are those conversion rates inflecting up, or is it still more browsing in that channel? Thanks.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: Dan, you want to handle that one?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Yeah. We don't disclose our conversion rates by channel, Brian. It's one of the areas that I
think is a key area of competency for us. We've got very well converting websites. And it's – one of our key efforts
every day is to continuously improve the experience of our customers on our website and continue to add content to
continue to push that conversion upward.
In mobile, it's more challenging because you've got a smaller screen and it's still earlier days. So as Jeff pointed to
earlier, we're still learning there. What's the best way to acquire traffic? And then continuously improving, and from a
much earlier – from a much more recent starting point, the experience for our customers as they land on those smaller
screens. So it's ongoing. And we hope that given the expertise we've developed over the years in desktop that we can
transfer that to the smaller screen and also give our customers a great experience there.

<Q - Michael Millman>: Thank you. I was wondering a couple of things. One, on Expedia's transaction, preference,
promotion or maybe more than promotion – practice. If you're seeing any effect on volume or margins. Secondly, on
rental cars, if maybe you can separate the U.S. and Europe in terms of availability and year-over-year price and even
look at that in terms of retail and Express. And maybe if there's any Name Your Own Price. And just – maybe you can

help with why the cost of revenues in the quarter was down? Thank you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: So, Michael, maybe I'll try the first couple, and then Dan can address the cost of revenue
question. So I think the first question you were referring to Expedia's Traveler Preference Program, which is the
program where they offer consumers the ability to book agency or merchant with the same hotel, depending on what
the traveler – whether they prefer to pay upfront or pay at the hotel. Expedia has been rolling that out. I think it's
benefited their results, and so that's something that seems to be the case, according to the disclosures that they have
made.
It's hard to tell whether that has an impact on our businesses. As you've seen the results that we've reported, they've
been fairly consistent. And I think we're still in a position where we're gaining share, despite the launch of that
program. Expedia's got a lot of – more hotels to put in it. We have a similar program here at Priceline.com in the
United States where you can book both merchant and agency for the same hotel depending on traveler preference. And
we've been doing that for a couple of years now. And we think it's a good feature and – but I don't think that feature, by
itself, has really changed Priceline's position in the U.S. marketplace, per se.
With respect to the rental car marketplace, I think the high-level commentary I can give you is that pricing has been a
little bit stronger this year. In the last couple of years, the pricing environment has been challenging for the rental car
businesses. But I think the pricing is firmer this year, both in the United States and in Europe. And – but availability
has not been a material issue for us, at least not so far this summer, as you can see by the unit growth rates that we've
reported in the last two quarters. I just don't think you can – you could get to that kind of a growth unless you had some
decent availability supporting it. So I think those numbers give you the best indication of, at least our experience, with
availability. And Dan...
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: So, Michael, the cost of revenue decrease is driven by Name Your Own Price hotel
business. So that business is continuing to decline. And we report it in our income statement on a gross basis. So the
total value of the transaction is in revenue, and then the cost that we pass on to the supplier is in cost of revenue. And
the decline there is what's driving the decrease in that line item.
<Q - Michael Millman>: Yeah. Thank you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Sena of Evercore Partners. Your question, please.
<Q - Ken Sena>: Was hoping that maybe on some of the unit growth figures, you could maybe talk a little bit about
the impact of KAYAK and what it had in the quarter. And maybe if you could just provide it sort of on a pro forma
basis. Thanks.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: We're not going to disclose the specific intercompany unit transaction trends between group
brands and KAYAK.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: And just to be clear, there is no room night bookings for KAYAK itself. It would just be
through referrals to other group brands. But nothing in our unit growth is specific to the KAYAK acquisition.

<Q - Scott H. Kessler>: Hi. Thanks a lot. There's been some discussion about Asia. And I'm wondering if you could
provide some additional, I guess, details about how you think Agoda is doing. You obviously spoke to the alliance with
Ctrip. But any additional details as to opportunities that you see; the nature of the competitive environment; the pace of
growth that the market and you're experience in there? Any additional information will be appreciated. Thanks.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: As we mentioned previously, Asia is a very attractive market for Booking.com and Agoda. I
think we're fortunate to have two very strong brands that have emphasis in different parts of the market, with Agoda
serving – a vast majority of its customers are APAC travelers, travelling in the APAC region, whereas Booking.com
has a lot more international travelers coming into the region from outside. We're – we are very pleased with the
trajectory for both of those businesses. We haven't given color on unit growth rates for Agoda on a long, long – for a
long, long time.
What we have said with respect to those markets, though, is that they generally are growing faster for the group than
our core markets. And that continues to be the case. So we're comfortable and encouraged by what we're seeing there
for both Agoda and for Booking.com.
<Q - Scott H. Kessler>: Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open, sir.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. Jeff, as you look out across your pipeline of hotels or just look at your share versus
offline in Europe and Asia, do you feel like you still have plenty of growth ahead as you look out a couple of years?
Maybe give us a big picture of where you are today versus a couple years ago on that front. And what would you do if
the day ever came that you kind of hit fully penetrated on the hotel market? And then on the KAYAK side, I know you
can't give us specifics, but is the KAYAK acquisition a material for gross profit guidance or for your booking guidance
in 3Q? Thank you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: Okay. I'll handle the first one, Justin. And Dan, you can handle the question on KAYAK. If
you look at the growth that Booking.com has been able to maintain for several quarters now, improving its inventory of
hotel and accommodation supplies by 40% year-over-year in the second quarter. It shows that we're still able to add
significant properties to the platform. I've said before and I'll repeat that there is a diminishing return; that those
properties tend to be smaller, have less have rooms and potentially not as wide appeal as some of the properties that are
already on the program.
But there's still a lot of room to add supply. And by definition, the supply we're adding is our accommodations and
hotels where we have zero penetration. And so there's real opportunity to build our penetration in those properties.
There've been some things published, and we published a year or two ago a number from Eurostat, trying to get our
arms around what the market opportunity is. And suffice it to say that we're not going to in the business of doing that,
just because it's so hard to get data on how many hotels there are and how many nights are stayed in those hotels on a
global basis. But we certainly believe that there is a substantial opportunity for all of our brands to continue to grow
their business.
Booking.com, as everybody knows, is now advertising in the United States and trying to build a stronger position here.
It's a market that Booking.com is a relative newcomer to, and I think that represents a significant opportunity in what is
one of the largest worldwide markets for accommodation. And we are still in early days, notwithstanding our
succession, Asia, given the size that market, our penetration there is relatively low. And South America as well. So
there's just a lot of – at least in our opinion, a lot of opportunity out there for us to continue to build the business. And
the new market strategy, where we continue to invest in these new markets and try to build them aggressively so they
get to be a larger size and they have – make more of a difference on total gross bookings, has continued to serve us
well. And we'll be focused there, also.

<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: And KAYAK doesn't impact our gross bookings, Justin. We don't look at KAYAK as a
platform upon which a booking is made. It may send a referral to other group brands, and they may get a gross
booking. And then that would show up in our numbers the way it always has in the past.
In terms of gross profit, we're not giving guidance on that level of detail. We'll report KAYAK's revenue, though, when
we report the quarter. But KAYAK will be included in our gross profit, net of revenue that it earns from other group
brands, which will be eliminated as intercompany. So KAYAK's numbers for last year are public record. You could
look at that and come up with your own forecast of what you think might be included.
<Q - Justin Post>: Hey, great. I appreciate that. And maybe one quick follow-up. Could KAYAK help the other
Priceline brands as you utilize it more? Or would that be kind of a small impact, you think?
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: It definitely can help to the degree that our brands are more effective in advertising on
KAYAK. That will generate bookings and gross profit for those brands and market share for those brands. So it
absolutely can help. And KAYAK is a big player here in the United States. And so for the U.S. business, the referrals
from KAYAK definitely matter. And hopefully, they'll be a very big business in Europe and globally, over time. And
that will matter, too. In the future, right now, it's relatively smaller in the international markets.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Susquehanna. Your question, please.
<Q - Brian T. Nowak>: Two. Just going back to KAYAK and how you think about growing it from here. Do you
think the KAYAK current offering is strong enough to compete and win back traffic? Or you think you need to add
more content to it, like the reviews or other content from Booking.com, really improve the visitor value proposition?
And then secondly, you talked a bit about non-European trends and the strong – the strengths in the global conversion
machine. I'm just wondering if you'd talk roughly about where you are in terms of conversion in the U.S. and the
emerging markets compared to your conversion rates, your more mature markets. And then is there anything you're
seeing so far that makes you think that Booking.com conversion in these new regions couldn't reach the same levels
that they are in Europe? Thanks.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: So with respect to KAYAK, I think their content today is excellent. And they – their business
continues to perform well in the United States and outside the United States. You can expect them to continue to
optimize, experiment, add content over time. But that'll be based on their view of the business as they develop it. And
it's certainly a benefit to KAYAK to have, potentially, access to the substantial content that our other brands have –
have to offer. But it remains to be seen how or if that – that would be applied.
With respect to conversion, I don't think – I wouldn't want to speculate as to what would happen to website conversion
over time in markets. There's no – we have experienced improving brand recognition and business results, as
Booking.com and Agoda have expanded their businesses organically. Same thing with rentalcars.com. So it would not
be unusual to enter into a new market with a relatively unknown brand and have to invest significantly in marketing to
build up the brand recognition to get you to a point where your efficiencies start to get to where you need them to be for
sustainable, steady-state business development. But I wouldn't go beyond that in terms of trying to predict what's going
to happen in the marketplace from here on in.

<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: So I guess following on some of the questions on marketing as well, Jeff. How are you guys
going to evolve, over time, your thinking about lifetime value of customers? I think that's the biggest question we get
from investors, as some of these platforms continue to evolve and move down the advertising funnel, how it'll impact
your decisions and your analytics around what they're delivering to you as to what – as opposed to what they're
delivering today. Thanks.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: No, I think the only color I could give you there is that we spend money in online channels to
build our brand and to bring in customers that we have chance of making loyal customers that will come back to us
directly. And not all platforms work alike, as you look at those – as you look that ultimate objective that we have in
bringing customers into the website.
So as a for instance, a white label relationship where nobody sees you brand has relatively less value than an integrated
relationship where people are seeing your brand on another website and then actually coming to your website and
experiencing your selection, your user interface and ultimately your customer service. So those factors are things that
we absolutely look at. I wouldn't say there has been a sea change in how we look at those factors. We evaluate each
advertising channel on its own merits, and that's been part of our discipline for a long time.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our final question for the hour comes from Aaron Kessler of Raymond James. Your line is open.
<Q - Aaron M. Kessler>: Great. Thanks, guys. A couple questions. I may have missed it, but did you give an ADR
forecast? And secondly, if you can talk a little bit maybe about in terms of KAYAK and – or – sorry – in terms of
Booking.com and maybe Priceline integrating inventory on the back end in the U.S. as well. Thank you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: The ADR forecast, Aaron was – global ADR is up about 1% for Q3.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: And Aaron, if you could clarify that second question for me...
<Q - Aaron M. Kessler>: Well I guess maybe in terms of how maybe Booking.com and Priceline'll work together in
terms of integrating supply in the U.S. for hotel supply, if they are.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: So today, Booking.com and Priceline have separate and distinct inventory, separate and
distinct contracting staffs, different people that approach the hotel. The Priceline.com, for years, has offered
Booking.com inventory as an option. That was done originally to accommodate travelers who were traveling from the
United States to Europe. And has grown to be a broader relationship where global inventories available to Priceline's
U.S. customers and Booking.com's inventory in the United States is available to Priceline customers as well, who may
want to book an agency property. And we're pleased with the way that integration has gone over the years, and we
think it's been helpful to both businesses. And we expect it to continue.
<Q - Aaron M. Kessler>: Yeah. And then finally, can you just maybe comment on the opportunity for KAYAK to
expand greater in Europe? It seems like it's still mainly a U.S.-centric site. But what's the opportunity to make it much
bigger internationally?
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: I think as we said when we made the acquisition, there's an opportunity to try to help KAYAK
build its business around the world more quickly, more aggressively than it was able to do so as a separate company.
We have resources and assets in terms of operating businesses in a lot of these markets where we can be helpful in
getting KAYAK up and running. And there's a lot of information that we can share on things that worked in markets
for our brands. And obviously, we can provide content for KAYAK's customers. So that's something where we think
we can be helpful. And we intend to work to hopefully create a successful global expansion for KAYAK.
