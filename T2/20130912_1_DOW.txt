EBITDA, EBITDA margins and earnings comparisons exclude certain items. The agenda for today's call is on Slide 3.
I will now hand the call over to Andrew.
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. If you look at Slide 4, 2012 was a challenging
year. However, Dow controlled the controllable, implementing strong and robust cost reduction in margin improvement
programs as well as reprioritization of growth projects and executed these tactical interventions with a focus of a world
seasoned team.
Let me provide some of the highlights from the fourth quarter and the full-year starting with the quarter. Here are the
headlines. Earnings per share excluding certain items was $0.33. Volumes stabilized as demand growth in Asia Pacific
and the Americas offset ongoing demand weakness in Western Europe. Our stringent price, volume margin focus
enabled us to deliver higher margins over raw material costs with only a slight decline in price year-over-year and an
increase sequentially led by our strong Performance Plastics franchise. Therefore our results were adjusted EBITDA of
$1.6 billion reflecting strong results in our Performance Plastics franchise with a 430 basis point increase in margins
due to robust U.S. Feedstock and Energy fundamentals. I'll have more to say on that in a moment. The Agricultural
Sciences achieved record sales levels and EBITDA in the fourth quarter. We saw significant decline in equity earnings
this quarter, particularly from Dow Corning and our ongoing headwinds in certain businesses particularly thermosets
where we are addressing structural disadvantages, we're also seeing in the quarter. However and importantly, we
continue to drive strong cash flow from operations, delivering $1.6 billion during the quarter and more than $4 billion
for the year as we had promised.
Turning to Slide 5, this brings us to our achievements for 2012. Dow delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.90.
There were two key drivers; on the downside price which declined a staggering $2.1 billion for the year with most of
the impact taking place from mid-year onwards. Note that currency accounted for nearly two-thirds of this decline, in
addition, as you know, the entire industry experienced significant naphtha based margin contraction in both Europe and
Asia, and our equity earnings were down significantly for the year largely exacerbated by industry challenges specific
to Dow Corning.
On the upside, our strengthening feedstock advantage in the Americas which includes Canada, Argentina and the
United States along with healthy market fundamentals in Agricultural Sciences partially offset these headwinds. In fact,
Dow Agricultural Sciences achieved record sales in EBITDA in the year of $6.4 billion and nearly $1 billion
respectively.
In addition, we reached significant milestones with critical enterprise growth projects, such as our investments in the
U.S. Gulf Coast and our Sadara joint venture in the Middle East. These projects are game changers to Dow's bottom
line more after Bill reviews the quarter.
And as stated, we clearly sustained a laser like focus on financial fitness reducing our debt by more than $600 million,
maintaining our liquidity position and achieving strong cash flow from operations. Between 2011 and 2012, we
generated $8 billion in cash flow from operations, in line with our previously stated targets. This focus on financial
flexibility enables us to deliver on our commitment to increasingly reward shareholders with a 34% increase in
dividends declared. As we enter 2013, I'm confident we have the right catalyst in place to deliver on our earnings
growth targets. I'll have more to say about this later in the call and about our plans moving forward.
But first, let me turn it over to Bill for more detail on our financial and operating results.
William H Weideman, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Andrew. Turning to Slide 7, Dow posted sales of $13.9 billion, a decrease of 1% versus the same quarter
last year. Dow reported a loss of $0.61 per share or earnings per share of $0.33 excluding certain items, which is up

32% versus the fourth quarter of 2011. We had several certain items in the quarter, we record charge of $0.57 per share
associated with restructuring plan that we announced in October.
In addition, we took a goodwill impairment of $0.19 per share in our Formulated Systems business, reflecting a weaker
outlook in wind energy. We recorded a charge of $0.07 per share related to the recent restructuring actions announced
at Dow Corning. We recorded a charge of $0.06 per share for Sadara related cost, and finally, we recorded a $0.05
charge related to early redemption of long-term debt.
Now, let me turn to volume trends on Slide 8. Overall, volume was flat as a decline in Western Europe offset volume
growth in both Asia Pacific and the Americas. In fact, we saw a 7% volume increase in North America excluding the
impact of our Feedstock and Energy operating segment which was down due to asset shutdowns in 2011 as well as the
expiration of sales contracts related to our polypropylene divestiture last year.
Now let me turn to price trends on Slide 9. Overall, prices declined $91 million, or 1% versus the fourth quarter of last
year. This modest decrease in price was more than offset by $413 million decrease in purchase Feedstock and Energy
cost. Our focus on pricing continues as we head into 2013 particularly given the recent increases in polypropylene
costs.
Turning to our operating performance; margins expanded as we largely held price in the midst of declining raw
material costs. This benefit was partially offset by a significant decline in equity earnings largely driven by lower Dow
Corning earnings due to unfavorable solar industry conditions and oversupply of polysilicon. In response, Dow
Corning announced restructuring plan this quarter to mitigate the rapidly deteriorating market conditions. The cost
savings associated with these actions will ramp as we move through this year. In current unfavorable conditions in the
polysilicon segment are expected to continue for Dow Corning's Hemlock Semiconductor subsidiary. These conditions
could worsen if trade rulings on the importation of solar grade polysilicon into China are negative. If conditions
worsen, Dow Corning will take further actions as appropriate. Now turning to our operating segment starting with
Electronic and Functional Materials on Slide 11. We saw modest revenue growth from Electronic Materials driven
primarily by our semiconductor technologies, where higher foundry utilization rates contribute to stronger demand
year-over-year.
In Functional Materials revenue increased across all geographic areas, as volume gains outpaced price declines. Dow
Wolff Cellulosics increased volume of strong growth of new product launches in the food sector. In Coatings and
Infrastructure Solutions, Dow Coating Materials grew revenue on improving demand conditions, however lower
pricing in epoxy hampered profitability. This segment also reflected Dow Corning's lower equity earning as previously
mentioned. Now turning to Slide 12, Agricultural Sciences reported record fourth quarter sales and EBITDA.
Sales of new crop protection products grew 11% for the quarter and 19% for the full-year. Seeds, traits and oils also
reported sales increases driven by continued strong growth in both North America and Latin America. Strong farmer
demand fueled gains for unique technologies such as SmartStax corn hybrids. Sales in Performance Materials declined
due to lower volume and prices across most geographic regions. Polyurethane sales were lower principally due to the
shutdown of our TDI capacity in Brazil and lower prices particularly in Asia drove sales declines in propylene oxide,
propylene glycol and chlorinated organics.
Sales in Performance Plastics were up compared with the same quarter last year driven by improved pricing in Europe
and Latin America and coupled with strong volume growth in North America. In Feedstocks and Energy the expiration
of contract sales related to the divestiture of our Dow's polypropylene business drove lower hydrocarbon sales. Higher
caustic soda prices were more than offset by lower vinyl chloride monomer sales driven by asset shutdown decisions in
2011.
Now turning to our cost reduction and cash flow measures.
As Andrew mentioned we have accelerated our cost reduction and cash flow measures. In 2013 reduced CapEx
spending will result in incremental cash savings of $500 million. Prior to growth investments and slower discretionary
spending will deliver savings of $200 million and restructuring plans we announced in 2012 will deliver incremental
savings up $300 million. Altogether we plan to deliver $1.75 billion in cost and cash savings on a run rate basis by the

end of 2014, and finally, we will continue to actively manage our portfolio. In fact, we are targeting to divest up to $1
billion of nonstrategic businesses over the next 12 to 24 months.
Now looking forward, you can use the following assumptions for modeling purposes. You can expect the savings from
our announced cost and cash flow measures will ramp as we move through this year. We expect Performance Plastics
margins will remain strong in the Americas due to our feedstock advantage.
Propylene costs are expected to increase $0.15 to $0.20 this quarter with some upside pressure. Dow Corning equity
earnings will remain depressed due to weakness in the polysilicon value chains specifically in the solar industry and
annual pension cost will increase $250 million to $300 million due to lower discount rates. You can expect a global tax
rate to be in the 28% to 30% range.
And now, I would like to turn it back over to Andrew.
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Bill. I would now like to address Dow's earnings growth trajectory and the full array of catalysts we have in
place to protect that growth path. Our commitment to grow our earnings on this strategy is unwavering and we have the
team to deliver this commitment. And during the year, we demonstrated this commitment by undertaking surgical
aggressive actions to accelerate near-term value growth.
Let me show you how. Turn to Slide 17. In this current slow growth world, we recognize that we must adopt a more
near-term pragmatic approach to funding projects that preserve growth and simultaneously improve the return on
capital all the while reducing risk. To be clear, while we selectively prune, we will remain fully committed to funding
efforts where Dow's differentiation is rewarded regardless of the weak macro environment and where near and
medium-term margin growth opportunities are clear and well within reach and expand our leadership in key franchises.
Let me highlight some of those businesses and projects that are and will continue to demonstrate a higher operating
return on capital, businesses where our technologies and products are winning where we expect growth to continue and
where we are investing accordingly.
Turn to Slide 18, our Electronics Materials portfolio is positioned in winning areas enabling faster processors, broader
displays and smaller internal components to match consumer trends.
Our Agricultural Sciences businesses is answering the call from farmers who are escalating demands for advanced
solutions to feed the growing population and seeking higher yields, and then of course, this is our Performance Plastics
portfolio, an industry leading franchise that is generating high returns today even in the midst of trough like conditions
in Asia and Europe.
In 2012 alone, our Performance Packaging business launched more than 40 new products showcasing its commitment
to innovation and rapid commercialization of new material solutions. When you couple the scale and location of our
assets, Performance Plastics is uniquely positioned to fully leverage the ethylene cycle and deliver high margin
attractive growth for years to come. In fact, we estimate this portfolio would deliver EBITDA margins above 30% and
EBITDA north of $5 billion in the upcoming peak.
If you turn to Slide 19, and on that note, I want to share our view of the ethylene cycle. As you know in 2012, the
industry grappled with inter-negative margins for naphtha-based ethylene producers in Europe and in Asia. The
dichotomy of course is the Americas, which have shown exceptional margins strength as wet shale gas dynamics are
fundamentally changing the game for integrated North American based producers like Dow. This is clearly evidenced
by operating rates in the United States and Canada being in the 90s, while Asia and Europe have been in the 70s.
We reaffirm our view that even given modest GDP growth in North and Latin America, operating rates and margins in
the Americas will rise in the near term. In fact, before the U.S. Gulf Coast capacity comes online in the back half of this
decade, the Americas may well become a net importer of ethylene derivatives leading to a step change in price
necessary to attract to those imports. Further, as global demand outstrips supply in the next few years and world GDP

gains further traction, we anticipate operating rates higher than 90%, leading to substantial margin expansion a double
peak, so to speak.
On Slide 20, Dow is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this change, for a start ethane fundamentals were very
strong on the U.S. Gulf Coast as we move to the second half of 2012 and beyond. And we have long highlighted the
naphtha to ethane arbitrage that provides tremendous margin expansion opportunities for ethane based producers like
Dow, but additionally, more recent industry dynamics further illuminate what differentiates Dow and that is the unique
advantage we gain from the powerful combination of current ethane as well as propane advantages on the U.S. Gulf
Coast and we are especially bullish on propane. In fact going forward, we see structurally propane creating a ceiling on
ethane pricing, and you can be sure Dow's feedstock flexibility will allow us to continue to pivot, so that we continue to
take advantage of our uniquely advantaged feedstock slate. And we are building on this advantage. Our actions in our
investments particularly those investments both here in the United States as well as in the Middle East are focused on
dramatically growing this advantage.
So if you turn to Slide 21, let me start with our U.S. Gulf Coast projects. Our St. Charles cracker restarted in December
hitting its end of 2012 milestone this new capacity cuts in half Dow's U.S. Gulf Coast ethylene purchases, this is a
major year-over-year positive for us. Our second ethane flexibility project in Louisiana, timed for 2015, also continues
to move forward and will serve to completely eliminate our in-region purchases. Just as critically, we are proactively
positioning ourselves to benefit from the aforementioned abundant propane supply and thereby mitigate exposure to
volatile propylene prices that affect our thermosets and coatings margins especially in the U.S. through our game
changing PDH project.
This project remains firmly on track and the investment is expected to add more than $450 million of EBITDA once
complete and is a key strategic step in improving margin performance and dampling volatility in all of our propylene
derivatives. And these investments are not simply geared for margin improvements. They also enable medium-term
growth in the Americas as market conditions improve and industry operating rates rise as evidenced by our plans to
build a low-cost world-scale cracker in Freeport.
As we have often stated, this investment will remain true to our strategy to deliver advantaged feedstocks and volume
that matches the growth needs of our differentiated downstream derivatives. And as we've shared previously, we will
have partners for non-core ethylene derivatives for this project to achieve economies of scale. In fact, we're in the final
stages of structuring a significant strategic ethylene offtake agreement, one that is a win-win both for us as well as the
offtaker. We will announce this deal which will help with the capital cost of the new cracker very, very shortly.
In total, we expect our U.S. Gulf Coast investments and favorable wet shale gas dynamics to deliver $2 billion in
additional EBITDA by 2017. Of course, these projects bring low-cost feedstocks for the Americas and our huge
investment in Saudi Arabia named Sadara does the same for all of the key growth regions in the world.
Turning to Slide 22, this joint venture with Saudi Aramco is very well positioned to serve Asia, Central and Eastern
Europe and of course, the Middle East and Africa capturing customer demand and stimulating high margin growth for
decades to come. I've visited the last site last month and I saw first-hand the significant progress our teams have made.
We have achieved several key project milestones. Front-end engineering and design work is complete. Product
marketing agreements have been signed and project financing remains well on track. We are on budget and on schedule
and by next year, the construction work force will peak and around 60,000 people all driving toward our target to bring
initial phase online in 2015.
Taken on the whole, these are high return projects and will significantly strengthen Dow's near-term and mid-term
profitability. I mentioned earlier that we are managing our businesses with a laser-like focus on return on capital,
rigorously testing our portfolio to identify which businesses to grow, run for cash, fix or sell.
Let me turn to two segments where we are taking focused actions to address underperformance. Turn to Slide 24, I
mentioned earlier our PDH investment which will enable Dow to benefit from abundant propane supply. Importantly,
this investment will bring less volatility and capture the benefit of what we believe is a sustainable structural change,
decoupling propane from propylene.

If you turn to Slide 25, our Performance Materials and Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions segments consume
essentially all of Dow's propylene requirements and securing long term low cost feedstocks is a critical action to
improve the profitability of these segments. In fact, we anticipate that the propylene from our on-purpose propylene
investment will enable us to drive margin expansion on the order of 300 basis points in Performance Materials and 150
basis points in Coatings and Infrastructure Solutions.
But this remedy we understand is medium term. And we have and will continue to take action in the near term. Actions
we have announced recently are squarely focused on improving the performance of these two segments today. By
shutting down high cost assets, strictly managing working capital, cancelling growth projects with backend loaded
MPVs and aggressively increasing price.
In addition as Bill has stated in December we announced plans to divest $1 billion of non-core assets over the next 24
months. We are already moving forward on this target evidenced by today's divestment of the stabilizers component of
our plastics additives business. As well as the announcement made just last night regarding our plans to sell our 50%
ownership in Nippon Unicar Company and joint venture in our electrical and telecommunications business. As you
think about our $1 billion divestment target moving forward expect to see the action squarely on driving improved
ROC.
Let me turn to Slide 26 and before I move to our outlook and priorities I want to cover one additional and critical topic.
Dow's commitment to strong cash flow and our focus clear priorities for uses of this cash. As you know we have three
and only three priorities for how we deploy cash; number one, paying down debt; two, rewarding shareholders. Our
34% increase year-over-year in dividends declares and illustrates our Board's confidence in our ability to deliver higher
sustainable earnings growth over the long-term; and three, investing prudently in organic growth opportunities.
Of course, the K-Dow arbitration awards will also serve to accelerate our priorities for uses of cash.
As you know, the $2.16 billion partial award announced last summer did not include interest and cost owed to Dow.
Those significant costs will be assessed in the final award. We are now simply awaiting the release of the final award to
the parties, which we expect to receive in February. This is an important last step in the arbitration. We have every
expectation that the two awards together will total nearly $2.5 billion. As a reminder, we also have every confidence
that interest will continue to accrue on the awards every day until payment is received. And critically, this cash
injection will go directly to our balance sheet, of this you can be assured.
As we've stated and taken on the whole Dow enters 2013 squarely focused on driving earnings growth, increasing cash
flow and rewarding shareholders. If you turn to Slide 28, our current business plans do not call for any macroeconomic
tailwinds in 2013 as we believe ongoing uncertainty in the global economy will continue to present challenges in what
we expect will be a slow growth environment. I'll repeat, of 2012 is what we are in fact planning for. We expect global
GDP will be near to 2.5% than the 2.0% and we do see decent improvement in the United States due to improving
fundamentals in key sectors such as housing, automotive and of course oil and gas. The outlook in China is also
growing brighter, exports of United States and elsewhere are regaining steam, the output of significant local stimulation
efforts have taken hold and the government is closely managing inflation particularly of the (property) speculation
variety. China should see solid 7% growth this year and other emerging regions in general will continue their growth,
albeit at slower rates than history.
The question is, how will these positives be counterbalanced by continuing challenging conditions in Europe? We see
Europe as continually challenged certainly throughout 2013, and while the sum of all these uncertainties makes it tough
to read the year right now, Dow will continue to focus on its own course and benefit from the structural cost reductions
implemented in 2012, as well as our continued strong North American feedstock advantaged and the favorable
dynamics driving our Agricultural Sciences business.
Therefore, as we enter and navigate 2013, you could expect us to take actions on every front to deliver on our earnings
growth trajectory by we turn to our priorities fully deploying the $2.5 billion of actions to reduce our cost structure and
generate more cash, the result of which are beginning to take hold. And by aggressively moving forward with our key
growth catalysts, which are leveraging our feedstock advantage as the ethylene cycle unfolds, aggressively

commercializing our near term technology pipeline and driving key investments for long term profitability in the U.S.
Gulf Coast and the Middle East.
All of these differentiate Dow, I will continue to propel our strategy to deliver higher earnings growth and increasingly
reward our shareholders. The Dow team understands its priorities which are clear and we know what needs to be done.
We are fully accountable for proactively and aggressively implementing the tough decisions required to achieve our
short, medium and long term targets and continue to accelerate value growth for our shareholders.
With that Doug let's go to Q&A.
Douglas May, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Thank you Andrew. Now we'll move to your questions. First however I'd like to remind you that my comments
regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply both to the prepared remarks and the
following Q&A. Lisa would you mind going through and explain the Q&A procedure.
Questions And Answers
Operator
Yes. Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
William H Weideman, Chief Financial Officer
Good morning, John.
John McNulty, Analyst
Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. So just first one with regard to the plastics business, you had
some downtime last year you have like Charles up now. How should we be thinking about potential downtime for this
year and what all of this kind of added in means for volume growth in terms of what you are expecting this quarter, or
excuse me this year?
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, John, it's obviously very -- this is Andrew. It is very hard to forecast unplanned and we just had an unplanned
in Texas our team did a great job of bringing that back up very quickly. But in terms of planned, Bill will give you a
specific sense of it, but look, nothing like last year, I mean, to answer your question and that was an unfortunately
timed downtime as you know, so we lost a lot of the run-up in the low-cost feedstock side out of Canada in particular.
But we believe our Performance Plastics business is on its march up. We believe that the margin expansions based on
our steady-state model here shows operating rates going up. We believe that we are advantaged specially in the growth
regions with our Kuwait venture as well as our Argentina business, and of course the U.S. and Canada. So, I actually
think that the business is doing incredibly well. They've got price increases out there. They've got good operating rates
and with exception of unplanned, I think you can expect year-on-year growth.

Great. Thank you very much.
William H Weideman, Chief Financial Officer
Just to add to that, John, we're assuming just a typical turnaround season this year and so even in our turnaround
spending actually for 2013 will be very much in line with 2012.
John McNulty, Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. And then, just one follow-up question. In Electronics, we've seen the pricing continue to kind of
drag down over the last few quarters and I guess if you can give us some color as to what's really driving that and if
there's competitive issues or its commoditization type issues or if it's just weak demand? Like maybe you can shed a
little light on that.
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Definitely weak demand, John, nothing embedded in the business. In fact, the business has got increasing investments
and positive exposure to the growth side of the business which are; tablets, smartphones, OLED, solid-state drives, but
the slowdown in PC instead of phones and end of year all the people you've seen out there, whether it be Apple or
anyone else, Samsung there's been some slowness in the consumer this last quarter and they are expected to continue

Andrew, I was wondering if I could ask maybe a broader question around your Performance Materials business and
propylene derivatives businesses. It seems like it's been quite some time since they performed up to PAR, and I'm
wondering if you can assess is this a Dow Specific issue, or is there something structurally about those end markets and
businesses that just make it a tough slog or how do you compare when you benchmark? And if it weren't for just
getting some low cost propylene production, is there a path to enrichment in other ways here?
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well the fix -- Dow specific, I don't believe so. If you look at the two key parts of performance materials that are
underperforming and have for some time to respond to you point, epoxy and then the whole polyurethane chain
including isocyanides.
The fixes are in place with the propylene back integration and the isocyanides investments in Saudi Arabia. So, low
cost competitive building blocks, propylene oxide, MDI, TDI, epichlorohydrin all those are in place for the two-year
route point. In the short term, what's been going on in the last couple of years in particular, Bob, is the propane
volatility without half of our exposure being on the purchase side of this thing. The propylene volatility mimics the old
price naphtha volatility and frankly the disconnect between the arbitrage of Asia where the markets are growing and
North America where the market hadn't been growing the way our assets are has particularly hurt polyurethanes.
On epoxy, the Chinese just over built that plus the Taiwanese and the Koreans and its' over supplied, and frankly, we
took down the asset in Japan just recently. You was us take down the TDI asset down in South America. Slide 25 really
speaks to the fact that in the very near term in Performance Materials in particular, we have to intervene on high cost
assets in low growth jurisdictions.
Now, one in Japan is clear one, the one in South America less clear, because Latin America is growing. So how do we
actually bridge over to the low cost jurisdictions in developed markets and developing markets as the investment in
Saudi Arabia and the investment in the U.S. Gulf Coast that actually bridges this over.
In the meantime, you can expect price action and price action will result in lost volume and lost volume may result in
some more assets coming down. We are going to put a laser like focus because we are unsatisfied, dissatisfied with the
last two years of performance and it is creating headwinds that speak against the positive side of the Dow portfolio.
That's the ROC focus. We are determined to fix those two businesses and do it in the short order.
Robert Koort, Analyst
Can you help us just size the reduced propylene sales to Braskem, is this meaningful for you from an earnings
standpoint?
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning Hasan.
Hasan Amir, Analyst
Wanted to chat a bit about the raw material side of things. I mean obviously one of the things that you've talked about
is taking advantage of the low cost natural gas price regime here ethane in particular. One of the trends that seems to
have popped up recently via a large sort of North American methanol producer is that they've structured a long term
natural gas price contract. Are you looking into such things as well?
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, so Hasan thank you for your question. We've have long said that given our large ethane buy in the United States
and Canada we are the largest in North America as well as one of the two largest in the United States that we have
several weapons in our arsenal to deal with the synthetic buy, the equity deals like the one announced by the methanol
guy, that you talked about, or in fact just base contracts, and we predicted that ethane would go long and it went longer
much faster than even we predicted. As one of my slides in the presentation talked about, we believe ethane will go
even longer and as a consequence of that we can afford to be patient and structure the right deals.
The key for us is we are unusual and that we have full access. We have pipelines now to all the key basins short of the
Conway where everything else; Marcellus, all the ones down in Texas, the Eagle Ford, et cetera, we have full access.
And every supplier wants to do a deal with us and we can their anchor volume, but we've been prudent in not anchoring
too much of that volume in search of the better long-term deal and getting it struck at the right time. So, yeah, that sort
of deal to answer your question is not off the table, but we're not going to strike too early until we are ready.
Hasan Amir, Analyst
Fair enough, thanks so much. A follow-up if I may, on the chlor-alkali side of things, obviously, it seems that in Q4 the
numbers were quite good, but there's obviously some capacity coming online fairly soon. So what's your feel of the
chlor-alkali market at least in the near-term?
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think cost is steady. You saw the aluminum producers mentioning a 7% growth rate in 2013, that's as the macro
start to recover in aerospace, et cetera, so price increases should start to take hold. The weakness there in obviously the
other side and PVC market is softer since 2006, but there's increasing optimism reflective of the housing rebound in the
United States. So, you could start to see and ECU cycle like we've had in the past where both sides show good strength.
We're bringing on the Mitsui joint venture this year.
That's a low cost asset. We're taking down old assets, so net-net it's the same, but it's a low cost position. Mitsui is very
excited about the U.S. Gulf Coast position. They believe they can sell out their 50% share to market if you see
worldwide. That's a very big statement on the low cost position, and we believe even for our chlorine it will go all
through our downstreams and start answer to Bob Koort's earlier question about giving cost advantage chlorine to
epichlorohydrin and now propylene oxide down there which will start helping the profitability of epoxy and urethanes.

Kevin McCarthy, Analyst
Yes. Good morning. Andrew, want to ask about propylene. You've taken a lot of actions in recent years to address the
position there. Can you update us on what your current long-short position is in propylene monomer and given the
surge of $0.15 per pound in the U.S. in January, do you think you can get enough price through in the Coatings and
Performance Materials segment to kind of manage the margins there and restore them through 2013?
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Let me get Bill into the mix here. Bill, why don't you take the question.
William H Weideman, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. The second, maybe I'll have Andrew to touch on the first and the second part of it in terms of the propylene
increase. Right, as you know propylene has gone up about $0.15 in January and projected to go up another $0.05 in
February. Just for an order of magnitude, that will increase our propylene cost about, between $200 million and $250
million this quarter. That's given us a lot of momentum on prices. And so we are aggressively moving price, but we're
obviously still early in the quarter to see if we can cover all of that.
As you know, our performances businesses is a little bit of a lag, but we do have a lot of pricing momentum and we're
moving price. So, to bid early the call exactly how much of that we'll cover this quarter, but again, this gives us upward
momentum on prices.
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
So one of the points you were making there is about can we actually get ahead of the propylene griller as it goes
through its volatility and what really hurts sometimes, one of the other questions in the Performance Materials point as
well as Coatings, is that lead lag when propylene's moving quarter-to-quarter very hard to get price increases out there
neither the paint companies nor anyone downstream in industrial coatings area and the epoxy chain.
We'll take the price increase based on propylene going up if propylene then goes down within three months. So that
really is what is really hurting our ability to get not just inventory management, but even propylene driven price
increases that stick. What helps all of that is improving demand and improving demand is what we'll see definitely in
the coatings chain. I have seen the paints companies the ones who have announced already they are seeing good
demand. They have also started to talk about price increases in their part of the mix, their part of the chain.
Remember, we are not PPG we are not a pain company, we are not Sherwin-Williams. Sometimes there is bad
comparison done between our results and their results, we are suppliers to them. We need them to be healthy and
growing so that it get price increases, so we can get price increases. At the moment we feel positive about that
architectural in particular. Epoxy will continue to be oversupplied and frankly there needs to be capacity taken out and
we believe that we've done some of it and others will do it as well.

Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna International.
William H Weideman, Chief Financial Officer
Hi Don.
Don Carson, Analyst
Good morning.
William H Weideman, Chief Financial Officer
Good morning Don.
Don Carson, Analyst
One is just the impact of Dow Corning this year as I look at Coatings and Infrastructure and adjust for your write-offs,
it looks like you got over $180 million of equity income there. What's your outlook for this year, how bad are things
going to be at Dow Corning?
William H Weideman, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, let me answer that. So, just to give you a little bit clarity on the change of 2012 versus 2011, our share of Dow
Corning's equity earnings in 2011 was approximately $400 million and our share of Dow Corning's equity earnings in
2012, excluding certain items was $179 million. So, our share of Dow Corning equity earnings declined $224 million,
so little over 50% between 2011 and 2012 due to, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, due to oversupply of
polysilicon and then also weakening the solar market. So we have seen a substantial decline there.
Now, as I mentioned in my prepared comments Dow Corning has taken focused actions and they announced two
restricting programs in the fourth quarter and so they are very focused on hitting us head-on and maintaining their
profitability. For the full year 2013 versus 2012, with these interventions and if we don't see any further decline in the
market we believe for the full year '13 versus '12 their equity earnings will be similar in '13 versus '12 with maybe a
little bit of downward pressure. So I think hopefully that answers your question.
Don Carson, Analyst
Okay. And then Andrew, just a follow-up, just wanted to clarify your Chlor-Alkali remarks. So, as Freeport starts up in
mid-year you'll be taking down some of your older assets like Plaquemine. Will those be shut down permanently or do
you still need some chlorine out of those to meet your potential growth needs in chlorine derivatives?

Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Peter.
Peter Butler, Analyst
Andrew, it's nice to hear once again that we're not going to be allocating cash to M&A, that's music to shareholders
ears. Could I ask, could you give some guidance on the other cash flow numbers, you gave the CapEx, but what are you
looking for in other items sources and uses of funds this year and next?
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Peter thanks. I'll let Bill take that.
William H Weideman, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Peter, so from an overall standpoint, we've already mentioned, so you mentioned the CapEx will be coming
down. We've also got also a very much of a focus on working capital. And so, we will be driving working capital
down. If you think about our overall cash from operations, as you know this year, we -- our cash from operations was
$4.1 billion. That was up from the prior year of 3.9, despite the fact that we had lower earnings.
So going forward in 2013, you should expect our cash from operations to be north of $4 billion due to the interventions
that we're taking. So, and that's going to come from our working capital focus, our lower CapEx spending, our gross
spending is, as I mentioned in my comments, is coming down a $100 million and then also discretionary spending of
$200 million. So, we feel very confident with generating strong cash flow in 2013 and that will give us the ability to
continue to pay down debt, fund pension and always reward shareholders.
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Pete, I just want to ride the back of a couple things said in the script, but they are very important to the way you asked
the question. So, not only no M&A, but also deployment of cash to the balance sheet. So I have mentioned the Kuwait
funds to the balance sheet, a very important statement.
Second, Bill talked about divestment of $1 billion. We're accelerating those and to Bob Koort's earlier question, you
can expect to see more action in the Performance Materials portfolio as we go drive further and increase price and look
at the unutilized assets and businesses that are not performing, strong ROC focus, but our cash-driven ROC focus, we
understand that we have a huge upside on the Performance Plastics business and our Ag business.

So, lots of cash being generated there. We can really prune R&D spending away from the medium to long-term and
home in on those underperforming businesses and home in and fine tune the portfolio. So, I expect deployment of cash
to balance sheet and reward shareholder. That's our single biggest priority this year.
Peter Butler, Analyst
Sounds good. Could I ask on the ag chemicals Andrew, how are the early orders looking and what sort of growth does
that support?
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well right now that business, as you know, almost hit $1 billion of EBITDA last year and had a frankly record year
--record year in sales and record year in profit and the order book is looking very strong for farm solutions this year
being launched, one of the highest in the industry. We will do about 30% of the year's business in Q1 based on the
order book, right now, so even Crop Protection in advance of spring plantings in North America looks strong. Latin
America was strong, Q4 looks strong, Q1 and so I would tell you that we are very, very bullish on our growth engine in
our ag chemicals and ag seed, traits and oils.
Seed, traits and oils is now $1 billion business and actually starting to begin to turn the corner on profitability. It has
reached critical mass, very excited about that. Thanks Peter.

expect David and it's foolhardy to forecast. But we're going to benefit from this 20 something number for few years to
come. If it goes into the 30s, it will be due to aberrations, but we've always said, and back to Hasan's question, this is
going to be a long ethane market for at least four or five years back half of the decade will go short again as all the
capacity comes online and then at the tail end of the decade it will go long again.
Frankly, wet gas in the United States, wet shale gas is a game changer in terms of competitiveness of U.S. based
producers. Dow has $25 billion of its asset base in the United States that will benefit from not just the ethane side but
the propane side. And the propane side puts a ceiling on the ethane sidem, because there's no real good use of the
propane other than sending it overseas, which some of it will occur, but also propane dehydro and our propane dehydro
will be a game changer to fix our propylene derivatives, two big powerful positives of that one dynamic.
David Begleiter, Analyst
Just lastly, Andrew, I know in the past propylene has spiked here, it has hurt Europe, propylene derivative exports to
Asia. Has that occurring right now again?
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
A little bit, but what we've done is deliberate decisions. Our business has decided, that's why their numbers in Asia
were not so good in the fourth quarter. They have decided to keep it home because the returns are higher at home and
then on top of that they are raising prices because of the propylene point that was made earlier, plus more decent
market dynamics. As we turn the corner, Q4 to Q1, Coatings and polyurethanes have seen better U.S. market dynamics,
so price increases in those two businesses is the fix that was asked about earlier and sustained propylene at these levels
doesn't bother us if it stays somewhat predictable and that's of course one of the issues that I dealt with earlier.
But we are more confident on the macros than our--if you like our macro planning suggests based on the evidence we
see today especially in the U.S. and served markets and especially in China Which I mentioned on TV this morning.

Hi good morning. Can you tell me your expected pension funding for fiscal--for 2013 and your cash restructuring

William H Weideman, Chief Financial Officer
Sure Jeff, this is Bill. So for our cash outflows and for our restructuring consistent what we communicated when we
found our 8-K in the fourth quarter is about $430 million is the future cash flows associated with that. On the pension
funding, I mean as you know with the pension relief act, our required contributions on the pension fund go down over
the next couple of years, about an average of about $350 million to $375 million. But for planting purposes, you should
assume that we'll continue to fund the pension plan in 2013 at the same level we did in 2012 which is roughly $900

Okay. And then secondly on Slide 19, you have domestic and global ethylene operating rates, and for 2012, I think the
chart shows an 88% global industry operating rate with the U.S. being at 89%, but I think in your commentary, you
also said that you though Asia and Europe were in the 70s, so I was wondering if you can reconcile how the global rate
can be so high in 2012 given the low rates in Asia and Europe?
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so the comments in the talk--thank you Jeff, the fourth quarter was in the 70s, not the whole year. That's a short
answer to your question. So, the average is what you see there on that slide. Fourth quarter, the pitch point was very
high and then it started to recover as the pitch point expanded, sorry, declined and that was due to price increase in
Europe, local price increases.

P.J. Juvekar, Analyst
Yeah. Hi.
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar, Analyst
So, Andrew, your balance sheet remains leveraged, your net debt was up in 2012 and you announced this $1 billion of
divestiture, but it seems small relative to your size. So my question is, why not monetize some of the joint ventures that
are underperforming or even equate to clean up the balance sheet and pay off those preferreds?
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, of course, you are looking at the debt to total capture and the pension adjustment to the restructuring where you
remember our historic range P.J., is 35% to 45%. So, even with that massive pension headwind, now that was a $2.2
billion swing in pension funded status, and other companies have got it and so we're not alone, but clearly those are big
numbers for us.
And to speak to your leverage, we've reduced debt by $600 million in last year. I think I was very clear on one of the
other questions and even on my prepared marks. We are driven to take that number down, not because of the range
being absolutely anymore 35% to 45%, but we think in this volatile macro world that we saw in full color in the second
half of this year, it's better to be closer to the 35% than to 45%.
So we will continue to deploy excess cash to debt pay down, and of course, retirement of the preferreds. We are
obviously very keen to get the preferreds off the balance sheet, but clearly they have to be priced, that price eventually

has to make sense and we will work on that. Your point on more divestments inclusive of what may or may not happen
in key joint ventures is definitely everything's on the table P.J., to make sure we stay on our earnings trajectory.
Everything is on the table. We will portfolio manage inclusive of more divestments so that we always put in place the
best on our mindset of our businesses and continue to march on the earnings trajectory to $10 billion. So, I would say,
anyway to answer your question, yes.

Good. Thank you. We're going to have one follow-up, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar, Analyst
Yeah. So I have just a quick question your commodity footprint in Europe and what can you do there particularly with
your cracker in Tarragona, Spain? Thank you.
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Tarragona is as you quite right point the only full-fledged naphtha cracker that doesn't have flexibility. Our
business is working or making that more competitive and decreasing the commodity footprint. I think no question that
Europe, as I already indicated in my remarks, needs more rationalization, more margin improvement, more
restructuring as time goes by, but we'll manage that within our portfolio of management process. So we don't have any
big shoes to drop there PJ, we know what we have to do including the point you made on Tarragona.
Douglas May, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Thank you. Andrew would you like to maybe close with a few comments.
Andrew N. Liveris, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think PJ's questions were right on what I was going to say at the end, which is look I think we are seeing a
different type of market as the year ended. I think our portfolio and the cost restructuring that we put in place. We can
count on those in 2013 as extra EBITDA. Dow's known for its operational excellence and its execution. We will
intervene as if the market isn't going to recover. But if the market does recover we have tailwinds that will help us a lot
and we are seeing some of those as we turn to the corner on the year, especially in United States and especially in Asia
and the emerging world.
In fact our price increases and our volume increases in some key businesses like the ones in Performance Materials and
Performance Plastics are an actual margin enhancer as we go into the year.
We lost $2 billion in price off the top line in the second half of last year and we have the Dow Corning weakness.
Those are two big weights on the earnings last year that we've acted to fix and we are going to benefit from the cycle
upswing and investments in feedstocks especially here in the United States and Saudi Arabia. So I believe that the
company is very focused on execution and will deliver against its earnings targets. Thank you Doug.
Douglas May, Vice President, Investor Relations.
