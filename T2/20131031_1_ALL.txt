MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Allstate third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. At this time,
all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will be
given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to
turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Steve Shebik, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin.
Steven E. Shebik
Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for Allstate's third quarter 2013 earnings
conference call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson and me, we'll have a question and answer session. Last night,
we issued our press release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for third quarter 2013, and posted a slide
presentation to be used in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These are all available on our website.
This presentation may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ
materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2012, our 10-Q for the third quarter, and our most
recent press release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, to
which there are reconciliations in our press release and on our website.
We're recording this call, and a replay will be available following the conclusion of the call. We'll be available to
answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. Now I'll turn it over to Tom.

Well, good morning, and thanks for investing your time with us. I'll start by covering the third quarter results as they
relate to our strategy and then our 2013 priorities. Bob Block is not with us today, as he's attending to a health issue. So
Steve will cover both the business performance and capital sections of the presentation. Also with us here today are
Matt Winter, who of course leads Allstate Personal line; Don Civgin, who is responsible for Allstate Financial and
Esurance; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; Don Bailey, who leads the Emerging Businesses; and then Sam
Pilch, our Corporate Controller.
If you look at the quarter in total, we generated very strong results, and it really reflects the broad and comprehensive
approach we've taken to creating shareholder value. Operating income was strong, and we made progress on all of our
2013 operating priorities. Growth improved, and we made progress on balancing risk and return and deploying capital
to enhance returns.
Starting with slide 2, it summarizes our third quarter results. Revenues increased to $8.5 billion, which is up 4.1%. That
reflects a 5.3% growth in net written premium, with contributions from all of the customer segments and businesses.
Net income of $310 million declined from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the $475 million after-tax loss from
the pending sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Operating income of $713 million was essentially equal to the – last year's
third quarter, while operating income per diluted share increased as a result of our share repurchase program. Book
value per common share increased both with and without fixed income unrealized gains and losses.
On slide 3, we show the four distinct customer segments that drive our competitively differentiated approach to the
market and our results in each. The three brands where we underwrite risk – that's Allstate, Encompass, and Esurance –
all grew net written premium. Answer Financial also increased its nonproprietary premium.
For the Allstate brand, which serves customers who prefer local advice, assistance, and a branded experience, policies
declined by 0.4% from the prior-year quarter, as growth in standard auto was offset by continued reductions in
homeowner policies. Allstate brand's standard auto policies increased 1.1% versus a year ago and 0.6% versus last
quarter, reflecting continued improved retention and strong new business growth. We've made substantial progress in
improving returns in homeowners, and as a result the decline in homeowners policies has lessened. Total homeowner
policies declined by 3.2% from a year ago and 0.3% versus last quarter. We're beginning to take steps to position this
line so it become a competitive advantage for us as opposed to a drag on overall growth. Actions taken to position
high-performing agencies for success, including more effect compensation programs, is also working, and agencies are
expanding. The profitability improvement in this segment was a combined ratio of 86.4 and an underlying combined
ratio of 85.4.
The Esurance brand, which is in the lower right, serves the self-directed, brand-sensitive customer and continues to
generate significant premium and unit growth as it successfully leverages the benefits of being part of Allstate.
Increased advertising that's more effective, better pricing for preferred risk auto customers, and improved claim
practices are designed to acquire and retain profitable, lifetime valued customers. The combined ratio remained high at
116.8, in part reflecting the high levels of marketing spend, the expensing of acquisition intangibles, and the impact of
higher loss ratios from new business. The Esurance team is working to adjust pricing and underwriting to ensure that
this growth will generate long-term profitability. These actions caused growth to decelerate in the third quarter if you
look from month to month, and we expect growth to decline somewhat in 2014.
The Encompass brand, which is in the upper left, serves consumers who want local advice but a choice of products and
services and continued to show positive growth, with policies up 7.2% compared to the prior-year quarter.
Strategically, we remain focused on household penetration with our unique packaged product that represents about 75%
of Encompass' volume. The combined ratio in the quarter was 93.6, an improvement of 6 points from the prior-year
quarter, with an underlying combined ratio of 92.5. The improvement in the combined ratio reflects favorable reserve
re-estimate.
On slide 4, we show a progress report on our five 2013 operating priorities. I've already covered the 'Grow insurance
premiums' priority for property-liability, and that's the first five sub-bullets there. Allstate Financial's premiums and
contract charges also increased by 3.7% over the third quarter of 2012. The growth in premiums and contract charges
for underwritten products was 4.4%, with Allstate Benefits growing approximately 10% compared to the prior-year

quarter.
Our second priority is to maintain auto profitability. The Allstate brand had a standard auto combined ratio of 94.9,
which was 3 points higher than last year's third quarter due to lower favorable reserve re-estimates. When you look at
the underlying combined ratio, it was 94.6, which is 0.9 points higher than the prior-year quarter. That increase reflects
a modest increase in frequency and severity and a higher expense ratio, which is offset in part by higher average
premiums. Esurance and Encompass had combined ratio improvement in the quarter where compared to the prior-year
quarter, but more work is required to improve returns in these two brands.
Our third priority is to focus on returns in homeowners and annuities. We continue to make progress on raising returns
in homeowners, with an Allstate brand homeowners combined ratio of 65.3, with an underlying combined ratio of 61.8,
which was 4.4 points better than the prior-year quarter. With the underlying combined ratios tracking towards the low
60s for the last several quarters, we believe we are now positioned to focus on building a sustainable competitive
advantage in homeowners. Annuity returns improved in the quarter, but the long-term outlook is still challenged by low
interest rates. Given our favorable, strong underlying results for the quarter, it's reasonable to ask if we'll end the year
below our 2013 annual outlook of 88 to 90. We believe that annual outlooks are the appropriate way to manage
expectations of profitability, so we'll be not providing a change to the range for just the fourth quarter. We will
announce an outlook range for 2014 when we report the full results for this year.
Our fourth goal is to proactively manage investment. Net income investment benefited from higher income on
investments in limited partnerships in the quarter. We continue to position the property-liability portfolio with a shorter
duration to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates, and Steve will take you through some graphs that make that very
clear. While this action generates current capital gains and lowers our risk profile, it obviously reduces the portfolio
yield and future operating income. Total return for the quarter was 1% on modestly higher net investment income and
really minimal changes in the overall valuation of the portfolio.
The fifth priority is to reduce our cost structure so we can give customers greater value with a differentiated offering.
During the quarter, we reduced the cost structure through simplification and process improvement initiatives. We also
restructured our employee and retiree benefit programs to make benefits more consistent amongst employees and adjust
to current market practices. Our property-liability expense ratio increased in the third quarter compared to the same
period last year but has sequentially improved since the first quarter this year. Investments are being made in
technology and to expand Esurance's geographic and product footprint.
Now, let me turn it back to Steve.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, Tom. On slide 5, we provide financial highlights for property-liability and Allstate Financial. Property-liability
had earned premium of $7.0 billion, which grew 4.1% from the third quarter of 2012, with a combined ratio of 90.0.
The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86.9, 0.9 points better than Q3 2012, and the year-to-date underlying
combined ratio was 87.2, better than our full-year outlook range. Catastrophe losses were $128 million, $78 million
below the third quarter of 2012, and the lowest third quarter losses since 2002. As a result, net income was $656
million in the third quarter, 2.7% higher than the prior-year quarter.
The combined ratios on a recorded and underlying basis for each brand are shown on the right side of the exhibit. The
Allstate brand continues to generate solid profitability, as the positive effects of rate changes and low catastrophe losses
more than offset the modest increases in loss cost. The Encompass recorded combined ratio for the quarter improved
from the prior-year quarter, reflecting favorable reserve re-estimates. The Esurance combined ratio of 116.8 improved
1.7 points from the prior-year quarter. However, it remains elevated, as Tom noted.
Allstate Financial, on the bottom left, had a 3.7% increase in premiums and contract charges in the quarter compared to
the third quarter of last year, helped by underwritten products increasing 4.4%, including an approximately 10%
increase for Allstate Benefits. The benefit spread declined in the quarter due to an increase in reserves related to our

annual review of reserve assumptions, partially offset by improved mortality in life insurance. The investment spread
decline reflects a $169 million pre-tax gain in the prior year associated with updating input used in the valuation of
certain embedded derivatives. Operating income, which excludes this gain, improved 30.9% from the prior-year quarter
due to lower credit interest on spread-based liabilities and improved mortality in life insurance, partially offset by a
higher charge associated with our annual comprehensive review of DAC and reserve assumptions. The net loss was
$360 million in the quarter due to the loss on the pending disposition of Lincoln Benefit Life.
On slide 6, we provide net written premium and policies-in-force trends by brand and in total. For total
property-liability, in the upper left, net written premium increased 5.3% from the third quarter of 2012, and overall
policies grew 0.8%. Our strategy to provide unique products and services to distinct consumer segments is working, as
both net written premium and policies grew for each brand compared to last quarter. Moving to the upper-right chart,
total Allstate brand grew, as standard auto net written premium increased 3.3% from prior year, while policies
increased 1.1% compared to the third quarter of 2012 and 0.6% compared to last quarter. Allstate brand homeowners
net written premium grew 5.5%, while unit volume declined at a slower rate than last quarter. The results for both of
these lines reflect favorable trends in retention and new business. On the bottom two charts, you can see the growth
trends for Encompass and Esurance. Both continued to grow compared to the prior-year quarter in both written
premium and policies. While growth trends have improved, we've maintained overall margins.
On slide 7, the charts on the left side of the slide show the earned premium and loss-per-policy trends, while the charts
on the right-hand side show the combined-ratio trends. For standard auto, losses per policy increased at a rate just
slightly higher than the earned premium per policy. As you can see in the upper left, where the blue line is above the
red line. Essentially, moderate increases in frequencies and severities were offset by rate increases. The combined ratio
for standard auto remained consistently profitable, as shown in the upper-right chart, where the red bar is generally
around a 95 combined ratio. For Allstate brand homeowners, shown on the bottom half of the slide, loss cost per policy
decreased, while earned premium per policy increased, with the blue line substantially below the red premium line.
This resulted in an improvement in underlying combined ratio of 4.4 points to 61.8. The recorded combined ratio for
the quarter was 65.3, a 7.6-point improvement from the prior-year quarter, reflecting the improved underlying margin
and lower catastrophes. The combined ratio trends are shown in the lower right-hand chart, and you can see our
underlying 12-month average is about 63, the lowest point in all quarters shown.
On slide 8, third quarter investment results reflect actions we have taken to reduce interest rate risk in our
property-liability portfolio, maintain alignment with Allstate Financial's changing liability profile, and reposition our
public equity portfolio. The carrying value of our portfolio totaled $85.5 billion compared to $97.3 billion at year-end.
The decline is primarily in our core debt portfolio, reflecting the $12.2 billion reclassification of Lincoln Benefit Life's
investments to held for sale due to LBL's pending sale, as well as lower fixed-income valuations driven by the
significant rise in interest rates since the beginning of the year. The equity and owned component of our portfolio
continues to grow. We expect to earn higher, but more variable returns over time on this part of our portfolio.
On the top of slide 8, you can see net income investment totaled $950 million in the third quarter, and total portfolio
was 4.5%, both below prior quarter, but better than the third quarter of 2012. Low reinvestment yields and a smaller
asset base driven by reductions in Allstate Financial's spread-based liabilities resulted in lower income in our core debt
portfolio. The decline was partially mitigated by $36 million in pre-payment fees and litigation proceeds. Our equity
and owned portfolio continued to benefit from strong limited partnership earnings, which increased by $84 million
compared to the prior-year quarter, and more than offset the decline in the core debt portfolio income.
At September 30, 2013, limited partnership valuations included approximately $400 million of cumulative appreciation
that has been recognized in our income, but has not been distributed. This amount is carried on our balance sheet as an
asset, but is subject to variability in the ultimate realization. If cash proceeds are less than this valuation, it will
negatively impact future operating income.
Moving to total return, the total return for the quarter was 1.0%. Net investment income was the primary driver, as
Treasury rates were relatively stable for the quarter. An attribution of the change in net unrealized capital gains for the
first three quarters of the year is provided on the bottom right of the slide. The fixed income valuation decline, driven

by a significant increase in Treasury rates, was the overwhelming driver of the $2.7 billion decline in unrealized gains
for the first half of the year. For the third quarter, positive equity valuations and realized loss activity offset the impact
of the additional modest declines in fixed income valuations, as the net unrealized position held relatively steady.
Slide 9 depicts trends in our property-liability and Allstate Financial portfolios separately. You can see a declining
earned yield trend on our property-liability core debt in the graph at the top left, reflecting maturity reinvestments and
our ongoing risk-reduction activity. Through our rate risk reduction actions, we have positioned the portfolio to be less
sensitive to an increase in interest rates and have pulled forward future income through realization of gains on the sale
of longer-term securities.
In the scheduled maturity graph in the upper right, the two declining red bars at the longest maturities reflect that only
15% of our current portfolio is due after seven years versus 32% at the end of last year. The current yield on
intermediate corporates, which is our targeted reinvestment proxy, is approximately 1.75% to 2%. Given this shortfall
relative to the portfolio yield, maturity and sales activity have and are expected to continue to result in a decline in net
investment income for the core debt portfolio.
At the bottom of the page, you can see that Allstate Financial net investment income has declined as a result of the
managed reduction of the spread-based liabilities, a trend that will be accelerated with the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life.
Over the past few years, Allstate Financial's investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows
rather than being reinvested, so the portfolio yield has not declined as much as the property-liability portfolio. Further,
our future investment income will continue to be impacted by the pace of the liability outflows and the reinvestment
activity. The exhibit provides a pro forma view of portfolio results exclusive of LBL-related assets.
As you can see on the bottom-left chart in the last column in the table, the core debt portfolio yield remains essentially
unchanged, around 5%, but the investment income is approximately $140 million lower, excluding the LBL-related
assets. The chart on the bottom right shows the ongoing decline in the Allstate Financial portfolio as we continue to
reduce spread-based liabilities.
Moving on to slide 10, we provide a roadmap of items that impacted the results this quarter. Last quarter we announced
the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life, which is a business serving customers in the upper-left customer quadrant with life and
annuity products, where we did not have a competitive advantage. Lincoln Benefit Life is treated as held for sale
beginning this quarter, with its assets and liabilities collapsed into separate lines on the balance sheet. The estimated
$475 million after-tax loss on sale is recorded in loss on disposition on our income statement. We expect this
transaction to close early in the first quarter of 2014, subject to regulatory approval. After closing, we'll have lower
financial risk and additional employable capital of approximately $1 billion. This capital will be freed up in Allstate
Life Insurance Company, and a number of steps will be necessary for us to move it to the parent company post-closing.
As discussed last quarter, we made changes to our pension and post-retirement benefits, which caused the liabilities to
be re-measured in July. This resulted in a change in our liabilities, favorably impacting shareholders' equity by $658
million; a curtailment gain related to changes in our retiree life favorably impacting net income by $118 million; and a
pension settlement charge included in operating income of $49 million. We'll also perform an annual re-measurement
of our pension liability during the fourth quarter and are likely to have additional settlement losses of a similar or
greater magnitude at that time. Our annual review of the discontinued lines of coverage reserves resulted in a negative
after-tax impact totaling $$86 million compared to a negative impact last year of $25 million. This year's review
resulted in a pre-tax increase to asbestos reserves of $74 million, environmental reserves of $30 million, and other
exposures of $30 million. I've already mentioned our annual comprehensive review of DAC and reserve assumptions at
Allstate Financial, which negatively impacted operating income by $44 million this year, compared to a negative
impact of $21 million last year.
Slide 11 shows our capital position at September 30 compared to the same period a year ago. We remained in a strong
capital position at the end of the third quarter. This quarter, we returned $608 million to shareholders. We repurchased
2.1% of our outstanding stock, or 9.8 million shares, and paid a $0.25-per-share quarterly dividend. We have $589
million remaining our share repurchase authorization.

As we continue to execute our capital management plan, our balance sheet has changed as we have previously
described. We issued $800 million of subordinated hybrid debt and $385 million of perpetual preferred stock in the
third quarter, bringing our total preferred stock to $673 million. Our estimated statutory surplus at September 30, 2013,
is $17.3 billion in total, with $13.9 billion estimated for the property-liability companies. Holding company level assets
were $2.8 billion. Net income return on common shareholders' equity was 9.0% and 12.0% on an operating income
basis. Operating income ROE declined due to higher capital levels at September 30, 2013, and lower operating income
for the trailing-12-month period, primarily reflecting higher catastrophes caused by Superstorm Sandy in the fourth
quarter 2012. Net income ROE declined primarily due to lower operating income and the loss and disposition of
Lincoln Benefit Life.
Overall, a strong quarter, and we should make good progress on the execution of our customer-focused strategy and
2013 priorities. Now, Matt, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital Markets. Your question, please.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Good morning. First of all, let me reach Bob Block a speedy recovery so we can beat him
up and have fun with him again soon. On the agent count, are we in a position that you could be able to grow that over
the next three to five years? Tom, what's your outlook there?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Bob, first, thanks for the comments about our own Bob. He's listening, so I'm sure he'll be
happy to hear that you want to beat him up. Let me make a comment, and then I'll turn it over to Matt. First, when you
look over a longer period of time, three to four years, we knew we were going into this slow-growth segment with
trying to fix homeowners. We knew that would impact auto, and we also knew that we needed to help our most
successful agencies become more successful, and those that could not get there needed to find another way to earn a
living and not take care of our customers.
So we made a whole bunch of changes, and then of course we always have turnover. So we went down from like over
11,000 to like 9,000, as you point out, of agency owners. And that helped build up the size of the average agency from
about 1,800 policies to over 2,500, which gives them more skills, capabilities which is – gets to the other point that I'd
like to make, and it's really about the number of feet on the street we have. So it's the number of agencies we have, as
well as the number of people, licensed sales professionals, they have in their offices. And that number has continued to
go up, in part because we've built a system, which is very supportive of them. Everything from new technology rolled
out to the compensation programs to the way in which we help them grow their businesses. So Matt can talk about the
specific plans he has to grow, but I think you're correct in that we are positioned now to begin to grow distribution in
the Allstate agency channel.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Hey, Bob, it's Matt. Thanks for the question. As Tom said, we looked at total sales
professionals, including exclusive agents. Our licensed sales professionals, our exclusive financial specialists, the
Allstate independent agents, so we're looking at a number of points of presence on the street capable of selling the
Allstate products. But we're not just looking at it in terms of numbers. As Tom said, we're looking at it in terms of
numbers, productivity of those existing points of presence, and the geographic distribution to ensure that we have
appropriate market penetration.
One of the consequences of shutting down the Allstate direct operation and shifting all of the Allstate assets, the
Allstate brand assets, to an agency model is that various geographies in the past were covered by the direct operation
and did not have sufficient Allstate agencies on the street. That's part of the heartland, that's part of pieces of New
England. And so we have fairly aggressive initiatives under way to put points of presence where they need to be so we
can appropriately serve customers throughout the United States. So you should expect to see not only numbers
improve, the productivity improve, but the geographic distribution change over time as we analyze it from a market

potential and a market penetration perspective as well.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: So, thoughtful answers. Just a follow-up. You had year-over-year growth in PIF in Allstate
brand auto, and certainly Esurance is showing good growth. So both of those units seem to be bucking the trend of the
aggregators, which some of your competitors are starting to complain about. Did you see that at all as an issue in
Encompass, or are you just less immune to the aggregators impact because of the current product mix?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Bob, this is Tom. I would say, if you're talking about aggregators like Answer Financial, it
continues it grow. It, of course, has a relationship with Esurance, where it takes a lot of the quotes that Esurance does
not close and then gets those customers placed with somebody else so that we can still serve them. And as you saw,
their premiums were up this quarter as well.
As it relates to each individual market, we are seeing the competition change in each segment. So many people in the
lower left with the Allstate agencies are starting to pursue similar strategies to us in terms of product differentiation and
bundling. In the Esurance side, you're not seeing people pursue the bundling, and we're just getting started there, and
started, we just rolled out in one state homeowners, but Esurance has not only the potential of a good, low-cost model
and then ever-increasing strength in its brand to be able to then broaden the product suite from there. And Encompass
has a specific focus, so rather than just trying to sell stand-alone auto policies, it's really trying to sell both an auto and a
home policy together, which is our packaged policy. So we think getting the right customer value propositions for each
segment is the way to compete.
<Q - Bob R. Glasspiegel>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your question, please.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just following up on some of the auto questions. Your
new-issued applications are up roughly 15% in the Allstate brand. Could you talk about it? And that's a big jump from
what it was a couple quarters ago. What's driven that big jump in applications? That's number one. But also, number
two, within those applications, are those more within your core preferred, or is that moving more into the standard
market for auto?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Adam, I'll get Matt to talk about new business. But let me just point out that the biggest
driver of growth in this quarter – actually this year – in auto is retention. So new business is obviously important to us.
But the retention has moved up by about 0.7 of a point. So I'll ask Matt to talk, first, about new business, but then he'll
probably want to talk some about the broad-based improvements we have in retention as well. Because that's another
factor driving your question, or your comment.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Adam, it's Matt. Thanks for your question. As Tom said, auto growth this quarter, and auto
growth in generally, is driven in large part by increased new business and better retention. On the new business side,
what we've seen is roughly three-quarters of the lift came from improvements in our close rate, and the remaining
quarter is driven by quoting more customers. So if you look at the close-rate component, I'd say the vast majority of
that has to do with continued enhancement of our pricing methodology, our agency re-engagement, and increased home
availability. All of those combined to improve our close rates. On the quote volume piece, it's certainly what we just
talked about with Bob. It's increased points of presence, and it's re-engagement of the agency force that's driving more
quotes through the sales funnel.
When you get to the renewal side, we saw widespread improvement in renewal rates, but the majority of the
improvement on that side, on the retention side, through September is a result of New York and Florida improvements.
Now, certainly it's not only those two, but those were the two biggest levers on the retention side. A number of other
factors, like increased homeowner availability, customer experience initiatives, we have a much better rate
management in place, so there's less rate disruption. And all of that has contributed to the retention improvement as
well.

<Q - Adam Klauber>: So I'm not asking for a prediction, but as particularly your homeowner product becomes more
competitive going forward, does that have the potential to continue to pick up your standard auto retention going
farther?
<A - Matthew Winter>: Well, certainly, without predicting, as I've said on a previous call, about 80% of our new
House & Home sales are coming with at least one auto. So it's a system. As we said before, we talked about home
availability impacting both the new business side and the retention side, since we're able to keep a stronger relationship
with the customer. But it's also customer experience, rate management. It's the level of advice and service provided by
the Allstate agency. And, of course, it's just sheer numbers of feet on the street capable of representing the Allstate
brand and serving our customers.

Our next question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your question, please.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you. First, just want to circle back on the positive PIF growth year over year in the Allstate
brand. That's the first time, I believe, in about five years. So the question I've been getting is the sustainability of that
trend, the positive growth going forward.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Good morning, Jay. This is Tom. I think if you look back over the last, say, eight quarters,
and do a trend analysis, you'll see that the negative impact on homeowners peaked about a year ago at about 6.5%
down by quarter, in terms of the number of policies are down. As we said, this quarter, it's come down to 3.5%. And if
you look at the trend analysis on price changes in homeowners, you'll see that that's also come down. So that trend line
should continue, which, as Matt pointed out, is helpful to not disrupting our current customers. And then, in addition, as
they roll out House & Home, that should drive the auto line up. So the auto line that you're pointing to has a similar
trend line. You can do the same kind of math. If you just look at it, it's continued to go. I think we should be able to –
and our goal is to pick up share in all of our brands. And we're clearly picking up share in Esurance and Encompass.
The Allstate channel is not yet to the point where it's picking up share in its segment, but I believe that the broad-based
system and approach that Matt's taking will do that.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay. And then on loss cost trends within the Allstate brand, standard auto, it is the second quarter
of losses exceeding earned premium growth, and both frequency and severity were higher in 2Q. I'm just trying to get a
sense of what's driving that.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Well, Matt can talk about profitability management specifically and what he's doing there.
A couple of general comments I would make is that, first, frequency bounces around a lot, as do paid severities, in BI in
particular. So depending which cases you're settling, we feel good about the reserves we have up, which are a little
different than paid. So we feel good that we've accurately reported the profitability, and frequency is just within its
normal range. But Matt can talk about what he does to adapt to that going forward. I would say we have, though, a
organizational system, which over the last 10 years, if you look at our profitability in auto, we know how to adjust and
adapt, if you look back at our performance. Matt, you can talk – will talk about what he does with the specific trends
you're talking about, and he may have some comments about specific places he's working on.
<A - Matthew Winter>: Sure. So as Tom said, yeah, we looked at it fairly carefully. We're confident it's not a
quality-of-business or a systemic issue. It's normal volatility. It's within our three-year historical ranges, and it's within
our expectations. We manage to the overall combined ratio targets, knowing that the individual components will move
over time.
So one of my favorite sayings, and one of the ways we manage this business is, you can't stop the waves, but you can
learn to surf. And that's kind of how we think about it. The waves are the normal volatility in the business: It's
movement of BI, it's PIF fraud, it's economic changes, it's competitor actions, it's weather changes. And we are set up

not trying to fight those waves or not trying to prevent them from occurring but to ride them. And so we use pricing.
We use sophisticated pricing methodologies. We use rate actions. We use underwriting actions. We use process
changes. And, most importantly, we use our 14 market operating committees and 15 including Canada to give us early
warning and detection of the movement of those waves so that we're able to react appropriately to them, quickly get out
in front of them, and be able to ride them.
And my opinion, having watched this team over the last several years, is we have a bunch of tremendous surfers out
there who are very good at reading the waves and getting on top of them, and I think the team overall does a
remarkably good job of managing that, so these ins and outs and volatility of frequency and severity, while we always
explore them and research them to make sure they're not systemic, they do not concern us.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay. And then just have one for Don. In terms of getting the freed-up capital from the sale of
Lincoln Benefit Life up to the holding company for share buybacks, how quickly could that occur?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Jay, this is Tom. That's really a question for Steve, I think.
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: Okay. So first we have to close the deal, which is, we believe, early first quarter of next year.
We have dividend limitations, which we'll have to get state regulatory approval to actually move the cash up to the
Allstate Insurance Company, and again from the Allstate Insurance Company up to Allcorp. There are other, alternative
ways we might be able to move the capital through a repurchase of some of the equity ownership of Allstate Life from
Allstate Life [ph] Balance, the Insurance Company, (40:06) which could get us up another level, but we still have to
pay a dividend up to Allcorp. So it all requires regulatory approval, is the bottom line. We're in a strong capital
position, so we're hopeful that when we apply for that that we'll get favorable results.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: All right, thank you.

Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, Tom. In regards to the goal of reducing
Allstate Protection's expense ratio over time, I was curious if the major initiatives to drive that decline are already in
motion, because I know there's been a lot of expense initiatives. And, related, is part of the reason for the initiative due
to the desire to bring Allstate's costs down closer to competitors who are gaining market share?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Mike, a couple things. First, I would say we're always trying to reduce expenses around
here. So the challenge we've had in reduce – and we've done that over the last four or five years. The challenge we had
in terms of the expense ratio was that the top line was going down, so you had to reduce expenses faster than your top
line was going down, particularly when it relates to the number of policies you have. So we weren't offsetting inflation
and some of our other costs. So that was our first challenge.
Second, what are we doing now? We're continuing that. We have a different approach to it. So we're really looking at
more continuous improvement actions to continue to take costs out. Our cost, though – depends how you slice and dice
it. We look at it by segment. And so when you look at the lower left, that's a different cost structure than the lower
right. So if you look at it, you have to really look at the costs relative to State Farm, Nationwide, Farmers, because
those are the people writing the same kind of value proposition. So you can't say that the agency expense is too high
because the agency does a lot of work, and our customers love our agencies, and they're happy to pay for our agencies.
Those customers in the lower right want to do it themselves, and so you have to make sure your expenses are right
there relative to GEICO and Progressive Direct.
So we look at the expenses relative to the customer value proposition that we deliver to people. So – and we think we
can do a better job in all of our segments. So there's lots of we always should be able to take costs out with the
improvements in technology, data management, and global sourcing. So that's part of why we're saying it's part of our
effort, which is we're supposed to deliver good value for our customers.

When you look at it by component, and if you look at advertising expenses, we think we're very efficient and effective,
whether that's our quote rates that you heard are up, or it's the close rates at Esurance. So we feel good about the
advertising component. So when you look at technology, which is another large component of our expenses, we
actually think we're in the top quartile in terms of best, in terms of cost per line of code delivered, because of the way
we do it. That said, we think there are ways we can simplify our processes. We still have too many processes that are
legacy based and too much what I just like to call built-up wax. So you should expect our expense ratio to come down
over time. I would like to you think about it relative to the customer value proposition that we're delivering, not just
who's grown and who's not grown.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay, that's very helpful and thorough. Last question is in regards to investment income
levels. You guys have great disclosure – thank you – but there's still a lot of moving parts. I was hoping to get some
guidance. So in the 10-Q, there looks to be about $56 billion of assets maturing through 2014 between P&C and life
and probably at least 100 basis point higher yield than current new money rates, I'd guess. And there's also a lot of life
insurance spread-based liabilities moving off the balance sheet. So I guess at the end of the day, I'm just trying to – if
you net out everything together, what's the dollar amount of investments we should be sizing up as needing to be
reinvested at potentially lower new money rates in 2014?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Judy will answer the question on that. First, I agree. It's difficult to project investment
income with what's both going on in the markets, what we're doing with Lincoln Benefit, and what we're doing from a
risk and return standpoint. So that is why we try to have as much transparency as we can. The number sounds high to
me in terms of what's rolling, and Judy will talk about that. But let me maybe just say our philosophy on this is we're
going to make the appropriate risk-return tradeoff for our shareholders, not do something just to maintain operating –
so that we make somebody's estimates for operating earnings – if it's a bad idea for our shareholders.
A good example of that is the shortening that Steve showed you on the property-liability portfolio. We could have had
higher – and would have had higher – operating income this year had we not shortened that portfolio. We're not trying
to trade interest rates; we didn't think it was a good risk-return tradeoff to be longer than seven years, so we sold about
as much of that as we could. So as you're thinking about our investment performance, you should obviously look at
how much we deliver in operating earnings per share, because that's what you and we are all held accountable for. But
also think about it in terms of our total return and say do you think we're getting the right total return relative to the risk
that we've taken?
Judy, can you take on the $56 billion number?
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: Sure, so not sure where you're getting the $56 billion number, but if you look in our notes,
we do outline the maturity profile of the overall portfolio on page 10 of the notes. And in one year, it's about $2.5
billion, and longer than one, less than five, it's closer to $22 billion. And, plus, Steve also outlined for the property and
casualty company in the presentation, that also shows what's coming up in the property and casualty portfolio, which is
significantly less than the $56 billion.
When you think about what's going on in Allstate Financial, as Steve said and what we've said in previous quarters,
that's largely a cash-matched book. And LBL really doesn't change that, the sale of LBL. So as Steve said, we're going
to lose about $12 billion in assets under management when LBL goes away. But that doesn't really change our maturity
profile as much as – I would think of it more as a cash-matched portion of the book is going away, and the balance of
the portfolio stays largely in line with where it should be. When you said the 100 basis points, that's about right. Our
portfolio yield at this point is a little over 3%, and our reinvest proxy is intermediate corporate, so that's about –
between 1.75% and 2%. So it is about a 100 basis points differential. But it's not anywhere close to the $56 billion that
you're mentioning in terms of runoff.
<Q - Michael D. Zaremski>: Okay, I'll check my math. Thank you for that; it's helpful.

Our next question is from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: Good morning. I wanted to see – maybe ask you about Esurance and whether or not some of the
changes you've made and some the things that you've experienced the last couple of quarters have changed your
thinking about scale in that business and whether or not – your view of sort of how big you need to get there has
changed, in order to be sort of scale profitable.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Paul, this is Tom. Make sure I understand the question, our view of scale. We think
Esurance is of scale today, but we're more than willing to invest a fair amount of money in advertising, which we break
out in the disclosures, which is more than it would support if you didn't want to grow it. But we actively think there's a
great opportunity to grow the business because we have a unique value proposition, which we're continuing to build
out. So maybe help me think through a little more on the scale piece.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: Well, I guess advertising is part of that scale, right? That eventually the all-in costs have to get
to the point where we're profitable.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: Has your thinking there changed when we're going to get to the point where it's all-in
profitable?
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. I have a better sense for where you're trying to go with it.
First, we think – we look at it, and the way Don runs the business, and he can talk about it in a second here, with Gary
Tolman, is that we have to have profitable lifetime value by customer cohort, so what we write in a particular year.
Given that you have large, up-front advertising expenses, obviously the first year, you lose money, and then you make
money after because your advertising expenses are not required, really, for retention. So you have a large loss. As it
relates to the total P&L, what I've said to Don is, as long as you're writing lifetime-value business, which gives us a
good return on capital, I'm prepared to keep funding the growth, because it's a good economic deal for our
shareholders, even if the advertising costs are such that they more than offset the earnings you get from retention
business. So I'm willing to run an overall loss at Esurance as long as we're growing economic value for the
shareholders. We obviously could stop that anytime we wanted, and the combined ratio would drop down into a
profitable standpoint.
Don, you might just want to talk about how you're managing and thinking about lifetime value.
<A - Don Civgin>: Yeah, Paul, first of all, I do agree with Tom. I don't think it's a matter of balancing scale and
profitability. It's more growth and profitability. And so with PIF up over 30% more than prior year, that gets called into
question. So when you look at the combined ratio that they're running, underlying's about 111.5.
Because of the accounting model, there are three things going on. First is the advertising gets expensed up front, as
Tom said. We run it, as Tom said, based on the lifetime value of the business we're writing. So we're running it for
economics. We take into account the acquisition cost. That's running in line with what we expect. Retention is running
in line with what we expect, if not a little better. So we feel good about that. The second issue is the loss ratio. And I'll
be honest, the loss ratio continues to be a little bit higher than we'd like. Gary and the team are on it. It's a few states.
We're taking the right actions on pricing. If you look at the supplement, you'll see we've been consistently taking
pricing actions where necessary throughout the year. But – so I feel comfortable we'll get that back in line, but that's the
second reason the combined ratio is high. I think the third one is just investment in expenses. I mean, we're building out
states. We're building out product lines. As Tom said, we sold our first homeowners policy last week in a bundled
fashion. We've got motorcycle, we've got renters. And that requires a lot of up-front work to get those filings done and
get the product ready to go, including technology investments.
So I feel good about that. I feel good about the advertising response. Little bit of work to do still on the loss ratio, but
overall, all those things put together, so long as we're making money on an economic basis, we're going to continue to
grow the business.

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Paul, this is Tom. Let me maybe make one other comment. If you look at the increase in
premiums in average rates that we show in the supplement, you can see that in the Allstate brand, auto, if you just add
up the last four quarters – and you can't really add them up, but it's easier math – but it's a little less than 2%. If you
look at Esurance, it's a little less than 6%, and if you look at Encompass, it's a little less than 6% too. So both of those
latter two businesses, we believe, we still have work to do to improve profitability in the auto business. Not so much
work that we want to shut growth off completely, but you may see growth in those two lines come down next year as
we work harder to deal with the issue that Don talked about in terms of the loss ratio.
At the same time, you should see the trend that Jay talked about in the Allstate brand go the other way. And, of course,
remember that the Allstate brand, in terms of total items in force, is about 15 times the size of those two individually,
and of course, seven to eight times the combination of them. So we don't need as much growth, so if we give up X
points of growth in Esurance and Encompass because we're trying to manage the loss ratio, we don't need nearly that
percentage increase in the Allstate channel to get overall growth. And we're trying to grow not only in each channel,
but we're trying to grow the overall company.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: That was perfect. Second question, and I actually know the answer, but I'm going to ask it
anyway. The new accounting – I've been asking everybody if they want to comment on the new GAAP accounting
that's coming down the pike.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Are you talking about insurance contracts and IFRS?
<Q - Paul Newsome>: Yes, sir. The new FASB proposal.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Sam has been actively involved in shaping that. I think I would comment that it's not the
answer you just gave us, which is perfect. I'm going to, like, write that down, Paul, that we gave you a perfect answer.
But we don't think it's a perfect answer. Sam might have a view as to – we've been very public about our statements on
it.
<A - Samuel H. Pilch>: Good morning, Paul. Sam Pilch. Yes, we filed a comment letter with the FASB and the IASB
last week, and our view is that the proposed accounting standards are radically different than the current. In fact, there's
little very carry-forward, if any, from the current standards to the proposed. The framework of the standards is to
contribute to solvency measurement and performance, and have deviated from historical performance reporting for
financial purposes. So we have strong views that are different than proposed, and we advocate improvements to the
current model, but not of any great significance. Very targeted. Did I respond to your question?
<Q - Paul Newsome>: That's also perfect. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Your question, please.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hey, good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. So good quarter. New auto apps were up
almost 20%, even though you raised pricing in standard auto by something like 3% last quarter. Obviously, that's great
that you're not seeing much of a tradeoff there. But against this, folks like Progressive seem to be sort of selectively
reducing pricing, and Travelers is talking about a big double-digit reduction to auto new business. And so I guess that
tees up two important questions. The first is how does more competitive pricing in the independent agency channel
actually affect you in your exclusive channel? And, second, I think driving a lot of this is people, companies, talking a
lot about price elasticity, and I'm wondering what you think your elasticity looks like in the exclusive channel, and how
you think that compares to the independent? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Josh, I would go this way. First, we don't think it's all about price. If you're in that – if you
go back to our quadrant – if you're in the upper side to those, it's clearly more price sensitive, because those customers
are sort of like, just give me a name I recognize. So they tend to be a little more price sensitive. We've tried to design
our value propositions to recognize price is important, but that value is equally important. We don't get as much

leakage between independent agencies' pricing and the captive channel. When you look at where our business comes
from, or where it goes, obviously people who want local advice go to the same kind of person, but we don't see a huge
amount of pressure. Somebody in the independent agency channel takes their price down, we don't see a big change
there.
As it relates to overall pricing, I would say we're sort of in line this year with our – if you look at the top three
competitors, top seven states, we look in line with those people, not a big difference. Progressive might be at the low
end. GEICO and State Farm would be slightly higher, but in the range of – hard for a customer to tell. If you're talking
about half a point on $1,000 a year, $900 a year, you're talking about $5, so it doesn't really matter from a price
elasticity standpoint.
As it relates to what other people do in the future, I think Matt described how we run our business. We do the same
thing in Esurance and Encompass, which is highly specific. We watch our costs, look at our value proposition, make
sure it's fair to our customers. And as it relates to Travelers taking big decreases, I think theirs was also related to a
different product. And Don Bailey's [ph] shaking – (59:17) may have some comment. But I think you're starting to see
more people move to product differentiation. So if you look over a longer period of time, competition first was on
sophisticated pricing, then it moved to advertising, particularly in the branded channels. And now it's moving to
product differentiation.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's helpful. That's helpful. If I can ask just one more quick question. Severity last year,
everybody was generally concerned about it, led to a bunch of price increases. Your guys' metrics, I mean, they're still
going up, of course, but seemed to be moderating a bit. And there was commentary coming from other companies that
sort of suggest that maybe the severity spike that everybody feared hasn't materialized, and I'm wondering if you guys
have any color around that or whether people are just reacting to noise.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I think I would go back to Matt's comment that to the extent we have cost pressures and we
think they're real, we increase our prices; if we think it's just noise, we don't. If you look at our overall pricing, it's been
less than 2% over the last 12 months, so we're feeling okay about where we're at.

Our final question today is from Mike of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Thanks. Just wanted to square the deployable capital. So looks like about $2 billion of run
rate, LBL $1 billion at some point in the future. I remember you talked about the preferred issue you that – sort of
balance sheet rightsizing you did in late last year, creating another certain amount of capital plus the HoldCo cash of
about $1 billion. Just want to think about, first off, how much of the preferred capital movement, capital generation, is
yet to come, and how should we think about right amount of liquidity you need to hold onto on a go-forward basis once
you clear all these decks? And just one follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: I'll let Steve answer the preferred question.
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So on the preferred stack we've issued somewhat over $600 million so far. We're planning to
issue about $1.5 billion. So as the market allows over the next several months. The proceeds of that will generally be
used for general corporate purposes, but we do have $960 million of debt maturing next spring and summer. And we
need the cash to pay that down.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Okay. And then the timeline for the remainder of the liquidity? Like, how much cash
should we think about you kind of hanging onto at the holding company on a run rate?

<A - Thomas J. Wilson>: Okay, this is Tom. So, Mike, what we do is every year we wait until we get the statutory.
We try to look at our capital plan in sort of January, February, and then let shareholders know what we're going to do
for the next 12 months. So we still have about $600 million left on our current share repurchase program. So we're out
buying that back. And then in February, when we get done with sort of how the year turned out, where was statutory
capital, and then we look forward and say how do we feel about earnings, profitability, the business. And, therefore, we
then come up with a share repurchase/dividend plan out of that, which is based on how much cash we think we need.
Obviously, we don't think we need $2.8 billion at the holding company.
Thomas J. Wilson
So maybe let me actually close kind of around that, which is to say if you just look at the quarter, a bunch of things
have come together at the same time, and all they happened to show up in the P&L, which really reflects our
broad-based approach to trying to drive shareholder value. So we've been maintaining profitability in the auto business
with dramatically improved profitability in the homeowners business. Obviously, this quarter, with cash incredibly low,
it really showed up. But we think it shifts it to a more sustainable position, which gives us that strength, Mike, that
you're talking about in terms of earnings power, in terms of gives us confidence to do it.
At the same time, we've made some strategic moves, too, which give us increased capital called Lincoln, the sale of
Lincoln Benefit Life. At the same time, we're working to improve the strength of the balance sheet by issuing things
like preferred – really at little cost to the shareholders in terms of current earnings. And the same time, we're buying
back a bunch of stock and paying what is a great cash on cash return to shareholders, which cash on cash is both
dividends and then the shares we buy back. So that's a very strong – and we're going to be in a better position, I believe,
at the end of this year on that, and we still have plenty of capacity to fund the growth that you're now starting to see.
So we feel good about the way everything came together. You wouldn't expect it all to hit the P&L all in one quarter,
but it did. And we feel like we've been successful in driving shareholder value, which relates then to increasing the
value of your shares.
Thank you very much for investing you time to continue to learn more about our performance. And we'll talk to you
next quarter.
