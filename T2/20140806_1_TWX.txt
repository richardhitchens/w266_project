MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Time Warner, Inc. second quarter 2014 earnings call. My name is Joe, and I will be your operator for
today's call.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and, later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please
note, this conference is also being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman,
you may begin.
Michael Kopelman
Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's second quarter earnings conference call.
This morning, we issued two press releases: one detailing our results for the second quarter, and the other reaffirming
our 2014 full year business outlook. Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover.
First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP
financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are included in our earnings release and
trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors.
Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is
available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current
expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements, due to various
factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on
Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly
disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events, or otherwise.

Thank you, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeffrey L. Bewkes
Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning.
We had another great quarter. Revenues grew 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 17% and adjusted earnings per
share was up 29%. We also generated $2 billion in free cash flow in the first half of the year. That's up 16% from a year
earlier. The other highlight in the quarter was the completion of the spin-off of Time Inc. into an independent, publicly
traded company on June 6th. This really marked the beginning of a new and a very promising era for Time Warner.
As you know, we started a process several years ago that focused the company on video content, emphasizing the very
best storytelling. We've strived to make that content available to consumers all over the world, and across every
technology platform and device. We've also maintained an intense focus on our operational and capital efficiency, with
an unwavering commitment to maximize value for Time Warner shareholders. Our strong results, both this quarter and
the last several years, are evidence that our strategy is working.
By focusing on the right set of leading brands and assets, on operational excellence, and on disciplined capital
allocation, we've been able to achieve the highest total shareholder returns of any company in our peer group over the
last six years. And we think the future of the company is even brighter.
We've only just begun to reap the benefits of being a nimbler and more focused video content company with iconic
assets, including the world's leading premium television brand, the world's strongest ad-supported cable network group,
and the world's largest film and television studio. The combination of those assets, and a management team that I think
is the strongest in the industry, positions us for continued attractive growth in the years to come.
Today's call is about our operating results and performance. We're not going to comment on the proposal from 21st
Century Fox or its withdrawal, except to say that the board and our senior management team appreciate very much the
continued support of our shareholders. We're committed to continue delivering substantial and sustainable returns into
the future, and we saw ample evidence of what we can accomplish during the second quarter, and that's just the
beginning.
So let me start with HBO, which, in a world with so much great content and so many ways to access that content,
continues to define the word premium. HBO remains at the top of its game, recently receiving 99 primetime Emmy
nominations, which is the most of any network for the 14th year in a row. It's also more than double the nominations of
its closest competitor for the second straight year.
Nominations included Outstanding Comedy Series for VEEP and Silicon Valley, as well as Outstanding Drama Series
for True Detective and Game of Thrones. Both Silicon Valley and True Detective are freshman hits for HBO. That
underscores HBO's unrivaled ability to incubate and provide a platform for groundbreaking storytelling.
Now speaking of groundbreaking, the fourth season of Game of Thrones, which concluded in June, averaged 19 million
cumulative viewers, making it the most watched season of an original series in HBO's history, surpassing even The
Sopranos. What are you going to do?
With all this, HBO is not easing up on the gas. It introduced two more shows this quarter that are off to solid starts.
John Oliver's Last Week Tonight, and our new drama, The Leftovers, from show runner and writer, Damon Lindelof.
The Leftovers is the first show Warner Bros. has produced for HBO, and Leftovers is averaging 8 million viewers per
episode to date. And two days from today, The Knick, from executive producer Steven Soderbergh, will premiere on
Cinemax, which has been steadily building a slate of original hits. We think The Knick could be a signature show for
the network, and we've already renewed it for a second season.
I mentioned using technology to enhance the user experience, and HBO GO continues to set the standard for how
audiences enjoy the content they love across devices and platforms. HBO GO active users grew 35% year-over-year, in

June, and it's now available in 24 territories around the world. And as we've told you before, we're making investments
in a next generation HBO GO that will be even more powerful and will put us in a strong position to take advantage of
consumer demand for multi-platform viewing options, here and around the world.
HBO's investments in programming and technology continue to translate into solid subscriber growth. In the first half,
we added more than twice as many domestic subs as we did in the same period a year ago, and we're confident that that
will translate into even stronger subscription revenue growth over time.
Of course, HBO's success has not been limited to its domestic business. HBO's international subscriber base, including
unconsolidated joint ventures, grew almost 15% in the past 12 months, and we think there are substantial additional
opportunities to grow internationally in the years to come.
Now, let's look at Turner, which has the strongest portfolio of ad-supported cable networks in the industry. That
includes two of the top five networks in the U.S. and the highest percentage of its U.S. networks and the top 30 of any
operator. And Turner's four most important networks, TNT, TBS, CNN and Cartoon Network, account for 85% of its
domestic affiliate fees. That concentration is the result of a deliberate strategy of focusing our investment on a small
group of top tier networks to ensure that they are must haves, for both consumers and distributors.
In a world where consumers are becoming more discriminating in what they watch, and where distributors are looking
to create smaller bundles of networks, we think that's the right strategy, and it puts us in a great position to increase
share over time. We saw that play out in this year's upfront, where we once again garnered price increases at the very
top of the industry.
To stay on top, Turner's investing even more on content, building on a strong platform that's already home to more
top-rated original programs than any of its peers and a portfolio of top-tier sports that includes the NBA, Major League
Baseball and March Madness. Those investments are paying dividends. During the quarter, TNT ranked as
ad-supported cable's number one primetime network among total viewers and adults 18 to 34, adults 18 to 49 and
adults 25 to 54. We've told you about TNT's efforts to refresh and take more creative risks with its programming, and
we're already seeing positive results.
The Last Ship and Murder in the First, which both launched during the quarter, are the two most watched new series on
ad-supported cable this year so far. We expect that momentum to continue with the August rollout of Legends, which
stars Sean Bean and comes from Howard Gordon. He's the creative force behind 24 and Homeland.
TBS was close on TNT's heels, finishing the quarter as the number three ad-supported network in primetime among
adults 18 to 49 and adults 25 to 54 with The Big Bang Theory on TBS remaining the number one comedy on
ad-supported cable among total viewers for the tenth consecutive quarter. And we're excited about the launch of all new
episodes of American Dad on TBS this fall. We also continue to see strength at Adult Swim, which was again
ad-supported cable's number one network in total day among adults 18 to 34 during the quarter, and it won the day in
adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 49 as well.
At CNN, we're making significant progress on our original programming strategy with current seasons of Anthony
Bourdain: Parts Unknown and Morgan Spurlock: Inside Man both registering solid double digit gains over the prior
season. The Sixties was tripling CNN's time period average from a year ago and The Hunt with John Walsh, another
new show, won its time period among cable news networks.
Outside the U.S., Turner is also a leader, particularly in Latin America. The strength of Turner's international position
was evident this quarter as international revenue was up around 10% and adjusted operating income grew 25% on a
constant currency basis with growth across all of our major regions.
Our kids business remains a cornerstone of our international operations. In fact, Cartoon Network is the number one
kids' network in many areas outside of the U.S. While already a very good business for us, we've got plans to
significantly increase the size of our kids' business as we focus on global franchise management and growing consumer
products revenue.

Turner is also investing to expand its lead in multi-platform with properties like Bleacher Report, which was the
number two standalone sports site in the second quarter, and CNN Digital, which is significantly ahead of its peers,
leading all news outlets with over 30 million monthly mobile uniques.
CNN recently extended its multi-platform capabilities with a national rollout of its next generation TV Everywhere
product, which is now available to subscribers in over 85 million households domestically, so go check it out.
Now I'd like to turn to Warner Bros., which is on track for another great year, underscoring its continued industry
leadership. In what is widely considered a volatile and mature business, Warner's has grown its adjusted operating
income at a double digit CAGR over the past five years by leveraging its industry-leading distribution capabilities, its
unique IP, and its very strong relationships in the creative community to produce content with global appeal. The
strength and diversity of its revenue streams was evident again this quarter.
On the theatrical side of the business, we anticipated a softer summer, compared to last year, which remember, included
Man of Steel, The Hangover Part III and The Great Gatsby. But despite those comparisons, we're number two in the
domestic box office year-to-date, benefiting from the strong performances of The LEGO Movie and Godzilla, and
along with the release of the second Hobbit installment, The LEGO Movie also helped us to maintain our number one
position in home video in the quarter.
It's just the latest example of Warner's unequaled ability to create franchises with two additional LEGO titles already in
development. That adds to an already strong pipeline of franchises built around DC Entertainment and the new series of
films from J.K. Rowling based in the world of Harry Potter. Our franchise pipeline gives us great confidence Warner
Bros. will continue to lead the film industry, building on a track record that includes the number one position at the
domestic box office seven out of the last ten years and the number one spot in home video for 13 straight years.
But that's not all. Warner Bros.' television group is also leading the industry, heading into the 2014 to 2015 TV season,
Warner's is again the number one producer of shows for broadcast, that's a position we've held for 11 of the past 12
seasons. Starting this fall, Warner will have 31 shows on broadcast networks, including at least two primetime series on
each network, and 60 shows overall across broadcast and cable.
Now what's also really notable and unprecedented is that five of those shows are based on IP from DC Entertainment,
including the highly anticipated Gotham on Fox, The Flash on The CW and Constantine on NBC. That's early evidence
of Warner's ambitious plans to further mine the DC catalog across our television, film, video game and consumer
products businesses.
Warner's is also leveraging its lead scale position in broadcast television by significantly expanding production for
cable networks and SVOD services, growing its non-scripted output and widening its international local production
footprint. During the quarter for example, we completed the acquisition of Eyeworks' international television
production operations and we've now built out a global network of wholly owned international production companies.
A key part of our strategy for Warner's to expand in cable TV production is working more closely with both Turner and
HBO. That collaboration is one of the many benefits of having a smaller, more focused company with commonalities
across all of the businesses and a management team that's worked together for years.
And we continue to augment our strong operating performance with disciplined capital allocation. So far this year,
we've repurchased $3.5 billion of our stock and including dividends, we have returned over $4 billion to shareholders.
Even at recent highs, we believe share repurchases were a very attractive use of capital. And today, we announced that
the board has authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases. That decision is a strong indication of the
confidence we have in our growth prospects.
Over the next several years, we have great opportunities across our businesses. At Turner, we'll benefit from our
domestic affiliate renewal cycle and strong international growth, while investing to reinvigorate our key brands and
take advantage of under monetized opportunities like the global kids' business. At HBO, we'll capitalize on the growing
demand for our industry-leading content both here and around the world, while investing in technology to provide the
very best next generation experience to our consumers.

At Warner Bros., we'll rollout an even stronger slate of franchise films with global appeal and leverage our leading
position in broadcast TV to drive growth in cable, SVOD, unscripted and international sales. And across the company,
we'll remain laser focused on operating and allocating capital as efficiently as possible to maximize shareholder returns.
We know that many of you are interested in hearing more about our long-term growth plans and we look forward to
sharing additional details about those plans at an investor event this fall.
With that, let me turn it over to Howard.
Howard M. Averill
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning.
As a reminder, we completed the Time Inc. spin in the beginning of June and it's now included in discontinued
operations. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.
We're thrilled with our financial performance in the first half of the year. We delivered strong growth in the first quarter
and even better results this one. So through the first half, our adjusted operating income is up 14% and adjusted EPS is
up 27%. And we think that growth is both indicative of the strength of our industry-leading businesses, and a validation
of the strategy we've been executing the last several years.
In the second quarter, we posted double digit increases in adjusted operating income at all three divisions and total AOI
increased 17%, boosted by an acceleration in subscription revenue at both HBO and Turner. Margins expanded nearly
300 basis points in the quarter, and that's the 11th time in the last 12 quarters that margins have increased
year-over-year.
Total operating expenses were down 1% in the quarter, and that's despite higher content investments at Turner and
HBO and increased expenses associated with the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic. SG&A was down 3% in
the quarter. This is a great example of how our disciplined approach to expense management allows us to balance
aggressive content investments with continued margin expansion and profit growth.
We continue to leverage growth in adjusted operating income into even faster growth in adjusted EPS, which increased
29%, and that was mostly due to our ongoing share repurchase program and improved results at our equity investments,
including CME.
During the quarter, we repurchased almost $2 billion in shares, a significant acceleration from the first quarter, and paid
over $280 million in dividends. So year-to-date, we've returned over $4 billion to shareholders, including over $3.5
billion in share repurchases and well over $500 million in dividends. And as evidenced by the authorization of an
additional $5 billion in share repurchases, we remain committed to delivering significant, direct returns to shareholders.
This morning, we also reaffirmed our 2014 guidance for low-teens growth in adjusted EPS. So with a very strong first
half, we remain on track for our sixth consecutive year of double digit growth in adjusted EPS.
Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, which had record second quarter revenues and adjusted
operating income. Subscription revenues were up 8% in the quarter, despite a 70 basis point drag from FX. Domestic
subscription revenues once again grew high single digits, as Turner continued to benefit from the rate increases
associated with its domestic affiliate renewals. International subscription revenues increased double digits, with the
largest gains coming from Latin America.
Looking forward, we'll continue to benefit from Turner's domestic affiliate renewals for the remainder of the year, and
we expect domestic sub revenue growth to remain in the high single digit range. Longer term, we remain confident in
our ability to grow domestic sub revenue double digits annually, on average, through 2018.
Moving on, advertising revenues increased 1% in the quarter, in line with the range we expected coming into the
quarter, and that included the benefit of approximately 300 basis points from the airing of two Final Four games. While
our new original programs at TNT are off to a good start, ratings at our domestic networks remain a headwind. In

Page 6 of 14
addition, scatter demand remained moderate, particularly for sports. And as we've discussed with you previously, we
think that was at least partially due to the impact of the World Cup.
Domestic advertising growth was up slightly in the quarter, with very modest growth at both our domestic
entertainment networks including kids and young adults and news networks. Excluding the drag of approximately 400
basis points from FX, international advertising would have been up in the high single digits, led by solid underlying
growth in Latin America.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, scatter pricing is healthy, pacing up high single digits over the upfront. However,
volume remains relatively modest and we expect ratings to remain a near-term drag on our performance. Taking those
factors into account, we anticipate total advertising to be flat to down low single digits in the third quarter.
Adjusted operating income grew a really strong 15% in the quarter and margins increased over 300 basis points. That
reflects both revenue growth and our continued focus on limiting non-programming expenses, which were down in the
quarter. Programming expenses increased 5%, due to higher sports costs primarily associated with the NCAA
tournament, and that was balanced by lower original programming costs at our domestic entertainment networks, due to
the timing of series premieres.
Looking ahead, we expect costs related to the new Major League Baseball deal and continued aggressive investments
in original programming to result in somewhat higher programming cost growth in the second half of the year. So we
expect full year programming cost growth to be in the high single digits.
To free up resources to invest even more in programming, as well as technology and international expansion, earlier
this year Turner kicked off a global initiative called Turner 20/20. Turner 20/20 is designed to improve efficiency and
maximize performance across the organization and will likely result in restructuring charges in the second half of this
year. This is all consistent with our company-wide strategy to limit non-programming expense growth in order to fund
investments and drive continued margin expansion.
Turner will also be evaluating whether to dispose of certain licensed programming in connection with these
restructuring activities. To the extent that it decides to, we could also incur programming impairments. We will provide
more details on both those fronts in the coming months.
Excluding those potential impacts, we're on track for another year of margin expansion and solid growth at Turner. And
looking beyond 2014, we expect revenue and adjusted operating income growth to accelerate over the next several
years, as we continue to benefit from attractive domestic affiliate rate increases, strong international growth, efficiency
initiatives, and upside from under-monetized opportunities like our global kids business, Adult Swim and truTV.
Turning now to HBO, where we had another very strong quarter, with revenues up 17% and adjusted operating income
up 23%. Subscription revenues increased 10% in the quarter with the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic
contributing around 500 basis points to that growth. Domestically, our subscriber trends remain healthy, and we're
starting to see some improvement in the subscriber mix, which contributed to a modest acceleration in our domestic
subscription revenue growth. Content revenues grew over 50% in the quarter. That increase was due to revenue from
our licensing deal with Amazon, balanced by lower domestic syndication.
Adjusted operating income was up 23% in the second quarter, with margins expanding nearly 200 basis points, and that
obviously benefited from the Amazon deal. Also keep in mind, the prior year's quarter benefited from an adjustment to
a receivable allowance. Absent that, adjusted operating income would have been up over 30%.
Programming expenses increased 11%, with 600 basis points of that growth coming from the international
consolidations. Excluding the consolidations, programming expenses increased 5%, with double digit growth in
original programming tempered by lower acquired theatrical expenses, due to the timing of film availabilities. In
addition, marketing spend increased to support our original programming, and due to the consolidations.
Across HBO's international properties, we posted another quarter of solid growth. Total international revenue,
including unconsolidated JV's, was up double digits, and that was driven by continued subscriber growth, with
international subs up around 15% year-over-year.

Looking ahead, we expect total expense growth, excluding the consolidations, to accelerate somewhat in the back half
of the year. This is due, in part, to the timing of programming, the reinvestment of the Amazon proceeds, and higher
distribution expenses. As we previously discussed, we intend to invest the majority of the Amazon proceeds back into
the business in programming, marketing and technology. As a result, we expect adjusted operating income to be
relatively flat year-over-year in the second half of the year.
Despite that, with our strong first half results and healthy underlying trends, HBO remains on track for solid growth in
2014. And given the strength of its brand and content, and the significant global opportunities we see in front of it, we
think that HBO is poised to accelerate its growth over the next several years.
Moving onto Warner Bros., which reached its highest second quarter profits in a decade, despite tough theatrical
comparisons, Warner's had another very strong quarter underscoring its diverse earning streams. Adjusted operating
income grew 28%, and margins expanded around 200 basis points. That included strong growth in TV and home
entertainment, combined with lower film and distribution costs. Adjusted operating income growth this quarter also
benefited from the reversal of bad debt reserves and lower restructuring charges.
On the TV side, revenues grew mid-single digits. That was related to higher license fees from television production and
international syndication. And as Jeff described earlier, Warner's completed another very successful upfront season so
the outlook for our TV business continues to be very strong.
Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue was up 14% largely due to the timing of the release of the
second Hobbit film, and the strong performance of The LEGO Movie. Digital trends also remain positive with
electronic sell through up close to 70% in the quarter. Consumer spending across the broader home video market was
down modestly in the second quarter, due to declines in rentals and sales of catalog product. However, total sell
through was up in the quarter led by 32% growth in electronic sell through. So we remain encouraged for the continued
digital transition in home entertainment.
Looking ahead to the second half of the year, theatrical comparisons remain challenging, but we expect continued
momentum in TV. We're really well positioned for the new TV season and expect continued growth in TV license fees.
We also expect demand for our content outside of the U.S. to remain healthy.
So given the strong start to the year and positive outlook in the TV business, Warner's remains on pace for another
great year in 2014. And looking beyond 2014, we remain confident in our ability to grow both our TV and theatrical
businesses at very attractive levels as global demand for high-quality video content continues to grow.
Moving to free cash flow where we are also having a great year, we generated nearly $2 billion in free cash flow in the
first half, a 16% increase compared to last year. The year-over-year improvement is primarily due to the strong growth
in adjusted operating income and a favorable swing in working capital. And that was despite increases in cash taxes,
capital expenditures and cash interest.
The improvement in working capital primarily reflects lower participations at Warner Bros. And cash taxes increased
largely due to higher pre-tax income and the expiration of certain favorable tax legislation. Meanwhile, the increase in
cash interest was due to higher debt balances and given the $2 billion of debt we raised during the second quarter, we
expect cash interest to be higher in the second half of the year. So with our solid performance in first half the year,
we're on track for another very strong year of free cash flow cash generation in 2014.
Next, I want to talk about our balance sheet and capital allocation philosophy. We're strong believers that effective
capital allocation can be as important to shareholder returns as strong operating performance and we've been steadfast
in our commitment to maintaining an efficient balance sheet and to prudent capital allocation in order to provide
superior shareholder returns. That strategy's been working and we have no intention of changing it.
Our capital allocation priorities remain first and foremost to maintain a strong balance sheet so that we can fully invest
to drive growth in our businesses. Even so, we generate substantial free cash flow. We have committed a significant
portion of that cash flow to our dividend with the highest payout ratio in the industry. We've grown our dividend
double digits each of the past five years and intend to continue to grow it along with our businesses.

Next, we always look at M&A opportunities as they present themselves. Potential transactions need to provide strategic
benefits with reasonable execution risks and risk-adjusted returns that are more attractive than our alternative uses of
capital. But we have leading scale in our businesses so we don't need to do anything.
Finally, we believe share repurchases remain a very attractive use of capital and intend to continue using them to
complement our dividend. You can see that philosophy at work so far this year. We ended the second quarter with
$18.1 billion of net debt, down about $230 million from the end of 2013. That's largely due to our strong free cash flow
generation, the $1.4 billion in proceeds we received from Time Inc. in connection with the spinoff, and the $1.3 billion
in proceeds from the sale of our space in Time Warner Center. Our net leverage ratio was 2.5 times as of June 30th.
On the M&A front we've invested over $860 million year-to-date. The majority of this came in the second quarter as
we closed our acquisition of Eyeworks' international television operations and completed financing arrangements with
CME. We're optimistic about the long-term opportunities for both and they fit in perfectly with our strategy of
investing selectively in attractive international territories. We also returned close to $3.5 billion to shareholders during
the first half of the year including almost $3 billion in share repurchases. And we believe our stock remains very
attractive at current levels in.
Now onto the final slide, which shows our 2014 outlook. We had a terrific first of the year with all of our divisions
delivering strong results and looking to the back half of the year we expect our underlying revenue trends to remain
solid led by strong affiliate revenue growth at Turner and HBO. At the same time we'll be making significant
programming investments at both Turner and HBO, face difficult theatrical comparisons at Warner's, and anticipate a
negative swing in intersegment eliminations. So as implied by our outlook, that will cause a deceleration in adjusted
EPS growth in the back half of the year.
A few minutes ago, I mentioned that we anticipate incurring restructuring charges and programming impairments in the
second half. In addition, we anticipate a favorable tax settlement over this period. While these items aren't currently
reflected in our outlook, on balance, we expect they will have a net positive impact on adjusted EPS. We'll share more
details on those items as the year progresses.
Putting all that together, we're on track for another year of solid double digit growth in adjusted EPS. As Jeff discussed,
we're confident that we can grow adjusted EPS even faster in the years to come. Demand for the type of high quality
video content that we produce is only increasing and we expect to convert that into continued healthy revenue growth.
At the same time, our efficiency initiatives and strict discipline managing non-programming expenses should result in
further margin expansion, driving strong growth in adjusted operating income. And when you factor in our capital
allocation strategy, we believe we can deliver very attractive adjusted EPS growth for the foreseeable future.
As Jeff noted, we look forward to sharing more of our plans with you at an investor event this fall.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.

Thanks, Howard. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one or two questions, so we can get to as many of you as

<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have two for Jeff.
Jeff, I think over the past few weeks, it was clear that you guys and the board have a strong conviction in the internal
plan of Time Warner. So you've helped us in the past talk about Turner's affiliate fee growth outlook, but I wondered,
from where you sit as an insider, where are the drivers of Time Warner's financials, do you think, underappreciated
from the outside world?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Thanks, Mike. I'm glad you asked. Look, it's a pretty long list, so let me just tick it off.
First of all, I think that global growth in multi-channel TV and in connected devices is fairly strongly increasing the
value of high-quality video content, and that's true all around the world. And we think that, if you look at Time Warner,
HBO, Warner, Turner, all of our brands are very strong global brands. We have global scale that gives us an advantage
in creating the content and also distributing the content. If you go to each company at Turner, we've got very good
visibility the next few years from the domestic affiliate renewal cycle, and so that's a pretty significant contributor to
growth. We also expect to complement that with strong growth internationally, particularly in Latin America. That's
true across Turner and HBO.
And I think people underestimate the opportunity we have, in terms of reinvigorating our key Turner networks and in
capitalizing on the under-monetized opportunities that exist there. I'll just say one. You're going to hear more about it.
Global kids, Turner and Warner's.
HBO. We're seeing really strong increased demand for the services and the content, so both HBO subscription demand,
wherever we take it, and HBO content, wherever we take that. That's true all over the world. I think people
underestimate that.
Warner's is also very well positioned for continued growth with both the film side, a huge pipeline of franchise films,
and there are very strong secular trends in the TV series business, which Warner's is a leader in producing.
So I don't think that there's full appreciation of what we can do there. And this is both film and TV. And if you take just
an example, like DC, which is pumping out so many new shows at Warner this year. And then add to that, as you look
at more and more realized power from DC, consumer products is an area where, frankly, we've underperformed what
we can do and we think that's going to be a real driver going forward.
So, if you take all those together, we're pretty confident that we can deliver very attractive revenue growth and we can
turn that into even faster growth in adjusted OI. And, of course, and I think our record speaks to this, our approach to
capital allocation. If you take increased operating income growth levels, we complement that with a fairly clear plan for
capital allocation, and so we feel comfortable that we can take increased OI growth and turn it into increased EPS
growth. And, remember, last quarter, we said publicly that we expect to deliver EPS growth in the low to mid-teens, if
not better.
You probably notice, I'm emphasizing the phrase "if not better." I'd also like to note that, over the years, we've
consistently over-delivered, and we look forward to sharing more about that and our long-terms plans in the fall.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Jeff, can I ask you just a quick follow up on SVOD? There was a rumor, a report over a
couple weeks ago, that Seinfeld may actually be sold into SVOD. Given the library of content you own and all the
comedies, does this suggest that you and Warner's are rethinking maybe your previous positions on SVOD, or will you
be a bit more aggressive about some of your library content in comedies, especially?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Well, we've had a lot of SVOD revenue, and I'm going to come back to that. But I think the
crux of your question is that the emergence of new players is increasing the value of great content, and we have more
of that than everybody. That's true on the film side. It's true on the TV series side.
It was quite obvious this quarter that, even without the Amazon agreement, our SVOD revenue would have been up
double digits. As we look to the full year, we expect SVOD to grow solid double digits, even without the HBO Amazon
deal, and that growth is obviously even stronger if you include the HBO Amazon agreement. I'd like to point out, since

we mentioned the HBO deal, that Amazon deal doesn't include some of HBO's most valuable content, like Game of
Thrones and True Detective.
Now there's nothing preventing us from monetizing hit shows like those in the future, if we think it makes sense, but
the same thing is true for Warner Bros. We have the biggest library of TV series and films in the world. If you look at
our SVOD revenue, which was quite healthy last year, we had a base, in 2013, of about $400 million. We are going to
be up solid double digits, and by that, I don't mean 10 to 20. I mean more. And I think the opportunity's very, very large
in international territories.
So, it's very clear there's big consumer demand for this content. We think there's an increasingly competitive and strong
set of buyers out there, including Netflix, but including Amazon and some others. And so, we're very confident we will
be able to effectively monetize our content, and we're actually pretty happy with the way we've timed or sequenced the
release of our library, and you're going to be seeing more about that as the years go on.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Michael. Joe, can we have the next question?
Operator
Of course. Yes, sir. Our next question here comes from John Janedis from Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thank you. Howard, can you talk a little bit more about the third quarter guidance for
advertising? Obviously, Jeff talked about the success of some of your originals. How much of the weakness is ratings
versus the ad market, and to what extent are you seeing signs of improvement in underlying demand?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Your question is third quarter advertising?
<Q - John Janedis>: Yes, Jeff.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Okay. So, scatter pricing for entertainment net is pacing up high single digits over the
upfront, but we're just not seeing the volume overall and that's been true, generally speaking. Additionally, the ratings
at our networks do remain a drag. Internationally, we're likely to see continued drag from FX and a modest slowdown
in organic growth, due to a tough comp.
So as I said in my prepared remarks, we think, overall, advertising's going to be flat to down, low single digits.
<Q - John Janedis>: Okay. And maybe on a related topic, Jeff, can you talk more about ratings at Turner? Is the
weakness from new or returning shows, and how much of the programming expense maybe skews to originals versus
licensed, relative to a few years ago?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yeah, okay. So, you've got to deconstruct Turner through the different networks. Let me
kind of break it down. You're asking about all of them, right, and in general?
<Q - John Janedis>: Yes.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Okay. So, let's start with TNT, which we mentioned on the call was number one in a number
of age groups in prime. TBS was basically number three in prime. Adult Swim was still number one, 18 to 34. CNN is
still the best nation for breaking news and leader in mobile.
If you really go from that, into the ratings performance, it's been a little weaker in the acquired programming. Not just
at Turner, but really in all basic cable networks. The originals are doing well. We mentioned on the call that the new
originals we've launched this year are up 20% or more over the season. All of the originals are up 20%. So, it's coming
around.
In 2014, we're ramping up the original programming. I think we've said this publicly. We've been around 20% of its air
time original. We're heading to 40% in the next year. So we're going to still have very strong acquired programming,

but it will be a smaller piece of the schedule. I think I've said, on numerous calls in the past, that our access to acquired
programming is an advantage, even though acquired programming, as a general category, is going a little weaker in,
basically, all GE cable networks.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thank you.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Joe, can we have the next question?
Operator
Of course, our next question here will come from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thanks. Good morning.
Jeff, since you've taken over as CEO, you've gone through shrinking the company down and clearly based on your
prepared remarks, you see a strategic advantage in being a more nimble, focused company. Does that reflect a view that
there is a disadvantage or dis-synergy in size and complexity, and I'm wondering when you look at M&A and
consolidation in the space either as a seller or a buyer, is there a general reluctance at Time Warner or on the board
level to sort of take on large scale M&A because of just the view that it actually hurts the business outlook?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: No, I think you can't make a general statement. I think we've said, and I think it's pretty
clear, we have leading scale in all of our businesses, so we're not subscale. We're not lacking something that we need.
And the next question, it's not that it's ever a bad thing necessarily to add something that would bring either
complementary fill-ins, maybe more scale on a given case, maybe more efficiency and elimination of redundancies.
Those things are all fine. But when you're looking at any particular case, you have to look at what kind of scale are you
adding?
Let's take Time Warner. On the studio side, we're the biggest movie producer and distributor in the world. We're the
biggest producer and distributor of series in the world. We have the biggest supply relations with the American four
broadcast networks of anybody in the world. So, if you take that and you consider combining any number of other
companies that do the same thing, you'd have to ask just on that side, we'll get to networks next. Is it a good idea? Does
it add operating benefits? Or doesn't it? So that's on that.
If you go to the network side, we've got the biggest network group or second to nobody in the world and if you think –
and we've got very strong networks. If you look at the Turner networks, four of them are 85% of our business.
Basically, the Turner networks don't have any weak sisters in the group. If you look at HBO, together with Turner, it's
an extremely strong network group.
If you then say all right, well let's look at other networks around the world. Which ones would improve the operating
capabilities or the leverage or the programming capability or the distribution and marketing capability of that already
strong group of networks? You can make cases depending on the hypothetical of which networks would help. You can
also look at networks that aren't so strong that would not help. So, you basically look at it that way.
When anybody – and if you take a big combination, and I'm not speaking of any particular one, there are always a
number of issues. There are benefits and there are risks to making any kind of combination like that. There's also the
factor of business interruption, regulatory scrutiny and timing that comes into play.
So, I would just encourage everybody because you're all looking at these kinds of things in more than one case, to look
at all sides of the issue when you're contemplating the benefits and the risks of putting very large companies together.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: If I could just ask a follow up. You talked about at least low to mid or better. One tool
you have is the balance sheet, and maybe Howard, you'd want to comment – I know it's an imperative keep a strong
balance sheet. Are you committed to investment grade? I think the answer is yes, and how high could you go and keep
that kind of rating? Any comments on whether you guy would be more aggressive? I realize you've raised it in the past.

<A - Howard M. Averill>: When setting our target we've had a very consistent and very balanced approach. We've
been very straightforward. First of all, we want to maintain the strong balance sheet that provides us the ability to fully
invest in our business. We want to make sure we do have flexibility to engage in strategic M&A that presents itself, and
it's really important that we continue to have access to capital markets across whatever is happening in the economy.
At the same time we really are trying to optimize our cost of capital to drive equity returns, so as you know, we
incorporate a number of factors into that analysis, including discussions, ongoing discussions with the rating agencies.
You know we raised our leverage to 2.75 times earlier this year, and that was to reflect an increased stability of our
cash flow based on the Time Inc. spin. We're always evaluating these factors, but right now we feel like 2.75 times
does strike the right balance among all of those.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Joe, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Of course, yes, our next question will come from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Thank you, good morning.
I have a couple on HBO. Jeff, I wonder if you could share the feedback from HBO's distributors and their reaction to
the Amazon deal? The reason I'm asking is, several years ago, STARZ damaged its relationship severely with
distributors when they were relicensing to Netflix. I was wondering what made the difference for you?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Okay, look. Thank you. That's a great point.
I think the difference a few years ago, what STARZ did was they sold their service as a subscription service at a lower
price direct, undercutting their own affiliates who were their partners. It was literally the same service. The HBO deal is
selling programming that's very classic HBO hits that are about three years old to Amazon, where Amazon is
distributing that to a lot of viewers and households that don't have HBO.
So from the point of view of Amazon, it's a fantastic product offering. From the point of view of our cable and satellite
and telco distributors, it's a fantastic thing because you have the resources and marketing of Amazon to a sub base that
frankly, our distributors didn't have as much penetration as they would like. So that's a great kind of partnership for our
cable and Sat [satellite] distributors from the Amazon – which Amazon is a very powerful retailer. It's great to bring
them into harmony with our cable and electronic distributors.
Therefore, the distributors have really approved of the deal. It's actually given everybody a new enthusiasm, and
particularly our underperforming affiliates on marketing more HBO and realizing that they can do much better, huge
profit for them. If they add variable subs there's no real costs on their side and so what we're seeing is essentially a
regeneration of really the upside of what distributors realize they can do with HBO.
Remember that one of the things that isn't in the Amazon offer, which our distributors do have and it tends to get
overlooked by everyone because it's "not new". HBO's got the strongest lineup of Hollywood movies of any
subscription VOD service in the world. They are current, they are new, they're powerful. That's where you get them.
HBO also has a very well recognized original programming slate that's at the top of its game. Both of those are
important and that's going to mean a big marketing push in our cable, Sat, telco distributors this fall, to regenerate
subscriber growth all over the HBO footprint.
So, what you really have is Amazon and the retail industry working together with the cable electronic, Sat Co industry
to bring subscription premium TV in its best form to all people in the United States. You can see us doing similar
things overseas, Scandinavia is the current vibrant case and, of course, HBO with its VOD offering in UK, Germany,
Italy, Australia, in partnership with Sky in a number of those territories, another powerful offering for consumers. I
think it's really a period of tremendous upside for HBO.

<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Thank you. And a quick follow up. So clearly HBO is at the very height of the creative
cycle. Can you help us understand or map out, what would be the sequence of events that would allow to translate that
into possibly acceleration in subscription revenue in the U.S.? Is it renegotiating contracts or how does it work? Thank
you.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yeah, thank you. It's a good question. I think what you're really saying is, what can we do to
improve the mix, because you see some vibrant HBO sub growth domestically, 2 million subs that we just reported,
even stronger overseas but on the domestic side, we're constantly working with affiliates to figure out how can we
better market and position the networks among our better-performing affiliates? Because some of them are up in the
penetration areas that are quite inspiring for everybody, but we've given them incentives to do that and we need to work
together with them to share the economics of that.
If you then go to the less penetrated affiliates, who are frankly missing a very important net operating contribution that
they should have, and it should provide sufficient incentive. We're working hard to market with them in order to get
them to be more effective in their distribution of our product. That's all part of the renewal cycle over the next couple of
years. We're going to turn over all of the deals or most of the deals at HBO. We think that we've got the right mix of
incentives and consequences to drive better net performance and I don't say that in a way that would leave out profit
gains for all our affiliates including the less-performing ones, but it certainly includes increased contributions to us.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Vasily. Joe, can we have the next question.
Operator
Of course, our next question here comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Richard S. Greenfield>: Hi, couple questions. First off, just in light of the A&E and Disney OTT linear deals we
saw A&E yesterday, curious how you think of single and multi-stream offerings. Disney and A&E seem to have taken
pretty different approaches in terms of single versus multi, and wanted your perspective on either.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Thanks, Rich. We're certainly open to opportunities to grow our business and we're not
philosophically opposed to an over the top virtual MVPD model. We've said that before. We just have to believe that it
will be additive to the total situation that we've got rather than subtractive, so in the two that you mentioned, there's still
a lot of questions in terms of the ad model, the quality of service, how it would impact investment in the plant?
But take the DISH streaming service. It's a concept we're interested in because of the way that it is designed very much
targets incremental subs and at a price point that would be attractive to younger people, particularly.
A similar one would be Comcast selling HBO in a lightweight TV package which allows you to target a group of
consumers that might not otherwise not subscribe to the multi-channel TV package and that could be a great entree into
the ecosystem for younger consumers who would then trade up over time.
To your point on the Disney and A&E approaches, the parameters of the offering are important to make sure that it's
incremental so the number of streams as you're, I think asking, is an important consideration. So we're not going to set
a rule on a finance call about how we're doing it but I think that the Disney approach is kind of directionally the right
philosophical approach.
<Q - Richard S. Greenfield>: Just following up on that. We believe that part of why Rupert was so interested in
acquiring Time Warner was, he saw this as a way to launch an everything Fox. Basically everything Fox including
Warner Bros and Time Warner consumer offering. Could you do the same on your own? Do you look at Turner and
HBO as something you could offer directly to consumers as a package? I guess why or why not?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Well, yeah, we could and let me just say what we are doing. At HBO, we're investing in top
talent including a large team of software developers in Seattle that are working on HBO. And as I think as you've been
among several reviewers who have said, I think you're right, that's a very good product. It's a very good consumer

experience. So, what we're doing there is we're trying to be best in class to have a platform that could not only deliver
HBO networks but also Turner network and frankly other networks, doesn't have to just be ones that we own.
I think it's important for everybody in thinking about that to ask themselves, should offerings be determined for
consumers based on what a company owns? That's not how consumers would program their dial and I think one should
always look at what consumers want to do and harness those platforms that keep in mind exactly the range of product
that consumers want. We think that we can have that for our HBO, Turner and Warner product, but we're anticipating
that people will want more than that.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Rich. Joe, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
And, yes, our next question here will come from Doug Creutz from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug L. Creutz>: Yeah, thanks. You guys have talked about some of the ratings challenges you've faced
recently, but more broadly, it seems like ratings in the second quarter were pretty weak across the board. Do you think
there's anything bigger going on there, or is this just kind of normal variability in TV viewing? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Thanks, Doug. Well, let me note, I think you're generally right. Ratings were kind of weak
across the dial, the TV dial. Broadcast finished down 3%. Ad-supported cable was down 4%. Some did a little better,
some did a little worse. But, essentially, viewing was stable, but a little on the weak side across the TV dial.
That, however, is before online viewing is fully captured and it isn't really being measured. And it's not that big, but it's
significant, to some extent, at the margin. And even though it's not being measured, a decent amount of it is being
monetized.
So, the issue is a little bit overblown. If you're asking, do we think there's a secular trend in lower audience viewing
across the TV dial? We would say, no.
<Q - Doug L. Creutz>: Great, thanks.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Doug, and thanks everybody for joining us today. If you have any questions,
please follow up. We'll be around. Thank you.
