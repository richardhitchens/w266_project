Thank you, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter with
earnings per share up 13%, primarily driven by growth in our interactive Consumer Products and Parks and Resorts
businesses. Our net income for the quarter also grew by 12% on strong revenue growth of 7%. I'm also happy to report
that in fiscal 2013 Disney delivered record revenue, net income and EPS for the third year in a row.
We're also making two other important announcements today. One is that we have set an official release date for Star
Wars: Episode VII, December 18, 2015. This obviously is one of the most important movies we have in the next few
years and we've chosen a date we believe will allow the creative team the time to make a great film. It's also the date
Avatar opened in 2009.
The second announcement is our unprecedented deal to create multiple live-action series and a miniseries event
exclusively for Netflix beginning in 2015. Under the agreement, Marvel TV in association with ABC Television
Studios will develop four serialized programs featuring some of Marvel's popular characters: Daredevil, Jessica Jones,
Iron Fist and Luke Cage. This original programming will run over multiple years and lead to a Marvel's The Defenders
miniseries event that re-imagines the dream team of heroic characters.
Both of today's announcements underscore the value of two of our major acquisitions: Marvel and Lucasfilm. As you
know, over the last several years, we have made a number of major acquisitions and capital investments to drive
growth and create shareholder value. Now that some of those investments have been completed and the acquisitions are
fully integrated, their positive impact is clear in our results especially in Parks and Resorts.
In its first full year of operations since we opened Cars Land and completed the transformation of Disney's California
Adventure, the Disneyland Resort delivered record attendance, revenue and profitability. Walt Disney World also set
new attendance records for the year driven, in part, by our historic expansion of Fantasyland, which will be completed
in 2014. We're beginning construction on an Avatar themed area in Disney's Animal Kingdom and continue our
progress toward the full rollout of MyMagic+. International attendance in our domestic parks also set an all-time high
in fiscal 2013.
Internationally, Tokyo Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland also had record attendance this year. We recently
announced that Hong Kong will be home to our first Marvel themed attraction when the Iron Man Experience opens in
late 2016. And last month, construction on our Shanghai resort officially went vertical. It was a major milestone and we
are on track to open the gates of that spectacular resort just two years from now at the end of 2015.
Turning to our Media Networks group, ESPN has been the brand in sports for almost 35 years. More than 100 million
sports fans connect with ESPN every week for incredible sports contact – content rather, and that connection is strong.
The average fan spends about seven hours a week interacting with ESPN. That's more than 35,000 hours of sports
programming every year, major long-term sports rights locked up for the next decade and unparalleled brand strength,
we remain confident in ESPN's value and continued reign as the leader in sports.
In broadcast, we're encouraged by ABC's start this season. In non-sports programming, ABC is currently a very close
second in both C3 and L7 ratings. The network has some of TV's most DVR-ed shows as well as the number one new
show, Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the fastest-growing returning series, Scandal. The perennial leader among
upscale audiences this season, ABC once again leads the other networks in this prized demo by double digits. It's also
the only broadcast network to see its audience get younger.
We've also successfully sold ABC studio shows including S.H.I.E.L.D., Scandal, Revenge and Grey's Anatomy into
more than 100 markets around the world. We continue to generate tremendous value from original Disney content as
well especially in kids' television businesses. All 10 of the top 10 series for kids 6 to 11 in Q4 were Disney Channel
shows and the channel has been number one among that demo as well as with tweens 9 to 14 for 125 consecutive
weeks. Disney Junior is another fantastic success story. Although we just launched the standalone channel here in the
U.S. 19 months ago, it's been the number one pre-school channel among kids two to five every single week since
Nielsen began reporting its ratings back in April.
The success of franchises like Sofia the First, Jake and the Never Land Pirates and Doc McStuffins have made Disney
Junior an important growth driver for our merchandise licensing business. Retail sales for Disney Junior products

exceeded $1.8 billion in fiscal 2013, more than double the year before. And going into the critical holiday season,
Disney Junior toys are prominently featured on the retailer's hot toy lists and our top four retail partners are planning to
double Disney Junior shelf space compared to last year.
Retailers are also excited about Disney Infinity this holiday season and so are we. We've already sold more than a
million starter packs globally and the individual figures are also doing extremely well with the most popular ones
selling out at major retailers in a matter of days. This successful launch drove Disney Interactive swing to profitability
in Q4 and all indications suggest the strong demand for Disney Infinity will continue.
Turning now to our studio business with phenomenal global success of Marvel's The Avengers and Iron Man 3, Marvel
Studios became the first studio in history to release two $1 billion movies in a row. That gives us some incredible
momentum going into our next Marvel release, Thor: The Dark World which has already opened strong in a number of
international markets and we're confident that Thor will do very well when it opens here tonight. We plan to keep the
streak of great Marvel movies going with Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of Galaxy next year,
and with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on small screens around the world, a new Iron Man attraction headed to Hong Kong
and the Netflix deal we announced today, it's clear our integration of Marvel across our company has been incredibly
successful.
Disney Animation's phenomenal creative resurgence continues with Frozen, a new animated musical in the spirit of
Tangled and the great animated films throughout Disney's history. Great storytelling, fantastic music and world-class
animation, Frozen will join the ranks of beloved Disney characters when it opens at Thanksgiving. Then we'll end the
year with Saving Mr. Banks, a great story starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson as Walt Disney and Mary Poppins
author P.L. Travers. Next year, in addition to the two Marvel movies I mentioned, we're also looking forward to a new
Muppet Caper and Angelina Jolie as Maleficent. And, of course, we've got some huge movies in calendar 2015 with
Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron and Star Wars: Episode VII as well as Pixar's Inside Out and The Good
Dinosaur.
We're obviously pleased with our performance in fiscal 2013 across The Walt Disney Company. From both the creative
and financial standpoint, we're well-positioned for continued growth in 2014. And with a slate of blockbuster movies I
just mentioned as well as the opening of Shanghai Disneyland, we're even more excited about what's ahead in 2015 and
beyond.
And now I'm going to turn the call over to Jay for the financial details.
Jay Rasulo
Thank you, Bob. And good afternoon, everyone. Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.77, an increase of
13% over last year. We are very pleased with our results this quarter, which capped yet another year of strong financial
performance. Our fourth quarter and record full year results only again demonstrate the significant benefits we derive
from the way we manage the company, which includes aggressively investing in our core businesses, extending our
portfolio through prudent M&A and returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders.
Operating income at Media Networks was down in the quarter as a result at cable were adversely impacted by the
timing of affiliate revenue recognition at ESPN. Broadcasting results were down versus last year. This quarter ESPN
recognized $172 million less in previous deferred affiliate revenue than it recognized in the fourth quarter of last year.
As a reminder, this issue does not affect full year results. Absent this impact, both cable revenue and operating income
would have been up 6% compared to last year driven by higher operating income at ESPN and the domestic Disney
Channels. Excluding the impact of the revenue deferral, ESPN's operating income would have been up in the quarter
due to higher affiliate revenue and increased advertising revenue partially offset by a modest increase in programming
costs for college football, the NFL and Major League Baseball.
Reported cable affiliate revenue was down 3% in the quarter. This decrease was due to the impact of ESPN's revenue
deferral, business model changes including the sale of the ESPN U.K. business as well as FX. Absent these impacts,

cable affiliate revenue would have been up high-single digits. For the full year, cable affiliate revenue was up 6% on a
reported basis and would have been up high-single digits absent these impacts.
Ad revenue at ESPN was up a solid 9% in the quarter due to an increase in units sold at higher rates. ESPN's ratings
were up year-over-year driven by college football, Major League Baseball and the NFL. So far this quarter, ESPN's
cash ad sales are pacing up nicely. At Broadcasting, operating income was down in the quarter due to difficult comps in
program sales and higher primetime programming costs, which were partially offset by higher ad revenue at the ABC
Network.
At the Network, programming costs were higher in the quarter because we aired more hours of scripted programming
compared to last year, when some primetime hours were dedicated to coverage of the presidential election. Ad revenue
at the Network was up 10% in the quarter as a result of increase in units sold at higher rates and growth in online sales,
partially offset by lower ratings and the Emmy's rotating from ABC to CBS this year. Quarter-to-date scatter pricing at
the ABC Network is running more than 20% above upfront levels.
Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered yet another solid quarter of performance. Revenue for the quarter was up 8%
and operating income was up a solid 15% on the back of continued growth at our domestic parks and resorts and
vacation club sales at the Grand Floridian. Results at Disneyland Paris were lower in the quarter. Higher operating
income at our domestic parks and resorts was primarily due to increased guest spending, higher attendance and
occupied room nights at Walt Disney World and an increase in guest spending at the Disneyland Resort, partially offset
by higher costs, including ongoing spending for growth initiatives. For the quarter, attendance at our domestic parks
was comparable to prior year. An increase in attendance at Walt Disney World was offset by a decrease at the
Disneyland Resort, given the comparison to last year when there was a surge in attendance around the opening of Cars
Land.
Domestic per capita spending was up an impressive 9% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending.
Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 4% compared to prior year, and occupancy in the quarter
was comparable to prior year despite an increase in available room nights. So far this quarter, domestic resorts
reservations are comparable to prior year levels, while booked rates are up 5% versus prior year.
We continue to enjoy steady margin improvement as the base business grows and margins begin to reflect the benefit
of recent investments. Total reported Parks and Resorts segment margins were up 90 basis points in the fourth quarter
compared to the prior year. The year-over-year change in Q4 margins was on top of an adverse impact of an estimated
90 basis points due to spending on growth initiatives. For the year, margins were up 110 basis points and that was on
top of an adverse impact of 30 basis points due to growth initiatives.
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was up due to better worldwide theatrical performance and higher TV
distribution results, which were partially offset by higher film cost write-downs and lower operating income from
worldwide home entertainment. Theatrical results improved in the quarter due to strong performance of Monsters
University compared to Brave in the same period last year. Film impairments were higher in the quarter reflecting the
impact of our write-down of The Lone Ranger. During the quarter, we released Iron Man 3 on DVD, and while we're
pleased with its performance, worldwide home entertainment results were down due to a difficult comparison with the
release of The Avengers DVD in Q4 last year.
At Consumer Products, growth in operating income was primarily due to gains in Merchandise Licensing. Results were
due to strong demand for a number of our key properties including Planes, Monsters University and Disney Junior. The
increase in licensing this quarter also reflects the inclusion of Star Wars results. Earned licensing revenue was up an
impressive 9% in the quarter, and that's on a comparable basis so it excludes the impact of Star Wars.
At the Interactive segment, operating income was up significantly in the quarter due to the successful launch of Infinity.
Segment results swung from an operating loss in the fourth quarter last year to an operating profit this year. As Bob
said, the next test for Infinity will come this holiday season, but we feel good about its prospects based on sales so far
and the feedback we've gotten from retailers, consumers and hard-core gamers.

During the fourth quarter, we significantly increased our pace of share repurchase by buying 21.8 million shares for
about $1.4 billion. And for fiscal 2013, we repurchased 71.3 million shares for $4.1 billion. We remain committed to
returning capital to our shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. We believe our shares are very attractive at
these levels, and as we've said, we expect to repurchase between $6 billion and $8 billion in stock during fiscal 2014.
So far this year, we've repurchased 15.1 million shares for about $1 billion.
We feel very good about how we're positioned for fiscal 2014 given the underlying trends we're seeing in our business.
Before I conclude, let me proactively address a couple of questions you may have about 2014. We expect total
consolidated CapEx in 2014 to be about $1 billion higher than in 2013 with the increase primarily due to increased
investment in Shanghai Disney Resort. As we've discussed in the past, capital spending for the Shanghai project will
ramp meaningfully in 2014 and 2015 as we prepare for the resort's opening in late 2015. While we fully consolidate all
of Shanghai's CapEx, our net contribution is only 43% of the total CapEx, thus our CapEx will be up approximately
$600 million. Domestic parks CapEx is expected to be essentially flat compared to 2013.
Pension expense is expected to decline in 2014 due to an increase in the discount rate. The lower pension expense will
be partially offset by expected adverse impacts from foreign exchange rates, primarily due to a decline in the value of
the Japanese yen. We expect the net impact of these two items to result in a benefit of about $150 million for the year.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A.
Lowell Singer
Jay, thank you and, operator, we're ready for the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes
from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Alexia, please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you. Just two quick questions. First, just curious why you chose to put the Marvel
movies on the Netflix rather than one of your own platforms like ABC or ABC Family?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, we are already producing Marvel shows for our networks. ABC has S.H.I.E.L.D. and is
developing another concept and we have shows on Disney XD. And when we look forward, we realize that there were
just so many Marvel shows we thought we could actually fit on to those platforms. So we looked at other opportunities.
There was a lot of interest from a variety of different distributors, new and traditional platforms and ultimately Netflix
won out.
They are in the business of creating original programming already. Obviously, House of Cards is a great example of
that and we saw a scenario where they were only going to continue to buy more original programming and this seemed
like a good opportunity for us to provide them with some branded product that they haven't had access to except for the
programming they get off-channel; in other words, after it's aired. So good opportunity we thought for them and a great
opportunity for us.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: And just a follow-up question on the domestic part. Because I think in the past, you've
called out some incremental expense that we may see in different initiatives. I guess is there something incremental we
should look out for in fiscal 2014? Where are you on the spending around Magic+? And then on Magic+ when we
might see some signs or data points of how it's impacting the business?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Alexia, let me take the back-end of your question first on MyMagic+. So the situation we're in right
now is that we basically are continuing to roll forward with making this benefit available to more and more of our

guests and at this point, if you're staying on property at one of our hotels you're basically a beneficiary of MyMagic+.
And we've talked about the benefits in two basic categories in terms of the financials of the company.
The first, as it greatly improves the experience at Walt Disney World, we expect that as we have with everything else
we've done to improve the experience at our parks, to have an underlying increase in business whether that's more
individuals coming to the resort every year or those individuals who come down to Orlando spending more time with
us and having a better time. That tends to reverberate throughout our business in a very positive way. And then easing
some of the, let's say, logistics of getting around the property, paying for things, entering the parks, getting in and out
of the resort hotels. When you make that easier, people tend to spend more time on entertainment and more time on
consumables be that food and beverage, merchandise, et cetera. So as we are still very much in the early days of
rollout, we haven't been characterizing that impact but we do expect this to be a net positive and growingly positive
impact on our business in the years to come.
Relative to the front-end of your question on spending – continued spending and ramp-up of new initiatives in Florida,
and that's not only MyMagic+, which the operating portion, of course, the costs are kicking in and we're now seeing as
we put the assets in place some of the depreciation that comes with that project being reflected in our expenses. But if
you look at it on an overall basis, those new initiatives are accretive – were accretive in 2013, will continue to be
accretive in 2014. I said in my comments that the margin impact of that in fiscal 2013 was about 30 basis points on our
overall margins. And this year, we are looking at about a $300 million expense item and more or less the same amount
on the revenue side. So we'll continue to see accretion into 2014 and ramping upward beyond that.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you very much.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: You're welcome.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Moffett. Michael, please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Thanks. I have two for Jay. One on CapEx and one on housekeeping. Jay, on
CapEx, we had thought – you just said MyMagic+ starts becoming an operating expense asset. I know you've been
through building new hotels and building new attractions. So with the CapEx and domestic business staying at the same
level, what are you guys now spending it on? So we thought it would ramp down a bit this year. So is there anything
new project-wise that you guys have not announced yet that will be coming out?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Yeah, we're – Michael, we are in the process of finishing up the Fantasyland expansion, not quite
done. Of course, we've got the underlying CapEx that both maintains and adds quality to our existing assets. And we're
beginning, as we've discussed, to expend some capital on Avatar. And I want to reinforce for all of you that we've
talked in shorthand frankly about Avatar and Avatar Land at Disney's Animal Kingdom, but for purposes of thinking
about the economic benefit of this project, you really have to think of Avatar Land the way we discussed Cars Land in
shorthand, that is, that Cars Land was part of an overall of re-concepting and redelivery of Disney's California
Adventure, which had park-wide benefit in terms of volume and length of stay, et cetera.
Avatar Land is playing a similar role in Disney's Animal Kingdom as we are converting that park into a full day
experience that goes into the evening and expect to have impacts on the overall volume and length of stay at that park
as well. So we've begun to expend capital on that, both aspects of the specifics of Avatar Land as well as converting the
Animal Kingdom to the point where it can be an evening experience as well as daytime. So the combination of those
factors is basically keeping our domestic CapEx equal to what it was last year.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Okay. And then just on housekeeping, I know you called out the impact on FX and
ESPN U.K. change for the quarter and for the year. ESPN gets changed, I know. But at what point do you think the
international affiliate fee growth will start to become less of a drag for you guys? Because I know just earlier you report

one number, affiliate fees. At what point do you think it's going to be less of a drag internationally?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Well, let me hasten to add that the business model change on the ESPN U.K. decision, i.e., to exit
that business and therefore receive less affiliate fees was accompanied by more than a cost savings for that business.
And, therefore, that was a net positive on an OI basis, even though it was a negative on international affiliate fees.
And, secondly, we've moved to a free-to-air format or are moving to a free-to-air format in Germany, which has also
depressed what were formally recognized as affiliate fees and will now be realized in the form of advertising, and more
importantly in the biggest and wealthiest country in Europe as a brand lifter as the Disney Channel has been all over the
world as it will be much, much more broadly distributed free-to-air than it had been in a relatively small cable channel
or with a partner.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: You're welcome, Michael.

Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank. Doug, please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. So, Jay, not to harp too much on the park CapEx, but I believe this time last
year you said that the CapEx-driven growth initiatives would be breakeven overall in fiscal 2013 but would start to
drive profitability in 2014 and ultimately achieve double-digit returns. And earlier in the call you indicated that it
turned out there was some profitability in fiscal 2013, but wouldn't improve in fiscal 2014? So I'm just curious what
changed from where we were a year ago and then has the return on investment profile of the growth initiatives changed
at all in your mind?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: I think if you look at – so we said things would be breakeven in fiscal 2013. They were actually a
little more accretive than we originally thought at the beginning of the year and they continued to grow in their
contribution on the revenue side. But as you can imagine with a project like MyMagic+ which had a very heavy IT
investment which depreciates on a much more rapid basis than the normal assets we put into place in World, we did
expect the cost side to bump up even though the revenue side from the new initiatives continues to grow. And it really
hasn't changed at all our perspective on the returns that we expect either individually on any of these projects or in total
for the new investment we're putting in to the division.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: And then one for Bob. It seems like there's a bit of an arms race in terms of theme parks with
both you and Universal building out more attractions and hotels. Universal obviously now with the backing of Comcast
is investing much more aggressively. Do you think there's room in the marketplace for both of you with all of the
investments that you're both putting in place?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Yes, I do. I think that they've been investing over the years. Universal expanded before
Comcast owned them. Harry Potter actually was started well before Comcast owned them. So do I think that they're
going to ramp up substantially? I think the jury is still out. We'll see just how much they're willing to invest and what
kind of creativity they have to invest in. But there's room in the marketplace, sure.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please?

<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thank you. A couple questions. I guess starting with China. As you march towards the
Shanghai opening in late 2015, can you talk about how you're going to build the Disney brand between now and then?
And maybe once it opens, what do you think the halo effect will be on your overall business there?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, we've been building the Disney brand over the years, Jessica, and we're going to continue
to. We've had continued growth or presence on television platforms. Although because of restrictions, that is limited.
We've grown nicely in the mobile space and online and we continue to grow at retail. Plus we've had some real success
with some of our feature films there, particularly as we've seen screens grow, or the number of screens grow,
tremendously in China.
A lot of the activity though between now and when the park opens will be to grow the theme park brand to make sure
that not only do people know that it's coming, but to give them a better appreciation for what will be in it, which we've
not yet announced. But you can expect a lot of kind of making of kind of programming and things that are done in the
marketplace that track what attractions will be in the park itself.
So if we have a themed attraction based on, say, a certain movie, then it's likely that you'll see, or the Chinese will see
that movie in the marketplace in a variety of different ways would be one example so they can better appreciate the
story. We're also opening or developing our first big store in China, and that is actually in Shanghai, which will be used
before it opens as sort of a quasi-visitors' center to let people know more about the park itself. And it is in one of the
highest traffic areas in Shanghai just at the foot of the TV Tower.
Once the park opens, we actually believe that we'll have a significant halo effect on the brand. There'll be a lot more
interest in and appreciation of Disney stories and characters and we intend to explore all different avenues to take
advantage of that. But we're right now focused mostly on building a great park and making sure that it is appropriately
marketed so that people, when they go, can really appreciate the experience better.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thank you. And then the second question just completely different. But I was wondering if
you could comment about what's going on with DISH? I mean, is there something really different this time in terms of
rights? Re-trans is maybe one issue but things like the Hopper. Can you just talk us through what the key issues are, or
in any negotiation, because it does seem to be taking longer than normal.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Well, first of all, we've had a productive negotiation and so progress is being made. There are
still issues to be resolved and they could take some time, but as long as we're making progress, we're perfectly patient
to see this thing through and avoid a blackout sorts of our channels, which we'd like to do. You're right to suggest that
this is complicated, because these deals have gone well beyond just how many subs they're going to provide and what
fees they're going to pay us.
Technology is creating a lot of complexity in terms of what we're selling to them, in effect what they're buying and
ultimately what they can do with the product that we're making available. And we want to make sure that we are
open-minded and modern in our approach to recognize all the different changes in the marketplace that enable
consumers to have better access to our product but at the same time we intend to be steadfast in our desire or in our
strategy to protect the value of our intellectual property. And so it's just complicated. And right now, the negotiation is
more about issues related to technology than related to the more standard issues of basically sub fees and distribution.

Our next question comes from Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein. Todd, please go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Hi, thanks. Two. One that picks right up where we just left off. So you get such intense scrutiny
obviously on affiliate fees in particular with regards to ESPN. So you just said how complicated it is. I'm trying to
identify any other degrees of variability going forward. It seems like your message is that the normalized growth rate at

least this past year has been high singles of affiliate fees. We've talked a little bit about the international business
change about some renewals that could have an effect on that rate. Are there any other big material puts and calls that
we should be thinking about and one that comes to mind is the WATCH apps and whether they could influence that
track rate?
And then the second housekeeping call similar on Consumer Products. Thanks for giving us the number ex-Lucasfilm
for the quarter. Just looking into next year, we've got the Lucasfilm going on but then you also – you're absent a Pixar
movie. So just any help you can give in terms of how we should think about the puts and takes on the growth of that
business with those two ins and outs? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: On the ESPN front, I think that you're likely to see nothing particularly dramatic to change the
trajectory of growth of ESPN over the next five years or so, partially because a lot of our distribution deals are done as
are a lot of our licensing deals for sports rights. We have seen across all of our Media Networks tremendous adoption
of our WATCH apps and significant usage of those apps.
And in the deals that we're cutting with distributors, we're getting paid so that they can provide access to their subs for
mobility or for the WATCH apps. In other words, TV Everywhere is something that actually is adding to our
subscription revenue because they're making it available to their customers and it is a rather compelling product
because suddenly as you know, Todd, the customer is no longer basically confined to just having watch the
multi-channel service in the home. They can really watch it everywhere.
The number of subs that will have the service and in effect the growth in sub fees from it is only going to continue as
we cut more deals with distributors. The other thing that's going to occur is at some point presumably in around the
year we're going to start getting consumption measurements from Nielsen on these apps and that will allow them to
generate more advertising revenue than they're generating today. I can't quantify for you what that may be but I think it
is safe to assume that at some point in 12 months or so, we'll start seeing even more growth in advertising revenue from
Disney, ABC and ESPN mobile consumption. And that could be an interesting growth or create an interesting growth
spurt for us in revenue.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: On the second half of your question, Todd, let me give you some sense of what we're excited about
for DCP licensing in the coming year. First of all, just as a matter of fact, we'll have three quarters of Lucas in the
numbers as opposed to this year we'll have all four quarters versus three quarters. But if you think about the kinds of
properties we will have in the market from the – on the theatrical side, first of all, Spiderman will benefit from the Q3
2014 release of it. That's like in May. And we historically and very much expect to see a lift in our license revenue
there.
For the slightly younger audience, I think, we'll see both the DVD release and in Q4 the second film release of Planes.
And Planes has turned out to be an incredible juggernaut on the DCP side with licensed merchandise, because it not
only has its own following and its own characters and its own new merchandise that it adds to the market, but because
it's from the world of cars, it tends to reinvigorate the interest in those characters as well, and that should fare us very
well in 2014.
And for our youngest audience, the Disney Junior properties are absolutely on fire. Bob referred to the ratings and the
strength of Disney Junior, and whether it's Sofia, Doc McStuffins, Minnie or Jake and the Never Land Pirates, they are
experiencing double-digit growth right now on the licensing side, and we expect that to continue as those franchises are
still all relatively new and all very much in the growth stage with the marketplace. If you went out this year for
Halloween, you bumped into a lot of little doctors and a lot of little pirates, and guess what? That's where kids' interests
are and, therefore, their parents' purchases are.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Very helpful. Thank you, both.

Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne, Agee. Vasily, please go ahead.
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Thank you. Good afternoon. I have a question on the income and the earnings of investees
– equity and the income of investees, sorry, for cable. If I am doing my math right, it seems to be – there seems to be a
material deceleration quarter-on-quarter and the year-on-year. So I was wondering what the nature of that is and how
representative that will be of the run rate in fiscal 2014?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: A little bit – thanks, Vasily, for that question. A little bit unusual for A&E where a lot of our
income of investees comes from. A&E had a big investment period in the fourth quarter. I do not see that as typical. If
you look at the full year impact of the contribution from A&E, it's strong. It's been growing. We expect it to be strong
into the future, and I would see Q4 more as an aberration. And that is what is driving what you see in those numbers.
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: You're welcome.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thanks, Vasily. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital IQ. Tuna, please go ahead.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Thanks a lot. So I guess my first question, Bob, can you explain what your television station,
there's been some reports about potentially selling that, which I was surprised about given all the talk about
retransmission. Is there any scenario where that doesn't become a strategic asset for ABC? And separately, from your
earlier comments regarding the mobile initiatives at ESPN, I was trying to get your thoughts on the monetization of C7
ratings. It almost seems to become a moot point for ESPN given, a, the live viewing of the sports programming and
also; b, your integrated multi-platform sales.
So I'm just wondering if some of your peers have talked about C7 coming to fruition perhaps as early as next year. Do
you feel like you're less invested at ESPN on that, and perhaps going to diverge ABC given your comments that ABC
seems to be getting a lot of ratings uplift on the extended viewing? So I'm just kind of trying to put together your
strategy there for C7. Is there going to be a divergence versus ESPN and ABC, if that makes sense?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: Yeah, that makes sense. You're right because most of ESPN's viewing is live. We don't expect
much of a lift from a ratings or a revenue perspective for either C3 or C7 for ESPN. By the way, on the C7 side, while
there's been some, I guess, a couple of deals done on C7, we'd certainly like to see more because there's significant
consumption beyond C3. I'm not sure that's going to happen very quickly. You mentioned a year; that sounds
aggressive to me. I don't think the advertising marketplace is going to move that fast.
On the first question, we haven't commented about the stations so what you're reading was complete speculation from, I
can't remember, whether it was the press or the investment community but neither one necessarily reflect the opinion or
the attitudes of this company. These have been good assets for us. They've been run extremely well. They're number
one in most of the markets. We only have eight, by the way, and I think as long as we're in the network business we'll
be in the station business. We don't comment about acquisitions or divestitures but I don't think it would be wise to
either predict or to conclude that these assets were on the market.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

<Q - Barton Crockett>: Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I was interested in a little bit more on the
Netflix-Marvel deal. Do you see this as a platform putting shows on Netflix that could drive enough viewership that it
actually could help make these bigger brands from a licensed merchandise perspective and in other ways?
<A - Robert A. Iger>: I do. I think that's a good question. Marvel has thousands of characters and it would not have
been possible, it is not possible, to mime them all with filmed entertainment. And, in fact, while these characters are
attractive characters, they're not among the most popular and they're characters that we probably were never going to
make feature films about. Although if they're popular on Netflix, it's quite possible they could become feature films. So
I think that there are a number of ways for Marvel to create more value opportunities or value-generating opportunities,
and this is one of them.
And it also, as I mentioned earlier, it happens to be great for Netflix. They're looking to make more original
programming, it's branded, there's a huge fan base. I look today about just at comments that were being made about this
deal from, I'll call it, the Marvel fan base. And other than the chatter about the dating of the Star Wars film, this is
among the most talked about step out there today, next to, of course, I guess the IPO of Twitter. Although the dating of
Star Wars was the number one tweeted or trending subject on Twitter today, I thought was also interesting.
Anyway, this is I think a great opportunity for Marvel to create more brand value and to create more character value.
And I think that it's only one step in a direction that will lead to much more value being mined out of Marvel. And
ultimately Lucas through Star Wars, other ABC production capabilities and, of course, Disney, there are more
opportunities beyond our platforms to produce product for.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Okay. Operator, next question, please?

Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Marci, please go ahead.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thanks. I have two questions, Jay. You mentioned Shanghai CapEx for fiscal 2014. I was
just curious how we should think about operating expenses. And then secondly, the pickup in the share repurchase
activity for this year, should we take this as a signal that there's nothing on the horizon in terms of M&A? Just trying to
understand what prompted the change and if this level of share repurchase activity is more of a trend rather than just a
one-year event? Thanks.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Thanks, Marci. So obviously, the vast majority of our spending in Shanghai is capitalized and will
show up as roughly the 43% of – roughly $600 million, as I mentioned in the comments. But there are operating
expenses, you're absolutely right. Those are in round numbers $100 million. I don't know if they'll wind up being a
little less than that because we tend to plan conservatively.
And it has to do with, of course, the on-boarding of the operating team, the on-boarding of the management team,
sending a lot of people to our existing parks to become trainers of future employees in a train-the-trainer mentality. And
we did that extremely successfully in Hong Kong with a staff that was very unaccustomed to what Disney operations
were like. We'll do the same thing in Shanghai. Actually, we've already begun and we'll continue to ramp that up. So on
fiscal year 2014, to make a very simple question easy, about $100 million. I'd use that in your thinking. Second part of
your question was?
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: In terms of the share repurchase, is that a signal...
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Yeah. So...
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: ...that there's no M&A or something that's going to continue?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: No, I would not say – look, we've talked about the fact that a lot of these investments that we've put
in place would eventually contribute to our cash flow. We see that clearly manifesting itself in our planning in the
coming years. And while we are absolutely happy with our A rating, the strategic position it gives us in the capital

markets, we feel that we've got the capacity, we have the capacity to increase our return of capital to shareholders. We
are not cash hoarders, but I don't think you should read it as a signal about M&A.
On the other hand, I'm not trying to signal you that there's something imminent. But on the other hand, I wouldn't signal
it as, hey, Disney's out of the M&A business, because it has been an incredible growth vehicle for the company. Year in
and year out, we have used acquisitions successfully to add to the IP of the company, the distribution capabilities of the
company. And, of course, we're in a dynamic marketplace since we've been talking about for call after call and we don't
want to stand still and act as if we have everything in our hands that could potentially continue to grow the company.
So I wouldn't read that either way, but I think we are a company with an incredibly strong balance sheet that has the
capacity to both engage in returns to shareholders as well as opportunistic M&A.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Great. Thank you so much.
<A - Lowell Singer>: Thanks, Marci. Next question, please, operator?
Operator
Jason Bazinet from Citi. Jason, please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Just another question for Mr. Rasulo. Within the Consumer Products segment, at least
historically as far back as I can go, the operating income margin sort of peaked in Q1. This is the first year I can find
where it peaked in Q4. And you mentioned the 9% up on licensing ex-Star Wars. But that number doesn't seem
extraordinary to me when I look at history. So is there anything else going on that's more fundamental that would cause
the magnitude of margin expansion? And does it foreshadow something structurally different in terms of the margins
for this segment? Thanks.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Yeah, I would say that your observations are correct. Obviously, the Lucas addition has contributed
to margins. We said when we did both the Marvel and Lucas acquisitions that we had the on-board capability to absorb
the licensing of those franchises without increases in overhead, which of course gives you incremental margins that are
better than your average margins. But we've also had very significant worldwide improvement in our Disney Store
business. And you can imagine that when you're looking at the blend of businesses that Consumer Products engages in,
both from the licensing side where margins are enormous to the retail side where margins are where you know they are
in retail.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Yeah, yeah.
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Now improvement in that improves the overall margins. So we're pretty happy with a division that's
pretty much firing on all cylinders at this point.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: I also think that when you consider that we've got Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucas products in
the marketplace, that the scale that, that generates creates margin expansion and general growth opportunities. Some of
it comes just from gaining access to more shelf space. Some of it comes from basically being able to cut better deals as
well. It's just a healthy collection of assets that retailers and licensees around the world are really interested in.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: That's helpful. Thank you.

and in particular, given that the Disney cruise ships are so successful and they're booked a year in advance and they're
an industry-leading load factors. When would you decide if you need to add to the fleets because there's obviously a
need for a long lead-time there? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Iger>: We are not currently contemplating adding to the fleet, Vijay (sic) [David] (54:36). We like the
itineraries that are available to us. We have had a number of conversations about potential itinerary expansion and
frankly given the business that we are in or the aspect of the business that we are in, the opportunities are not that
numerous. I think eventually Asia will open up to the cruise business but when it opens up to the family cruise
business, we're still unsure of and my guess is that it won't open up in the very near-term.
So, we're not really at the moment contemplating adding to our fleet. We think that we have some interesting
opportunities to expand the itineraries of our current four ship fleet but we're not going to need a fifth ship to take
advantage of global itinerary opportunities for a while.

<A - Lowell Singer>: Okay. Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator
And our next question comes from Alan Gould from Evercore. Alan, please go ahead.
<Q - Alan S. Gould>: Thank you. I've got a question about the Cable Networks. The growth in the Cable Network
operating income was much lower this year. Margins were roughly flat with last year. I know there was a lot of
incremental sports rights costs and I know next year you have the new NFL contract. Are we going to – your sports
cost going out for the next 10 years as you've said. Should we be seeing margin expansion or should it stay flattish for a
while, given all the incremental costs that are coming onboard?
<A - Jay Rasulo>: Thanks, Alan. Let me – I guess when you talk about cable as a whole, it obviously encompasses a
lot of things, ESPN and its network – its parts the domestic Disney channel, international Disney channels and the
A&E Network. They all wind up in the same basket and, of course, when you look at an aggregate number, it's very
hard to decipher for you guys what's going on within.
Let me say this. That ESPN – adjusted cable OI was up 6%. ESPN was significantly higher than that as were the
domestic Disney channels, way beyond 6%. I don't give specific as to how high they were but well beyond 6%. What
you're seeing that ends up averaging down is the investment in the A&E Network that I mentioned before that shows
up in that line as well as pretty significant investment, the heaviest investment in its lifetime for that the launch of the
Germany free-to-air channel. And it does take a fair amount of work and money to put up a channel that you expect to
be successful in a big country and that is depressing the average pulling it down to that 6%.
So I know it may not be that satisfying and I'm not giving you specific numbers but they are much stronger up in the
high singles and low double digits for our core networks and the balance is the opposite as I just mentioned.
<Q - Alan S. Gould>: Okay. Thank you for that clarification, Jay.
