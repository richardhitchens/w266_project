With that, I'd like to turn the call over Howard Schultz. Howard?
Howard S. Schultz
Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today's call. I'm very pleased to discuss the record Q1 results that
Starbucks announced today. Strong operating and financial performance from all business segments around the world
and increased operating leverage and store efficiency enabled us to deliver record quarterly revenue of $4.2 billion,
record quarterly operating margin of 19.2%, record quarterly operating income of $814 million, and record quarterly
EPS of $0.71 per share.
Strong customer response to food and beverage innovation contributed to solid Q1 comp sales growth of 5%.
Consistent with our previous mid single-digit guidance and representing our 16th consecutive quarter of 5% comps or
greater.
Noteworthy is that the 5% comp growth delivered by our important EMEA region with over 2,000 stores was its
strongest growth in more than three years. Demonstrating the success of our strategy to transform our EMEA business
based on the learnings from our U.S. transformation. Also noteworthy is that our Q1 U.S. comps were approximately
twice the national retail sales average during holiday shopping period this season. And that our Q1 results do not reflect
the significant future sales benefit from a year-over-year increase of $230 million in deferred revenue to over $1
billion, resulting from extremely strong new Starbucks gift card activations and Starbucks card reloads in Q1.
At the outset, I want to take a moment to comment on two pronounced shifts in consumer shopping behavior that
retailers experienced, but that we unlike many retailers or any competitor were prepared for this past holiday season
and explain why and how Starbucks Global Business will increasingly benefit from the acceleration and convergence
of these shifts going forward. Then I will provide an overview of segment performance in Q1 and Troy will take you
through Q1 financial and operating results in detail.
Holiday 2013 was the first in which many traditional bricks and mortar retailers experienced in-store foot traffic give
way to online shopping in a major way. Customers researched, compared prices and then bought the brand and items
they wanted online, frequently using a mobile device to do so. This was also the first holiday in which consumers
embraced the convenience and flexibility afforded by physical and digital gift cards with a passion. Instead of gifting a
particular item, many consumers instead chose to give the gift of choice.
Starbucks was prepared for both of these shifts having invested over many years in the creation and development of
proprietary, world-class digital and mobile payment and card technology and expertise. This expertise and the assets it
supported enabled us to seamlessly process more than 40 million new Starbucks card activations valued at over $610
million in U.S. and Canada alone in Q1, including over 2 million new Starbucks card activations per day in the days
immediately leading up to Christmas and the $1.4 billion in Starbucks card loads globally. Each of these figures
represented a significant increase over both last year and candidly our most optimistic projections for this year making
Starbucks one of the very few small handful of retailers to benefit from the transference of brick-and-mortar store sales
to online sales in the gifting of choice. Even more than the sheer magnitude of the $1.4 billion loaded on to cards in Q1,
is the opportunity presented by the millions of customers that will be visiting our stores to redeem these cards in the
future.

Experience tells us that many gift card recipients are new customers for Starbucks and their visits are providing us with
a unique and powerful opportunity to introduce them to the Starbucks experience, invite them into My Starbucks
Rewards loyalty program and inspire them to become Starbucks – to become part of the Starbucks daily ritual. Today,
nearly 10 million customers actively using our mobile payment app, over 7.3 million active My Starbucks Rewards
members in U.S. alone, over half of whom are gold status members and a figure approaching 5 million mobile
transactions taking place in our stores each week. Starbucks integrated mobile and loyal app technology is by far the
undisputed leader in digital and retail technologies. Together, mobile and Starbucks card payments represent over 30%
of total U.S. tender. This powerful technological advantage combines with our robust pipeline of food and beverage
innovation and Starbucks recognition as one of the world's most respected and most trusted consumer brands will
provide us with the winning hand as mobile card and online sales trends continue to converge and accelerate around the
world and into the future.
Let me turn your attention to the Americas. Starbucks Americas segment, now comprising over 13,000 stores, had
another strong quarter with revenues up 8% and comp sales up 5%, including a solid 4% increase in traffic.
Contributing to Americas' performance was the success of our holiday beverage offerings, including both Pumpkin
Spice Latte and our holiday beverage Trio and strong food sales, including increased customer acceptance, and
additional benefit from the ongoing roll-out of La Boulange bakery platform. As we entered 2014, Starbucks Americas
segment is benefiting from new store development and existing store renovation programs that are driving increased
store efficiency and throughput, enabling us to deliver both an enhanced customer experience and increased
profitability. The success of these efforts are apparent with our newest class of stores on track to average over $1.2
million in year one sales exceeding our best-in-class investment ratio of two to one.
For example, a new class of drive-through stores is providing Starbucks with the unique opportunity to connect with
customers on the go and represent a tremendous growth opportunity for us both domestically and internationally. In the
U.S., highly profitable drive-throughs account for 40% of our company-operated store portfolio, and remain a focal
point of our store development efforts. And the more we broaden and expand our drive-through program, the more we
see white space and opportunity for drive throughs in the future.
Licensed stores comprising 40% of our Americas store portfolio representing roughly half of the 600 net new stores we
plan to open in the Americas in fiscal 2014 also present a compelling growth opportunity for us. We opened 50
licensed stores in Canada in Q1, including 30 in a single day.
But in addition to facilitating rapid growth, licensed stores utilized less of our capital, provide strong returns and afford
access otherwise unavailable, high-traffic retail venues such as hotels, airports, rail stations, grocery stores, theme parks
and fast-growing international markets such as Mexico, a market that delivered extremely strong comp growth in Q1.
Overall licensed portfolio revenue increased 15% in Q1, the highest growth rate in six quarters. And because of the
value of our global brand, we are receiving more inquiries today from potential licensees than any other time in our
history.
Let me turn your attention to new platforms and begin with Teavana. A year after the acquisition of Teavana, we are
more convinced than ever that we have the opportunity to transform the tea category the way we have transformed
coffee all around the world. Recent research confirms that Teavana now enjoys the highest level of awareness of any
super premium tea brand and like Starbucks, Teavana had a solid Q1.
Now one year into the integration of Teavana, we are poised to begin the roll-out of additional stores on the heels of the
successful opening of our first two Teavana tea bars in New York City and Seattle. These two beautiful new stores are
already providing us with key insights that will help us achieve our goal of combining and leveraging Teavana's
strength and authority around loose leaf tea and tea merchandising and Starbucks' strength creating experiential
consumer environments, innovative handcrafted beverages and a retail store development to create a new retail
platform in a unique international premium teahouse experience. I would add, look for Teavana to bring breakthrough
innovation to the tea category in the U.S. and Canada this spring and summer and to international markets in the years
ahead.

Now beyond tea, another important area of innovation and interest for us is premium handcrafted cold carbonated
beverages. This category is by far the fastest-growing segment of the over $140 billion global carbonation industry and
the results of tests we conducted in stores in select U.S. and Asian markets last summer exceeded our most optimistic
expectations. The excitement that was created as baristas carbonated our customers' favorite drinks and the fantastic
innovation and interaction that followed, cemented our interest in the category and the opportunity to elevate the cold
carbonation category with a premium handcrafted offering in our stores. Look for handcrafted cold carbonated
beverages in Starbucks stores that will drive food attachment, create an incremental need space for our customers and
create a new day part for us in the months and quarters ahead.
Turning to China and Asia-Pacific; in Q1, our important, rapidly-expanding China, Asia-Pacific segment currently
comprising over 4,000 stores in 14 countries, including 209 net new stores in Q1, delivered strong revenue growth of
25% and exceptional strong comp growth of 8%. These are best-of-class results for any retailer or restaurant operating
at our scale in Asia. This month, Starbucks celebrated its 15th anniversary in China, a market we opened with one store
in Beijing in 1999. We have more than 1,000 stores today and China remains on track to become Starbucks' largest and
most successful market outside the U.S. Just in time for the Lunar New Year, we reached a major milestone with debut
of Starbucks gift cards in China. China customers responded to the Starbucks card overwhelmingly in a positive way
with initial sales once again far in excess of our plan, and in many ways mirroring our U.S. experience. We currently
offer the Starbucks card in different aspects of our My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program in 12 of the 14 China,
Asia-Pacific region markets in which we operate. And in Japan and Hong Kong, we recently made it even faster and
more convenient for customers to give the gift of Starbucks choice online with Starbucks eGift.
In India, momentum continues, where in Q1 we opened a beautiful new flagship store in the garden city of Bangalore
and we continue to accelerate that growth. We now operate 34 stores in four cities and customer demand for Starbucks
stores throughout India literally is at a fever pitch. We're delighted with the performance of our joint venture with Tata,
among the most respected companies in India, and we are poised to grow sizable portfolio of stores in India over the
next two years. Overall, we plan to add a total of 750 new stores across China, Asia-Pac in 2014, including both our
100 store in Singapore next month and continue to be driven by the exciting opportunity to introduce our elevated,
differentiated and locally relevant Starbucks experience to millions of new customers in this important fast-growing
part of the world in the years ahead.
Let me turn your attention to EMEA, which in many ways has really had a wonderful performance and I think it's
consistent with the guidance we gave you a year ago in terms of our confidence that we would turn EMEA around.
Starbucks important EMEA segment now comprising more than 2,000 stores had a particularly noteworthy Q1, with
revenues increasing 11% and exceptionally strong comp sales growth of 5%. We opened a total of 64 net new
company-operated and licensed stores in EMEA in Q1, including our first store in Monaco, and believe it or not, our
first ever store aboard a train on the Swiss rail line running between Geneva Airport and St. Gallen. We're on plan to
open a total of 150 net new stores in fiscal 2014.
EMEA's Q1 performance underscores continued execution against our transformational agenda in that region and the
success of the strategy that includes enhancing our new store customer experience, showcasing innovative,
locally-relevant food and beverage products, and focusing on company-operated licensed and franchised stores for our
new store growth. Licensed store revenue in EMEA grew by 38% in Q1 due to the combination of new stores and
strong performance in several key markets. Including double-digit comp growth in the Middle East and North Africa
where we now have 335 stores. While we continue to be very encouraged by the progress we have made in EMEA, as I
previously stated, we're determined to see this progress continue for the region to reach its full potential.
Turning to Channel Development, our Channel Development segment posted total revenues of $401 million in Q1.
Representing solid 7% growth in Q1 over last year and continues to grow market share and increase distribution
through CPG channels outside of our retail stores. The strong, direct selling relationship we have built with retailers is
enabling us to elevate and differentiate our brand, increase our presence and enhance our product positioning, and the
deepening and strengthening of these retail relationships combined with new product offerings and initiatives currently
underway gives us confidence that Channel Development growth will accelerate as the year progresses, and that the
segment will deliver both double-digit top and bottom line growth in fiscal 2014 and beyond.

Premium single cup is the fastest-growing segment in at-home coffee; we have grown our share to a current 18% of the
segment over the last two years. Since launch, we have now sold way over 1 billion K-Cups and 200 million sticks of
VIA and we continue to build and expand both platforms. In January, responding to strong customer demand, we
introduced a new innovative line of VIA Latte offerings, including flavor lattes and over the course of this year you'll
see a significant expansion of our line of K-Cup offerings, including flavored Starbucks coffee in the K-Cup format.
We continue to innovate and add to our leading market share of the premium packaged coffee segment as well. And we
now really have a remarkable 26% share of that segment. And we continue to build the Starbucks Refreshers platform
and already seeing the early success of our Starbucks Signature Aisle merchandising initiative, just in time for the
rollout of our new ready-to-drink packaging this spring. Starbucks continues to offer the world's first and only
cross-channel loyalty and rewards program with more than $2.2 million rewards stars earned by customers in the first
seven months since My Starbucks Rewards stars down the aisle loyalty program was launched. Starbucks unique
combination of value, rewards and premium-positioning will enable us to continue to add to our leading position and
market share and CPG channels.
A few final thoughts before I hand the call over to Troy. And I think this part of my remarks are very important. Over
the last month or so, I have heard many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers attribute the downturn in their core
business during holiday to factors such as a shortened holiday shopping season, a weakened consumer, the U.S.
Government shutdown, and poor weather.
Respectfully, those explanations ignore a larger fundamental truth and that truth is that traditional brick-and-mortar
retailing is at an inflection point. No longer are many retailers only required to compete with stores on the other side of
the street. They are now required to compete with stores on the other side of the country. Navigating the seismic shift
will continue to be very, very difficult for many.
But I firmly believe and I submit that Starbucks' solid 4% increase in traffic in Q1 validates that we will be among the
small group of retailers to gain from the macro transference of brick-and-mortar retail sales to online sales
underpinning this belief our three dynamic unique Starbucks advantages. First, Starbucks offers an experience that
cannot be replicated or copied. The power of our brand, our heritage in coffee, beverage innovation, customization and
the deep emotional connection we have with our customers rooted in long standing trust and respect at our 200,000
Starbucks partners share with our customers provides us with an overwhelming competitive advantage not only
domestically, but around the world.
Second, we invested and continue to invest well ahead of the curve and today have world-leading proprietary digital,
social, mobile payment and card technologies and assets. These assets are enabling us to broaden and deepen our
connection to customers, enhance overall Starbucks customer experience and further differentiate and distance
ourselves from competitors. And we have a full pipeline of new technological innovations to introduce in the quarters
ahead that will fully leverage these assets and provide us with even greater benefits into the future. And we're just
beginning to appreciate the full magnitude and possibilities of the Starbucks mobile payment platform opportunity.
And third, as our strong traffic in Q1 demonstrates, the deep sense of community and human connection that our stores
provide our customers as their third place is only going to become more important and more relevant around the world
in the future.
Let me say in closing, I could not be more confident that Starbucks' unique combination of physical and digital assets
makes us one of the very few consumer brands with a national and global footprint to be in a position to build market
share and benefit from the seismic retail and consumer shifts underway.
I'll now turn the call over to Troy.

Thanks, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. The strong start to fiscal 2014 across all of our operating segments led
to consolidated results that eclipsed every meaningful record; revenues of $4.2 billion or a 12% increase over last Q1.
Our 5% global comparable store sales growth was the largest driver and particularly encouraging is the strength of sales
growth around the world. In fact, this was the first quarter since Q4 of 2010 that all regions posted comp growth of 5%
or better. And traffic continues to fuel that comp growth, growing 4% in the quarter with a 1% contribution from
average ticket. The strong performance from our more than 1,500 net new Starbucks stores opened over the past year
also contributed to the revenue growth in Q1.
Consolidated operating income grew 29% to a record $814 million in the first quarter. This includes a $20 million
credit as a result of paying our obligation in the Kraft settlement earlier than anticipated. Operating margin expanded
260 basis points to 19.2% in Q1 far above any quarter we've ever had, even when excluding the litigation credit.
Operating margin expansion was due largely to the lasting of several non-routine expenses in the Americas segment in
Q1 of last year. Commodity cost improvement and sales leverage also contributed toward the expansion.
Earnings per share grew 25% to $0.71 per share in the first quarter, a record even when excluding the $0.02 impact of
the litigation credit. Our tax rate of 34% was up significantly over last Q1 as we lapped an $18 million benefit recorded
in Q1 of last year, primarily from state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years. Our
performance this quarter clearly demonstrates the comp growth in the heart of our target range results in significant
gains and profitability and margin expansion, a testament to the efficient use of capital and strong financial discipline
that is embedded throughout the organization.
Now let me take a few moments to briefly touch on results from each of our operating segments. In the Americas
another solid holiday season and excellent operational execution drove revenue, operating margin and operating
income to record levels. Revenue grew by 8% in the first quarter, a strong sales growth in existing stores and sales from
735 net new stores opened this past year pushed Americas' quarterly revenue to over $3 billion for the first time ever.
Comp growth of 5% was driven by a 4% increase in transactions. We did see some softening of traffic in comp growth
in December, however, our Q1 comp growth was an extraordinarily strong delivery given the shifts in consumer
behavior that retailers faced during the holiday, as Howard mentioned.
Howard also mentioned food among our comp growth drivers in Q1. Food continues to be a disproportionate driver to
our comp and La Boulange is helping to propel those results. There have been very significant successes thus far,
including croissant sales that have doubled versus our prior offering. Make no mistake, however, this is a very complex
roll-out. We are significantly up leveling our core food offerings across more than 10,000 U.S. stores in two years'
time.
To accomplish that we're leveraging the learnings from introduction in many markets in fiscal 2013 to quickly optimize
implementation of stores launched this year. This includes labor deployment strategies, product assortment choices and
marketing and display optimization. Overall, we are as optimistic as ever about this opportunity.
In addition to the solid revenue growth in Q1, Americas operating income of $732 million was 24% higher than last Q1
and operating margin of 23.8% reflected an expansion of 300 basis points. Included in the expansion was the lapping of
non-routine items from last Q1 including our leadership conference, litigation charges and impacts from Superstorm
Sandy. However, even after backing those items out, our largest and most mature business of the Americas continues to
drive margin expansion, while also making investment in labor and food to unlock new levels of growth.
Not only was our 23.8% operating margin a big improvement from last Q1, it was a full 150 basis points higher than
any other quarter we've ever had and opportunity remains. Waste, labor and store maintenance are all under the
microscope and we expect new technology, enhanced deployment schedules, and robust renovation program will all
deliver improvements. As we continue to invest in our people, including maintaining world-class health benefits that go
above and beyond requirements of the Affordable Care Act, we see greater management stability and more effectively
run stores. This means we can spend more time focusing on our customers, ensuring they receive the one-of-a-kind
personalized service experience that drove our solid, well-balanced results this quarter.

Let me move now to Europe, the Middle East and Africa or EMEA where the first quarter represented a continuation of
great strides we're making in the region. Revenues of $340 million in Q1 grew 11% over the prior year. It is truly a
great start to the year, in fact the $33 million in Q1 revenue growth was higher than what we delivered for the entirety
of fiscal 2013. There were several contributors to our top line progress; certainly the signs of a slow but positively
trending economic recovery, including declining unemployment in the UK have been helpful. Beyond that there are
strong signals that our strategy in EMEA consisting of licensed store growth along with the heightened focus on the
store experience is paying off. Licensed stores were the largest contributor to revenue growth with company-operated
comp growth falling closely behind.
The 5% comp growth in Q1 was generated by a 3% increase in transactions. Perhaps our most positive sign out of
EMEA, the fact that the improvements we're seen are broad-based, all of our major markets have shown improvement,
the momentum is building for a great year. Our top-line momentum and disciplined store expansion across EMEA
translated into a strong bottom line as well. Q1 operating income in the region grew to $34 million, 50% higher than
last Q1. And operating margin expanded 250 basis points to 9.9% as the portfolio shift to higher margin licensed stores
drove our highest quarterly operating margin ever. We are encouraged with the progress we're making in EMEA and
excited about what is to come.
Now to China and Asia-Pacific, which continues to be fastest-growing and highest margin region. In the first quarter,
CAP revenues grew 25% to $267 million. Our record number of store openings and their strong performance in Q1
were key driving force behind our revenue growth. Additionally, company-operated comp growth, which at 8%
represented the continuation of our strong, consistent growth in the region drove revenues higher. Seven percentage
points of the comp growth were due to higher transactions, an acceleration over Q4.
Two year comp growth also accelerated to 19% in the first quarter. Strong brand awareness, relevant core promotional
product offerings and the increased usage of the Starbucks card and loyalty program all contributed. CAP operating
income grew 12% in Q1 to $81 million. Operating margin of 30.4% represented a 330 basis point reduction over last
Q1. Margins were negatively impacted by a decline in profits from our joint venture in Japan. This was driven
primarily by the sharply weaker yen, but also the timing of investments made in labor and store upgrades necessitated
by the extended spike in traffic we experienced, as both our business expanded and the Japanese economy
reinvigorated over the past several quarters.
Excluding Japan, our cap operating margin expanded slightly over last Q1, despite continued margin pressure resulting
from the ongoing strategic portfolio mix shift for company-operated stores. Our outstanding performance in mainland
China is a major reason we're able to offset the impact from that shift in the portfolio composition. As China's revenue
and operating income growth easily outpaced the region. Strong new store performance, effective labor management
and sales leverage are driving our success there.
In Channel Development, robust sales of single serve products and continued growth in foodservice combined to drive
revenues higher by 7% to $401 million. These revenue drivers were partially offset by the impact of lower pricing on
packaged coffee. While we are growing share of this category, until we lap the list price reduction we initiated last
May, we won't see a meaningful impact to our revenue growth. This is one of the reasons we anticipate higher Channel
Development growth in the second half of fiscal 2014 than in the first half.
As far was single serve growth goes, Starbucks K-Cup share of the premium single serve market in the U.S. is now
over 15%, our highest point since the launch two years ago. Our new Holiday Blend K-Cups were extremely well
received, helping to propel sales in the U.S. food, drug and mass channel higher by 65% in the final four weeks of the
quarter, which significantly outpaced the category over that same time period. Additionally, we continue to gain
traction on Verismo, which delivered solid holiday sales. Units sold grew over last Q1 as we nearly doubled
year-over-year door count with the addition of several key specialty retailers. Verismo is an element of our strategy to
capitalize on the highly competitive single cup space. We will continue to invest in the single serve business, which we
believe will be an important driver of our long-term growth.
Operating income in Channel Development grew a very healthy 23% to $119 million in Q1. Operating margin
expanded 370 basis points to 29.6%, due largely to 340 basis points of favorability from lower coffee COGS. Lower

pricing on packaged coffee and strong promotions in the quarter partially offset our coffee cost favorability. However,
that was offset quite favorably in other operating expenses as a result of decreased marketing due to the launch of
Verismo last Q1.
All other segments grew revenues to $159 million in Q1, up $101 million over the last Q1, and we delivered $14
million of operating income, up from a $4 million loss a year ago. The growth in both revenue and operating income
was due to the addition of Teavana, which was not in our prior year Q1 results. Please note that Q1 was the last quarter
we will not have Teavana in the prior period results, as it was added at the beginning of Q2 of fiscal 2013.
Before I move on to our fiscal 2014 targets, let me note that this quarter we corrected an immaterial error in our prior
period financial statements to allow for a more accurate comparison with current results. Specific to Q1, the impact of
last year is that both revenues and other operating expenses were lowered in Channel Development by $5.5 million and
in all other segments by $0.9 million. There was no impact to operating income. More details including a full
explanation can be found on our Investor Relations website.
On the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a conservative focus while wrapping up leverage where appropriate.
During the first quarter, we paid in full our obligation to Kraft as a result of the arbitration outcome. This led to the
issuance of $750 million of debt in December which when coupled with the $750 million we issued in September in
prior issuances, puts our total long-term debt at just over $2 billion. The two most recent issuances result in a
meaningful increase to our interest expense that is reflected in our Q1 results and that will continue.
The rapid pace of Starbucks card loads during the first quarter has pushed our quarter-ending deferred revenue balance
to over $1 billion for the first time ever, and 29% higher than a year ago. These loads also boost our already strong cash
flow, which for the quarter saw an unusual decline due to the Kraft payment. The Starbucks card strength, proceeds
from our recent debt issuances, and strong quarterly results offset the Kraft payment, however, and we ended Q1 with
$2.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities. Our strong cash position and
conservative balance sheet mean that we can continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases. In the first quarter, we re-initiated our share repurchase program and we continue to target share
repurchases to offset dilution of our broad-based stock equity program that also include our part-time store partners.
With nearly 26 million shares currently authorized as available for repurchase, we will also from time-to-time be active
in the market to repurchase additional shares based on market conditions.
It was a very strong start to our fiscal year on many levels, and the operating results we delivered in the first quarter
give us continued confidence in our full-year outlook. With the over-delivery on EPS in Q1, we are now targeting
full-year fiscal 2014 EPS in the range of $2.59 to $2.67, which includes $0.03 of additional interest expense as a result
of the recent debt issuances. That represents strong 18% to 22% growth over fiscal 2013, when excluding last year's
non-recurring gains due to the sales of equity in Mexico, Chile and Argentina and the fourth quarter recording the Kraft
litigation charge. Specific to the second quarter, we continue to expect EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.55. Remember
that traditionally, the second quarter is our lowest in terms of earnings, due largely to seasonality. That means the fixed
cost like our interest expense on debt issue over the past six months had a more dilutive impact on Q2 than the other
quarters. Additionally, last Q2 we had a $0.03 gain on our sale of equity in our Mexico business.
With respect to the second half of the year, we're targeting Q3 EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.66 and Q4 EPS in the
range of $0.70 to $0.75. The second half of the year represents growth of approximately 20% when excluding
non-routine gains and the Kraft litigation charge and reflects the strong earnings momentum we continue to generate.
We continue to expect a $0.09 to $0.10 full-year EPS benefit from lower coffee cost in fiscal 2014. This benefit is net
of pricing changes taken last year in CPG, as well as investment tracking to our business. And with respect to fiscal
2015, we now have more than a quarter of our company's loss at rates stable to fiscal 2014.
Given where the market is trading at today, we expect the overall impact of coffee prices to be positive in fiscal 2015,
but lower than the benefit in fiscal 2014. All other previously-announced guidance for fiscal 2014 remains unchanged,
including revenue growth of 10% or greater, global comparable store sales growth in the mid single-digits, consolidated
operating margin expansion targeted at approximately 150 basis points to 200 basis points, including moderate
improvement in the Americas and Channel Development, high single-digit margins in EMEA and margins moving

toward the low 30% range in CAP, 1,500 net new stores globally, capital expenditures totaling approximately $1.2
billion and a tax rate of 34.5%.
The balance first quarter strength of our Global Business sets us up extremely well for another remarkable year. We
have a number of significant growth drivers to continue the outstanding Americas performance. We have considerable
momentum brewing in CAP and EMEA, our Channel Development business is taking share from competitors and
delivering more to company profitability than ever before and our fiscal discipline and conservative balance sheet
continues to serve us well. What we have built over the past two years is paying dividends now. Our growth investment
proposition is based on strong double-digit revenue, fueled by consistent mid single-digit comp growth. And it is based
on growing earnings at a rate much faster than the top line. We achieved all of that in the first quarter, and we're
confident in our ability to continue that revenue growth, margin expansion and strong earnings growth in quarters
ahead.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Mike?
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you. Troy, for the current quarter, for the second quarter, one of guidance was
stepped up marketing I believe around both La Boulange and the Starbucks card. Are you still – is that still the case?
Are you still executing that? And could you give us an update on where La Boulange is now in terms of store
penetration?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Joe, thanks for the question. Yes, we continue to expect the same guidance we've given you
previously, which is something of a higher marketing spend as a percent of sales in the second quarter, and frankly in
Q3 and Q4 also anticipating moderately higher marketing spend as we really continue to invest in driving our business,
supporting La Boulange, supporting food broadly and driving innovation throughout our stores. So that will continue
and that is also a fundamental part of our guidance for the second quarter. La Boulange took a pause in terms of the
roll-out of new stores in the first quarter to allow us really to focus on the big holiday period for us. That will resume
here beginning in the second quarter and we continue to expect to be fully rolled out with the first wave of this bakery
program fully across the U.S. by the end of the fiscal year.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: And you mentioned the complexity of the La Boulange roll out and I realize it's a huge
undertaking and a major change, but has it been more complex than you expected or what are the intricacies of rolling
it out that you've discovered from your experiences?
<A - Troy Alstead>: No, it's not been any more complex than we anticipated. A big change like this across a huge
store system like we have with the kind of transaction volumes we have for our stores is a big change. It's a big
operational change, it's a big supply chain change and all of that we anticipated. And then, of course, in a big roll-out
like this, like any other retailer experience, like we would experience on other product innovations, we learn as we go.
We continue to fine-tune labor deployments and the warming routines and product assortment. Fortunately, customers
want a broader product assortment you'll see us respond and address that as we learn from last year's launches and
proceed to the rest of this year. But that's the normal part of the process, everything so far is right on track with what
we expect, we're extremely pleased with the results we're seeing in terms of the uplift, the fact that food continues to be
an incremental comp driver in our business and we think this – is that big opportunity as we ever thought it was as we
continue to build it up from here.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Okay. Thank you.

The next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Thank you very much. Troy, you may have mentioned that there might've been some
slowdown in comps in December and I was just hoping – in the U.S. I was just hoping you could provide a little more
color on that and whether it was related to core food and beverage or perhaps other items that you sell in the store and
whether you think you may see any implications of that as we enter 2014?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Thanks, John. Yes, we did see some slowing in December. Relative to previous quarters and
relative to the early part of the quarter relative to October and November, and we really attribute that fundamentally to
the discussion Howard had early on in the call, which is, fundamentally that significant shift in consumer behavior, less
retail traffic that we're all hearing about from other retailers, that we're hearing about in the retail traffic reports that
have been published, all of that out there had some impact on our traffic growth in December particularly.
Now, with that said, it's important to note, we still serve a record numbers of customers, we had record traffic coming
through our stores in December, we had record sales volumes in the month of December, and for the quarter overall.
We continue to drive traffic, however, just at a slightly slower clip than we had coming into that particular month.
Now, with that said, no comments about the particular quarter or implications beyond that other than just to point out
and acknowledge what you already know is worth underscoring the advantage we have, we expect that significant
change in consumer behavior is the fact that we ended Q1 with more than $1 billion of deferred revenue on our balance
sheet, dollars that customers have loaded on the card that will become revenue in our stores as we proceed from here.
That's an important advantage that we have a leadership position in and we'll continue to further our leadership as we
proceed from here.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: But maybe there's some evidence in the comp, if I may, that 1% lift in average ticket
suggests that maybe you sold less of some of the higher ticket, maybe gift related items outside of the card in the
quarter? I mean is that a right comment because obviously composition of the comp is not just traffic, it's also the
average ticket, and you just had very low average ticket growth in this most recent December quarter and can you just
give us a sense of what that might trend going forward, especially with the addition of things like La Boulange and
Evolution, what have you?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: There's no message there. In fact, I think if you look at each quarter for the last two or three
years you'd see our ticket growth average 1% in many quarters, 2% in some quarters but more often than not it was in
that 1% to 2% range. So we saw the first quarter come in with ticket that was not so distinct from most of our trends.
It'll tend to be a point or two either way, but again that's been evidenced by most of our trends recently. And the
slowdown we saw – the moderate slowdown we saw in the month of December in traffic was very broad-based, it
wasn't unique to any particular region, it wasn't unique to any particular day part or product set or product line, it
clearly demonstrates improved stuff and there were just a fewer people out there shopping and so fewer people for us to
capture and provide some great experiences in our stores.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Understood. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Very much. I wanted to follow up on that again and I guess I've a couple of questions about
the shift in the spending habits, kind of one big and one small. In terms of the small, other restaurants have pointed to
weather, can you disentangle when you look at your data something that says when weather was good, your comps
were better or worse, I mean are there data you can look at that says that's definitively not the case, it's much more
about the shopping habits? And the second point is, in bigger picture, can you just talk about why you think we're
seeing this inflection point now in terms of how people are spending? And does this have any implication for Starbucks

going forward? I always think of Starbucks as kind of a destination as opposed to a convenience, but it sounds like
there is some piece of the business that gets hurt if there're just fewer people shopping.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: This is Howard, let me try and answer your questions. It's not that easy to kind of bifurcate
what happened specifically in the quarter, with regards to weather and other things. But there's no doubt that
throughout the quarter there were unusual events and don't forget we had the government shutdown, which certainly
had an adverse effect on consumer confidence and consumer behavior both before and after and then obviously there
was a lot of weather, but in my prepared comments, I spoke specifically that I don't think that was the driving issue
here. I strongly believe that the month of December and what Troy just described in terms of John's earlier question,
will go down as a turning point in the overall way in which people are shopping. I think clearly, the month of
December was a gift-giving time and as a result of that, people spent much more time on the web than ever before and
you saw that in the online e-commerce sales. As a result of that, on the margin, there were clearly less people out
shopping and as a result of that, in certain day parts in the month of December there weren't as many people to capture.
Now, what Troy just said in terms of the follow up, your question in terms of going forward, I do believe that there will
be a real sea change for many, many retailers who're going to have a hard time navigating through what I believe will
not be a December-ish problem. This is going to be an ongoing issue and it's going to happen faster than people think in
terms of the way people are shopping and how they're spending their time and the value that you can get on the web.
Now, when I mentioned in my closing comments, I believe very strongly that we have the inherent benefits built in to
be able not only to capture incremental traffic, but to drive traffic into our stores as a result of the things that we will be
doing and the combination of physical and digital assets that will get stronger over time.
I do believe that although John mentioned in his comments that there's both traffic and average ticket, the 4% number
in Q1 to me really is the number that we have looked at as really the sign of the strength and conviction that our
customers have about Starbucks. I don't know of any other retailer or restaurant that drove traffic into their stores at that
time and if you look at how much money we spent on consumer advertising and trying to capture customers, it's very,
very de minimis compared to others.
One thing Troy did leave out that I'll just mention in terms of the average ticket, we were a little bit more promotional
in-store during the month, second half of December in terms of recognizing that there was a problem in the country
with traffic and as a result of that, the average ticket probably went down a bit as a result of promotional activities. But
I would say with no defensiveness that we look at the 5% comp number and the 4% traffic number in Q1 literally as a
stunning success given our peer group and given the macro market conditions. I do believe that there will be challenges
from many, many other retailers in calendar 2014 and Starbucks will be one of the companies that not only will be able
to navigate through it, but will gain market share as a result of the combination of assets that we have.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you. Just two questions. Just one, the follow up on the La Boulange.
Wondering if you can give some incremental color in terms of what you're seeing in the stores that already have it
whether it'd be mix, frequency, average check or often you talk about what the contribution is to the comp or any
update on the lunch rollout? And then I had one follow-up question.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Let me speak to that one, Jeff. First, I'd say, we'll give you all the details you're probably hoping
for; we've just been very encouraged across all aspects of this food program. It still is early. We're only in parts of
stores across the U.S. and it needed only the part of our new elevated food program which is the bakery category as you
know. But all indications are we have found something that resonates highly with customers, it gives us a chance to
dramatically exceed their expectations around food, it gives us a chance to continue to drive food as a faster growing
part of our business, which it has been for some time and that continues to over time elevate food as a mix of the stores

overall.
One part that I should add to this that is connected with food is that, while all day parts grew for us, at a healthy clip
again in the first quarter, mid-day and afternoon outpaced growth of the other day parts, and that's consistent with some
recent trends and is partially fueled by food by people recognizing that there is a fantastic food opportunity now at
Starbucks in the middle of the day and in the afternoon, snack items, bakery choices for all day long. They're just much
better than they used to be. So every indication for us continues to be very positive. We've got a ways to go to continue
this roll out around the U.S. The lunch program will continue to be fine tuned, which is really that stage it's at right
now. And we're very excited as that will begin rolling out late this fiscal year or early next fiscal year more broadly.
We're very excited about that next wave of food and what you're seeing from us is a multi-year elevation of food that
we think gives us a tailwind in comp growth and a tailwind in volumes through the stores over that entire span of time.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Got it. Then just a follow up on the earlier question being that you have I guess now
13,000 plus stores around the U.S. You talk about the shift from brick-and-mortar to perhaps – to online, which
obviously you guys seem better positioned than most to deal with that, but would you say that ex kind of the holiday
timeframe where I guess that becomes pronounced, do you think there's been a change in the underlying health of the
consumer? Or is it really just around shopping in the holidays and, therefore, there hasn't really been a change in the
health of the consumer per se just a matter of how they spend or how they spend their time shopping?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: We have a lens on consumer behavior and consumer spending perhaps unlike any other
retailer with the national footprint we have. I would say this isn't quantitative, it's more qualitative, and more personal. I
think the health of the consumer today is better than it was a year ago, but I do think it's still a fragile issue. And what
we saw with the government shutdown in October is any isolated event of that magnitude can have a very drastic and
dramatic effect on behavior and I think that speaks to the fragility. Now having said all that, I think one of the
underlying benefits of Starbucks for many, many years is that we are an affordable luxury.
We have been – we continue to be that and as a result of that, the demography and broad-based diversification of our
customer base and our store base insulates us from some of the underlying problems that may exist in one geography
versus another. I also think what Troy said is that our ability to take the physical asset of Starbucks and our fixed costs
and if you look at the store today versus even three years ago, the ability with La Boulange, carbonation coming and
things that we're going to do with tea are going to extend the day part, leverage our fixed cost and give us
incrementality, not only on the introduction of certain products, but many of these things are linked to the opportunity
to increase food attachment, not as a result only of La Boulange but the beverage and the innovation that we're bringing
that are skewed towards food.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Kelter>: I wanted to follow up on La Boulange a bit further and there are two questions. The first, are
you able to rule out the possibility that any of the same-store sales slowdown may have been associated with reduced
throughput during the peak sales quarter as a result of the complexities in the store associated with La Boulange? And
then the second is, can you talk to us about what to expect as it relates to hot breakfast and hot lunch that are coming
next under the platform and how far are you able to go with respect to product offerings, how it's going to be managed
logistically at the stores, et cetera?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Let me speak to the first thing, Michael, and Howard may want to jump in here, too. There's
absolutely nothing, nothing whatsoever to the idea that what's happening with our food program and the La Boulange
roll-out is impacting the throughput or is impacting service in the stores or has anything to do with comp growth
slowdowns in the quarter, absolutely nothing. We can completely rule that out. We have an opportunity and our
analysis to look at stores with La Boulange and stores without La Boulange. I appreciate you don't get to see that

side-by-side set of analytics, but I do. There's no change in our peak transaction day parts, there's no impact we can
discern from that.
Now perhaps and I would appreciate this, I think sometimes there is a customer perception that things are different in
stores. Their food's being warmed now. More people are ordering food. The case looks different. That change requires
some adoption over time, and I think that it may have created some case's perception, but you can fundamentally rule
out that there's any meaningful impact on what's happening there. And at the same time, we will continue to deploy
more labor and revise the labor routines against food as it grows in our stores. We'll make sure we invest in the right
parts of the business to both drive volumes, to meet the customer needs and to grow profitability in our stores as time
goes on.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: And kind of one thing about that. Not only is there absolutely nothing to suggest that there's
a throughput issue, but I would also remind you that because of the Starbucks card and the quick adoption of mobile
payment that we are speeding up the level of service in our stores. And when you look at the amount of people that are
now paying with the card and the unbelievable rate of adoption and how accretive mobile payment is, there's no issue
whatsoever. This is a myth that absolutely has no legs and for all of you listening on the call, you should just eradicate
that thought. It does not exist.
<A - Troy Alstead>: And Michael, with respect to your second question, I want to leave some surprises out there. I'll
tell you we've got some great new innovations coming both in that morning category around the savory items and the
warm items as well as in lunch. Everything we've seen so far encourages us that we're just beginning to go after as what
is a big, big food opportunity both in our busiest day parts to drive increased attach. But also as I've said before, to
continues food as a way to set that benchmark into a lunch program at mid-day as an attached as we roll out the
carbonated beverage platform later this summer. All these things work together for us. We know the food as an
elevated quality in our stores not only drives higher food sales, but by the way it drives higher beverage sales. That's
when people come in to buy food, they also by beverage.
So the whole shift rises the level of volumes in stores and that our whole product line tend to increase as we find
ourselves elevating food. So, more to come, no details, but I think you'd really like the food we've got coming out the
balance of the year.
<Q - Michael J. Kelter>: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Thank you. I just wanted a little clarification and a question with respect to the promotion.
You mentioned that the promotional side of the business may have impacted the average check in the most recent
quarter reported. Should we read into that then in an environment where you have $1.4 billion worth of pent-up
demand call it that we would probably not see as much promotional activity? And then I just want to clarify, when you
keep referring to sort of the change in overall retail doing more online sales and the brick and mortar guys seeing the
softness, historically shopping happens on the weekends. So would we read into that then that you literally saw then
tangible evidence that the business that might've been correlated with brick-and-mortar traffic associated with weekend
business was your weakness in December? Because you said pretty much that it wasn't day part positioned or timing of
the day or timing of the week I run into that.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I think the latter – there's no evidence with specificity that there was a weakened issue. So I
think this was to spread across multiple days. The one thing about the issue of whether that was brought up earlier,
clearly any weather problem in a city where people are living during the Christmas holiday season, the initial reaction
is not to go out and so the weather played I think a positive role for the online e-commerce opportunities because it was
so convenient. But we did not see a weakened issue and I think one thing I want to go back to is we anticipated this
level of change. The investments we made in the card, the investments we made in mobile payment, all of these things

were in anticipation of what we saw in December. They probably came at us and everybody else with a faster clip, but
we were in a position to take advantage of it and the best evidence to that is not only the $1.4 billion, but the $200
million that's sitting in the reloads.
<A - Troy Alstead>: And that's just – to underscore a part of Howard's point there. In holiday periods in past years, we
would see elevated holiday traffic all week long, not finding just isolated to the weekends. So I think that underscores
the fact that because we didn't see it isolated to the weekend this time, that's not a message. So anything else other than
actually very closely matches how we would anticipate that traffic around the holiday period as well. And then perhaps
you can help me understand your first question. Were you saying that related to promotional discounting that we
increased a bit in the first quarter because we had the Starbucks card balances, are you asking if that means it will be
lesser going forward?
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Correct. So I'm assuming that you addressed the December slowdown with promotional
activity that given the pent-up demand you probably – would it be correct to assume that you would not need to do as
much promotional activity and its adverse effect on check?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Well, what we can specifically comment and what we may do with promotions or not, we
tend to throughout the year at various times had various offers, particularly around now driving to get the Starbucks
card balances loaded and registered so that they become an integral part of our loyalty program. So you'll see us very
active in what we do. It may not be as specific around merchandise promotions as we did in the holiday period that for
us is true, but you'll continue to see us be very active in the way to engage the customer and keep traffic coming into
our stores each quarter as we go.
<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thanks. Just, first a follow up. Troy, what are the metrics around card usage in January, what
portion of the cards are used in January and if you know this what portion of those are actually used by first-time
customers, people that haven't registered before? That's the follow-up. I also just wanted to ask about EMEA, we
haven't talked about any place also around the world, what was the inflection point, what country or what was the piece
that really changed the comp momentum I think for the first time in a while in that segment?
<A - Troy Alstead>: John, to the first question, in years past, most of that incremental new card load tends to come
into the stores predominantly in the second quarter, but then also continuing into the third quarter. So, going into this
quarter, and I won't make specific comments about what we're seeing in the current quarter right now or in the current
month of January, we would anticipate that we would see that incremental load come in through the business as we
progress through Q2 and even into Q3 and that would match more of a typical historical pattern. In EMEA, there has
been a very meaningful steady progress.
I would say I think the first quarter was perhaps a bit of an inflection point as the number of great things came together
all at once for us. But to be clear, these are all the things we've been working on and our team over in EMEA has been
working on for two years now, around dynamically changing the store experience, around beverage perpetration,
execution within stores, around the licensing activity, all of that is really starting to show up both in the top line now
and in the middle of the P&L driving that margin to the all-time high that we reported in Q1. So it's a bit of an
inflection point, but it's one that comes after several quarters in a row of preparation and a lot of hard work. We would
absolutely anticipate that improvement to continue, not always at the pace that we experienced in the first quarter to be
clear, but everything we've been saying for the last two years is we believe we can continue to develop EMEA into a
very, very healthy strong contributor in our business and I think Q1 is a fantastic validation of that.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Is it just – suffice it to say is it UK largely – UK driven or is it from stronger performance around
the peripheral and that market is not as strong as the average?

<A - Howard S. Schultz>: No. On the contrary UK was very strong for us, but it's also broad-based. So all of our
major markets in EMEA, company-owned, UK, France, Germany, Switzerland we saw nice improvement across that
portfolio of markets, but the UK was perhaps leading, we had a very good quarter in UK.

Your next question is from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks. Regarding Channel Development, you mentioned some coffee innovation in your
remarks. But you build up stable brands outside of coffee for instance I suspect internally you would have big dreams
for brands like Evolution Fresh and where that can go. I just wanted to get a sense of those dreams and maybe just the
timing about will there be a big push beyond coffee with Channel Development, one of these quarters we'll sort of
wake-up and you'll be pushing harder in marketing more than you ever had before?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Thanks, Dave. The answer is yes. We have big aspirations for what more we can do
through our Channel Development business particularly as we have acquired and brought into our stores and really
begun to nurture and integrate these new brands and businesses we have. I wouldn't have you expect any meaningful
change in any immediate quarter right in front of us, but we are progressing with the rollout of Evolution Fresh across
the country, sold within the Starbucks stores but as we go building up that distribution into the CPG channel that will
continue. We have big aspirations for what we can do with Teavana in the Channel Development business in time. The
first priority for Teavana though is our standalone Teavana business as well as bringing those teas into the Starbucks
system. But in time as we build the equities of Teavana, as we develop the following around Evolution Fresh, all of
these products have great opportunity to then be extended into the Channel Development business and really leverage
on top of the infrastructure we have, the relationships and trade we have, the distribution that we built, so you will
actually see us build more over time in that space.

Your next question comes from Jason West with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jason T. West>: Yes. Just going back to the discussion around the shift in the consumer over the holidays, just
wondering if you guys have passed through the store base and if you've identified maybe a percentage of the store base
that would be more exposed to that shift, if you could talk about what that number might be and are there different
things that you are going to do in those stores that are a little more retail oriented to kind of address this issue? Or is it
really sort of a chain-wide effort that's going to be addressing this?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I would say that the – any bricks and mortar company that is heavily skewed to the malls
will be more susceptible to this new change. I think we are in a unique position in that our mall base business is a very
small component of our overall national footprint. So I don't think that you're going to see us be at a disadvantage
because of our real estate portfolio. I think we've introduced this subject to you not to create fear and trepidation but
really to share with you what we believe to be a new, dynamic change in consumer behavior.
But linked to that, once again, is our strong belief that not only did we anticipate this but we have the resources, the
capabilities and the assets unlike most traditional bricks and mortar retailers to be a beneficiary of this change. And I
think once again, the Starbucks card platform and the Starbucks mobile card, mobile transaction platform is still in its
nascent stage and we believe there's an opportunity to extend that value to our customers in ways that we have not yet
shared with you. And we also think there's an opportunity over time to take full advantage of what every other tech
company is chasing with regard to mobile payments.

<Q - Jason T. West>: Just a quick follow up on that, I mean the mobile ordering you guys alluded to in the past, is that
something that would be sort of early stage or I guess earlier in the pipeline to kind of able to pre-order with your
phone before you get to the store? Just wondering if that's something that's coming soon?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I'm not going to comment with specificity of when that is coming, but I can tell you that we
understand the value that that will create for our customer base and also we believe there's significant incrementality as
a result of it. And if you look at how quick we were and how early we were to adopt mobile payment in our stores, you
can assume that over time we will lead in this area.

Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.
<Q - Andy M. Barish>: Hi, guys. On a margin question in the Americas obviously the performance in the first quarter
was fantastic, but with regard to the rest of the year is sort of moderate increases which implies the kind of flattening of
margins maybe even some challenges in the 2Q to maintain margins with some of the investment marketing spend you
spoke about, Troy. Can you give us a little help directionally there for the rest of your on Americas margins?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Yeah, Andy, no, absolutely not. We'd anticipate for the balance of year to be able to moderately
expand the margin in the Americas. Now the first quarter was more than – actually more than I would say it's moderate.
Remember that was fueled by some unusual events from a year ago, like the leadership conference as an example. Like
Superstorm Sandy, which certainly had an impact on us and it did on all other retailers. So the degree of expansion
likely won't be as high through the balance of year as it was in the first quarter, but we have every expectation that we
continue to grow the top line and improve profitability through our store system.

Your next question is from Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thanks. I just want to follow up on some of the comments related to the promotional activity
in December. If you think about this is a uniquely Starbucks capability to leverage the dramatic increases in the amount
of customers in the social and mobile and digital. As this – as that usage has picked up, how has this advantage may
have picked up? In other words, like how quickly can you respond to these things? How customizable or personalized
can you make initiatives and now that you have so many more customers on this program, does the uptick change from
what you would have seen in years past? Some color on that would be very interesting. Thanks.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Thanks, Keith. I'm going to ask Adam Brotman, our Chief Digital Officer to respond to
that.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Hi, Keith. It's a great question and the answer is absolutely. We've never been more nimble
in terms of our ability to respond using our digital assets. You saw that this Q1 and the holiday period where we were
able to react at a very personalized level even some geo-targeted aspects of what we were doing and it's a significant
improvement over where we were in the same quarter of last year, and it speaks to the number of customers
participating, not only in My Starbucks Rewards, but on the mobile platforms, and it puts us in a great position to be
even more nimble as we go forward.

Your next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Your line is open.
<Q - Will E. Slabaugh>: Yeah, thanks, guys. Just a quick follow-up on Europe. A nice surprise there. I was wondering
if you could break down sort of where you feel like you're winning right now, where you turn that inflection point,
where there's still an opportunity. And then secondarily, are you seeing a difference in your company-owned traditional
stores versus performance in some of the licensed stores with a more captive audience?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Thanks, Will. Our licensed business has been a healthier component of our business in EMEA for
quite some time. We frankly struggled more over the last 10 years to 12 years in our company-operated business. Now,
as I look at the first fiscal quarter and break it down for you a little bit, what's very encouraging to me is that the
revenue growth we saw and the trajectory change we saw was almost evenly split between the licensed business and
company-operated, comp-growth driven. The licensed business tipped a little bit stronger but not much. Both were very
strong contributors to the increase in revenue and the full turn of profitability.
And that's two messages there. One is the significant focus we've had on store execution, on operations, on
management of the stores, on supply chain into the stores. All of that has been a heavy focus of ours as you've been
hearing us talk about for a couple years now, and that's paying off. Absolutely, fundamentally, we're seeing top line
response, we're seeing customers respond, and the bottom line is improving.
We also now, as we've really begun to mature and flesh out our license strategy to the region, we understand much
better today what component of that region should be a licensed execution as we've accelerated that and even over the
last year and a half converted and sold off some former company-operated stores to licensees as we've made that
transition, that has contributed nicely. And of course, that's a higher margin execution. It gives us access to customers,
[ph] peer points we couldn't elect to (1:11:34). And in some cases, it positions the licensee, who's better able to operate
in a particular geography or venue than we are, frankly. So both of those things are progressing and I have to say, I
think we're winning right now at both in company-operated and in licensed part of our business there.

Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good afternoon. My question's on the new store development within the U.S. And it
sounds like you're seeing some very good results from some of the newer class of openings, and you mentioned there's
opportunity or white space related to drive-through. So I'm just wondering if all of that is giving you more confidence
and maybe stepping up the unit growth rate as you look out to maybe 2015 or 2016 or beyond. Is this maybe a
precursor for accelerating the growth?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I'm glad you asked that. I've spoken about drive-throughs and I've spoken about the $1.2
million for new stores. But in addition to that, we've had unusual success in very unique configurations and store types.
Many of you probably have read that we've opened about four or five stores that are literally old containers, and they
are drive-through only and walk-up. The volume on those stores against the cost to build them has given us great
confidence that we have an unusual opportunity in traditional stores, drive-throughs and what I would just mostly
describe as unique configurations, both in size and location.
We've also done a lot of work on verticals; for example, hospitals, where we do not have a lot of penetration. So I
would say that you probably will see us go after a significant level of additional market share in the future with an
acceleration of U.S. stores that are highly targeted against the return on investment and the sales that we're currently
achieving in the kind of stores that we have not opened before. And in addition to that, you'll certainly see traditional
Starbucks stores around the country.

But I think that despite the commentary on sea change in customer behavior that we have underestimated for the last
two, three years, the opportunity that we have across North America for additional stores and specifically additional
store types meeting with drive-throughs. There's no doubt that drive-throughs have surprised all of us in terms of its
volume, return on investment and the opportunity to build stores that we didn't think existed in the past. And you'll see
us do that in great numbers in the future, coupled with what I've just described.

Your next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the mobile payments in China, I
think it's fair to say that smartphone technology has vastly improved from when you launched this program in the U.S.
But even if we look at the U.S. as sort of an example, the early years where you saw card loads certainly in the 70%,
80%, 90% range, and now they've sort of stabilized in the 30%, 40% range. Can you talk a little bit about your
expectations for China? The China consumer has embraced smartphone technology, so I think the market is bright for
the launch of this type of platform. But maybe if you could give a little bit of more detail about what's you plan there,
how it will differ from what we see in the U.S. And then your expectations sort of how you're going to measure
yourself, and is it hitting your goals, or not. If you could give us some details around that I'd really appreciate it. Thank
you.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I'm going to – I think Adam's going to answer that question. I must say, I think we're all
sitting here surprised that we haven't gotten one question with regard to the biggest opportunity in front of us in terms
of geography, about China. And a market that we have over 1,000 stores and our best performing market outside the
U.S. You talk about white space, it's uncharted with opportunity. But, Adam, go ahead.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Yeah, Diane, it's a great question. And the answer is absolutely we believe the opportunity
for mobile payment is something that we plan to do not only in China, but frankly in many markets around the globe.
We've already brought it to almost 10 markets and China we believe will be no exception. Highly
technologically-savvy consumer base, one where they've adopted our MSR offering in droves, and we believe that
China is going to be a great opportunity to do the kinds of things there that we are trying here in terms of mobile
payment, mobile loyalty and innovation in the stores. So yes, I can't get into specifics, but that's coming soon.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: John, go ahead.
<A - John Culver>: Yeah, Diane, this is John Culver. With regards to just add on to what Adam's saying. Two years
ago we launched the Starbucks Rewards program in China. And in that short period of time, we now have nearly 4
million members on the platform. And to Adam's point, we are laying the rails right now for a much more accelerated
digital experience for our customers in China. We just launched in concert with this Chinese New Year the first ever
store value gift card in our stores in China. And then obviously continue to roll out the opportunity as it relates to
Starbucks app on both the iPhone as well as the Android application. So a big opportunity for us to take what we've
done in the U.S., transfer that knowledge and capability into China, and look at a whole new way of reinventing the
experience for our customers there.

really go into those units and optimize throughput, find better ways to ensure order accuracy, and if so what's the
opportunity for that and what's the timeline for addressing it? Thanks.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Thanks, Karen. The answer to that is absolutely, yes. One of the things that we
fundamentally know is that, in our drive-throughs, not only do we have huge opportunities for more drive-throughs
around the U.S., the economics are strong. They have, as we said in past quarters, comped higher than our full
portfolios, including the non-drive-through stores. So we see every great indication of drive-throughs, and including, by
the way, to improve throughput, to up-level the experience for the customer as they come through. To change how our
barrista engages with the customer in that line. They'll move that stack of cards more quickly. We have significant
work underway to do exactly that, and part of that, by the way, includes enhanced technology. Some of the same things
you've us talk about, and see us innovate around in terms of payments and ordering in the cafe, inside the store, will be
very true and very beneficial in the drive-through. So, much more to come, but we will go back through all of our
existing drive-throughs and make some enhancements that I'm quite confident will be incremental drivers to the
business.
