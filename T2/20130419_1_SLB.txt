However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in
today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer
and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request.
We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements.
And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat
Thank you, Malcolm.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First-quarter earnings per share from
continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.01. This is $0.07 lower sequentially and $0.05 higher
when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we recorded $0.07 of charges relating to the currency
devaluations in Venezuela.
Oilfield Services first quarter revenue of $10.7 billion, decreased 4.5% sequentially, while the pre-tax operating
margins declined 37 basis points. More than half of the $506 million sequential revenue decreased is a result of the
absence of the yearend surge in product, software and WesternGeco multiclient sales that we experienced in Q4.
The remainder of the decrease is largely attributable to the seasonal weather related slowdowns we typically experience
in Q1. Given the significant impact that these seasonal factors had on our sequential performance, our comments will
focus on year-on-year changes unless otherwise noted.
Oilfield Services revenue increased 7.6% year-on-year, while pre-tax operating margins declined by 59 basis points.
Highlights by product group were as follows: Reservoir Characterization's revenue of $2.8 billion increased 8.5% while
margins grew by 94 basis points to 27%. These increases are primarily attributable to a very strong performance in
Testing Services on improved offshore exploration activity.
Drilling Group revenue of $4.1 billion, increased 9.2%, and margins improved by 57 basis points to 17.9%. These
improvements were led by drilling and measurements on strong offshore drilling activity across all international areas
and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Production Group revenue of $3.8 billion increased 6.9%, while margins fell by 237 basis points to 15.1%. The effect
of ongoing pricing pressure for Well Services technologies in U.S. land more than offset by double-digit revenue
growth across all other segments. This performance was led by the Schlumberger Production Management and subsea
product lines. The margin decline for the group was entirely attributable to the impact of the continued excess hydraulic
horsepower capacity in U.S. land.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 23.3% in the first
quarter, compared to 23.8% in the previous quarter and 23.6% in the first quarter of 2012.
Net debt increased $162 million during the quarter to $5.3 billion, reflecting the seasonal deterioration in working
capital that we typically see during the first quarter.
During the quarter, we spent $894 million on CapEx, and we repurchased 2.5 million shares at an average price of
$77.63. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.9 billion in 2013 as compared to $4.7 billion we spent in 2012.
And now I turn the conference over to Paal.

Our first-quarter results were solid, driven primarily by the overall strength and progress of our international business,
but also by continued margin resilience in North America, in spite of both activity and pricing challenges. All together,
earnings per share were up 5% compared to the same quarter last year.
Looking at the international markets in more detail, our revenue grew 13% year-over-year while operating income was
up 21% and margin expanded 135 basis points, demonstrating the strength of both the international market potential as
well as our execution capabilities.
Sequentially, revenue was down 5% due to the normal seasonal slowdown in the northern hemisphere and the Far East,
while operating margin was up 3 basis points, driven in part by strong performance from our IPM and SPM product
lines.
In terms of Q1 activity, the international rig count was up 7% versus the same quarter last year. Pricing trends remained
stable with revenue per rig continuing to slow, but steady progress now observed over the past six quarters.
In this environment, we continue to drive high-end technology sales throughout our international operations, and we are
also actively adding our latest new-technology introductions to our existing contract base. New-technology sales,
together with strong execution and operational performance, helps drive both effective pricing and margin levels.
In Latin America, revenue was up 8% year-over-year while operating margin was up 123 basis points, driven by strong
execution, cost control, and new-technology sales.
As previously communicated during the quarter, we have had a series of very constructive meetings in Venezuela with
PDVSA, and we expect to finalize a new payment agreement in the near future, and we anticipate ramping up activity
to meet the current and future needs of PDVSA's development and production plans.
Elsewhere in Latin America, Ecuador posted the highest growth rate in the first quarter, driven by excellent
performance in our Shushufindi SPM project. The de-risking of our development plan is now largely complete, and we
are operating four drilling and two workover rigs. With production levels progressing in line with our plans, the project
is set to generate significant value to both Ecuador and Schlumberger in the coming years.
In Argentina, activity was also strong in the first quarter, again driven by drilling and stimulation activity in the
Neuquen basin, and from our IPM project in the Vaca Muerta shale.
In Brazil, overall rig count remained flat in Q1; however, we did see activity starting to shift back from workover to
drilling for several deepwater rigs. Our main focus in Q1 was on the startup of new contracts. As previously stated, the
Brazil contracts were generally bid at very competitive prices for basic technologies. However, given the complex and
challenging operating environment, the use of high-end technology can create significant value for both our customer
and Schlumberger. We are therefore already in discussions to add our latest technologies to the contracts, and we will
continue to actively introduce new and value-adding products and services over the span of these long-term contracts.
In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 21% year over year while the operating margin was up 125 basis points
driven by strong performance throughout the region. In the Middle East, we again saw the strongest growth in Saudi
Arabia, where activity is progressing as planned and in Iraq where operational performance of our IPM rigs was strong.
The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait also posted solid growth in Q1 driven by higher customer activity and further
supported by market share gains from recent contract wins. In Asia, the normal seasonal slowdown led to lower
sequential activity in both China and Australia, but this did not prevent both GeoMarkets from posting very strong
year-over-year growth numbers.
In China, growth continues to come from both complex conventional land developments as well as from offshore.
While in Australia, Queensland unconventional gas activity together with deepwater drilling activity in the Northwest,
will lead to growth in the coming year. As stated in the January call, we expect strong growth from the Middle East and
Asia in 2013, and our Q1 results are so far validating this trend.

In Europe, CIS and Africa revenue was up 11% year-over-year and the operating margin was up 120 basis points.
Growth in the first quarter was driven by Sub-Sahara Africa, where activity was robust throughout the region.
Angola was particularly strong for us in Q1, driven by development and exploration drilling as well as marine seismic
operations.
In North Africa, growth was limited during the first quarter. While the pending contract issues were generally resolved,
security has again emerged as the primary challenge and had a significant impact on activity levels during the quarter.
Our customers are now in the process of evaluating future activity plans and the need for additional security measures,
and we expect activity to remain subdued as long as this process is ongoing.
In the North Sea, we saw the normal seasonal slowdown due to winter weather, but activity still showed solid
year-over-year growth as we transition from exploration to development, and production related work continued.
In Russia and Central Asia, we also experienced the normal seasonal slowdown in activity. Still, the region posted one
of the highest year-over-year growth rates in the first quarter driven by offshore activity in Sakhalin and by land
activity in Kazakhstan. And Russian and Central Asia remains on track to be one of our main growth drivers in 2013.
In North America, revenue was down 4% while the operating margin was down 356 basis points compared to the same
quarter last year. Still, at 19.1% our margin remained significantly higher than in previous cycles, and is a clear
testament to our newly built strength in the North American market.
Looking at the North America land market in detail, U.S. land rig activity in the first quarter came in below
expectations, although the data showed some increase in total rig count towards the end of the quarter. At the same time
drilling efficiency remained strong, asset utilization improved from the low levels seen over the holiday season, and
lower guar cost provided some relief to pressure pumping margins. Still, the main concern in North America land
remains pricing, where the downward trend in drilling, wireline and coiled tubing seen in the fourth quarter continued
in Q1. In addition we also saw further downward pricing pressure on a number by hydraulic fracturing bids during the
quarter adding further uncertainty to the North America land market outlook.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico the overall rig count remained strong but operational delays relating to the change out of
subsea connectables on the deepwater rigs had a negative impact on results for parts of the quarter. However at this
stage we expect these issues to generally be behind us and that the U.S. Gulf of Mexico contributions to our business
will be in line with expectations for the year.
In WesternGeco we continue to operate one Dual Coil fleet in the Central Gulf while multiclient sales relating to the
Central Gulf lease sale in March came in well below expectations in the first quarter.
Let me now turn to technology, where I would like to highlight our integration capabilities and the growing value this
brings to our business. As our customers continue to look for ways to reduce finding, development and lifting costs a
number of them are now seeking much closer and broader partnerships with us to unlock more value from the E&P
value chain. This includes more collaborative problem solving for utilizing our complementary expertise and by further
leveraging our wide technology offering and broad integration capabilities.
We have carefully built up our integration capabilities over the last 15 years by developing the required business
processes and people competencies and by instilling an unmatched spirit of teamwork through our matrix organization.
In terms of our integration offering, we have arranged our business models and focus areas with varying levels of
integration and contract risk. Through our IPM product line we offer project coordination for complex offshore
exploration and development projects, long-term turnkey contracts for land well construction, intervention and
production enhancement campaign for mature fields both offshore and onshore, as well as P&A activity for aging
offshore installations.
Today we operate these types of contracts throughout our global operations covering all parts of our customer base. In
addition to our IPM product line, we also offer complete field management capabilities to our SPM product line where
we risk the value of our products and services and sometimes cash in return for a fee per barrel of incremental

production.
Today our overall integration capabilities represent a key strength and competitive advantage for us in the marketplace.
And going forward we will continue to develop these capabilities in order to help our customers extract more value
from their oil and gas efforts.
Let's then turn to the macro environment where we, so far, this year has seen mixed data from the main economies
including China the U.S. and the Eurozone. Still the overall outlook for 2013 remains largely unchanged from the
update we gave in January both in terms of GDP growth as well as the fundamentals for the global oil and gas markets.
Looking at our industry, the major trends from 2012 are as expected continuing this year. In the international market,
we see strong and consistent growth in key regions such as Sub-Sahara Africa, Russia, the Middle East, China and
Australia and with customer activity in general progressing in line with our stated expectations.
In North America land, the outlook remains uncertain driven by lower than expected rig activity and by furthers pricing
weakness. Cold weather and flattening natural gas production has led to larger than expected storage withdrawals in the
U.S. in the past couple of months. However, this has yet to result in an increase in dry gas drilling activity.
In this environment our entire organization remains focused on growth, margin, and earnings outperformance
throughout our global operations. This commitment and drive is starting to have a direct impact on our results as seen
by the following three facts.
First, our international leadership position in terms of operating margin and share of operating income is as strong as
ever. And our international leverage in terms of operating income is approximately 70% of the total. Second, following
the restructuring of our land business we have recently taken the lead in terms of operating margins also in North
America. And third, we have on average delivered double-digit growth in earnings per share over the past few years
and we are, as previously stated, looking to extend this trend in 2013.
These results combined with a collective motivation of the 120,000 Schlumberger employees to do even better going
forward, gives me a lot of confidence in our future ability to outperform and to provide superior returns to our
investors.
Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] With that, we'll go to the line of David Anderson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thank you. Good morning, Paal. So oil price weakness has really been weighing on these
energy stocks lately. I know you touched on it in your remarks here but when you look at the fundamentals of the oil
market right now, has anything changed really kind of as you've been look at the fundamentals? Has anything kind of
getting you concerned regarding your outlook or is it really kind of basically the same as you saw it 90 days ago?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well at this stage, we haven't really changed our outlook. We have obviously seen the recent
drop in Brent prices which is mainly driven by the macro numbers – the recent macro numbers and also seasonally
lower demand. But we still expect very strong support around $100 per barrel as demands pick up from the seasonal
low in Q2. So overall we have not really changed our view at this stage.

<Q - David Anderson>: Are any markets out there particularly vulnerable you think to a slow down or is there still
more than enough cushion here that you don't really get too concerned here?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No. I'm not overly concerned. I think with the level that you see both on WTI and Brent at this
stage I think both – at current levels both the international activity as well as North American liquids activity is pretty
solid at these levels.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Could you just touch a little bit more on the Middle East, just to expand on your
comments there? Last quarter I believe you said you were expecting the rig count to get to about 170 rigs. Do you still
think that? Is it higher or is it lower than that? And also if you could touch on how much of that incremental demand is
coming from unconventional gas?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. Well if you look at the Q1 performance in Saudi, that was as I mentioned quite strong
for us and the total rigs at the end of the quarter was now up to 140. And we are still maintaining the number of 170
rigs by yearend. So, really no change to the Saudi outlook, it's progressing pretty much in line with what we were
expecting. And what was the second part of your question?
<Q - David Anderson>: I was just curious as to how much of that incremental demand that you're seeing is going to
go towards unconventional gas or the tight gas that they're seeing – they're going for these days?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. So, I would say in 2013 that is still going to be quite limited. There are pilots ongoing
which we are involved. But in terms of overall rig count and activity level, these are still quite small in the overall
picture in Saudi. So, not a significant part in 2013.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Thank you.

We'll go to the line of James West with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - James C. West>: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - James C. West>: Paal, quick – one quick question and a follow-up which may be a bit longer but do you still
expect 10 percentage type international activity growth this year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes. That's roughly where we see it. No real change to what we said in January. About 10%
increase in international E&P spend.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay. Perfect. And as follow up, so if we think about international pricing you obviously cited
in six quarters of increased revenue per rig. One of your competitors this morning cited Saudi and the ramp up there as
a potential catalyst to create an inflection point. I know one of your other competitors has talked recently about – this is
the time now to raise pricing.
Are you seeing evidence from the competition in the market? I know you guys have been trying to push pricing for a
while here. Are you seeing evidence that your competitors are now on board with this and starting to push price
internationally?

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, in fairness, I haven't seen any significant change in behavior. I think we have moved on
from the nonsense pricing that we saw a few years back. But apart from that, no dramatic change in behavior from the
main players, as far as we've seen.
We have continually been able to drive revenue per rig which is kind of the overall pricing indicator that has to do with
new technologies sales, it has to do with the efficiency and it has to do with the overall quality of our operations. But in
terms of this pricing, other than testing pricing on small and medium-size bids with reasonable success, there hasn't
been any dramatic change and we still don't foresee any major inflection in 2013 based on where we stand today.

We'll go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go head.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hi, good morning, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: So, just to follow up on that question, there were obviously indications that at least the tone on
the international market has, at least from what I can pick up, drastically improved over the course of the last couple
quarters as it relates to the outlook. Schlumberger has been a strong international position for quite some time, and I
think your margins this quarter kind of demonstrate that prowess. As you go forward, are you picking up though that
there is an increase – any increase in sense of urgency at the customer base? And how do you envision Schlumberger
continuing to maintain the wide margin differentials that you've enjoyed over the last 10 years, 15 years?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well first of all I mean, we are maintaining our positive view on the international market,
which stems all the way back from last year, right? For reference, last year we grew revenue by 16% and operating
income 31% on the back of 8% growth in rig count, and this is really the kind of numbers we are aiming again for this
year. So overall, we haven't really changed our view on the international market. We're just consistently focusing on it,
and we're consistently delivering in that marketplace. And in terms of protecting our market differentiation or our
market lead, I mean, that's what we have been doing over the past 5 years, or 10 years or 15 years. There is nothing
really new there. We do that through the leverage of our size, our infrastructure, our local knowledge and the fact that
we've been in these markets for 50 years, 60 years, 70 years and also the fact that we have a strong focus on – excuse
me, execution, both from an efficiency and a quality standpoint. So it's really nothing new in terms of how we're going
about it. It is just – it is progressing quite fine in our view.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I know investors were trying to get their arms around the
joint venture that you did with Forest last week. I was just wondering if you might be able to take this opportunity to
give a perspective on that? And with my understanding being the key element here, are you trying to increase or
accelerate the uptake in technology in the U.S. market relative to what to what you've already seen internationally? So I
just wonder if you'd provide additional color around that?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, that's fair. So, if you look at our SPM product, we have been pursuing production
intensive type of contracts for a number of years, and today we are only about 10 of these SPM projects worldwide.
And these are generally a fee-per-barrel contract with no working interest. Now in recent years we have invested
significantly in the shale workflows and shale technologies. And this is all about taking a much more scientific
approach to drive production and recovery. Now our approach is used extensively in the pilot projects in the

international market. However, as we talked about before, the uptake is quite slow in the U.S. with the exception of
some key customers. So what we wanted to do was to create an SPM project in the U.S. to really have a showcase and
be able to demonstrate our capabilities.
The Forest deal became an opportunity, and initially we aim for the traditional SPM contract model here, that was not
workable for a variety of reasons. So the working interest was really the only solution to get the deal done. But it was
much more of a consequence rather than the objective of the deal. So is a one-off deal in terms of taking a working
interest, and we have no plans of pursuing this type of contract model further. But it's key – it's really key for us to
demonstrate our capabilities within the shale technologies and shale workflow and get a higher return on the significant
R&D investments we made into this area. So that's really the whole rationale for the deal.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: All right. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lamotte with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, if I could follow up on the SPM model, in particular,
what differentiates it from IPM and integrated our bundled services that your competitors might provide? You
mentioned fee-per-barrel, but what are the true characteristics in addition to the revenue model with respect to the
breadth of services and the ability to leverage the technology?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: If you look at the SPM model, we will then take full control in terms of operation and
decision-making when it comes to the fee development, rather as a subset of a fee or a complete fee. In the IPM
models, the overall decision making is still generally governed by the E&P company. So in the SPM model we get to
decide where to drill, how to drill, how to work over, and how to further invest into the field. And in the SPM model,
we will risk the value of our products and services in general and in some cases, also risk cash into the deal, but
predominantly it's the value of our products and services.
So that means that if we create incremental production, we will get paid and we will get paid also an upside beyond
what we have invested, but if we don't deliver incremental production, then obviously that is our problem. So it's
mainly the overall risk profile of the deal combined with the fact that we have complete sort of management control
over the operations within the SPM deal structure.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: And you mentioned in terms of – there are 10 projects globally right now, which
suggest to me that we're still pretty early in the evolution of this concept. Do you have an idea as to how big this market
could be? Or just from are resource limitation within Schlumberger, how big it could get over the next two years to
three years?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, it is a part of our business which we are looking to grow because it's highly accretive to
our margins if you look at the portfolio we have. But at the same time, it is resource intensive; the whole sales cycle is
quite long and also, we are very careful in terms of evaluating the project that we get ourselves into. So we are
interested in growing it in that traditional SPM model, but it's not – that it isn't – it is an area where we can afford to
kind of hurry slowly, so there's nothing that we're looking to ramp up dramatically.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Okay. But can we – is it fair to say that 10 projects could be 20 in the next two to three
years? Is that the trajectory that we seem to be on?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Probably not 20. If you look at reasonable size projects, we might look to add two, maybe
three a year. I would say that's probably the maximum at this stage.
<Q - Michael Kirk Lamotte>: Okay, great. Thanks so much.

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.

We'll go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. A quick question on North American margins; given the magnitude of
the drop in multiclient sales expected seasonally coupled with the Gulf of Mexico issues in Q1, I would've expected
margins to be a little bit more poorly behaved, and yet they were only flat to down. So what accounted for that
resilience quarter-on-quarter?
<A - Simon Ayat>: Well, I think it is still three things. Canada had a reasonable quarter, decent activity there, and the
breakup happened towards the end of the quarter as we were planning. Gulf of Mexico, although, there were delays in
deepwater operations, also posted, I would say, quite a strong quarter overall. Although it could've been better. And
then it's all about the approach we take to U.S. land, in particular, in pressure pumping: we are not pursuing share; we
are looking to protect margins and we are focusing in – very much on utilization and only taking on contract that meets
a certain return for us. So I think it's overall how we manage U.S. land and then we had a decent performances in both
Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, although multiclient sales were down quite significantly sequentially.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: With the reversal of the operational delays in Q1 in the Gulf of Mexico, also taking into
account breakup in Canada for the second quarter, what should we expect for North American margins in Q2? Still flat
to down? Or do they do get better than that?
<A - Simon Ayat>: Well, I would love for them to go up. I have to say that, but I think you pointed out the main items
here, right? So we will have continued pricing challenges on U.S. land. At the same time as we will have the Canada
breakup. Those are the negatives but then it's just a matter of how well we can manage within the overall U.S. land
operations as well as the progress we will make further in the Gulf of Mexico. I don't – and I would say, I don't expect a
significant improvement in margins in Q2. If we can hold them around where we are, I'll be quite pleased.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay. And then a point of clarification with regard to your narrative on your SPM business
model, if I understood you correctly, you basically take full operational control and that's the distinction between that
and IPM basically. On the Forest arrangement, if I read the press release correctly, Forest will continue to be the
operator? Is that correct?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, Forest will continue to be the operator. When I say operational control, we don't take on
operatorship in any of these deals, but we have a much more of a say in how we go about developing these fields.
Right? So there's always some dialogue with the E&P company who maintains operatorship but if you look at it from a
well construction type of contract, an IPM, where we are told well where to drill and we just go about drilling the well
there is much more of a dialogue around the entire development plan within an SPM project and we have a lot more a
say in how we go about doing that development.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: That's helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Paal, you noted – I mean a peer mentioned earlier today, and then you noted you don't believe
that the Saudi activity will lead to a pricing inflection in 2013. There was also mention that Saudi activity could lead to
higher activity by neighboring countries later this year and going into 2014 – higher activity than already today any
thoughts there?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, like I said before, I mean the overall Middle East area is looking quite strong. So you
have Saudi Arabia you have Iraq and also you have Kuwait and in the UAE which are also quite strong in terms of
year-over-year activity and how that business is progressing. So don't get me wrong, I would love to see an inflection in
pricing in 2013 it's just that I'm not at the stage where I can promise it at this stage. We will continue to test pricing and
to try to move things along because in our view there isn't a lot of spare capacity in the international market at this
stage. It's just that to predict that inflection which we all have been waiting for quite a few years, I'm not ready to do
that yet.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Fair enough. And then given that this work is gas versus oil as it was in last cycle. How do
you see the service intensity even though there's tight gas and unconventional but how you see the service intensity of
this growth in the rig count versus what we saw in the prior cycle?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Are you talking about Middle East or?
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Yes, in Saudi specifically.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, well, I think the service intensity in Saudi and also the neighboring countries there is
quite strong, both in gas as well as in liquids. There's a lot more deviated, again, extended reach in horizontal wells
both for gas and liquids. So I think overall service intensity is strong and it requires high-end technology and very solid
operational performance which again plays to our strengths.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Right. And then as an unrelated follow-up on the one source JV with Cameron, any further
insights on when we'll have the details on the structure of when the deal will close? And then has the team determined
how long do you think it will take to develop your own subsea separation unit?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, in terms of when we are looking to close the deal, we were hoping to do it in Q1 but it's
going now slide into Q2 as you see. Our goal would be to try to close in June. We're just getting the final regulatory
approvals from various countries. We have most of it sorted out by now but we are relatively confident we will get it
closed in Q2.
At that stage, we will then put the organization in place. There has been some limited discussions with Cameron on
how that's going to be. So I think we should be ready to hit the floor running as soon as we get the deal closed during
the quarter. And as to when we will get new technologies introduced and so forth, I think it's a bit premature for me to
comment on that at this stage. Other than that we will have quite aggressive R&D plans for the JV. We have some
significant objectives that we want to achieve but I think I'll hold off from commenting on that at this stage.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: All right. Fair enough. I'll turn it over. Thanks.

Thank you. We'll go to the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Well, thank you. Just a slightly higher level question on the press release there you mentioned that
the growth in North America oil production is being offset by other than OPEC – non-OPEC producers seeing decline
in production and as you expect spare capacities remain around current levels. Can you elaborate a little bit on this
statement put some – try to put some numbers around it if you feel confident about that?

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at spare capacity now I believe it's sitting around 4 million barrels. Right? So
we expect it to be around this level in the near-term barring any major macro events. And if you look at the whole
balance of supply and demand, the overall demand growth projected for this year is about 1 – just short of 1% or
800,000 to 900,000 barrels a day. Sort of offsetting that demand growth, is mainly the continued growth in North
American production and we don't expect any significant growth in the non-OPEC production outside of North
America and that leaves the quote on OPEC more or less unchanged. That's the main balancing that we are looking at,
at this stage, which is similar to what we talked about in January.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: And, so, in a historic context, would you say that this is a constructive backdrop? Or this the
backdrop which could sort of lead to some nervousness?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at 4 million barrels of spare capacity on about 90 million barrels of
production, it is around 4%. And it's still about 1 million barrels below where we stood prior to the Libya conflict.
Right? So I don't think this is an excessive spare capacity. I think if anything it's probably relatively tight.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Very good. Secondly, you mentioned the ability to upsell technology. We've all kind of seen the
headline numbers, let's use Brazil as an example. So, do you expect this fully to offset some of the pricing pressures on
recent contract signings? Let's say Latin America margins – do you expect to be able to hold those margins at this
level?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I can't guarantee quarter-to-quarter, but I would say that for all these large contracts that
we have been talking about for the past year, not just in Latin America but globally, we have an overall plan in terms of
how we bid for the basic technologies, which are generally comparable to our competitors. Then beyond that, for these
kind of medium to long-term contracts we have a plan of what new technologies will be introduced and added to the
contract base. And based on these technologies, which will bring significant value to our customers but also to us, we
are quite confident that we can make these contracts that were originally quite competitively bid into quite viable
contracts for us over the span of the contract term.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: So when we think about margins, if you look at your North American margin, very impressive level
at the moment, more or less in line with your international margins, what do you think you'll exit the year? With higher
North American margins? Or with high international margins relative to one another?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: It's a good question. If I was going to make a bet without really committing to it, I would say I
still expect our international margins will be higher than North America in terms of the exit this year.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. We will go to the line of Scott Gruber with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Coming back to the motivation for the Forest deal, the appetite for technology in the U.S.
onshore has always been low, but has there been any degradation to that demand? Have the E&Ps, as they move into
the harvest mode with these shales, and now that conventional services, service pricing is lower, has it actually
diminished the demand for technology in the U.S.? Is this a response to that?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No. I don't think it's going in that direction. I think what you'll find is that in the past we
haven't really had a significant focus on developing new and high-end technology that had, I would say, significant
application in North America. Now over the past five years, with a renewed focus we have on North America, we have

invested a lot more into these type of technologies. And what we are looking for now is just to try to accelerate the
penetration to get return on these investments. So there is no, I would say, reversal of the technology uptake. It's just
that we have a much broader and I would say much more interesting technology portfolio with applications in North
America, and we're quite eager to get these technologies further into the marketplace.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Great. And then turning back to the macro picture, Paal you mentioned that the backdrop
today remains constructive, even with a bit of a decline in crude price. One of the top concerns we hear is how long can
Schlumberger continue to grow at something close to 10% in a world of flat crude prices? How do you think about the
medium-term outlook for growth over the next, call it, three years? If crude prices are flat, can you still post top line
international growth that comes close to 10%?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes. We are still confident that we can do that, and I think there is obviously several ways that
we are pursuing this. We are obviously present in every market around the world, so we have kind of a very broad
growth opportunity. But one thing I think will be quite interesting from our side is that if you assume that crude prices
are going to stay flat, as you indicate, then I think there's going to be a need for our customers to look at driving more
costs out of the E&P value chain. And I would say integration, which I talked about today, has the potential to do that.
And also overall quality and efficiency of operations, which in many cases comes down to the size of the operation is
also going to be key. So I think we sit on several, I think, unique enablers that will allow us to be a very interesting
partner for the E&P companies, in terms of helping them drive overall costs out of their system and then basically
unlock more activity for us and more vote for us.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Great. Thanks.

Thank you. We'll go to the line of Jim Crandell with Cowen Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good Morning
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Paal, I know that Schlumberger is a company that of course pays a lot of attention to its
market shares around the world. Information evaluation, I was a little bit surprised to hear one of your two major
competitors on their call this morning say that in LWD, MWD they are the market leader now in revenues in both the
Gulf of Mexico and Norway. A; would you agree with this? And B; is this something that you have a plan to reverse?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, Jim, there's nothing to reverse. If there's anyone who is the leader in LWD in any place
around the world, its Schlumberger. So I don't think I'm really going to engage further into that question.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. I was surprised when I heard their response, but anyway. Secondly, could you
specifically talk about the Petrofac joint venture? And where you are in that? And additional work that could be
forthcoming there?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, so we're still engaged with Petrofac in evaluating SPM type of opportunities around the
world. We – we're still actively in dialogue with them. There is a number of sort of prospects that we are pursuing. The
overall sales cycle in these – for these projects is quite long, and the projects we're looking at with Petrofac is also
whether there is a balance between what is required from the subsurface, which is our strength, as well is what is
required from the surface, which is obviously their strength.
But that whole corporation agreement is still very much intact, and we are still engaged with them in pursuing global
opportunities.

Thank you. Next question is from Brad Handler with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Good morning. Could you please speak to – well, I guess the following issue, as it relates to
the second quarter?
So there was a traditional – in the non-North American markets, there is this traditional seasonal recovery. And if I look
at last second quarter, you had 9% sort of sequential revenue growth, and 40% type of sequential incremental margins.
And I guess I'm just curious whether or not there are some dynamics that happened in the first quarter this year that
might make that progression look different in the second quarter of this year?
For example, the progress in SPM, which might make the seasonal pick up a little less dramatic. Or in Latin America,
that might be the case. But, if you could speak to something in that dynamic and give us some perspective on the
second quarter, non-N.Am, that would be helpful?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, in terms of Q2 consensus, you know that we don't give guidance. I'm not going to start
with doing that, right?
But I would say that, generally, there's nothing dramatically different in our business today than what you saw year
ago. We expect good seasonal improvement in our earnings per share in Q2. As I mentioned several times during the
call here, international looks solid.
I think the main uncertainty continues to be the market evolution in North America land. And the main headwinds there
are going to be continued pressure on U.S. land, in terms of pricing, and the Canada breakup, right?
But overall, we expect to see a good seasonal improvement in earnings per share in Q2.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Fair enough. Okay, thanks. And on an unrelated follow-up, please, I just happened to notice
significant pickup in working capital in Q1, which looks like it stemmed from a sizable reduction in payables.
Could you speak to that a little bit? What was driving that? And perhaps give us some visibility on how cash might
flow from working capital for the balance of year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I will hand that to Simon.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Right.
<A - Simon Ayat>: So as you mentioned, in Q1, normally it's a bit of a pressure on our working capital.
One of the reasons is actually the year-end compensation for our employees, related to incentives and bonuses, that
takes place in Q1 funding of pensions and others. So this is a major deterioration that took place on the working capital.
As far as the rest of the year, we expect to have pretty good performance on collections as we progress during the year.
CapEx, as I said, is $3.9 billion. And we will continue to buy back to compensate for the increase – or the stock reissue
in relation to the stock-based compensation.
So, no. We think that, going forward into the year, the cash situation will improve.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Okay. And then just to clarify what I think I just heard you say, you're sort of – the starting
point philosophy on share repurchase is to cover what will be issued in shares as comp?
<A - Simon Ayat>: Correct. And any – as we always said, any excess cash over a period of time, we'll return it to our
shareholders. But the bottom level will be to compensate for the creep in the number of shares, yes.

Thank you. Next question is from Jeff Tillery with Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hi, guys. I guess, seeing as you're in China, you highlight China in one of the recent investor
presentations – could you help us think about – I guess, one, size in the market for you guys today? The growth rate
you guys are achieving? You'd given us a little snapshot on Iraq recently as well. Any color you can provide on China
would be very helpful.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, China for us is one of our fastest-growing GeoMarkets. We are seeing a lot more
opportunity emerging here over the past one or two years.
The offshore business, we have always been strong in, and that continues to grow. But we see a lot more opening up of
the land business here, and partly in terms of complex conventional land developments, where we are working with our
traditional Chinese customers. But also as the shale is opening up to a lot of nontraditional customers, there is
significantly higher market potential for us, even in that market.
So we are quite – I would say bullish, in terms of the overall growth potential and the growth rate that we expect
coming out of China. And that's why we, over the past 12 months to 18 months, have been trying to – I would say
improve or extend our positioning in the country. And we continue to invest into the business there, both in terms of
capacity but also how we JV and partner with local players.
So overall, China is way up there with the – for the highest-growth regions that we expect in the next couple of years.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: The unrelated follow-up that I have was just around Venezuela – the release. And then you
reiterated today – discussed ramping-up of activity.
Could you just give us some color on this? Kind of anything on the order of magnitude or timing of that? Is that a
late-this-year event? And then will there be any incremental disclosure around receivables here in the Q1, 2Q?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: We're not going to disclose anything further on receivables beyond what we did in January.
Our collections has improved in Venezuela during the quarter. As I mentioned, we have had a very good dialogue with
PDVSA. The key thing here is that we're expecting to finalize this payment agreement in the near future. And we are
basically ready to ramp up activity to meet the needs of PDVSA.
The magnitude of that, we are still discussing. They have a significant resource base in Venezuela, and they have the
need for our products and services. And when we get the payment agreement in place, we are very much ready to
support them with what they need.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: All right. Thank you very much.

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes. If I first look at Q1, in marine, the Q1 [indiscernible] (52:53) utilization improved
sequentially. So that was good news. And going forward, we are still quite – I would say optimistic in terms of how the
year is evolving.
In marine seismic, we have now the majority of our capacity booked for Q2 and Q3.
In terms of pricing, we're still operating at more or less the same pricing levels that we saw in 2012, which is about
10% to 15% higher than what we saw in 2011, right?
So for the small remaining part of the capacity that is yet to be filled out for Q2 and Q3, we will obviously continue to
test pricing further. But overall, we're looking at strong utilization for the next couple of quarters. Pricing hasn't moved
significantly from where we were last year, but it's still looking quite good.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Okay, great. And in terms of new supply coming in, over the next two years to three years, are
you seeing any red flags? Any other signs of stability? Or you feel confident about the longer-term or intermediate-term
outlook, given some of the capacity adds.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Are you talking about marine seismic?
<Q - Waqar Syed>: That's right. Yeah.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I'm not really overly concerned about any overcapacity at this stage.
There are new builds being planned that will enter into the market. We have two new vessels under construction. But
these are generally high-capacity vessels, I think, for the overall industry, meaning twelve or more streamers. And
generally these will likely replace smaller vessels or [ph] six streamer (54:33) vessels.
So I'm not really overly concerned about overcapacity at this stage. Our new-build vessels remain on schedule. We'll
get delivery on the two of them in 2014.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Okay. And then just one finally on your deal with Forest. What is your capital commitment in the
coming years for development program there?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I don't have the details about the capital commitments over the coming year. So I think we're
going to have to back to you with that. But the overall deal is not very significant, in terms of size, right?
I think – like I said, the main motivation behind the deal is to create a showroom of what we can do, in terms of shale
technology and shale work flows in the U.S. So I think the overall headline the deal is getting versus the size of it and
impact to Schlumberger, I think, is sort of a little bit over-dimensioned at this stage.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Mostly over services.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: And yeah, what we will contribute is generally going to be in kind, in terms of the value of our
products and services.

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No. I'm quite pleased with how we are maintaining – how we're maintaining share in that. We
have separate teams that are aiming at securing – I would say contract and capacity on these rigs for the services that
this is kind of relevant for. A lot of it has to do with cementing obviously.
So we have teams dedicated that basically pursues the new build owners to make sure we get our share of the market
for whatever we can capture, prior to these rigs are coming out in the market, and where we enter into the traditional
bidding sequence.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Okay. And I was also curious about the pricing dynamic here. Is it super-competitive?
Are you pleased with the pricing levels you are achieving on all these deepwater-related contracts?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, I think if you look at the overall performance of our deepwater operations, both in terms
of growth, in terms of market share, in terms of margin – it's all highly accretive to the overall business that we have.
So it really comes down to the broad technology offering we have and the highly differentiated execution capabilities
we have for this type of environment, which is really what Schlumberger is all about.
So I'm quite pleased with how we're progressing in Deepwater, and it's a highly accretive part of our business.
<Q - Robin E. Shoemaker>: Right. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.

Thank you. And our last question comes from Turner Holm with RS Platou. Please go ahead.
<Q - Turner Holm>: Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Actually my question was partially answered but I just
wanted to question you on the seismic fleet utilization.
It looks like you guys have been running at about 70% in Q4, and that moves to about 75% in Q1, from the data that we
have. First of all, are these numbers about ballpark correct? And if so, if that lower utilization relative to your peers is
kind of a function of switching over to isometrics?
I guess what I'm getting at is would you expect utilization to improve from these low levels here, as you move
throughout the year? And when you combine that with price increases and the isometrics premium, could you see
seismic have a meaningful impact from here?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Firstly, I don't think I would validate all your utilization numbers. Our Q1 utilization is higher
than what you indicated.
Although in Q1 we did have a fair bit of transiting. We had a few dockings and also some permitting delays. But
overall, utilization in Q1 was reasonable and it was higher than the number that you indicated.

In terms of isometrics, it's still early days in terms of where we stand with isometrics. We have one vessel fully
converted to isometrics today, and it showed its first survey in South Africa during the quarter. And we actually have
still downtime on the vessel there.
So our further plans for isometrics is that we will convert another vessel this year, and a further two vessels in 2014.
So we have a service plan for both our vessels this year. The one that did the survey in South Africa is now shooting a
survey up in the Bering Sea, and it'll move on to Eastern Canada after that. Beyond that, we also have a fair bit of North
Sea work for the other vessel lined up.
So the uptake is quite strong. But I think it's also important that we get the full set of results analyzed, together with our
customers, before we really start talking about what the pricing premium should be. But the fact that there should be
quite a decent pricing premium on these type of measurements, I think, is beyond – it is very clear.
So it's still early days, but we're progressing – I'd say quite well and in line with our plan, when it comes to isometrics.
<Q - Turner Holm>: Okay. And just one quick related follow up.
On the multiclient outlook, I guess we saw multiclient sales tick down to 175 this quarter. I believe first quarter last
year was about 215. And I know multiclient bounces around a bit. But what can you say about 2013 relative to 2012 on
the multiclient there?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, at this stage we expect there will be good progression in overall multiclient sales in 2013
over 2012 but these things vary a bit from quarter to quarter. And Q1 was obviously down sequentially but it was down
slightly as you indicate, somewhat down from Q1 of last year but overall we had a very strong library and I'm quite
convinced the overall sales from our library in 2013 is going to be up from 2012.
<Q - Turner Holm>: Okay. All right, thanks, guys. I'll turn it back.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
