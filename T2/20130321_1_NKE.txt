MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NIKE's Fiscal 2013 Third Quarter Conference Call. For those who need to
reference today's press release, you'll find it at http://investors.nikeinc.com. Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice
President, Treasury and Investor Relations.
Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, please let me remind you that participants on the call will make forward-looking
statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in our reports filed with the SEC
including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q.
Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues
for subsequent periods due to the mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations,
discounts, and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.
In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including
equipment; NIKE Golf, Converse, and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales.
References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market
footprints of the brands owned by NIKE Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.
Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial
measures. Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP
measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website, http://investors.nikeinc.com.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations.

Thank you, operator. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE's fiscal 2013 third quarter
results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find
the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago at our website
investors.nikeinc.com.
Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker; followed by Charlie Denson, President
of the NIKE Brand; and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an
in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like
to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your
initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to
re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this.
I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker.
Mark G. Parker
Thanks Kelley, and hello everybody. I feel good about Q3, another very strong quarter for NIKE. Our results show the
power of our strategy to manage the pace and the quality of growth. NIKE, Inc. third quarter revenues were up 9% on a
reported basis and up 10% on a currency neutral basis. That growth was well-balanced across most of our brands, key
categories and geographies. Gross margin grew 30 basis points versus prior year, better than projected and diluted
earnings per share outpaced revenue growth, up 20% to $0.73.
Those are outstanding results that illustrate the value of having deep and genuine connections to athletes. We learn
from them and they inspire us and our results show that consumers continue to see the value of products that deliver
innovation and iconic style which is really at the heart of what we do at NIKE. This focus on delivering consumer right
products and services has helped us continue to drive growth even in uncertain economic times.
We have a very powerful portfolio of businesses and resources and we manage every piece of our business individually
and as a collective. We know that not all areas of the business will grow at the same pace or at the same time. What
we're able to do is leverage the strongest parts of the business to fund investments in long-term growth across the
portfolio. We also focus on managing the levers of the profit equation, balancing revenue growth, gross margin
expansion and cost.
Our goal is to deliver consistent profitable growth at the NIKE, Inc. level, even though there will be variability in the
individual components. That is the nature of a globally diverse business. My leadership team and I remain laser focused
on managing the portfolio to capture the opportunities it creates. This was on full display in Q3.
The NIKE Brand continues to expand the market and gain share in North America, incredible performance from our
biggest sport businesses across almost the entire category offense.
In China, we're seeing progress against our strategy to reset the marketplace, but we still have more to do before we can
capture its long-term growth potential.
In Europe, we're still in the early stages of implementing the category offense. Not every country will grow at the same
pace, but there is a good momentum for NIKE in Germany, the U.K., and in the developing markets of Central and
Eastern Europe. I continue to see tremendous potential for growth in Europe over the long-term.
And Converse is connecting with young people on a local level around the world, delivering 12% growth in Q3. As you
know, over the last two years, we've converted to owned distribution in the U.K. and China, and we're seeing strong
results for Converse in both those markets as we take more control of our brand, distribution, and product assortment.
If you know me at all, and most of you do, you know that my roots are in design and I'm an unabashed product geek.
So I want to share a small glimpse, just a sample of what we delivered in Q3 and what you can expect going forward.

NIKE Flyknit is a technology that created a lot of excitement right out of the gate with athletes and consumers. We're
already broadening its base across categories and we're blending it with other technologies to achieve new levels of
performance, like you see in the NIKE Flyknit Lunar1+ running shoe. At the same time, we're able to reduce our
environmental footprint, tremendous potential in NIKE Flyknit for the near and the long-term impact across the
company.
The Mercurial Vapor IX football boot is the latest iteration in a franchise we started 15 years ago. Today, like then, it's
the lightest, fastest and most ambitious boot design we've ever done. And we've advanced three of the most successful
shoe franchises in history. The AIR JORDAN XX8 delivered iconic style and new plate technology. We've added five
new styles to the Air Force 1 family. Then the Air Max 2013 shoe signaled a reemergence for NIKE Air as the standard
in impact protection.
We even used the 3D printer to create a state-of-the-art cleated outsole that was used in competition at the NFL
Combine, where seven of the top fastest times were run in that cleat; unbelievable. Footwear is really wide open at
NIKE and so is apparel.
Our NIKE Pro and Pro Combat base layer and protection products are the most innovative in the industry. NIKE
Sphere, Dri-FIT Knit, Hyperwarm and Hypercool are game changers in athletic apparel. And we're ramping up those
investments in apparel performance innovation and it's really paying off in the marketplace.
In short we are flowing amazing products, services and experiences through the innovation pipeline and that's always
been my top priority as CEO and it's the source of NIKE's consistent growth over the long-term.
Looking ahead, there are some amazing opportunities for NIKE and I will highlight a few. First, let's look at digital
technology. As I've said before, it's really an amplifier of what NIKE does and it helps dimensionalize the business in
three important ways; digitally enabled products and services, digital brand connections and e-commerce, and we're
executing on those opportunities right now.
In the longer term, digital at NIKE is really a catalyst for innovation. It's the currency we use to invest and grow the
business the same way NikeFuel points is the currency of movement we use to inspire athletes.
And more immediately, digital helps us realize our vision for e-commerce. In Q3 our online business grew 33%,
outpacing the growth in our total DTC business and for total NIKE, Inc. We've delivered strong double-digit results in
our e-commerce business every quarter for the past five years.
That said, I'm not satisfied, right now e-commerce is a relatively small portion of our total revenue. There is a pretty
big gap between where e-commerce is today and where we can take it. So, we're driving more innovation into the
shopping experience, elevating the level of service, and expanding customization online. At the same time, we are
simplifying the user experience, making it easier to find and buy our products. I can assure you, given the size of the
opportunity; everyone on the leadership team shares my sense of urgency around e-commerce.
Second, let's look at Brazil, a place we've been doing business in for the past 20 years. I was there just last week in Rio
and Sao Paulo and the excitement is obvious, incredible pride and anticipation ahead of World Cup next year and the
Olympics in 2016. I'm really looking forward to working with those athletes, teams and federations. These events are
special in the world and they serve as inspiration points to push the boundaries of what's possible in innovation. They
bring out the best of us at NIKE, they always have and they always will.
And that brings me to the final thought, something not typically discussed on our earnings call, and that's the idea of
serving human potential. I was in Chicago recently with First Lady Michelle Obama to help launch Let's Move! Active
Schools. NIKE is pledging $50 million as part of our ongoing commitment to broadening access to sports and helping
reverse the crisis of physical inactivity for kids.
I mention it for a couple of reasons. First, it's a very important personal commitment and I want to do whatever I can to
support it to raise awareness and serve as a catalyst for others to get involved in this important issue. And second, it
speaks to the core of who we are as a company. Our mission statement focuses on innovation and inspiration because

that's how we help athletes realize their full potential.
We also take an important cue from our Co-Founder, Bill Bowerman who said, if you have a body you are an athlete.
It's a statement of inclusion and it's a rejection of limits, whether they're self-imposed or put on us by others. And I
believe that physical activity is an incredibly powerful way to help people overcome those limits and live a stronger
fuller life.
So as we move through Q4, I'm inspired by the work we're doing at NIKE. Management team and the people they lead
truly are the best in the industry and that's good, because the changes we're seeing in the world are fast and they are
massive and so are the opportunities. That's why I'm glad to be at NIKE, and so confident about our future.
Thanks everyone and here's Charlie.
Charles D. Denson
Thanks Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. Well, my focus today is on one of the biggest strengths of the NIKE Brand,
specifically the category offense, and how it drives growth across products and our key markets. You saw that reflected
in our financial results for the quarter. On a constant currency basis NIKE Brand global revenue was up 10%. We saw
growth across most key categories and geographies. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 23%, driven by 12% comp
store growth and a strong increase of online sales of 33%. Footwear grew at 9% rate and apparel grew at 8%, global
futures were up 7%.
There is a common story inside these results and across every category in the NIKE Brand. First, there are huge
opportunities for NIKE to grow and second, we get after that growth in three very specific ways; innovative product,
strong consumer connections, and premium distribution. These are the three pillars to our growth strategy and we
leverage them in every NIKE Brand category and markets throughout our diverse portfolio of businesses.
I highlight this on every call because it's critical to our success. One of the most exciting parts of our business right now
is running. In Q3, running revenue grew double-digits for the 13th quarter in a row and the futures are up double-digits
in nearly every geography. We're on a roll. But the question people ask, is can we keep it up? We think the simple
answer is, yes. And here's why I'm confident about that.
Two main reasons; running participation continues to grow around the world and we continue to develop and introduce
new and compelling products.
Let's start with NIKE Free and Lunar, unique technology platforms that resonate with runners around the world. Then
there's NIKE Flyknit. We're just getting started here – less labor, virtually no waste. As we scale and expand our
offerings, it adds a new dimension for running and potential to expand to additional categories.
Next, the Air Max 2013; it demonstrates the tremendous potential of the NIKE Air franchise – excuse me – the Air
Max franchise and NIKE Air cushioning and we are designing and engineering both to take cushioning to a completely
new level, which will energize NIKE Air across all categories. And that's just footwear.
Running apparel is growing at a similar rate driven by our Dri-FIT technology and premium apparel styles, which has
been one of the fastest-growing segments for the overall running category. We also continue to see very strong results
in our women's running business as well.
The final piece that gives us confidence that running will continue to grow is our complementary position with our
sportswear. For most average runners, it's more than just an activity, it's a lifestyle and we have the breadth and depth
of innovation to serve their every need and to grow this business going forward. Bottom line, running is not a trend at
NIKE, it's a commitment. And when we help runners train, compete, and express, we win.
So let's go to basketball. It's another strong business for us and growing bigger and more global every day. We see a ton
of potential in basketball and where we see potential, that's where we invest.

Over the last decade, we've been getting to know some special athletes. It started back in 2003, when we signed Kobe
Bryant, LeBron James, and Carmelo Anthony. We thought it could be the early beginning of a resurgence in basketball.
Then came something we didn't, or we hadn't seen since the game changing era of Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley,
and Scottie Pippen in 1990s. We added the talents of Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, and Russell Westbrook
to the NIKE team. It's a pretty special group.
Now, as we watch this group move into their prime, basketball is again one of the most compelling sports around the
world. Their time has come and we're in a great position to take advantage of it.
We saw in London with the men's and women's U.S. teams taking gold. We're witnessing greatness as LeBron and the
Miami Heat, push the limits of records that have stood for decades. As we speak, yes as we speak, March Madness is
shifting into high gear. All of it, setting viewership records worldwide, not just here in the U.S.
Our marquee styles from Kobe, LeBron, and Kevin Durant, sell through faster than ever. We feel great about our
ability to expand our success with additional sportswear businesses in both footwear and apparel. In the Jordan Brand,
we're getting even more aggressive on the performance side of the business. In a game full of icons, there is no stronger
one-two punch than NIKE Basketball and the Jordan Brand. Needless to say we are very excited about the future of our
basketball business.
So just like we leverage the diversity of our key categories, we also leverage, market opportunity and our geographic
portfolio. Mark mentioned Western Europe; that landscape remains a bit uneven, but we saw a strong growth in the
quarter with revenues up 8%. The northern territories are showing some real energy, but the south, specifically Italy
and Iberia, will take longer to gain their footing as economic challenges remain.
That said, we continue to see tremendous growth potential for Western Europe long-term and our efforts so far in
transforming the marketplace to align with category offense are proving us out.
Our emerging markets continue to increase revenue and expand opportunity, delivering 8% currency neutral revenue
growth for the quarter. Great potential for continued growth in this geography as you can see for our futures numbers,
which were up 16%.
Mark mentioned Brazil, which I'm especially excited about as we gear up for the World Cup, which is now just 15
short months away. Of course, our biggest geography is North America. In Q3, North America delivered another
powerful quarter; revenues up 18%. NIKE's performance in this market continues to outperform expectations.
How big can this market get? I guess that's a good question, but it's not the one we ask. We focus on building healthy,
sustainable, and profitable businesses, and we do that by investing where the greatest growth opportunities exist.
North America is a big business for us. We talk about it as one business, but in reality, it's a portfolio of businesses.
And we look at every part of the business as a leverage opportunity to grow the NIKE Brand. I think the biggest
strength of our North American business is our ability to run a complete offense.
We drive very strong performance in our running, basketball, and men's training categories, and that's something we
certainly feel good about. But I'm equally confident in areas where we have even more room to run; women's training,
sportswear, digital products and services, apparel, and e-commerce. They all represent material growth opportunities
for the brand.
It's a pretty impressive portfolio. It gives us great flexibility and adaptability to serve consumer demand and address a
very competitive marketplace and we still see opportunities to continue to transform the marketplace along the line of
that category offense we talked about. The NIKE Brand is stronger and more relevant than ever before in North
America and growing. Our distribution continues to get deeper, more targeted and more productive. I have tremendous
confidence in these fundamentals. They continue to make North America a great opportunity for NIKE and they are a
blueprint – excuse me, a blueprint for growth around the world.

So next step, let me talk a little bit about China. On the last call, we talked about our strategy for China. How we're
continuing to adapt and elevate our apparel products, investing in brand connections with consumers and improving
productivity at retail. This strategy represents a comprehensive and balanced approach to resetting this important
market.
Near term, we're continuing to focus on aggressively clearing inventory from the marketplace. In Q3 we've introduced
improved merchandizing assortments in our DTC doors delivering mid-teen comp store sales growth.
Our wholesale partners continue to report they are seeing some positive comp store growth as well, and in some partner
doors where we've transformed the spaces to align with our category offense we are seeing comp store results that
significantly outpace the rest of the fleet.
While we continue to see progress, we still have work to do to clean up the market. At the same time we're taking a
harder look at our supply into the China market. This means re-phasing product flow and closely managing
cancellations and at-once orders to more tightly controlled volume of product going into the market. As a result of these
efforts, reported revenues for China will look different than our Q3 futures might indicate.
As we work to manage inventory, we also continue to focus on improving productivity and sell-through, which are the
core sustainable growth long-term. Specifically, we'll continue transforming doors to align with the category offense
and increase focus on product assortments that are deeper in fewer categories.
Most importantly, we continue to invest in our brand and our relationship with the Chinese consumer. All of these
efforts are going to take some time and so we are being aggressive where we can and patient where we must. Our
purpose and our opportunity is to create a strong pull market. We do that by being the most exciting and relevant brand,
the creator of the most important innovation and a source for the most exciting retail. China is an important part of
Nike's long-term growth goals. That's why we are not taking any shortcuts in China. We will take the time to do it right.
So, in all, Q3 was a very strong quarter for the NIKE Brand, but as you know, we don't focus on one quarter or
category or event. We will always stay focused on building the brand and the business for the long-term and taking
advantage of our biggest opportunities for the short-term. Everybody at NIKE knows the goals and the strategy and
we're all working together to get better, stronger and more profitable in every dimension of the business. That's why
we're confident about the future.
Thanks and here is Don.
Donald W. Blair
Thanks, Charlie. I'd like to start by outlining three characteristics of NIKE that we believe underpin our valuations.
First, our track record of delivering consistent growth in revenue, earnings and cash returns to shareholders. Second,
our long-term growth opportunities and our proven ability to realize them. And third, the diversification, discipline and
financial strength to effectively manage risk.
Our third quarter results vividly illustrate each of these characteristics. In Q3, we delivered strong growth, revenue
grew 9%, up 10% on a currency neutral basis, while earnings per share for the quarter grew 20%. Our return on
invested capital expanded to 23% and for the quarter, we returned over $400 million to shareholders in the form of
share repurchases and dividends.
At the same time we continue to strengthen our long-term growth prospects by deepening our connections with
consumers along each of the dimensions of our business: brands, categories, geographies and product types, enabling
us to grow even in highly penetrated segments. As both Mark and Charlie described, we delivered an unprecedented
level of innovation to the market in Q3 and consumers are responding.
Finally, Q3 demonstrated our capacity to manage risk. As Mark indicated, our goal is delivering sustainable profitable
growth. That requires continuous adjustment to changes in the global economy and the business environment. We do
this by leveraging the strongest parts of our portfolio to fund investments in others. We do it by managing all of our

financial levers to deliver near-term profitability and invest for the future, and we do it by maintaining financial
discipline and a strong balance sheet to provide flexibility in a volatile environment.
With that introduction, I'll recap Q3 results for our continuing operations. Third quarter revenue for NIKE, Inc. and the
NIKE Brand grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, while our other businesses grew 9%. On a reported basis, futures
grew 6%. Excluding the impact of currency changes, futures advanced 7%, driven by 4% growth in units and a 3 point
increase in average price.
Currency neutral futures were higher for all geographies, except Western Europe, which fell 5% versus a strong prior
year, driven by the Euro Champs and Olympics. Futures for Greater China were up 3%, reflecting the timing of fall
orders and strong growth in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Futures for Mainland China were flat. As I'll discuss in a moment,
we do not believe Greater China futures orders are indicative of the revenue growth we expect to realize for this
geography in Q4.
Third quarter diluted EPS grew 20% to $0.73 driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion as well as
the lower tax rate and share count. Q3 gross margin increased 30 basis points versus last year as higher prices and
easing raw material costs more than offset the impact of labor cost inflation, higher discounts, FX headwinds and shifts
in our business mix to lower margin geographies.
Gross margin for the quarter was better than we anticipated as a shift in mix to higher margin products more than offset
higher discounts and reserves in China. Demand creation grew 5% for the quarter, below the rate of revenue growth
due largely to the timing of spending across quarters, particularly Q1 investments focused on the Euro Champs,
Olympics, and NFL launch.
Operating overhead grew 11% for the quarter due to growth in our higher gross margin, higher cost DTC business, as
well as continued investments to support our innovation and growth initiatives. The effective tax rate for Q3 was
22.8%, compared to 27.7% in Q3 of last year. The decrease is largely due to a lower effective tax rate for foreign
operations and the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit which provided a one-time benefit of $0.02 per
share. For Q4 and the full year, we expect an effective tax rate of about 25.5%.
Q3 inventories for NIKE, Inc. and the Nike Brand each grew 4% versus last year, well below the rate of revenue and
futures growth. Overall inventory levels are healthy as the proportion of closeouts is roughly in line with the prior year.
Our main area of focus for inventory management continues to be China, as we take action to balance supply and
demand at retail. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with $4 billion of cash and short-term investments on the
books at quarter end.
Now, let's take a look at our performance by segment starting with China. Q3 revenue for Greater China declined 10%
on a constant currency basis and fell 9% on a reported basis. EBIT decreased 20%. We are continuing to take decisive
actions to reestablish a pull market in China and our Q3 results reflect the impact of those actions, as both revenue and
gross margin were below the prior year.
As Charlie indicated, we are seeing some early signs that our strategies are taking hold. While we are making progress,
we are not done and we will continue to work with our retailers to right-size inventory, accelerate sell-through and
improve retail productivity. Consistent with our accounting policies, we've made provisions for expected returns and
discounts in our Q3 results and we will be tightening the amount of product we ship into the market over the next few
quarters. As a result, we expect Q4 reported revenues for Greater China will be lower than the future's orders would
indicate.
On our last conference call, we said we expected repositioning our business would take time and that revenues and
EBIT for Greater China would be below prior year levels for a few quarters. That's still our expectation and the NIKE,
Inc. guidance I give you in a moment will include our most current thinking.
At NIKE, we are focused on driving growth that's brand-accretive, sustainable, and profitable. We are absolutely
confident we are taking the right actions to extend our brand leadership in China and return our business to growth.

At the other end of the scale is North America where Q3 revenue grew 18% on both a reported and currency neutral
basis. Footwear revenue increased 15% and apparel revenue grew 22%. Strong growth in basketball, men's training,
running, and sportswear fueled the increase. Direct-to-consumer revenue grew 19%, driven by 12% comp store sales
growth. Q3 EBIT for North America grew 24% as revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and SG&A leverage all
contributed to increased profitability.
In Western Europe, Q3 revenue increased 8% on both a reported and currency neutral basis. Wholesale revenue grew in
all territories except Italy and Iberia where currency neutral revenues declined 17% and 29%, respectively. DTC
revenue grew 24%, driven by strong comp store growth in both inline and factory stores.
On a category basis, growth in Western Europe was led by running and basketball, which both grew double-digits for
the fourth quarter in a row, and sportswear, which posted high single-digit growth. Q3 EBIT for Western Europe grew
19%, driven by revenue growth, higher gross margin, and SG&A leverage.
In Central and Eastern Europe, revenue increased 13% on a currency neutral basis, powered by particularly strong
results in Russia and Turkey. Revenues were higher in nearly every key category, led by running, women's training,
sportswear and football. On a reported basis revenue for CEE grew 16% and EBIT increased 18% driven by revenue
growth and gross margin expansion.
Results in Japan continue to be mixed. Q3 result – revenue fell 6% on a currency neutral basis, largely as a result of
steps we are taking to segment the market and significantly lower closeout sales but currency neutral futures grew 5%.
Although reported revenue for Japan decreased 13%, reflecting the weaker yen, EBIT was flat, driven by gross margin
expansion.
Our emerging markets geography delivered solid growth in Q3 as revenue grew 8% on a currency neutral basis.
Growth was broad-based as revenues were up in every category except sportswear and nearly every territory grew. Our
Q3 results in Korea and Argentina were somewhat weaker than the rest of the geography due in part to macroeconomic
conditions in those markets. Nevertheless, currency neutral futures grew 16%, indicating continued strength in this
geography.
On a reported basis, Q3 revenue for emerging markets grew 6% while EBIT grew 3% as gross margin expansion was
more than offset by increased investments in SG&A. The third quarter revenues for our other businesses increased 9%
on both a reported and currency neutral basis driven by growth at Converse and NIKE Golf. EBIT for the group
increased 23%, driven by revenue growth and improved gross margins for all three businesses.
Looking forward, our expectations for fiscal 2013 remain largely unchanged, but our guidance reflects updated
expectations for China and the phasing of growth across Q3 and Q4. For revenue, we continue to expect full-year
reported revenue to grow at a mid to high single-digit rate. For Q4, we expect reported revenue to grow at a mid-single
digit rate as we anniversary strong revenues in last year's Q4, which benefited from the Euro Champs, Olympics and
NFL launch.
For gross margin, we continue to expect fiscal 2013 will be roughly in line with the prior year. For Q4, we now expect
expansion of approximately 50 basis points, reflecting updated projections for product mix as well as discounts and
reserves in China. We continue to expect full-year SG&A to grow at a high single to low double-digit rate, reflecting
mid-single digit growth in Q4, as we anniversary heavy demand creation investments in last year's fourth quarter.
While we haven't yet completed our planning for fiscal 2014, we can provide some initial thoughts. Given the strength
of our brands and the innovations we'll be bringing to consumers, we expect to see full-year revenue growth at or
slightly above our high single-digit target range and EPS growth approaching our long-term mid-teens target. We'll
provide more visibility to our FY2014 expectations when we report our yearend results in June.
As always, we're focused on managing our portfolio and our financial model to deliver profitable growth and
shareholder returns in the near-term investing to realize our future potential and managing risk in a volatile
environment. The strength of our brand and our businesses puts us on track to finish a strong fiscal 2013 and positions
us well for continued profitable growth in fiscal 2014 and beyond.

We're now ready to take your questions.
Kelley Hall
Operator, can you please queue the first question?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Bob Drbul with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Hi. Good evening.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hi, Bob.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Hi. I guess the two questions that I have – the first one, can you elaborate a little more just sort of
how out of whack you feel like the China market is with the supply and demand and sort of how much more work you
really have on the inventory side? And the second one just quickly is on Western Europe, like the footwear business
you are still very, very strong this quarter. Just elaborate a little more on the running – what's driving those businesses
right now? Thank you.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Hi, Bob. This is Charlie. I'll take the China one first. I don't know if I'd categorize it as out
of whack, but I think what we see in China is just that it's still a very robust marketplace. We still believe in it
long-term and it's a matter of cleaning up some of the inventory that we have in there and then moderating the flow
that's going in, so that we are pulling it out and pushing in at the right pace to get us back to that pull market.
I will just go back to the three things that we are really focused on and that's continuously building a great brand that
we can obviously use as a launching pad for the future. It's going to be grounded in performance and we are going to
have a premium position in the marketplace.
The second would be just the product, some of the product issues that we've talked about, primarily in apparel with
some of the fit issues. We feel like we're starting to get some of that addressed and some of the new product is finding
its way into the market and performing well. And then finally, just around the distribution piece and making sure that
we've got a great consumer experience there that we have – and part of that consumer experience is obviously finding
what you are looking for in the right size, in the right color. So a lot of that has to do with product flow and a little bit
narrower presentation in each of the different retail spaces.
And I think where we started to transform some of those spaces, as we referred to earlier, some of the results are
significantly better than what we're seeing across the rest of the fleet. So we are still very optimistic on the long-term.
We feel like we have a good handle on where we are at and what we need to do and we are just going to get after it.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Second question was on footwear in Western Europe?
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Western Europe, yes.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Yeah I think – and there I think again it's a little bit of a tale of the north and the south. The
challenges are in the south with Iberia and Italy, but we are – we have a great performance story in running. And we're
even starting to see some interest in basketball in Western Europe. But it's really being driven by the running business.
Then we had a very nice response to some of the new introductions of our sportswear – footwear business as well.
Those are the two things that are driving most of the Western European success right now.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yeah. I'm going to just jump in and add Germany is performing quite well for us, footwear
and just overall. The business there, the strength of the brand, the flow of the product, the reaction from the consumers
has really been real strong. So, the U.K. and Germany are really leading the charge in Western Europe.

And just a comment on footwear in general. I think we're doing a – we always set a high bar, but we are doing a better
job I think at leveraging our innovation across multiple categories. Charlie mentioned the new Max technology which
has been incredible to sell through on that product and we are able to leverage that across multiple categories as we
move forward. The Lunar, the Flyknit, the Free, some of the other platforms that we have been investing in, we are
starting to see those really resonate across multiple categories. And then the balance between both performance in
sportswear and footwear is actually quite impressive, what we call complete offense. I think you see that complete
offense really taking shape in footwear between performance and sportswear.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Thanks, Bob.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: All right, Bob.

And your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hey, Robby.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Hi, Robby.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Hey, two quick questions. The first is, just – could you give us a little more color on the
futures orders – maybe the balance of the futures, you know, and the window for the global number? Was it constant
for the window ahead or weighted towards the front half? And then the revenue guidance for fiscal 2014 implies pretty
healthy futures orders continue – the comparisons are a little easier than what we just saw and am I thinking about that
the right way? And the second question is, Don, can you give us some more – a little color on the gross margin
thoughts around that fiscal 2014 guidance you gave us? Thanks.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Okay. Well with respect to the futures we announced today, they are more back loaded and
you would expect that because we are overlapping the pretty heavy sales numbers, big sales numbers we had in last
year's fourth quarter behind the European Championships and the Olympics and the NFL launch. So the futures are
back loaded in the window.
As far as FY 2014 is concerned, Robby, as you know, we are going to give you most of the color commentary on that
in June. So I don't want to get in too deep with that. But what I would say is, we feel very good about the overall
momentum we've got. I mean, Charlie and Mark talked a lot about innovation and the way the consumers are
responding. And we've also seen pretty broad-based success with the category offense. So, that's really a reflection of
where we see the momentum in the business.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Yeah.

<Q - Katharine McShane>: Hi. You had mentioned overall inventories for the company were healthy but I was
wondering if you could give a little bit more detail around inventory levels in Europe and if that's still weighing on
gross margins at all?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: We have some pockets in Europe with some promotional – we call it promo product. It's a
product that we would do for athletes. There's a little bit more specialized apparel products, we may have some
pockets. But generally, we feel if you look at this on a global basis, we are in good shape. We are always going to have
some areas of excess around the company, but one of the great things about the factory store network that we've built
over time is that we have got the ability to liquidate a lot of these products at a profit. So we feel, overall in pretty good
shape. As I noted in my prepared remarks, the one place that we are really laser focused right now is on China. And as
Charlie said, we are confident that we're going to work our way through that.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Okay. That's great. And my second question is on the women's category. I wondered if
you could talk at all about how women's footwear and apparel performed during the quarter and what your expectations
are for this category as retailers start to concentrate a little bit more on this initiative.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Hi, Kate. This is Charlie. I don't have the footwear numbers right in front of me, but I think
I can very easily and confidently tell you that the running category is leading the way. Our women's running business is
incredibly strong, and we feel very, very good about it. And then, I will echo that in some of our new apparel offerings.
I think some of the new presentations that you've seen in women's training in some of the stores certainly has resonated
with the consumer, performing very well, and we're starting to scale that on a much faster pace. And so, I think I would
say that the U.S. market is leading the charge here. And we feel very confident that we have some – as I said earlier, we
have some real running room here and some potential opportunity. I think as well, you can look to Western Europe and
expect some good things coming out of there as well. So, hopefully that answers your question.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Yes. Thank you.
<A - Kelley Hall>: You bet.
Operator
Your next question comes from Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.
<Q - Chris Svezia>: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hi.
<Q - Chris Svezia>: I guess – hi. Just going back to China for a second, the positive currency neutral futures versus
your thought process about the revenue decline, just maybe talk a little bit about why the difference? Just specifically
what's going on and are we going to continue to see futures increase? Is this just a short-term situation in this quarter?
Just maybe explain a little more in depth in terms of what's going on, the puts and takes there between revenues and
futures?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Sure. The equation is extremely complex. There's a lot of different variables. But let me see if
I can just simplify it a little bit here. We take orders for futures well in advance of when they go into the marketplace.
But what we are always doing, as Charlie talked about, is managing to a pull market. So we are really always very
focused on making sure that the product is moving through the supply chain smoothly and that we don't let too much
product back up and when we do start to see that situation, we are going to restrict the supply that goes into the
marketplace.
So, the difference between what we expect to see going forward on revenues versus futures is that we are going to be
putting less product in the marketplace than what was in the original futures order to make sure we manage the supply.
If you're looking at what actually affected our Q3 results, we had those factors plus we were doing a little more
discounting as well as making provision for bringing some product out of the market. So those reserves that we would
take for either discounts or returns to stock would actually affect the revenue number. The ultimate goal of all of this is

to accelerate the productivity of the retail stores in the marketplace, to accelerate the sell-through and make sure the
Brand stays fresh.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: And I would just add just one other point in the sense that the Mainland China futures
number was flat. We've got a much more mature business in both Hong Kong and Taiwan and they are not
unsubstantial. Those businesses are performing extremely well and so that's also affecting this number a little bit.
<Q - Chris Svezia>: I see. Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And my second question, I guess for Charlie, for you. I guess when
you think about the basketball business, which has seen great momentum and everyone continues to talk about
increasing over buy towards basketball, how are you managing allocation, the integrity of the Jordan Brand at scarcity,
whether it's Air Force 1, whatever the case might be in that business to continue to drive it? Just maybe talk a little
about that as more and more retailers talk about trying to get more and more basketball product into the marketplace?
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Yeah, it's one of the better problems I like to talk about, I guess, is the demand that we have
and the building demand. The allocation process is something that we've used for a long time. And we feel confident
and comfortable on our ability to manage it. I think some of the challenges become logistically how much product gets
to where and when. And that's been a challenge at times over the last couple of years.
But we would – as demand grows, we will continue to increase production against that demand. We certainly want to
keep some of the very high-end products on a very short lease, so to speak, with regards to availability, but it's a tool
that we use. We use it well. It's something we will continue to use but we will increase volumes as demand increases
and continue to grow the business.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: I just want to jump in and add the – remind you of the power of diversity that we have in
basketball between the innovation that we talked about between the number of athletes we have to work with, as
Charlie mentioned, the franchises we can work with in both Jordan, which are obvious the Air Force 1 and NIKE
Basketball, the Dunk and others, Laser, other great franchises. And then of course, as Charlie mentioned the one-two
punch between NIKE and Jordan Brands. It's a great, great example of a full offense within a key category.
<Q - Chris Svezia>: All right. Well, thank you very much and all the best.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Thank you.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Thank you.

<Q - Michael Binetti>: Hey, guys. Good afternoon and congrats on a great quarter.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Hi, Michael.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Binetti>: I apologize if you already talked about this, but in the futures window, could you comment on
units versus ASP or mix for us, please?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Yeah. In the prepared remarks the units are up 4%, the ASP is up 3%.
<Q - Michael Binetti>: Okay. Thanks. And can you help us think about how – over the next few quarters how we
should think about the China profitability or the margins there? Obviously that was – that compressed quite a bit in this
quarter. I just want to maybe help us think a little bit more in the medium term about how you are thinking about that
right now?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, in the near-term, as you manage through an inventory situation, you are going to see
some pressure on the margins. The benefit of moving towards a higher productivity model at retail is, that's a more

profitable model for everybody. So, the management of that marketplace, as we said, we are really focused on putting
that in a sustainable profitable growth position.
Charlie spoke to this, but the underpinnings of this are strong brand, driving a highly productive retail environment and
we have done those things. We have a premium brand in China. We are bringing innovation to the market and we
believe we can make the distribution system much more productive and that will let us keep our margins at a pretty
robust level.
<Q - Michael Binetti>: Okay. So even though we look at the margin compared it's a lot easier in the fourth quarter
maybe the message is, don't get carried away yet.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, as we said, we think it's going to take us a few quarters to work our way through this. I
like Charlie's phrasing on this, we're very aggressive. We're going to move as quick as we can, but we're going to be
patient where we need to be to get it right.
<Q - Michael Binetti>: Okay. And if I could just ask one more on the inventories, had about a 3 point impact from FX
but the future is only about 1 point. Is that – can we imply that product costs were negative at this point for you?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, let me frame it a little differently, because there's a lot of changes in product mix but if
you look at the actual product cost themselves, we are seeing labor cost inflation and we are seeing a bit of a tailwind
now because raw material costs are easing. Those things are largely balancing out and we are also seeing ongoing
increases in price. So that's why the margins are starting to head up.
And if you look at all of our geography businesses and all of our non-NIKE branded businesses, the only business
where we had margins down was China. All the rest were up. So we are starting to see some positive movement there.
There is currency. There is many other factors but that's bottom-line what's really driving it. We are starting now to see
that the pricing and the material leasing is offsetting the labor cost.
<Q - Michael Binetti>: Okay. Thanks a lot. Congrats again, guys.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Yup.

And your next question comes from Matt Boss with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matt R. Boss>: Hey. Good afternoon. So as we think about the expense side of the ledger into next year, at the
level of revenues that you have guided to, would there be any investment constraints to note to prevent potential
leverage next year?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Would there be – I'm sorry, would there be any investment constraints to note that would
prevent leverage?
<Q - Matt R. Boss>: If you – so basically if you hit your revenue guidance embedded within returning – approaching
the long-term model, are there any investments to think about on the SG&A side to prevent leverage?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Yeah. Yeah, I think at this point, we gave you the top and the bottom line, and obviously that
would imply some leverage at the EPS level. At this stage, I'd rather not got too deep on that, but what I would say is
broadly speaking we continue to work towards expanding our margins and we believe that we're going to be investing
in the kinds of innovation and growth drivers that you've seen us deliver in the third quarter. And, in fact, for the last
few years. So, don't want to actually get too deep into the P&L model until we get to June.
<Q - Matt R. Boss>: Okay. Great. And then second – I mean can you provide any performance versus expectations
with the recent Flyknit expanded launch? And also, the trajectory of this platform over the next couple of years, any
examples? How should we think about it? How big could this really be?

<A - Donald W. Blair>: I'd tell you, the demand from a consumer standpoint is huge. It's been steady since we
introduced Flyknit this past year, basically catching up to demand. We are working hard to build that capacity. But as I
mentioned, we are leveraging Flyknit, not only through running, but across the other categories.
It remains one of the more exciting pieces of innovation, I think, for NIKE, in terms of performance, in terms of the
aesthetic, in terms of the sustainability story, but I think and over time as we scale this in terms of the profitability that
this represents, it's really changing the game of one of the more expensive pieces of the manufacturing process. And as
we scale this, and I've obviously had glimpses of what's going on within the R&D pipeline, and incredibly compelling
product. Let me just leave it at that. Very, very exciting, and there is no question in my mind that this technology will
allow us to do things we have never ever been able to do before and I think they will continue to resonate at a very high
level with consumers.

Operator
And your next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jim V. Duffy>: Thanks. Hello, everyone. So I'm trying to understand the inventory management and strategies in
China. Orders up. Is it simply that partners want the product but you aren't shipping it to them to save them from
themselves and develop an element of scarcity?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: No. Jim, that's a little oversimplified. Basically you take an order six months in advance, you
estimate what the market demand is going to look like and where the sell through is going to go, and you monitor along
the way. That's one of the reasons we measure the sell through information with our retailers. And we put the product
in the marketplace based upon the level of demand we that have and the productivity of the retail store. So this is a
constant process of moving all the levers that you have to make sure that you keep the supply and demand in balance.
This is something we do working with our retailers in making sure we have the right amount of product in the
marketplace.
<Q - Jim V. Duffy>: Got you. I was afraid it wasn't that simple. The back half of the futures window in China, Don,
would be reflective of the fall-winter period where compares seem to ease. Are the orders for the back half of the China
futures windows indeed stronger as well in the front half?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Yeah. The only thing I can say about China, going back to the prepared remarks, there was a
timing effect in this particular report because only the first month of futures is included in this window and it actually
happened to be a pretty strong month, higher than the overall season will be. So that's one of the reasons among others
that we told you that those futures numbers are not necessarily what we would expect on revenue. So I don't want to get
into trying to reconcile individual geography futures. It just gets too much granularity and detail, but the bottom line is
our guidance is we don't think the revenue is going to be reflective of that level of futures growth. We think it's going to
be lower.
<Q - Jim V. Duffy>: Okay. I can appreciate that. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Christian Buss>: Thank you very much. I was wondering if I could ask a little bit about the European business.
You've been restructuring that business. It looks like you're on the early stages of a margin recovery there. Can you talk
to us about your expectations for improvement there? Where do you think you can get to? Can you get back to the
historical margin profile of that business? And what would get you there, if so?
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Yeah, I think, well, I am going to talk about the business. I will let Don talk about the
margin piece, specifically. But I think the overall business, as we have referred to a couple of different times, we feel
good about things going on in the north. Mark called out the performances in Germany, the U.K. market is coming out
of the Olympics healthier than we have seen in a while. So we're very – the Nordics and areas like that.
The severity of the economic situation in Iberia and Italy, which are substantial markets for us is significant. We are
definitely feeling some of that. But overall, as you look at that marketplace and you look at the world of sport and the
world of football, which we feel great about going into this year's – next year's World Cup, we feel from a brand
position and a business position, we are in a really good shape.
It will – some of the recovery is going to be bumpy. I think we talked about that in some of the prepared remarks based
on some of the economic conditions that we are facing. But the consumer proposition, and I guess that's the part I want
to make probably the biggest emphasis on, the brand is in very good shape. We feel very good about the opportunity in
both the near and mid-term and certainly the long-term. And I'm optimistically and yet still, with some regard to the
macros, bullish on Western Europe.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: And I think from a margin – a profit margin standpoint I do believe we can improve profit
margins over time and that's indeed what we aspire to do around the world. One thing to bear in mind with Western
Europe is if you go back two or three years which is where I think you're referencing you have to recall the euro at
$1.45 and today we're seeing the euro at $1.25. So, I think there is an impact on the margin from the value of the euro
but for an evolution of where we see the margins going, yes we think that as that geography grows we can continue to
improve profitability.
<Q - Christian Buss>: That's helpful. Thank you and best of luck.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Thank you.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Thank you.
<A - Charles D. Denson>: Thank you.
Kelley Hall
