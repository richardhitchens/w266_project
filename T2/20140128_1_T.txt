Randall L. Stephenson
Thanks, Susan, and good afternoon, everyone, and happy New Year.
2013 was an interesting year for the industry and I would suggest to you that it is probably a formative year. We saw
old competitors stake out new positions, we saw most of the players significantly change the value proposition for their
customers, and with smartphone penetration beginning to hit some impressive levels, we've seen new business models
emerge around LTE and the cloud. And in our case, that includes things like connected homes, connected cars, video
and mobile business solutions.
But from our view, the most important development that we're seeing is that the entire U.S. telecom industry is
investing aggressively in advanced networks. Today in the U.S., four national carriers and dozens of regional providers
are building out LTE, and you just don't see that happening anywhere else in the world. The industry is now competing
on price, customer service, technological innovation, and most importantly, network coverage and quality, and we think
this speaks volumes about where the country's public policy has landed concerning spectrum and the importance of
light-touch regulation. We think it's very, very important to maintain that approach as we move forward.
Because of these things the industry is healthy and it is attracting a lot of investment. So let me give you a few
highlights, and then what I'm going to do is turn it over to John and he'll take you through the details of the quarter.
First, our revenue and EPS growth finished right on track with our guidance. Cash generation was strong both from
operations and from the monetization of non-strategic assets. For the full year we invested $25 billion in CapEx and
spectrum, and then returned another $23 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback programs. We
ended the year with really high quality credit metrics and our pension plan funding is in great shape, and 2013 was our
first year for Project VIP and we're well ahead of schedule across the board, LTE deployment, U-verse expansion and
Fiber to the business. I would tell you it was a home run for the – it was a home-run year by our Network Operations
Group.
In terms of LTE coverage, we said we'd get LTE to 300 million people by the end of 2014. We're already closing in on
that number, and we expect to be essentially done by summer. John is going to give you the details, but growth in these
platforms was very strong. Mobile Data is now a $23 billion revenue stream and it's growing at 17%. U-verse is more
than $13 billion of annualized revenues and it's growing at 28%. Strategic Business Services are now at $9 billion at a
run rate and the growth ramp throughout 2013, and it hit 17% in the fourth quarter and we expect this growth rate to
step up again this year.
We rolled out a number of new technology solutions. We're having terrific success with our AT&T NetBond Service,
which combines our VPN network with cloud services from companies like IBM and Microsoft. What it does is gives
customers a secure connection to the cloud that they can't get on the public Internet.
Our Mobile Business Solutions continue to scale, Digital Life and Connected Car are off to strong starts, and we're very
enthusiastic about no-contract wireless. We expect the Leap acquisition to close by end of the first quarter and we're
convinced that putting the Cricket brand on top of the AT&T network is going to shake things up in the space.
So if you go to slide 5. A year ago I told the team that 2013 would be the year of the network for us and that turned out
to be an understatement. Today our network is best in class. We come out on top in all sorts of third-party tests for
network quality and speed. In fact, in a broad study of overall performance and that was done by RootMetrics, we are
head and shoulders above the field. The chart on Slide 5 shows you how we stack up and we think it's telling. We're in
a dead heat with Verizon for lowest in dropped calls, well under 1% and our other national competitors are at twice the
dropped call rate or more. That's the reason we posted record low fourth quarter postpaid churn.
On slide 6 you see that our network puts us in a great position for what we think is the industry's next growth wave.
There's a lot of talk about the connected world ahead. There are different estimates on how fast it develops, but I think
we're all going to agree that it's a big opportunity and when you combine these pervasive super-fast LTE networks with
the cloud it changes everything. It changes every industry, every aspect of our society and the economy. And for this
industry it means we're moving past the area of smartphone wars to rethinking how we work, how we conduct

commerce, how we learn and manage our health and so much more.
In fact, the visual on slide 6 captures most of what's taking place. It starts with the ultra-fast connectivity to the cloud,
smartphones are quickly becoming the remote control for this connected world and the pace of innovation is
accelerating. And this explains why we're being so aggressive with Project VIP and with initiatives like our U-verse
1-gig launch down in Austin. These things give us the ability to drive innovation and then lead in the next waves of
growth.
So with that, I want to turn it over to John to take you through the results.
John J. Stephens
Thanks, Randall, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with our consolidated financial summary, which is on
slide 7.
As Randall said, 2013 was a solid year for our financial results. We grew consolidated revenues by almost 2% thanks to
strong growth in Wireless, U-verse and strategic business services. Consolidated margins were stable, even with Project
VIP expenses and record annual smartphone sales and we grew adjusted earnings per share by 8.2% for the year.
Looking at the fourth quarter we finished the year with an exceptionally strong earnings per share performance.
Reported EPS was $1.31, however, when you exclude one-time adjustments, earnings per share for the quarter was
$0.53, a 20% increase from a year ago. Adjustments include an $0.89 gain from the year-end mark to market change
for our benefit plans. The gain was driven by an increase in the discount rate as well as strong performance of our
benefit plan investments. And a $0.02 gain for the sales of America Movil shares was also one of the adjustments.
We also saw $0.07 of pressure from costs associated with an early debt repayment and a $0.06 charge for costs
associated with employee retirements, specifically an early retirement program that Randall had mentioned.
Our solid cash flow and strong balance sheet also allowed us to be aggressive with our share buybacks. We repurchased
more than 366 million shares for the year, returning nearly $23 billion to the shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases. And since we began our buyback program at the beginning of 2012, we have bought back 737 million
shares or about 12% of our outstanding shares. All in all, we turned in a very strong financial performance for the
quarter and for the year.
Now let's look at our operational performance for the quarter starting with Wireless. Revenue and ARPU are on slide 8.
Strong Wireless revenue growth was driven by the network strength and by data hungry smartphones and tablets. Data
is now a $23 billion annualized revenue stream and is continuing to grow, growing at nearly 17%. That helped drive
4.8% service revenue growth and total Wireless revenues were up 4.5%.
Postpaid ARPU growth was strong. For the 20th consecutive quarter we saw total postpaid ARPU growth. That's a
record unmatched in the industry. And our postpaid phone-only ARPU increased by 3.9% and that's growing off a
much higher base than anyone else. We did have some adjustments in the quarter that bring the run rate closer to 3.7%,
but either way a very impressive performance. Our phone-only ARPU includes smartphones but also includes our
lower ARPU feature phones and Wireless home phones, which makes this growth even more impressive.
Now let's move to net adds and churn. The details are on slide 9. Our churn story is nothing short of exceptional. In a
quarter where we saw increased competitive activity, strong seasonal promotions and competitive offers targeting our
postpaid base, we turned in our lowest ever fourth quarter postpaid churn, a record of 1.11%. We're very proud of that.
This helped drive a solid quarter of postpaid gains with almost 600,000 net adds including nearly 300,000 smartphone
subscribers and overall we added more than 500,000 branded smartphones in the quarter both postpaid and prepaid. We
also added about 440,000 branded tablets as well.
Network coverage and quality is the top reason customers choose AT&T. And thanks to the high performance of our
4G LTE networks. We have been very successful in attracting and keeping high-value postpaid customers. We're also
taking steps to address the more value-conscious customer. Competition for these customers is intense, but our network

gives us an important advantage. On the postpaid side we have several initiatives underway including new Mobile
Share value plans and other targeted promotions.
In prepaid, we have made steady progress in adding smartphone subscribers. In the fourth quarter alone, we added
more than 230,000 prepaid smartphones to our network. That gives us a base of more than 2 million prepaid
smartphones and ARPU for these customers is more than 70% higher than our non-smartphone, prepaid base. Once the
Leap transaction is approved, we will be an even better option for value-conscious consumers. We believe the Cricket
brand on our network will be a great combination.
Now let's take a look at our growing smartphone base. Those details are on slide 10. Smartphones continue to take a
bigger share of our phone sales, a record 93% of our postpaid phones sales were smartphones in the fourth quarter. That
increases our postpaid smartphone base by 1.2 million. For the full-year our postpaid smartphone base grew by nearly 5
million subscribers. Overall 77% of our postpaid phone base are on smartphones. That compares to about 70% a year
ago.
Smartphone sales were strong, 7.9 million in the quarter and data usage for smartphones continued to rise, increasing
by more than 50% year-over-year. We have seen an incredible response to AT&T Next especially when we introduced
the new Mobile Share value plans, and sales improved throughout the quarter.
Overall more than 15% of all smartphones sales during the quarter were AT&T Next sales, with the sales percentage in
company-owned stores much higher. These strong sales reinforce our belief that focusing on what the customer wants
is the right move, whether it's a new device every year or the ability to take advantage of bring-your-own-device
service plans, we need to continue to focus on the customer. AT&T Next did impact our cash flows since we are
financing the handsets, but that's all right. We know these customers and we know their credit profile. Overall this
program is a great value for both our customers and us.
In the quarter we reached 7.1 million of Mobile Share accounts. Those accounts include more than 21 million postpaid
subscribers or about three subscribers per account. Take rates on the high-tiered data plans for both Mobile Share and
tiered data customers continue to be strong. In the last year the percentage of customers on those plans has nearly
doubled, growing from 13% to now 24% with about a third of the Mobile Share customers on plans of 10 gigabits or
higher. At the same time, Mobile Share value plans are attracting customers who may not need such large data buckets.
The new plans offer customers more savings and provide no annual service contract options, giving our existing and
new customers even greater choice.
Now let's talk about Wireless margins. Those details are on slide 11. Let's start by taking a look at the full year. For
2013 our Wireless EBITDA service margin was 41.3%. That is a 170 basis point increase from a year ago, even though
we sold more smartphones during the year. There are a number of reasons for this improvement. Revenue growth was
solid throughout the year thanks to our expanding smartphone base and increasing data usage.
Second, the strength of our network makes a difference. We're seeing outstanding speed and reliability performance
and greater efficiencies as more and more customers upgrade to LTE devices. More than half of our smartphone base
are now on LTE-capable devices. Our new upgrade policy also added a positive impact on margins, as did strong
AT&T Next sales.
In the fourth quarter Wireless EBITDA was nearly $6 billion, an impressive 35% increase over last year; and Wireless
EBITDA service margin was 37.4%, also much higher than a year ago. When you look at the full picture, this was a
very strong Wireless quarter for us, from churn to smartphone sales to margins to network performance, these solid
results in a hotly competitive environment gives us confidence as we look ahead.
Now let me turn to our Wireline story starting on slide 12. U-verse finished the year just as it started, with strong
subscriber gains, increasing penetration and growing revenue. In fact, U-verse helped drive consumer revenue growth
of nearly 3% in the fourth quarter. U-verse continued its record of strong, high-speed broadband gains. We added
630,000 U-verse broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter and 2.7 million during the year. U-verse now represents
more than 60% of our total broadband base. These subscribers not only have a higher ARPU but churn is significantly
lower as well. We believe we've hit a tipping point with U-verse broadband. With the growing base of U-verse

subscribers we feel confident that we can grow broadband subscribers even stronger this coming year.
We also continue to excel in video. While some companies are excited about actually gaining customers, we added
almost 200,000 subscribers in the quarter, and nearly 1 million for the year; plus we had our lowest TV churn ever in
the fourth quarter. That tells us customers not only want U-verse but they stay with us once they get it. And we expect
to maintain this momentum. We continue to add new features such as TV Everywhere, which allows customers to view
programming on smartphones and tablets, inside their home and out. And increased broadband speeds, nearly
two-thirds of the U-verse TV footprint can now get speeds up to 45-megabits per second.
U-verse is now a $13 billion annualized revenue stream, growing at 28% year-over-year, and makes up 57% of our
total consumer revenues. U-verse was a solid story from start to finish during 2013 and we expect that to continue as
we expand U-verse coverage with Project VIP.
Now let's move to Wireline Business which you can see on slide 13. First let's start with some of the really good news,
strategic business service continues to be a bigger part of business services. Those services, products such as VPN,
Ethernet, cloud, hosting and other advanced IP services now make up more than 25% of business wireline and growth
is accelerating, up more than 17% year-over-year.
We continue to see U-verse high-speed broadband growing in the business space. Increasing speeds and broader
coverage open the door to new growth opportunities with small and medium-sized customers.
We're also seeing increasing momentum in cloud and integrated service offerings. We are one of the top cloud
providers in the world and adding scale. For example, we already have more than an Exabyte of virtualized storage.
Much of this is driven by steps we are taking to move our own business processes to the cloud. Our goal is to be an
entirely cloud-based enterprise within the next three to five years.
Our own IT operations are probably the most aggressive cloud operations around. So we're not just selling cloud
applications, we are customers, we are users as well. This helps focus us on developing new cloud-based products such
as NetBond. NetBond helps our customers safeguard their information by extending their virtual private networks into
the cloud, which functions like a normal VPN site and keeps data separate from other users' traffic. And NetBond
reduces latency by up to 50%, which means that businesses have access to their data almost instantly. We believe
NetBond will drive even more growth.
We already are the VPN market leader with a multi-billion dollar annual business, and we had our best fourth quarter
VPN growth in years. These growth products helped transform our revenue mix, but we still saw lower revenues in the
quarter. Total revenues were down 3.4% versus the year-earlier quarter and were essentially flat sequentially. Business
service revenues declined 2.4% year-over-year. Behind all of this are the overall economic trends.
The outlook is still uncertain. Customers are still delaying buying decisions. Business starts lag but slightly better than
a year ago and unemployment is slowly improving, but labor force participation is the lowest it's been in more than 30
years. It's still a slow market, but we are hopeful that we will see an improving economy to get this part of the company
growing again.
Now let's look at consolidated and wireline margins on slide 14. Even with Project VIP expenses, U-verse gains and
record-breaking annual smartphone sales, consolidated margins remained relatively stable. Wireless margin
improvements helped offset this pressure. For the year, our adjusted consolidated margin was 18% compared to 18.2%
last year. This pressure on wireline was expected. Much of it is tied to Project VIP and other success-based initiatives.
We had almost a million new U-verse TV subscribers, and there were trailing expenses from VIP investments and
depreciation expenses were also higher.
We continue to take steps on the cost-cutting side as well. This includes the introduction of Project Agile. Project Agile
is a major new initiative that is transforming how the company organizes and operates around customers to deliver a
best-in-class customer experience as an all IP, all mobile and all cloud services company. We see considerable
opportunity to raise costs through simplifying processes, standardizing platforms and making our customer interactions
effortless and efficient. Randall will talk more about this initiative in just a few moments.

Now let's move to cash flow. Our summary is on slide 15. In 2013, cash from operations totaled nearly $35 billion.
Capital expenditures were $21.2 billion, as we deployed Project VIP and free cash flow before dividends was $13.6
billion. This was impacted somewhat by the tremendous success of AT&T Next.
We've also been very opportunistic in monetizing some of our assets. This includes the tower transaction with Crown
Castle, sales of some of our America Movil shares and sales of some of our real estate assets. These items generated $7
billion in cash for the year and nearly $6 billion in additional cash in the fourth quarter alone. All this and free cash
flow generated about $20 billion in cash during the year and strengthened our cash position.
Our balance sheet remains solid. Net debt edged up during the year, however our average effective interest rate is down
compared to last year thanks to debt refinancing, early repayments of debt and historically low interest rates and a net
debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.73 is well below our 1.8 target and down from the third quarter even with our
Project VIP investments.
In addition to investing in our business, we also returned substantial value to shareholders. For the year we repurchased
about 366 million shares for around $13 billion. We made dividend payments for the year totaling nearly $10 billion.
This makes our total return to shareholders for the year right at $23 billion, and in the last two years we returned more
than $45 billion, a record unmatched in the industry.
Now before I hand it back to Randall, let's take a quick look on how we delivered on 2013 guidance, that's on slide 16.
So how did we do for the year? On an adjusted basis we expected upper-single-digit EPS growth, continued revenue
growth in Wireless and consumer Wireline and stable consolidated margins; and that's what we delivered. We set out
ambitious Project VIP targets, increased them during the year and still came in ahead of forecast. We also are excited
about the Leap acquisition and how it will support our Project VIP deployment. Once the deal is closed we'll take a
look at how it will impact our sell-side build plans and densification initiatives.
We continue to generate cash, both through asset monetizations and free cash flow. We also took several steps to
manage our debt, helping reduce the cost of debt even as we invested in future growth. And through it all we remained
focused on the shareholder, returning substantial value through dividends and buybacks. Altogether, a solid year during
a transformational time in our business.
I now will turn it back to Randall to talk to you a little bit more about that transformation. Randall?
Randall L. Stephenson
Okay. Thanks, John. I'll close with just a couple of comments on what you can expect from us in 2014 and I'll reiterate
what we laid out when we announced Project VIP; and that was that 2014 is our peak year for VIP investment and our
outlook is very consistent with that original plan.
We will continue to be aggressive on the network front. We expect to hit our LTE coverage target ahead of schedule
this year. We also have a big effort in terms of network densification and cell sites. We will further ramp our U-verse
and business fiber builds. Video, we believe, is a big growth opportunity so we have a major initiative to make our
network the best in class for video delivery for both Wireline and Wireless. And longer-term we're taking the lead in
virtualizing our network to shift functionality from hardware to software; and over time we believe the payoffs in
operating efficiency and speed to market are going to be significant.
In terms of our investments in growth, mobile data and U-verse, while they're beginning to scale into very large
businesses in and of themselves, are still very early in their growth curves; and the same holds for our strategic business
services. As John pointed out with the Cricket brand on top of the AT&T network, you should expect us to be
disruptive in the no contract space this year.
We have a number of new services that will begin to move the needle this year. We'll launch Digital Life into a number
of more markets. We've taken a leadership position in connected cars; in fact, we've already announced agreements
with GM and Ford, Nissan, Audi, BMW, Tesla and there are more to come.

And as I mentioned, we have a number of new cloud, security and mobile solutions for business and in parallel we're
also re-engineering how we operate. We have a major effort this year to re-architect our enterprise customer
experience, rethinking every step end-to-end to dramatically shorten our intervals. Across our business we're driving to
make 80% of our customer interactions digital and online by 2020, and Project Agile is all about streamlining
operations around an all-IP cloud and mobility experience; and as a first step about 5,600 employees took voluntary
retirement in the fourth quarter. Most of those were management employees. We have additional Project Agile
initiatives underway which will require some investment that we expect run rate savings in the $3 billion range by
2017.
If you go to slide 18 it lays out our financial expectations for 2014. They are very much on track with what we laid out
for you when we launched Project VIP some 14 months ago. So there shouldn't be any surprises here. We expect
consolidated revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range. This doesn't include any impacts from our planned Leap
acquisition.
We expect stable, consolidated margins with adjusted EPS growth in the mid-single-digit range. And this does not
factor in any future share buybacks. And we expect cash from operations in the $32 billion range. 2014 capital will be
in the $21 billion range, exactly what we laid out earlier for Project VIP with savings from our original plan offset by
capital for Agile and some new network projects. And again, we expect 2014 will be our peak investment year for
Project VIP and with a step-up in cash taxes, we expect free cash flow this year in the $11 billion range with similar
levels for 2015.
Post-VIP, we expect free cash flow and dividend coverage to trend back to the historical levels. We also expect cash
from divestitures from some non-strategic assets. And all of this is based on some rather conservative assumptions that
includes U.S. economic growth of around 2%.
Finally I know everyone saw the filing we made with the U.K. Takeover Panel yesterday. I think the statement speaks
for itself. We've talked in the past about how we view the European market and we don't have much to add. Again,
we're on track with and in most cases we're ahead of what we committed to you when we rolled out Project VIP. We
have a lot of opportunity ahead of us. The initiatives we're executing have really good payoffs in terms of growth and
cost structure. And 2014 is going to be a very productive year for us.
So, Susan, with that, I think we're ready for questions.
Susan Johnson
Thank you, Randall. Tony, I think we're now ready to open up for our Q&A session.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan
Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay. Thank you very much. Randall, just very quickly can you just give us some color on
exactly why at this point you had to file with the U.K. Takeover Panel?
And then, John, on the free cash flow, can you just give us a little bit more detail around the cash taxes and what the
impact is in 2014 and 2015 and what the CapEx is likely to be in 2015 to get to that $11 billion number? And is there
any impact on working capital from the Next program as that starts to ramp this year as well? Thanks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Hi, Simon. In terms of the – they call it a 2.8 announcement we made in the U.K.
yesterday. Anytime you get a lot of noise around any kind of M&A, it's kind of standard procedure for the Takeover

Panel to contact the parties that are being mentioned and ask them to make a declaration and so we were contacted over
the weekend because of a lot of press surrounding us in Europe and asked to make a declaration, so we made the
declaration we did. I really don't have much more to add than that. It's just a technical requirement by the Panel.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Simon, on the free cash flow, I'll take it from the standpoint of we're expecting that $32
billion of cash from operations and the $21 billion range on CapEx is the biggest generator. When you look at the $32
billion and you compare it to this year, the major change is a pickup in cash taxes. Some of it is from our pension
funding strategy that we implemented last year. Some of it's from depreciation. It does incorporate continued growth in
the Next program and it does incorporate what is effectively pressure from that program, but that is all-inclusive.
Likewise if you look at 2015, some of the same things are happening. We'll have certainly continued tax pressure, but
we'll also have growing – we would expect to have some growing pressure from Next and some growing and strong, I
should say, CapEx. But our operational improvements and our revenue growth and our profitability improvements will
allow us to cover that and keep it stable and keep us very comfortable in our coverage ratios.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: So CapEx around that $21 billion again in 2015?
<A - John J. Stephens>: We're not specifically giving guidance on that, but I would tell you that in prior conversations
we talked about CapEx being, the current year $21 billion, for 2013 and then 20 and 20. We've opted for Project Agile
in this year and we will continue to have – I would expect we'll continue to have some Project Agile efficiency
investments going forward.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thank you.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess it's good for the industry that the consumers are back to
being in the willingness to pay for full handsets, guys. Maybe, John, just your thoughts on, at least in the current
quarter, the impact of Next on churn?
And then looking through the tracking on it throughout the quarter, obviously December a very strong month, is there
seasonality to that, or should we be thinking about – or how we should be thinking about percentage of gross adds or
upgrades as we progress through 2014?
And then secondarily, your comments regarding Cricket, is there something to be read through that, meaning that some
of these folks that are getting EIP contracts in the industry maybe would be better off in a Cricket-type product, or
when we say shake things up, I guess I'm trying to understand what that means?
<A - John J. Stephens>: So let me take a couple of the questions, Mike, and kind of go from there. If you look at
where we were at the end of the third quarter, we had about 10% of our handset sales being through the Next program.
During the fourth quarter, that grew for the overall fourth quarter, we had about 15% or about 1 million handsets sold
in the Next program, and we came out of the quarter at about 20%. We continue to see strong sales in the first quarter.
So that's what we're dealing with, with regard to Next, a very good opportunity for our customers. They like the
program, they're electing it, they're choosing it, and certainly we like it.
While I'm confident that Next has had a positive impact on our churn, I would suggest to you that the award-winning
customer service our retail stores give our customers, and our really great network performance are also really
significant factors in that real reduction in our churn rate in the fourth quarter. I can't point to just one item, I've got to
tell you that I believe it's the network performance, it's the sales efforts, the quality service, and quite frankly good

choices including Next that our marketing team has put out there.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Hey, Mike, as it relates to the Leap acquisition, we've spent the last six or seven years
chasing capacity in our network build. And we've been very reluctant to move down market because we have some
very, very high-value customers, high ARPU customers that we are ensuring that we maintain network quality and
capacity there.
As we make the move to LTE and as we continue to push the network build and create capacity, it's created a whole
new opportunity for us to think about the value segment and the no-contract segment. And as we get into the Leap
acquisition, as we really study the Cricket brand, we're finding that it is a very, very strong brand. And we really
believe that at that end of the market, as you put a no-contract-type service on top of an AT&T network, our coverage,
our quality, our performance, we are convinced there's a real opportunity to grow.
We're convinced that we can grow from a couple of standpoints, and that is what we have seen in terms of moving
smartphones deeper, deeper penetration on postpaid, that play has yet to be run in the prepaid segment to any
meaningful degree, and you should expect us to be very assertive and very aggressive to push smartphone penetration
in the no-contract space, and to be aggressive as it relates to pricing. We'll be using a different brand, we can do some
things that'll be disruptive in the market, and we're actually getting more and more excited about it the closer we get to
closing in the first quarter.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: All right. Hey, Randall, is this sort of just looking at it as a bifurcation of credit risk and
understanding some balance sheet risk there as well?
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: That's exactly what it is, and also giving you the flexibility to do some things in the
marketplace with a different brand that you wouldn't do with the traditional brand.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Great. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Hey, guys. A couple. One, Randall, just as a follow-up real quick, in your regulatory
conversations of the last week, have you learned anything new, though not necessarily about you but of a U.S.
company's ability to buy assets in Europe, whether those are NSA issues or otherwise?
And then second, John, given the high payout ratio for 2014 and it sounds like 2015, should we assume that the days of
big buybacks are pretty much over for now? Is there any room to raise the leverage there? Thanks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Yeah. So, Phil, I was in Davos, actually, and I had an opportunity to meet with several
folks that were administrations and policy makers and so forth and my main objective for last week, as it related to
those conversations, was we have had some business impacts from the NSA revelations, and they've not been
inconsequential. We're having customers ask us a lot of questions, were having policy makers ask us a lot of questions
and it's affecting our ongoing business today, irrespective of anything that might relate to some M&A or whatnot.
And so I was really there to discern what was the attitude and the disposition, and try to help formulate our own plans
as it relates to those and it was fortuitous that the President made his speech the Friday before. I think that speech was
helpful in terms of the policy makers in Europe understanding where the Administration here, the President, is going on
meta-data collection and so forth. And so I would tell you it was net-net a productive set of discussions, and I feel like
we have a path, just as it relates to our ongoing business operations there today.

<A - John J. Stephens>: Phil, let me comment on your questions with regard to buyback. First and foremost, to make
a point, I'm very comfortable with our payout ratios. I feel really good about our balance sheet. You can see that our
debt ratios are well within line in our – within our previous guidance that we've been able to generate strong cash from
operations. But quite frankly, we've also been able to generate strong cash from asset monetization of non-strategic
assets, and we still believe we have opportunities there as the set transaction – announced transaction would imply. So I
feel very comfortable, not only for 2014 and 2015, with where we're at on our payout ratios.
With that being said, our assumption in the business plan and our guidance that we gave was not based on additional
buybacks. We will continue to buy back opportunistically. I will tell you, we have about 160 million shares left on our
authorization. So that would give you a gating factor unless our board will give us more guidance. But we feel real
good about our payout ratios and where our balance sheet is. It remains very strong.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks. Maybe, Randall, could you comment on the competitive environment you're
currently seeing in the Wireless market? And maybe look out to what you expect and how you would expect it to
evolve in 2014? And I guess specifically with T-Mobile's new ETF strategy, it seems to be the first promotion that
really targets family plans. I mean, is that something that you see as more of a significant change in the competitive
landscape or just sort of more of the same promotion that we've seen in the past? Thanks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Yeah, hi, John. Yeah, as I mentioned in my opening comments, it was a formative year
for the industry. And I would tell you what is probably most interesting to me, as we look at what has played out in
2013 and carried into the first month of 2014, is the idea that our customers are demonstrating an interest, desire even,
to put more of their money into the handset in exchange for lower monthly pricing, and that's what you see happening
in the marketplace right now. More and more customers are moving to handset financing plans, picking up more of the
cost of the handset with the desire to have a lower monthly rate. And so we're seeing that play itself out, and you're
seeing kind of the whole market move there.
All players are introducing these kind of plans, and our customers are loving it. You heard John talk about the take
rates and how in December 20% of all of our smartphone sales were on these types of arrangements. And so one can
say, well that's great margin opportunity, but then you turnaround to re-investing it back into the customer in terms of
better pricing in the marketplace, and so that's kind of working out very interesting.
As it relates to the impact on competition, there's a lot of noise but at the end of the day we studied this nine ways to
Sunday and we've made a lot of moves in the marketplace ourselves. And fourth quarter churn was the lowest fourth
quarter churn we've ever experienced, and it just continues to reinforce that you have to be aggressive in the
marketplace. You have to constantly have your ear to the ground and attuned to what the customer expects, but you
better have a high quality network experience, both data and voice. And we really, really feel good about what was
accomplished in 2013 in terms of network quality.
Again, our voice quality is on par with the best in the industry in the United States, and when you look at everybody
else in the industry we are running dropped call rates that are half of what the nearest competitor is running. So
competitive intensity is going to remain strong, I have no doubt that you'll see that continue. I have no doubt that you'll
see us continue all to modify our value propositions, but as I pointed out earlier I think where you'll see us get most
competitive is moving down into the value space with the Leap acquisition and using the Cricket brand.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go
ahead.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. First, Randall, obviously we've
had a win for the carriers on the net neutrality space. You guys were out at CES with some of your sponsored data trials
visible for the marketplace. Obviously, Ed Whitacre started this conversation many years ago with the marketplace.
Could you kind of tell us how you see the next steps unfolding and when, if ever, we might be able to see a real
monetization of this opportunity?
And then second, John, just for you on the EPS guidance, two pieces I wanted to talk about. Just one obviously we're
going to get about 2% benefit year-over-year from the ending share count relative to the midpoint of 2013. And then
obviously on the Next program, we're going to get a lot more equipment revenue being booked for a fifth of the
customers coming in the door than we do under the old plans. By my math we should see roughly $1 billion more
revenue dropping into the EBITDA line, dropping into the earnings line for 2014. That's going to be about another 4%
to 5% benefit. So we're already at 7% kind of earnings per share growth year-over-year before we've even started to
work on the business. Could you kind of talk about where the core business is going to go in 2014? Is it a growth year?
Is it a stable year as you work on competition? What's underneath the hood for 2014? Thanks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Hi, David. Net neutrality, I just kind of laughed when you made the comment about
Whitacre. When was that like 2002 or 2003, right?
<Q - David W. Barden>: A lifetime ago.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: [Laughter] The industry's come a long way since then and over the last couple of years,
the industry came together and worked and agreed to a framework as it related to net neutrality that the SEC
promulgated into rules. We did have this court order. From our standpoint, David, that changed, really, nothing. It
doesn't change any way that we will operate. I really don't believe it's going to change much of what anybody in the
industry will do. As you pointed out, we introduced our sponsored data plans, which the easiest way to articulate it is
like 1-800 data where companies, they want customers to access their content and they'd be willing to pay the freight to
let those customers access their content.
We can't find that that violates anybody's net neutrality rules that are in place today. It's perfectly voluntary. It's open to
any company that might want to do this. You think about the kind of situations that are driving this early on, and it's
very interesting.
So for example, UnitedHealth, they have a number of young mothers who are not getting good education and training
on prenatal care, and obviously it's driving their healthcare costs up. UnitedHealth says, we have a lot of information, a
lot of data, we want to motivate these young women to come watch and to take advantage of and they say if we would
like to pay for it to make sure that there are no constraints, nothing gets in the way for these women taking advantage of
this training to address their prenatal care. And so they said we're willing to pay for that and provide motivation and
incentives for these young mothers to be, to take advantage of that. I'm struggling to figure out what the arguments
against those types of services would be.
So you're going to see these evolve. I have no doubt you'll see them scale. It's the same way the long distance industry
grew in scale and I think mobile data and mobile Internet services will follow some of the same paths. So stay tuned,
but I don't see the court ruling on net neutrality changing anything in terms of how we operate or most anybody else in
the industry for that matter.
<A - John J. Stephens>: David, on your second question, a couple of quick comments. We're giving guidance of net
EPS growth in the mid-single-digits range. You're right, we will get a little lift underneath our wings from the buybacks
that took place in 2013, we're not assuming any more in 2014.

In the Wireless space, we do expect some benefits not only from Next, but also from our 24-month upgrade cycle. But I
will tell you, some of the customers on Next, while they're electing that, they're also, as Randall mentioned, electing to
choose the bring your own device pricing platforms and so those benefits from Next may be moving from our service
revenues. And you'll see a different mix of revenues with the equipment and service. But we are positive about the
Wireless market and about continuing to expand margins.
On a consumer side, U-verse is doing great. We continue to expect to see growth. You saw the kind of numbers they
posted on video in the fourth quarter and for the year as well as high-speed broadband. With the additional footprint,
we're optimistic there.
Business is still challenged but strategic services are going great. The base is up to 25% and we expect it to expand and
with that expansion, it should come an opportunity to expand the growth rate.
So what are the challenges? Well, the challenges are an overall slow economy, a lack of investment by the private
sector in the U.S. economy. And quite frankly, we still have, while we've made a lot of progress in our legacy voice
headwinds and we brought that from what it was in 2011 about 22% of our revenue base is now down to 17% and in
the fourth quarter down to 16%. We still have to overcome those challenges in a low employment, slow economy
environment. When you put that all together, we're optimistic about the year but we're at that mid-single digits
guidance.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Thanks, John. Thanks, Randall too.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: You bet. David, I would just add on that if we can get some type of U.S. economic
growth in that 3% to 4% range, it changes the equation for a lot of us. And I'm hopeful. I'm not yet optimistic, but I'm
hopeful. And you can assume that we, AT&T and the business community in general, are going to be pushing an
agenda.
I hope to hear the President speak on several of these issues tonight: first and foremost, business tax reform. I just can't
think of anything that would move this needle faster and to a greater extent than business tax reform. And I do believe
the Administration and Congress are all supportive. Here's an area where everybody has coalesced and it seems like it's
ripe for getting done. Trade is obviously huge and immigration reform. Everybody's talking about these. Everybody in
Congress and the Administration is expressing a desire and a need to get this done. If you could just get a couple of
these done, I think it takes this 2% to a 3% plus growth profile and that does change our view of this as well.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Thanks, Randall.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Thanks. John, you've been able to find opportunities to monetize some non-core
assets. Do you see any additional opportunities as we move forward? And how should we think about the use of the
capital from these types of transactions?
<A - John J. Stephens>: So, Joe, thanks for your question. First and foremost, we're always looking for opportunities.
The most recent example of that was the announcement of the Southern New England Telephone transaction of $2
billion, a transaction we expect to close at the end of the year. I will tell you we'll continue to look at things like real
estate, like we did last year, and other opportunities.
In a company of our size with a $0.25 trillion balance sheet and a company that has the history, 100-year old plus
company, we have opportunities. And we'll continue to search those out. And as some of the economics on real estate
and other things improve, we're optimistic about those. With that being said, we're going to keep our balance sheet
strong like we always have. We're going to keep our credit metrics strong as we have. And we're going to be
opportunistic with the use of that cash. We feel good about where we're at. We feel good about how we treated our

employees.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: And do you think this could maybe give you an opportunity to ramp some of those
buybacks as we've seen it slow over the last couple of quarters?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Well, certainly all those things will be taken into account as we make those decisions. But I
do want to make sure I'm clear on the guidance that for next year our EPS guidance did not assume a ramp up in the
economy and did not assume any buybacks. And as we said before, we're going to be opportunistic with our buybacks
and make sure that they are done and from a position of strength as we have been doing as we continue to remain with
a strong balance sheet.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Adam Ilkowitz with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Adam T. Ilkowitz>: Thank you very much. Just one question on the balance sheet side, you had made a move on
the pension plan to fully fund that. I wanted an update on the preferred equity contribution, if you could.
And then on the Wireless side, the postpaid gross additions, I know that this is a tough quarter with some of the moves
that were going on, but I was wondering if on the high-end postpaid side you were looking to accelerate sales in any
way? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So first and foremost with regard to the pension plan funding, we continue to work with the
Department of Labor for an official approval. Those – that process continues to go well. For purposes – as we had filed
and we publicly stated, we have made the contribution. We did that in September of last year and when you look at our
audited pension financial statements this year, they will be essentially fully funded. They will be at the 99.8% or
100.2% funding, so that's gone well. We do not have an official ruling yet from the DOL, but we're still very optimistic
about it. And quite frankly, I will tell you I'm complimentary about the work and the way we've been respected by the
individuals at the Department of Labor. They've been good to work with.
With regard to gross additions in our Wireless, we're always looking to be competitive and we're always looking for
opportunities to continue to grow what has been just a great business for us. As Randall said, we're continuing to
respond, not just to competition, but what our customers want, and we'll continue to focus on offerings and products
that allow us to do that. I will tell you that we are looking at sustainable growth, profitable growth, growth that fits for
both us and the customers, not growth that does not make economic sense long-term.

<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First for Randall, if you go back to your page 6
diagram, how much of your strategy do you want to be the enabler of these applications with your network, versus
out-rightly owning the applications that scale when you compare it to the a-la-carte alternative?
And John, if I can throw out a question, back on the dividend coverage, how should investors be thinking about the
coverage aspirations that AT&T has on a few-year view, and how should they think about how much comes from
growth in revenue or cash flow from operations versus lowering the CapEx over time? Thanks.

<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Michael, on enabler versus owning the end-user or the finished service, the answer to
the question is yes, and it depends. As you think about LTE and cloud capabilities, there are some where we will take it
all the way through the finished service.
A classic example of that would be Home Security and Home Automation, the Connected Home. That is a finished
service that we're monetizing at the retail level. As you think about our NetBond product, we are enabling other people
via APIs and capabilities to monetize through us, providing a secure environment for cloud services.
By a same token, we have our own cloud services out there that we're selling at the retail level as well. You can think
about – in terms of Health Services, we're opening up APIs allowing companies to come and put their devices and their
applications and use our network services to accommodate that. We think this is a rather sizable opportunity. Payments,
Mobile Payments, we're working with a JV, ISIS, where Verizon and T-Mobile are our partners in that JV. That is a
finished service.
So it's going to cover the gamut. We think the opportunities are really large. The Connected Car is probably going to be
both. There are going to be subscribers who, the car is like an additional device they add on to their data bucket, but the
auto manufacturers will look at us as a platform and they will sell finished services in the car through our connected
capability as well.
So again, the answer to your question is yes, all of the above.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Mike, with regard to the dividend coverage, what's going to be reiterate, we feel very
comfortable about the dividend coverage for 2014 and 2015. But with the continuing revenue growth, with the
opportunity that the VIP Network platform provides us not only for products and services and revenue, but quite
frankly for efficiency through Project Agile, we believe that we – you will see us trend fairly quickly to historic – to
more historic levels of dividend coverage. And quite frankly, I'm opportunistic that we need to do better than that. I
think that's a mix of efficiency from the payoff from Project VIP and the high-quality IP networks as well as the
revenue growth that comes from those products.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thank you.
<A - Susan Johnson>: Tony, I think we've got time for just one more question.

Thank you. And that question will come from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much, and good afternoon, folks.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: Good afternoon.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Good afternoon
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: On the churn front, I mean certainly you reported the lowest fourth quarter postpaid churn
coming out of you folks. Given some of the recent initiatives in part launched by you folks during the quarter, for
carriers to absorb ETF fees, should we expect your postpaid churn and perhaps the industry's, for that matter, to go up
here given what seems to be more increased flexibility to shift between competitors?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Good question. Thank you for that, Amir. Let me give you a couple of comments. First of all,
our churn improvements were not just in our Wireless business and we're very proud of those. But I need to point to
you that we had really great performance in U-verse churn and consumer video churn. So we're really pleased with
churn and an overall customer satisfaction with this network quality we have.
Secondly, I will tell you that, when people talk about things like porting ratios and offers for ETF, the real measure of a
network and the real measure of customer satisfaction is churn. Porting is a – porting issues or ETF issues are a subset
of that. Historically, about a third of our customers who made a change ported their numbers, about two-thirds didn't.

And so when you have an unusual and sometimes uneconomic offer to pay someone's ETF, you may shift porting
ratios, but that may not have any change to the total churn picture. It's just a difference between those customers who
made a change with or without porting.
We certainly have a competitive environment, and we're certainly going to keep our eye on the ball and make sure that
we continue to respond to what customers want in a sustainable process. But we think those are the driving force, those
choice matters are the driving issues, not necessarily just one ETF offer or another.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then one last question, if I may, on the release from
yesterday. Has anything changed in terms of your view on the regional market outlook for Europe over the longer-term
with respect to the potential opportunity for mobile data for someone who opts to invest in the region? Thanks very
much.
<A - Randall L. Stephenson>: No. I mean, our view of Europe hasn't changed at all.
John J. Stephens
So with that, let me take this moment to thank all of you for being on the call with us today. We've closed the year with
a solid performance, solid quarter and a solid year. Our growth platforms are going strong, our Wireless network is best
in class and our capital structure is solid. And as Randall mentioned, we're positioned well for 2014; focused on
growth. We have a solid, achievable plan that will help us get there.
Thanks, again, for being on the call and, as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good evening.
Operator
Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your
participation and for using AT&T's Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.
