MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. This call is
being recorded. [Operator Instructions] We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief
Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is
available on our website. And please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the
presentation.
So turning to Page 1, we carried strong momentum into the second quarter with net income of $6.5 billion and an EPS
of $1.60 a share on revenue of $26 billion, up 13% year-on-year, and flat versus a seasonally strong first quarter with a

return on tangible common equity of 17%.
And you can see on the page that we've highlighted several significant items up front here. A $950 million reserve
relief in Mortgage and this quarter we saw net charge-offs less than half of what they were a year ago. A $550 million
reserve release in Card with charge-offs remaining historically low. And $600 million in expenses for additional
litigation reserves in corporate.
In addition the results for the quarter included a $355 million DVA gain in the Corporate & Investment Bank. Outside
of these four items, we had a number of other smaller items both positive and negative in the quarter which offset each
other, many of which I'll call out as we go through the presentation.
And we want to be very transparent with you: we don't count items like reserve releases and other non-core items when
we think about our end performance, so if we adjust for all of these items, both big and small, our return on tangible
common equity would have been about 15%, reflecting strong underlying core performance.
This quarter a couple of important themes: the markets environment in June as well as several capital developments, so
just a quick note on each. Rising long-term rates and higher levels of volatility in June had an impact both on the
quarter as well as in terms of our mortgage outlook guidance. Our markets businesses held up well in June and our
asset management platform outperformed during the backup. And importantly, remember that given the firm's
positioning, rising rates will drive significant benefit in higher NII over time.
However, in the near term, higher long-term rates and wider spreads drove a significant reduction in the unrealized
gains in our securities portfolio, or a reduction in AOCI, which did impact Basel III capital negatively. Despite that
impact, we were able to add to our capital and improve capital ratios as we began to realize some of the run off and
model benefits that we previously guided you to. And finally, higher rates will have a significant impact on mortgage
refi volumes and margins in the second half of the year.
On capital, we've added a new page in the deck on leverage which I'll cover in a moment but our headline capital
number is a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 9.3% including the impact of the final Basel III capital rules approved this
month by our regulators. In general the approvals were the same or similar to the NPRs and in that sense, were broadly
in line with our expectations, including the confirmation of no exception for AOCI. The estimated impact on our ratio
was a modest benefit.
So on page 3, let me take you through the details. We ended the quarter with Basel III Tier 1 common of $148 billion,
up from the prior quarter. We've put a Basel III capital walk here on the page in the blue callout box, which steps you
through each component of the change quarter-on-quarter. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratios before the impact of
final U.S. rules increased to 9.1% from 8.9% even after the 20 basis point impact from the change in AOCI. This
impact was offset by a $40 billion reduction in risk-weighted assets reflecting the impact of portfolio runoff as well as
lower levels of risk. So then adding in the benefit of final rules, which was principally related to changes in MSR rules
and securitization benefits, our ratio at the quarter-end was estimated at 9.3%.
And as you know, although we reflect our best understanding of all the rules in our ratio, we don't pull forward the
impact of passive run-off or model enhancements, some of which we saw this quarter. Together these will deliver
approximately an additional 75 basis points of benefits by the end of 2014. And we remain committed to reaching a
9.5% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio by year-end.
Briefly on liquidity, in addition to building our capital, we accelerated compliance with the proposed Basel III liquidity
coverage rules and not only did we become compliant with the rule during the quarter, but at quarter-end our estimated
ratio was 118% and we feel great about the progress we've made. Although there can be short-term volatility in the
number, you should expect that we will run around this level going forward.
And to finish on page 3 in the bullets, the Board increased the quarterly dividend to $0.38 a share from the previous
$0.30, and during the quarter we repurchased $1.2 billion of common equity. As a reminder, that's $1.2 billion of the $6
billion CCAR authorization.

Page 3 of 26
So turning to page 4, we've added this page to help walk you through our current thoughts on the new proposals
regarding Basel III leverage. Let me start with two things. We believe the leverage ratio is an appropriate complement
to a Tier 1 common ratio if properly calibrated. And our holding company leverage ratio is estimated at 4.7% at the end
of the quarter based upon the U.S. proposed rules. To be clear, these rules do not reflect the most recent Basel proposal,
which would further increase our leverage balance sheet.
Just a few comments on the proposal in the U.S. The denominator builds on GAAP assets with add-on for derivative
potential future exposures and off-balance sheet commitments, resulting in a gross up for us of approximately $1
billion. And remember, included in our balance sheet is over $450 billion of cash and other high-quality liquid assets,
which we think there's a strong argument that they should not attract capital at these levels.
So I'm going to take you through the analysis on the page. We started with analyst estimates for net income and we
held our dividend flat and assumed repurchases generally consistent with our current levels. Given those assumptions
we would be able to add approximately 60 basis points to the leverage ratio by the end of 2014.
Additionally, we will continue to recalibrate our Tier 1 capital through the issuance of preferred and finally we will
take appropriate actions to reduce our leverage assets, which may include some of the points on the slide, for example,
re-pricing or restructuring of commitments or unwinding certain derivative positions. If you take those together, this
could add another approximately 100 basis points over time for a total of up to 160 basis points. So we will adjust our
business but we do expect the holding company to be able to be compliant in early 2015 with the bank to follow. Of
course a caution that the timeline could be impacted if there are significant changes to the rules which are not yet final.
Changing gears, in terms of business performance, starting on page 5 with Consumer & Community Banking, the
combined consumer businesses generated $3.1 billion of net income for the quarter on $12 billion of revenue with an
ROE of 27%. Just a quick look at the franchise, we ended the quarter with over 5,600 branches, over 19,000 ATMs and
we now have nearly 1,700 Chase Private Client locations.
We continue to see really strong growth in the underlying drivers for the consumer businesses. Deposits were up over
$40 billion year-on-year, an increase of 10%. Customer attrition levels remain historically low and our active mobile
customer base grew by 32% year-on-year. So we're adding customers, we're retaining them through superior customer
experience and we're deepening our relationships with them.
Also mortgage and auto originations showed strong growth, up 12% and 17% year-on-year respectively, and we had
record credit card sales volume of $105 billion, up 10% year-on-year and record client investment assets of $172
billion, up 16%.
Turning to page 6, Consumer & Business Banking, net income of close to $700 million and an ROE of 25% on net
revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1% year-on-year and up 3% quarter-on-quarter. While we continue to see pressure on
deposit margins, five basis points down in the quarter, this continues to be largely offset by very strong growth. On the
non-interest revenue side, we're seeing strong growth in both debit and investment revenue. Expenses are up
year-on-year reflecting the investments we're making in the business including branch-builds, as well as the absence of
some one-time items that benefited the prior year.
During the quarter, we had record investment sales of $9.5 billion, up 53% year-on-year. And a note that approximately
70% of those sales are managed money, driving strong recurring revenue for the business, up 13% year-on-year.
Average business banking loan balances are flat quarter-on-quarter, up 4% versus last year and you can see here in the
drivers that the loan production stabilized just above the very low levels we saw in the first quarter. We believe that
we're maintaining share despite increased competition and the pipeline is up relative to first quarter which should
support origination levels in the second half of the year.
Turning to page 7 and Mortgage Banking, overall Mortgage Banking net income was $1.1 billion with an ROE of 23%.
At the top of the table, looking at the first blue highlighted line, production pre-tax income was $582 million. Top line
production revenue, excluding repurchases, was up slightly quarter-on-quarter with a higher reported gain on sales
pre-tax margin of 116 basis points, more than offsetting lower closed loan volumes, down 7%. $49 billion of mortgage
production saw a change in mix this quarter as the purchase market continued to recover. Our purchased volumes

increased over 40% quarter-on-quarter and contributed 36% to volume, up from 23% last quarter.
And despite the strong start in April, the environment in late May and June drove mortgage rates up significantly,
around 100 basis points. This pressure continued into July and we expect it could have a significant impact on the
refinance market side in the second half of the year. If mortgage rates stay at or above current levels, the market could
be reduced by an estimated 30% to 40%. Although we will adjust capacity, expense reductions will lag volume
reductions and will challenge profitability and production.
Moving down to Servicing, pre-tax income of $133 million, up quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year on lower expenses
and modest gain in the MSR. Servicing expenses of $715 million decreased quarter-over-quarter in line with our
expectations and we continue to see Servicing or expect Servicing costs to decrease to $600 million by the fourth
quarter.
At the bottom of the table Real Estate portfolio pre-tax was $1.2 billion. Run off of the legacy portfolio continued,
although in the quarter given the positive economics of retaining certain loans, we added close to $5 billion of
mortgage loans to our portfolio, which is up $1.3 billion quarter-on-quarter. And we expect to be able to sustain these
levels in the second half.
On Credit, delinquencies and foreclosure in our portfolio were each down around 10% quarter-on-quarter. Net
charge-offs continue to come down less than $300 million this quarter, which was in line with guidance. And we
released $950 million of reserves. The majority of this release related to the impact of lower severities reflecting real
and sustainable HPI improvements. Going forward we expect quarterly net charge-offs of less than $250 million and as
credit trends continue to improve, expect additional reserve releases in the next several quarters.
Turning to Card, Merchant Services & Auto on page 8, net income of $1.2 billion, up 21% year-on-year with an ROE
of 32%, or 23%, if you exclude reserve releases reflecting excellent underlying performance in the business. Revenue
of $4.7 billion was up 3% year-on-year and despite strong volumes down slightly quarter-on-quarter as a result of
spread compression. In Card, year-on-year growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes were strong and
consistent at 10% and 15% respectively. And importantly, we saw a stabilization of outstandings at the end of the
second quarter after 15 quarters of net run-off. And we believe we've reached an inflection point and expect some
modest growth from here.
Expenses are down year-on-year primarily driven by lower remediation expenses on our legacy product and the net
charge-off rate continues to be very low and we released $550 million of credit card loan loss reserves this quarter. This
reflected both the continued improvement in early stage roll rates as well as higher than expected levels of pay downs
on modified loans.
The net charge-off rate was 3.31%, down over 100 basis points year-on-year and if we continue to see favorable roll
rates, as well as our modified loans continuing to pay down, we will see incremental reserve releases in the second half
of 2013 and before we move on, a few words on Auto: originations up 17% year-on-year, reflecting market share gains
and driving loan balances up 5%.
Moving on to slides 9 and 10 and the Corporate & Investment Bank; a strong second quarter performance, which
included a DVA gain of $355 million. This is versus a gain in the same quarter of last year of $755 million, both of
which are shown in the credit adjustments line. As usual we'll focus on the numbers excluding DVA. $2.6 billion of net
income was the highest second quarter net income since 2009, up 37% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter.
Revenue of $9.5 billion was up 16% year-on-year and the business delivered an ROE of 19%. Total banking revenue of
$3.1 billion, up 17% year-on-year on higher IB fees of $1.7 billion, up 38% primarily driven by strong debt and equity
underwriting. We continue to be ranked number one year-to-date in IB fees and despite weaker credit markets towards
the end of the quarter we had near record debt underwriting fees in the first half of 2013. In equity capital markets we
have a number one wallet share for the first half of the year.
Moving on to Markets revenue, which was up 18% year-on-year, in line with our guidance, a very strong performance
particularly given the challenging environment in June reflecting strong client flows throughout the quarter, the

diversification of the business and trading risk discipline.
Fixed Income Markets revenue of $4.1 billion was up 17% year-on-year with credit and spread related products
benefiting from less eurozone uncertainty and a stronger U.S. housing market.
Equity markets of $1.3 billion was up 24% year-on-year with strong client flows in cash and equity derivatives and
before we leave markets, just a quick update on OTC clearing. The implementation of Phase 2 in June went very
smoothly. Although volumes were relatively light at launch, we have seen activity pick up and we feel we have the
right level of participation.
Security services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 1% year-on-year. And within this number, you should note growth in
custody fees is in line with asset growth but is offset by declines in agent lending as well as lower volumes in clearance
and collateral management.
Just a comment on credit. Trends are stable at low levels with small net recoveries for the quarter. Loans were down
6% quarter-on-quarter driven by lower balances in trade and conduits and expenses were up 8% year-on-year driven
primarily by higher comp on higher revenues, with the comp to revenue ratio excluding DVA of 31% for the quarter.
Finally on this page, at the bottom of the drivers section you see the CIB average VaR, which continued to decline to
$40 million reflecting generally lower levels of risk but also lower volatility across asset classes. A note that the
increased volatility in June did however drive spot VaR up higher to over $50 million.
Before we skip over page 10, just a comment. If you take a look at the numbers for the first half of 2013, you can see
we continued to make great progress in the international space and had particular strength in Asia during the quarter.
Turning to page 11, Commercial Banking saw a net income of $621 million on revenue of $1.7 billion with an ROE of
18%. Revenue was up 3% quarter-on-quarter despite the softer lending environment, driven by higher average loan
balances, stable spreads and positive momentum on cross-sell and IB fees.
Although end of period loans were flat this quarter, we saw very strong growth in commercial real estate, up 3% and
gaining share, offset by lower corporate lending. Our clients have excess cash and are keeping their utilization rates low
but we've also seen a continuation of competitive pricing and aggressive structuring. We are holding the line in
choosing quality over growth and this of course is reflected in our strong credit performance.
But we're still adding very good clients and doing many more business with our existing clients. As we look forward,
we expect continued strong growth in the real estate business given our competitive position, and for C&I loans,
pipelines are up from the first quarter and deal activity feels like it may be turning. We are expecting a more
constructive second half and therefore should see some growth but the environment remains competitive.
Turning to page 12 and Asset Management, an excellent quarter and despite challenging markets in June, we saw net
income of $500 million, up 28% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter with an ROE of 22%. $2.7 billion of revenue,
up 15% year-on-year, reflects an increase in management fees driven by strong long-term net inflows, $25 billion this
quarter, marking the seventeenth consecutive quarter of long-term inflows and higher equity and fixed income markets,
up 12% based on our business mix. We also saw higher performance fees driven by strong fund returns and record loan
balances up 16%, $15 billion year-on-year across products and geography.
A moment on expenses, growth and performance in the business led to 11% year-over-year expense growth but as our
investments season, the business is delivering positive operating leverage, which you can see in the pre-tax margin
which is 30%, up from 27% last year. We ended the quarter with assets under management of $1.5 trillion, up 9%
year-on-year and client assets of $2.2 trillion, up 10% despite small net outflows in June. However, the breadth of our
platform should enable us to continue to gather net new assets globally looking forward and we delivered strong
relative performance in both fixed income and equities.
Moving on to page 13 and Corporate and Private Equity, a net loss of $552 million for the quarter. Private equity
generated net income of just over $200 million, which included over $400 million of gains in part driven by
investments that are in active sales discussions. Treasury and CIO net loss was $429 million, driven by negative NII

due to continued low rates and slower reinvestments, as well as a change in portfolio mix shifting from higher yielding
securities to LCR-eligible securities and cash. The results also included net securities gains and a modest loss on TruPS
redemption which we guided to last quarter. Excluding the net of these two items CIO Treasury would have generated a
net loss of about $350 million which is generally in line with our guidance. Our quarterly guidance remains unchanged.
Finally Other Corporate, a net loss of $335 million includes the $600 million of pre-tax expense for additional litigation
reserve in the quarter. Excluding litigation, Other Corporate was around $100 million net income in line with our
guidance. Again, our guidance, which does exclude litigation and significant items, remains unchanged for Other
Corporate.
Turning to page 14 and net interest margin, net interest income was down slightly and core NIM was down 23 basis
points quarter-on-quarter. We acknowledge this is larger than you may have expected but let me give you some color.
Importantly it was principally a result of actions we took to build liquidity to comply with Basel requirements more
quickly which we believe is a strong positive. And to a degree it was also a pull forward of compression we've guided
to over time.
So we added a table on the slide which shows our cash balances and how they progressed over time and what you can
see circled is that our cash was up more than $100 billion quarter-on-quarter with other interest-earning assets being
broadly flat. This changed the relative mix and also the size of our interest-earning assets and drove core NIM down the
18 basis points we circled on the page.
While the increase in cash does reflect accelerated LCR compliance, it does also reflect very strong deposit growth and
slower reinvestments and a little less robust loan growth. The balance of the reduction in NIM relates to loan yield
compression partially offset by the lower cost of debt. So going forward, all else being equal, what we expect from here
is relatively stable NIM in the second half of the year and net interest income to increase modestly next quarter.
And finally, on slide 15, here's our outlook; I've covered these items as I went through the presentation. So in wrap-up,
overall a very strong quarter, returning 17% on tangible common equity with excellent underlying performance across
businesses while making significant progress on capital and liquidity ratios. And the firm overall is positioned to
benefit from higher rate environment.
Thank you for joining us, operator you can open up the call for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Good morning. Hi, Marianne. I was wondering if you could – do you have any sense
that you could give us of where you stand on the leverage ratio at the bank level today relative to the 6% requirement?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hey, John. Good morning. We don't disclose the bank leverage ratio but it is lower than the
holding company, so we would have a further way to go. We said we intend to be compliant at the holding company
level by the beginning of 2015 and welcome bank compliance shortly thereafter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. So shortly thereafter, maybe within a quarter or two? Can you give us any feel
there? Just to get a sense of...
<A - Marianne Lake>: John, obviously the rules are fairly new and still a proposal and not final so there's work to do
before they get finalized. We're working through all of the things we need to do to comply. I would say we would aim
to be compliant by the end of 2015 but we need to go do more detailed plans and we'll get back to you with more
specifics.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. You mentioned the mitigation you can do at the holding company, is there
mitigation you can also do to help the – specifically, the bank level ratio in terms of maybe assets that could be shifted
to the parent or equity that could go from the holding company to the sub and things like that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, all of those things could be considered and would be considered.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then on the liquidity ratio, I guess, why have you decided to run with this
level of cushion to LCR and why the acceleration in getting there now? Anything driving that in particular?
<A - Marianne Lake>: In terms of the cushion, while it's not scientific, there is a volatility in that number inherent in,
actually, deposit flows, so we do see some things in deposit flows, particularly wholesale flows, and that could span a
quarter end and drive the ratio up or down some so it's prudent to run at a ratio above 100% and at around about this
level. And just in terms of acceleration, we just wanted to get there more quickly. The opportunity presented itself, so
nothing more than that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And could you give us some of the assumptions behind your outlook for stable
net interest margin and modest net interest income growth in the back half of the year just in terms of maybe what
you're assuming on rates and loan growth? And what are the puts and takes in your outlook?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So it's a great, question, John, because as you alluded to in the question there's a large
number of moving parts in terms of the forecast including points of view on rates, which as you know have been
choppy over the last several weeks. So, you know, we base our projections on modest loan growth and on our
understanding of the implied rate curves and that they could change also. Deposit flows as you've seen, have been very,
very strong. So we accelerated our LCR compliance. That took the majority of the NIM compression we were
previously expecting and guiding you to forward and consequently we expect to be more stable with some loan yield
compression being offset by lower cost of debt.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then finally, I'm not sure if I saw it in here are not, but can you remind us
how much you benefit from higher rates and which rates in particular are most helpful for you? If you can go delineate
between kind of the 10-year and then kind of the shorter based rates?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So I'll just give you two data points and then you can maybe go and have a look at them.
But I think in the Q we disclose a couple things. The first is a bit of a steepener, which says that over 12 months it
would deliver about $900 million of additional NII. It's not exactly what we've seen but it's...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: That's the 10-year going up 100 basis points.
<A - Marianne Lake>: That's right. So the 10-year going up 100 basis points, I'm sorry, and that's not exactly what
we've seen but it's the closest thing to what we've seen right now. And then the other thing we've disclosed is on a
parallel shift of 100 basis point so if you saw short rates go up too, that would deliver just over $2 billion over 12
months. And don't forget that recurs but it takes time to build up to that.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And that's interest rates only, not mortgage volume, investment banking volume. That's just

<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And that has, that's the current numbers? That's last Q? Or that's as of right now?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Those were the numbers from the last Q and they are not meaningfully changed right now.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And last thing from me, on reserve release, how can we gauge if it is possible
at all, how long this can go on for? Are there any base metrics that you think you can't go below that we can kind of
look at as a percent of loans or a percent of normalized charge-offs? Any help you can give us to kind of gauge how
much might be left on reserve release front?

<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So, John, I would point you to, and I can't remember the page, I apologize, but we put a
page in investor day that talked about what we thought through the cycle charge-off rates were for each of our
businesses. And so what I would do is look at – take NCI loans and a reserve balance at the end of the period of $3.3
billion, take a look at that page and figure out what a more normal sort of charge-off rate and therefore reserve balance
would be and that will be in large part a reduction over the course of the next several quarters. So we expect it to be a
journey to get to that level throughout 2014.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And so wholesale we're kind of where we should be. You shouldn't expect much different. Credit
cards maybe a little bit more but then the hundreds of millions. And on mortgage, I think we said at the investor day
eventually would be $1 billion to $1.5 billion...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, around about $1.5 billion, down from $3 billion
<A - Jamie Dimon>: ...in a couple of years.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And PCI, if we have home improvement you may see some reduction in PCI loan loss reserves,
purchased credit-impaired.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: You haven't done that yet in terms of taking the PCI out yet, right?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No.
<A - Marianne Lake>: No. We haven't done that yet, John, but the reserve release we took in NCI was driven in large
part by lower severity. So as this continues you might see some of that.

Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So another quick question on leverage. Could you help me understand why it takes until 1Q
2015 for the bank holding company to add the 30 basis points necessary to the leverage ratio? It just looks like what
you laid out puts you kind of well above that, earlier?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So, Brennan, we're not – I guess what we laid on the page was an illustration. I mean
you're absolutely right what it shows you is that we ought to be able to close that gap much more quickly. And so that
might very well be what happens. We just aren't going to come out now with a target of achieving it over the course of
the next one or two quarters because we have other objectives including the continuation of being able to have some
capital distributions to you guys that we won't be able to decide – well, we do CCAR at the end of the year.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We'll be able to do it pretty quickly when we know what it actually is and we'll want to start
making actions that affect customers way in advance of knowing the real final rules.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure.
<A - Marianne Lake>: But what you took away from the page was absolutely right. Closing that gap should not be
difficult and could be more quick than this but we wanted to be cautious.

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Understood. Thanks. Was there a change in the securities portfolio during the quarter? And
maybe could you give us an update on where that duration stands?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We're not going to disclose the duration but there was some changes in the portfolio as we
moved out of non-eligible into eligible securities for LCR and also maintained more cash, so there was some changes
we also, as you saw, made some gains on sale when we were doing that.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So would the bias be to assume that it would be towards shorter?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No.
<A - Marianne Lake>: No
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: When rates go up, certain mortgages linked and a whole bunch of different things take place but
in general the portfolio is several-year duration and a couple year duration, AA plus and it obviously changes over time
to manage interest rate exposures.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Just a quick follow-up on John's question, given – is it generally right given what you
guys have disclosed and what you guys just verified and what we've seen in rates, if we assume that rates kind of stay
where they're at that you would get about 75% of that $900 million in additional NII in 2014 if we stay status quo to
where we are now?
<A - Marianne Lake>: That is not a bad assumption.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: All things being equal.
<A - Marianne Lake>: All things being equal, yeah. [Laughter]
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: All things are never equal but...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Right.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: And then last one, just trying to think about maybe the potential to avoid some of the really
big distraction that we saw this quarter around what is sort of becoming an annual event at the shareholder vote, have
you guys considered maybe articulating some kind of plan or a blueprint or a map or what have you to get people
comfortable with the future state of CEO/Chairman roles way down the line when there is sort of a succession that is in
place?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The Board – we're not going to say what Board deliberations are but the Board obviously has
talked to shareholders there are a bunch of ideas and also we think we have some of the best corporate governance out
there including – which I think is more important than the separation of Chairman and CEO, that the Board should
make decisions based on the circumstance at the time. They know the company, the strategy, the people that the Board
always meets without the CEO, the Board, in total, sets the agenda, the Board is completely engaged in CEO
compensation, the Board can hire and fire the CEO at will. Those practices, some are in our charter, some are not but
hopefully it won't be the distraction it was last year.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Let's hope so. Thanks for the answers.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hey. So one more question on page 4, your 4.7% is really close to what we were looking at
for 4.5% so very much in line with what we were looking for, I'm just wondering why no bank sub disclosure? I realize
that it's different but – and I heard your answer earlier but I'm just wondering why not just give us a number? Is it that
there's too much uncertainty in estimating that denominator you need understanding from the regulators as to what
they're looking for? Could you just help us out on what are the qualitative reasons?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Sure, Betsy. There's nothing sinister underlying it. Let me just give you hopefully enough. It is
a little bit lower than 4.7% and given that the ratio for the bank holding company is 6% then the gap is a little bit bigger
but measured in small tens of basis points, not more.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: A lot of it is historical how JPMorgan Chase got built, through mergers over time what ended up
in the bank, what ended up in broker dealers, we had to change our legal entities and move it overseas. So we had to
modify legal entities to accomplish our objectives and we'll be able to do that over time.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And over time what we're able to push out...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Exactly.
<A - Marianne Lake>: ...will help.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And the overriding constraint is the 5%.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yes I get that. If possible, I'd love to show you what our assumptions are and maybe we
could understand where we differ.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, of course.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then separately, you put on here, on this page the potential further add-ons for the
Basel proposal, you're talking about the Basel consultative document that came out a couple weeks ago.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Is there any sense as to what kind of basis point hit that is?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I mean, we're not going to disclose it today, Betsy, and we can reconsider that because we
think there's some pretty fundamental issues with some of the proposals not least of which is the absence of FIN 41
netting or netting on matched securities financing which we believe and are hopeful is going to be resolved but it is an
add-on and it's not insignificant.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And then things like stressing derivative receivables and not taking benefit for collateral, which
we know we get. There are a lot of issues in there that need to be looked at and analyzed.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. Agreed.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Betsy, to Brennan's earlier question I think in the context of what we've laid out as
illustratively being achievable, then time lines would solve the problem.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The other important point is one of the things that Basel and all this stuff is going to do is
harmonize global rules. This is clearly no longer harmonization. We have one part of the world that's talking about two
times what another part of the world is talking about and I don't think there's any industry out there that would be

comfortable with something like that in the long run. Because in the long run that has a lot of effects you can't
determine quarter-by-quarter.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yes. So and part of the challenge is a higher denominator on one side and a higher ratio on
the other side, right?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Just on HPI, HPI obviously rose significantly in the quarter. Could you give us an indication
as to how much that helped RWAs?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah so...
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Was that a big piece of the driver?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The HPI improvement on RWA has a bit of a lag to it. So while it did contribute to the
reduction in our RWA it was – our reduction was principally run off and some model enhancements and some lower
risk. But in part that lower risk was driven by better HPI.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So can you give us a sense as to given where HPI is today what kind of benefit that would
have on RWAs if there wasn't a lag?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We'll have to get back to you.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Betsy, it's a great question and we will get back to you after the call.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: I was drilling down to some of the businesses here. Obviously June, as you've mentioned,
we've all seen was very volatile in the credit markets and the fixed income markets in general. And I guess just kind of
basic question like how did you do so well on fixed income? I know you guys have commented early part of the month
but things have deteriorated quite a bit and I think some of us were surprised at how good it was in the quarter.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So June was a bit more challenging and so it wasn't as strong as April and May. But it really
comes down to the fact that we really do have a client driven business model and the client flows, they held up. And so
if you surround that with robust and strong trading risk discipline, that's pretty much how it panned out.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think our folks in emerging markets also did a spectacularly good job because I think you might
see some real differentiation there from some other folks in how their numbers come out.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: And is that just from managing a smaller inventory while the spreads were widening or...?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: A little bit of everything.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And I guess on the other side when we look at the comp rate at the investment bank,
it was down I think 2% to 3% both linked quarter and year-over-year. What's driving that? Is it mix? Is it the
streamlining of the business lines that you announced about a year ago fully coming together? Or just paying people
less?

<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think we've been very consistent on how we look at comp and how we accrue it and things like
that after capital charges and by line of business, type of business. So it's just a change of mix and a change of capital,
et cetera.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: And so I think you've been guiding towards 35%.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah.

Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Morning.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: First I just wanted to follow-up on the comment. So over the next 12 months NII should benefit
by 75% of the $900 million? So in other words you should – in 2014 you should benefit by about $700 million.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Well, Mike, all other things being equal that's not an unreasonable assumption. But as we said,
things are never equal.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: No, I understand. It's more art than science. So I guess your run rate of net interest income that
would be about 1.5% of that? Is that in the ballpark of how you think about it?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I'm sorry, Mike. Could you say that again?
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I said that benefit would equal about 1.5% of net interest income?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. I guess that's about right or maybe a little less. A little less, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And when you say the benefits, the benefit of the 10-year increasing 100 basis points? I
didn't fully hear how you explained that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. It's – I think we disclose all of the assumptions in the earnings risk tables in the 10-Q.
But yes it's short rates staying low and the ten-year going up 100 basis point, I think.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yes. It also drives up the 5-year, the 7-year...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, yes.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So if you use one point, it's the ten-year but it's the yield curve going up meaningfully, yes.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: The reason I ask that is it seems as though maybe the ten-year is not as relevant as perhaps the
five-year, or am I mistaken? Or the three year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: You're not mistaken, which is why if you actually get more of a parallel shift and short rates go
up, the numbers go up by multiples.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. Separately, the investment banking backlogs, where are they versus the first quarter at the
end?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The pipeline?

better.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: You saw a real slowdown when we had the volatile markets in June but we think that's actually...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Not permanent.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: ...opening – the market's kind of opening up again. You see a bunch of IPOs and debt deals and a
lot of M&A chatter.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And the leverage ratio, you said under the U.S. rules is 4.7%, under the proposed Basel rules, if
adopted, where would the leverage ratio be?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We didn't disclose that, Mike, for a couple of reasons, one is that, as we said, the proposals, we
think, have some fundamental issues to them but it would be lower. Their gross up to our balance sheet on top of the
3.5 trillion on the page would not be insignificant. But we didn't disclose that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Can you give us a ballpark or is that one reason you're being so conservative? You have 160
basis-point-potential benefit but you're still saying wait 'til early 2015, is that part of your thought process?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. That is definitely one of the reasons and that's one of the reasons why we said of course
the timeline to be impacted if there are significant changes to the rules and that would be one of those changes.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then last question relates to the processing business, which to me it looks like it's lagging
for the second quarter in a row. I'm asking a more broad question, for eight years since Bank One merged with
JPMorgan and I think for a few decades before that it was run as a separate business and the fourth quarter last year it
was merged into the investment bank and now we have two quarters in a row of what looks like performance that will
lag peers. So my question is, how is the management and organizational restructuring going? Is it impacting the
processing business or is there something else taking place there?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: First, I think it's going great and the folks in the field will tell you that they're seeing huge
benefits from putting together the corporate global investment bank, the corporate investment bank, treasury services.
But you are right, there has been a flattening out a little bit in treasury services and investment services which is mostly
custody, some of that is spread, some of that is margins, so some of that will benefit also a little bit from rising rates.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Right.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We don't know what the peers will show yet, so maybe you do but I don't know yet.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I'm guessing it's going to lag, I mean assets under custody down 2% linked quarter when
markets are up as much as they are. Is there anything else that's one-time or unique?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Mike, I don't know and obviously if we lag our peers we'll be as disappointed as you are.

Our next question comes from Erika Penala of Bank of America.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: Good morning. My first question really has to do with some of the initial questions
asked on capital. What is the priority here on capital distribution versus leverage ratio? Is it compliance to the 5% at the
hold co. Or is it accelerating capital distribution over the next two years relative to what you announced out of this

year's CCAR or can JPMorgan both be compliant with a leverage ratio over time and accelerate buybacks and
dividends?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Your last one.
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's balancing both, Erika, which is why in response to the earlier question we said we've been
conservative on the timeline because we want to preserve the flexibility to consider capital distributions when we do
our CCAR in 2013 and it will be a factor we consider.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: Okay. A follow-up question on what you mentioned, Marianne, in the beginning of the
call on mortgage, you mentioned that if rates, loan rates stay where they are that could mean the market shrinks by 30%
or 40%. What is the proportionate expense in that scenario that you could take out of the business and how long
typically is the lag until you can take those expenses out?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, Erika, the truly, truly variable as in transaction variable proportion of the businesses is it's
some but the majority of it is related to people and systems so there's usually a several month lag to be able to get that
out of the system.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: And proportionately, if the revenues are down let's say – origination revenues are down
30% to 40%, what's the, I guess the efficiency ratio that we can think about as we think about the variable costs that can
get taken out?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Think about it this way, I think revenue margins will be down on competitive pressures,
volumes are down and expenses may go up because volumes are down for a couple of quarters.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: I see. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Expense margins, sorry, expense margins would go up.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: A dramatic reduction in profits.
<A - Marianne Lake>: We're trying to be clear with you that this would be a significant event, if rates stay where they
are, if mortgage rates stay where they are. Or go higher.

Our next question comes from Andrew Marquardt of Evercore Partners.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask, maybe I missed it on expenses. Can you talk about
how you're still feeling about the full year target you previously had talked about down $1 billion year-over-year
ex-legal? Does that still stand?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So let me just walk you through it, if you've got – so this quarter our expenses adjusted for
litigation were $15.2 billion. For the first half adjusted for corporate litigation and foreclosure rated matters, it was
$30.7 billion, which would be against the $59 billion target, which is running a little high but there are two important
factors. One is in our definition of adjustment we only adjusted out corporate litigation so there's other litigation in the
firm that's several hundred million dollars. It's disclosed in our supplement. You can see that. And also in the first half
of the year, we did see outperformance in terms of the investment bank or CIB revenues and clearly we paid
compensation on that, which is a good expense and we would weight that in all day long. So if you take the
combination of those two things that we don't technically adjust out, our underlying core expenses are on track for that
number yet.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. That's helpful. And the additional litigation costs this quarter, somewhat elevated.
How do we think about them going forward, staying elevated but at a similar rate? Or a little bit lower? How do we

think about that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: You can't really think about a run rate trend in litigation costs because they are somewhat
lumpy so we don't have a forecast for you and they will go up and down.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. Thanks. In terms of the rates, obviously impact a lot of different businesses,
mortgage, the balance sheet, NII, NIM discussion but then also can you walk through how we should think about it in
terms of the FICC business, heightened volatility, maybe more volume, but then obviously softer environment in June?
How do we think about this current environment kind of playing out for the back half of this year in terms of trading?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: You're absolutely right. When you separate NIM, you try to tease it out and you make our
interest rates because you're going to look at the underlying results, underlying volumes and things like that. There's no
reason to think that we're not going to have any good trading going forward because if the economy is strengthening
and we believe – our view is that it is, and that capital markets are going to open up again and people get adjusted to
slightly new higher rates and yeah, volatility helps certain trading areas. It hurts – high interest rates hurt mortgages but
again they can help other areas. So it's a whole potpourri. It's impossible almost to separate it out and we try to do that
for you but I think it's a little bit of a mistake when you look at the whole company.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Okay. Thank you. And then my last question was just a clarification. There has been a lot
of regulatory issues: capital, liquidity buffer zone buffers, OLA et cetera. Is it – as well as – I know you guys I expect –
I think it's this quarter that you're resubmitting your CCAR plan. Is it fair to assume that despite all these things that
have been coming out, still some hurdles need to be met, that one shouldn't expect a change in capital deployment? Or
should we?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, we're working really hard on the CCAR resubmission and you're right, we're going to
resubmit that before the end of the third quarter. We're in constant dialogue with the regulators, although we won't
receive any formal feedback until we're in the fourth quarter and so we're doing everything we can to be able to be
successful in remediating any of the issues they identify for us and if we're able to do that, then there should be no
impact.

Our next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning. Just a couple of questions. First of all, Marianne, you mentioned servicing
costs in the mortgage business being down by about $600 million in the fourth quarter. Is that largely coming out of
default side of things? Or do you think that will be more evenly spread between default and more regular servicing?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, just a point of clarification, if it wasn't clear is that our guidance is that we're expecting to
get our expenses down to $600 million in the fourth quarter from the level they're at now, which is $715 million for this
quarter. So just that's to be very clear and to remind you longer our longer-term run rate for that business is $325
million a quarter. So, it is dominated by the default side but there is some core performance servicing in there too.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And to keep it really simple, we hope to get it to a run rate of $500 million the year after that,
$400 million the year after that and $325 million the year – where we should be. We have a lot of work to do in
systems, et cetera to get all that done. And obviously the costly foreclosure and delinquent stuff is also coming down.

<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: So it's about a three to four year run rate to get down to ultimately where you want to be?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Three year.
<A - Marianne Lake>: About three years. And know that we are actively working the portfolio to be able to do what
we can more quickly so you would expect that we are looking at either sales or sub-servicing of defaulted loans and
capacitizing our performing servicing. So we're working on all of that.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. Marianne, just a further clarification question on gain on sale margins. You
mentioned those were 118 basis points this quarter. You mentioned last quarter that they were 100 basis points and
about 180 basis points on a normalized basis in the fourth quarter. Are all those calculated in the same way? Are those
quarterly averages? Or are those the gains at the end of the quarter? I just want to make sure we understand that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Sure. They're all calculated the same way based upon the disclosed closed loan volumes that
we have for you. So if you take the revenues and expenses and use the closed loan volumes for the quarter that's how
we derive the margins, which is why you see some noise, short-term noise quarter-over-quarter and the increase this
quarter to actually 116 basis points because we actually took revenues when we lock loans but we report them closed.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Which is different than you guys do it at Wells.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Fair enough. And then one final question, Marianne, you mentioned deal activity appears
to be turning. I think that was with respect to the Commercial Banking business. Could you provide a little more color
on that? Did June's volatility in the interest rate scenario slow down business activity in the Commercial Banking
business? I'm not really specifically talking about the investment bank but more in the commercial banking side of
things.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So I would tell you that it's more of what we're seeing and feeling in my discussions and
activity with our clients that we feel like deal activity levels have picked up and may be turning and the pipeline feels a
little better and solid but not strong. So we're expecting that to translate into the second half and obviously as the
economy continues to recover and confidence continues to grow, hopefully that will get even better.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And just finally there's been a lot of talk obviously in the last couple days about a
potential of reassertion Glass-Steagall and I guess I'm just curious, given your current business model, would that – if
that were to come to pass, would that be a meaningful negative in terms of your ability to maintain your cross sell
opportunities across the businesses? Or is that perhaps less of a challenge given how you currently have the businesses
structured?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So listen, my comment on that is that Glass-Steagall didn't have anything to do with the crisis
and our business model allowed us to be a port in the storm. Our customers like doing business with us in the model
that we have now so...
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: We don't spend time thinking about it.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking my question.

you're going to hold your capital distributions flat, is that for all of 2014 relative to 2013?

illustrative we just for the purposes of this analysis, we just held everything flat. That's not to imply anything about

what our capital distributions will be going forward but rather to imply we can continue to do some.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Yes. Okay. And then second, you put in here the Tier 1 capital actions could add possibly
30 basis points. Could you give some color behind what you're thinking there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. I mean it's just optimizing our mix between common and preferred.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. And with the total leverage impact of 60 to 160 basis points, clearly that's over the
5%. I assume then that you are going to be comfortable running something north of 5% when you finally get there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's too early for us to talk about buffers on that level.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. In your investor day, you gave us the ROEs for the different lines of businesses and
in the total firm, you felt 15% to 16% – 16% was your target ROE. Will that change now that you've got to carry the
higher leverage numbers?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Folks, this just came out. So we're trying to share information with you and it might, but give us
a little time, we'll give you a deeper feel how this might affect different businesses, different products because
obviously when you do something like this, this will be put down at one point not just to the line of business but to the
client and the product and the country. And then we can answer that question for you.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. You guys have had some great C&I loan growth in the middle market space over the
last four, five, six quarters. It seemed to really slow down this quarter. Anything in particular happen?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Nothing in particular, just demand.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I should temper that with just demand and the continuation that we've talked about of very,
very strong competition and we are, as I said, we are prioritizing quality over growth. We would tactically
underperform rather than chase a deal that we weren't comfortable with.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And finally, can you give us any color on how the shared national credit exam has gone?
And are those results in your second quarter results? Or will they be in third quarter results?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The results are in our second quarter results.

Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. I hate to focus on the leverage ratio but
one question on the cash component. I think by my calculation if you were to exclude cash from the denominator that
would add almost 70 basis points to your leverage ratio. Do you think that that has any legs or any sticking with
regulators in terms of logic around excluding that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: You've got to ask them.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: We hope so.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Yeah. It would make some sense. And then maybe just getting to the FICC business, you
alluded to it a little bit, some businesses benefit from volatility. Is it fair to assume that in June we saw things like

think about it?

<A - Marianne Lake>: Month specific.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: ...monthly specifics. I think our folks did a very good job in June.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Obviously when spreads widen out, certain businesses are more at risk than others but I already
mentioned that emerging markets where we probably saw the most volatility both in terms of spreads, volatility and
equity markets, et cetera, did a very good job.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Thank you very much. On your reserve ratios right around 2% and you had a lot of reserve
releases in the quarter, with credit improving, can you continue to do this type of releases in the next couple quarters?
Or is that reserve ratio going to stick around 2%?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So you should think about mortgages having some more releases because we continue to see
delinquencies and severities improve, particularly HPI improvement and so you should expect that to continue, maybe
not at the level we saw this quarter because we had a big revision to HPI, as you know, during the last several months.
And in card, we've had $1.050 billion of reserve releases in the first half. Given what we're seeing, we expect more
releases in the second half but not at that level.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Think of it as several hundred million.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Several hundred million dollars.

Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski of Autonomous Research.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. So just looking at the hit to the OCI at 3.1 billion, it actually seems like it's
less than would have been implied by the guidance that you gave at the investor day. Obviously that was for a more
severe shock but just calibrating it relative to the number of basis points that the 10-year went up, et cetera. Any
comment on that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think you got it exactly right. At the investor day we gave you something that was far more
dramatic than 100 basis points and we already said the duration of this thing is not 10 years. It's a lot less than 10 years
so obviously the effect would be less.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And is part of the reason why – besides the fact that it was 100 basis point not a 230 basis
point move or whatever – is part of the reason linked to the de-risking of the treasury portfolio that you were talking
about as you prepared for the LCR?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Not really.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Not really.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. But then is there validity to the fact – to the idea that if we recalibrated for 100 basis
point move versus 230 basis point move that I think it is implicit in the $15 billion number that you gave us in
February, was the $3 billion in line with that or was it actually materially better and if so maybe if it wasn't related to
the LCR de-risking why did you have a better outcome?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The investor day scenario was a more severe scenario than the 230 basis point you're implying.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: What was the number we gave at investor day?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It was 300 plus or minus.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Right.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And this is in line with our expectations.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Unfortunately the OCI is not – I hate to say it, it is not that big of a deal. We all know about it,
we're all prepared for it, rates are going to go up, OCI gains are going to go down. With 20 basis points – you're going
to see this happen elsewhere, it's asynchronous. You know, we have OCI going through capital and the benefits going
through earnings in the future.
You know, so if it were up to us we wouldn't have actually had this asynchronous accounting in this thing and we're
prepared, we're going to have buffers, [indiscernible] (1:02:41) conservation buffer works but it's not that big of a deal.
The duration of our portfolio, and you guys could do it yourself, AA plus, couple year duration, you can almost
calculate the number yourself with one caveat, is that the losses are less as rates go up because of the convexity of the
portfolio currently. Another thing about this, we can change it overnight at any time.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Right. Fair enough. As I think about the changes that you can make to the business that you
referred to on page 4 to mitigate the impact of the leverage ratio changes, you talked about optimizing the use of central
clearing and yet there's also all these concerns about the disallowance of additional derivatives collateral. How
comfortable are you that the way the rules are written right now, moving your derivatives business more towards
central clearing really does, because of the collateral, give you a lot of relief on those leverage assets?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: If you move a trade to central clearinghouse it has no charge here and it has nothing to do with
the margin that they put up at the clearinghouse. If the trade is bilateral with us, you have the receivable get stressed,
you can't take the benefit of the fact that you're going to get collateral against it, that's the way the calculations are done
but any trade you move to a clearinghouse eliminates that exposure.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Right.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The margin with clients at clearinghouse is not with us, it's with the clearinghouse.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Right. So I guess the logical next question for that is: given the central clearing mandate
which has started to be implemented recently: should we – as we think about leverage ratio going forward, should we
be thinking about a large part of that derivatives add-in to the denominator of the ratio as basically being a runoff?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well we had already added in our forecast to you guys some stuff moving: derivatives, how we
look at capital and all that so I do think at the margin this will move more things into clearinghouses but we don't have
analysis to tell you about that right now.

Will it be material? We don't really know yet. Remember the clients, a lot of the client business, they are also going to
determine what they want. It won't just be up to us.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And remember that the derivative add-on calculation is a calculation that is currently being
re-thought by the Basel Committee because of some of the issues with it, so it could also in and of itself, improve.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. When you think about those leverage-asset actions that you're talking about, is
there any linkage of taking those actions that further benefits LCR?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We haven't done that analysis.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's hard to tell.
<A - Marianne Lake>: To be honest, we were trying to be very transparent and give you some ideas about the sorts of
things that we're considering. We haven't translated these into detailed plans yet, so we don't know the second order
impacts of this yet.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Fair enough.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think Marianne gave numbers to show that we can handle this, but there's also – you have to be
very cognizant of client effects. We have a client business and we have to make sure that we continue to have a client
franchise and so over time we'll adjust the businesses and we'll meet LCR, we'll meet Basel III, we're going to meet
whatever the leverage ratio is and think of it in some ways as alternative minimum taxes, so every client will be
running what's your return on Basel III capital and then what's your return on leveraged capital and you'll try to
manage...
<A - Marianne Lake>: And stress capital.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And stress capital. So you'll manage, try to manage all those. It's fair to the client and kind of fair
to the company.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. One last question I'll ask to you is that as I've talked with clients over the last couple
of days about this leverage ratio issue, one of the questions that has come up is, wouldn't it be possible to downstream
more capital to the banks in order to deal with the 6% requirement there? Obviously that incurs a double leverage issue
potentially. Your double leverage ratio right now is just over – I think it's like 1.05%. I mean is there any room there?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Obviously you can do stuff like that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And give us a little time. I mean there's some you can inject into the consolidated pretty easily,
maybe you have to restructure some things and change the capital structure a little bit, move businesses out of a FDIC
insured bank and all that. I just don't think any of that's going to be critical to the future function of our business. We'll
adjust those things to accomplish what we need to accomplish. And give us a little more time so...
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: This just came out a couple days ago.

Page 21 of 26
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yeah. Just following up on Guy. I wonder I mean it just seems the thrust of the whole
leverage ratio is that it's going to penalize the businesses that have the highest ratio of leverage ratio assets to risk
weighted assets. And can you give us an idea like where that gap is the biggest? And in particular also, are any of these
global businesses where this would give European banks a leg up?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well let me do the first question, the second question first. If you have a world where some
businesses have to have twice as much capital as other companies, that obviously over time can create huge
competitive disadvantages. I don't know of any industry in America who would want to compete globally on that basis.
We have an interest in a safe and sound system so we're not against a leverage ratio but we would be – we're not for a
hugely unbalanced competitive playing field. So put that aside, the regulators know that. They're trying to – we thought
the point of Basel and all that is to harmonize these kind of things.
And if you ask about it, where we show here, and Marianne just shows it, anything which is a low RWA asset,
including HQLA, revolvers, certain types of derivatives, those things obviously we'll look at a little bit differently
because there's leverage ratio asset. And we won't have to do it by business yet. We'll give you more detail later.
Like even Marianne had mentioned that we take huge deposits in from countries and from money funds, et cetera, that
we may not take in because you can't afford capital against a deposit, $1 billion you get in from a money fund that you
park at the Fed for 25 basis points, you pay the FDIC 10 basis points, you pay the client 5 or 6 or 7 basis points and
you've got to put 6% capital against it. You simply stop doing it. There are a whole bunch of things we've got to figure
out how we're going to do it. But we want to make sure we manage the client franchise properly. We'll figure out the
other stuff over time.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: All right. That's it for me. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Just, Jamie, following up on that, it just seems like even the $100 billion of
increase in deposits this quarter probably cost you 15 basis points in that leverage ratio. And so is there any movement,
do you think, during the comment period towards exclusion of any of the risk-free assets at all?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah. So separate the type of deposit, okay? So if it was a consumer deposit it has a completely
different LCR, how you can invest it, the kind of spread you can make. If it's what we call a big wholesale short-term
deposit, you're absolutely correct. We could probably restrict some of that over time.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Right. Okay. And maybe just to follow-up on the mortgage business. You talked about
some of the financial impacts. Can we talk a little bit just about strategically what you're doing as you kind of look at
that business and the competitive environment in a kind of weaker refi environment?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. This backup although sharp, is not entirely unexpected. And so as we thought about our
longer-term plans and when we outlined all of that in the strategy for the Mortgage business at investor day that
medium to long-term plan does not change. So it may accelerate some of the activities that we have and have, as we've
said, some impact on the next couple of quarter's results. But the long-term strategy hasn't changed. We're working the
portfolio, optimizing servicing, trying to take costs out as quickly as possible and grow share. And actually we think we
should be able to grow share even more strongly in a more difficult market.

<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning. Two questions. First on the branch banking network, I know this backup in
rates has been primarily at the longer end and we have not yet had a corresponding rise in short-term rates but do you
see any need at this point to re-price products, et cetera, at the branch level due to consumer perception of rising rates?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No. No, Nancy.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Not yet.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Not yet. And as you know, traditionally that would in any case lag. Of course that doesn't
mean it will but that's traditionally what happens.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Secondly, Jamie, you talked about the asynchronous nature of the OCI with OCI getting
dinged now with the benefits in the future. Something else asynchronous is sort of staring us in the face and that's this
loan loss reserve methodology possible change to expected lifetime loss. What are your thoughts about that? Where
does that stand in an implementation process? And would you really get dinged by that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: This is what the issues are: you spend all this time talking about accounting as opposed to
business. The business is deposits, serving clients, doing things and now we talk all the time about AOCI. We have a
lot of asynchronous accounting and procyclical accounting and stuff like that, which you try to explain, but we try to
look through all of that and build the business: more clients, more bankers, more branches, happier clients. So in all of
our business, that's how we look at it. We'll work through the asynchronous accounting. If the loan loss reserve
accounting changes, it would add obviously to loan losses though probably not as much as people think, but we still
would run the business for economics in the long run. It wouldn't change how we run the business. We'd just be holding
more reserves, which would be fine with us.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Do you have any sense though – I realize that you're going to run the business for the
business, but do you have any sense if this is going to happen and when it might happen?
<A - Marianne Lake>: As you know, the industry commented, we commented, in terms of the proposal and we're
generally in favor of it but think that a lifetime timeline is too long. So something shorter than that would make sense. I
think we need to work that through. It would be implemented over not the course of the next couple quarters but in a
year or so. So we'll wait and see.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: All right. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Chris Whalen of Carrington.
<Q - Christopher Whalen>: Marianne, could you go back to mortgage and talk a little bit about the quality of the
demand you're seeing? At the beginning of the year the industry was guiding down about 20% in terms of volumes, and
for next year as well. Your numbers suggest that that's basically doubled. In other words, instead of 20%, we're looking
at 30% to 40% given rates. Would it be fair to say that the two factors are equal?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I would say, first of all, the industry groups haven't fully reforecast the markets, so we'll wait
and see what they come out with. We're trying to be transparent with our guidance so that level hopefully we're wrong
and hopefully it will be better than that. I will say for our own business we didn't expect volumes to be down this much
throughout the year had this not happened with this speed.
<Q - Christopher Whalen>: So you think there is definitely a price reaction that out there among consumers?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Mostly this is refi.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: They're not going to make up for refi but they may go up, yes.
<Q - Christopher Whalen>: But, Jamie, back to your point about harmonization. When you look at the totality of the
way the regulators are treating mortgage, MSRs, for example, which have been rallying very strongly in the past few
months, and your comments last year about Basel, should the U.S. withdrawal from Basel II? It's so unfriendly to
businesses that are very important to you and to the economy, particularly in mortgage. What are your thoughts on
that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We're in favor of finishing – we've always believed in high capital, high liquidity, good
regulation and things like that and finishing it. And obviously there are things that all countries have points of view
about which would be different but I think the better you get to real harmonization – the closer you get to real
harmonization, the better. If you want to start all over again, we'll spend another five years debating every single thing
out there.
<Q - Christopher Whalen>: Right, precisely. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. Marianne, can we just go back to the sequential NII guidance? Can you
help me understand how much of that is coming or what the attribution is between benefits to NIM versus loan growth?
<A - Marianne Lake>: As I said, we're expecting NIM to stay broadly flat from here. We do expect some modest loan
growth. That's our outlook, I'm not going to tell you how much, but some. And then we also have the improving cost of
debt, lower cost of debt on actions that we've been taking throughout the first half.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: So I guess a couple of follow-ups then. I mean shouldn't presumably then the benefits to the
funding cost should show up through NIM, no?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. But we also have loan yield compression and so there's puts and takes and so relatively
flat on NIM, modestly up on NII.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And then just within the composition of loan growth, if you divorce out the credit card
seasonality, it's been within a very stable range. What is it that in your view takes the loans out of the current range?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I'm sorry. I didn't understand.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: So in other words your loan growth has been – sorry not your growth but rather your loan
balances have been between $725 billion and $727 billion or $728 billion very consistently for many quarters if you
divorce out fourth quarter credit card seasonality.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: But it sounds like you have some expectation that it starts to move out of the range in order
to generate this improvement in NII? I'm wondering what the driver of that is?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So we're growing loans in Asset Management, we're growing loans in Auto, we're adding more
mortgage loans, we're expecting some growth in commercial. Our commercial real estate is already growing strongly.
We're expecting some growth in middle market and corporate client banking space, although we've seen loan reduction
in CIB. We're expecting that to remain relatively flat so all other things being equal, that's net growth. And Card, as I
said, has hit that inflection point. So that will stop contributing to run off net.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it. And then just finally on the third quarter guidance, is that consistent with, or
relatively better than your prior annual guidance of down 1%?

<A - Marianne Lake>: So our annual guidance is that if you look at the first half of the year you will see that
obviously already we are down year-to-date by more than that amount. So this is relative to the third quarter we expect
NII to go up, we're already down a little more than 1%.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Yes. Good morning. I have questions on a couple of topics. Perhaps the first one on
equity capital markets. Clearly, I think the volumes were up about 2% quarter-on-quarter and I think we all expected
you to outperform. But it was an extremely good performance and I wondered if you could brag a little bit about how
you achieved that, how much you thought was from the market share and perhaps how much is down to geographic
split. That's the first question.
The second one I'm afraid – or the second two go back onto leverage. I'm just intrigued by the comments on page 4,
which you've touched on in an earlier question on a the Tier 1 capital actions, which kind of you sort of suggested
would be perhaps issuance of some additional Tier 1 capital. This is this becoming called now AT1. And I wondered if
you actually had any indication yet, I know it's very early, from the regulator on what the terms of that new capital
would have to be to qualify for Tier 1 under Basel III?
And then perhaps talk about the $14 billion, $15 billion of current hybrids that you have within the Tier 1 calculation,
which obviously are going to phase out, I think in some cases if not all, through to end of 2018 and what your strategy
is for replacing those?
And then just perhaps finally, I know Jamie's talked a lot about level playing fields and I've asked him that last year on
Basel III capital. But I'm just wondering what will actually, the leverage ratio that you're looking to have to achieve
now, whether that actually gives you a competitive advantage as opposed to a disadvantage given 3% is pretty well
being considered too skinny? Thanks very much.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well thank you for bragging on our trading results. And for years the investment bank is building
FX rates, securitized products, commodities, emerging markets credit and they're good. And obviously some go up and
some go down. I wouldn't say it was – at least I didn't see any regional effects. I mean we trade around the world and
the books get handed off around the world. So it's hard to give it a region. But we build a lot of client flow businesses
and that was driving it.
If I think of the harmonized – I think it's better for the world to have harmonized rules around what Basel is trying to do
et cetera. But you are absolutely correct, it doesn't have to be exactly the same to have a competitive marketplace, et
cetera. We always ran with higher capital liquidity than most of our competitors.
I just think if one is 3% and one is 6%, that becomes just too big and over time it can have huge competitive effects.
And the regulators are working out – we all want a fair, safe, sound financial system, okay. So that's in everyone's
benefit and there are huge capital issues – I mean capital requirements, liquidity requirements, leverage requirements,
stress-testing requirements and among all of that I feel good in there. But at one point they should be somewhat
harmonized.
And your middle two questions, I now forgot.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Additional Tier 1 capital, AT1. Can we get back to you on some of that stuff? We're running
out of time rapidly.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Okay. I do appreciate that. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Our next question comes from David Hilder of Drexel Hamilton.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Good morning. Just quickly, to be clear on page 4, are you saying that your 4.7% leverage
ratio is as of June 30 without any other assumptions or roll forward?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. Correct.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I'm sorry, David, as of June 30 based upon the U.S. proposed rules.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Estimated to the best of our ability.
<A - Marianne Lake>: All those caveats.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: And congratulations for doing the work so quickly. But secondly, Jamie, how will you as a
company respond to the proposal? Are you in favor of it largely? Are you against it? Will you have a lot of proposed
changes to it?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So David, we did say at the beginning that we do think that having a leverage ratio is an
important part of a capital management toolkit or process as long as it's properly calibrated. And so for us the two
questions and I think they're very important and the industry does too, so we're participating in discussions, is, as
Jamie's talked about, what should the quotient or the ratio be and making sure that that's not only appropriate but fair
across the globe, and also, what should the calculation for the denominator be and we've alluded already to two specific
questions but there are more. One is: should high quality liquid assets or most particularly cash and cash at central
banks be treated the same as other balance sheet items? And then in terms of some of the additional add-ons that are
being proposed, we think they could have issues, actual issues, for the operation of the financing market.
So I think there's going to be a lot a work that takes place. There are comments due back on all of those proposals by
mid-September, call it, plus or minus, and I think this will be worked through, through the fourth quarter.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Okay. Thanks very much.
