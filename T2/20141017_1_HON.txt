presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Elena Doom
Thank you, Leo. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Here with
me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; Senior Vice President and CFO, Tom Szlosek. Today's call and webcast,
including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our web website at honeywell.com/investor.
Note that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the
world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we would ask that you interpret
them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and
other SEC filings.
This morning, we will review our financial results for the third quarter, share with you our outlook for the fourth
quarter and provide an initial framework for 2015. And finally, we will have time for your questions.

Morning, all. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell had another terrific quarter with better-than-expected
operational performance and sales, margins and earnings all exceeding our guidance.
In the quarter, our organic sales growth accelerated to 5%, a continuation of the positive trend we've seen throughout
the year and even more encouraging was the fact that we saw organic sales growth broadly across the portfolio in all
our segments. It truly was a balanced contribution highlighting great positions in good industries.
Our short-cycle order rates continue to trend positive as we saw strong quarters from Energy, Safety, and Security and
Transportation Systems, as well as continued improvement in Advanced Materials.
Our long-cycle businesses are maintaining robust backlogs with strong orders and sales growth this quarter from UOP,
Process Solutions and Aerospace, giving us confidence in our outlook beyond this year.
Geographically, where as you know we are well-diversified, we're seeing strength in the U.S., particularly in our
residential and industrial markets. As you know, we've been conservative over the years in our planning assumptions
for Europe and I think that's been a good call. China continues to be a strong market for us both on the short and long
cycle sides of the portfolio and we saw double-digit increases this quarter in both the Middle East and India, reinforcing
that our focus on high-growth regions is paying off.
EPS of $1.47 increased 19% year-over-year, or 14% normalized for tax. So, another quarter of double-digit EPS
growth, with earnings coming in above the high end of our guidance range.
Our continued progress on the Honeywell Operating System or HOS and other key process initiatives are delivering
meaningful growth and productivity benefits. We're seed planting all the time to drive top and bottom line growth.
Complementing the balanced portfolio is our relentless focus on new products and technologies, which help us to
differentiate. Innovation remains the lifeblood of the organization, and we continue to win big in the marketplace. And
we've got some really good stuff to talk about today.
Because we're really excited about the Gulfstream, new 600 and 500 series planes that were announced earlier this
week. And we have several innovative Honeywell technologies on board, including our avionics and mechanical
portfolios. A sampling includes synthetic vision, wireless connectivity, cockpit avionics, traffic and 3-D airport maps,
and our APUs and environmental controls.
We also have another first, the Gulfstream flight deck called Symmetry will include – for the first-time ever, integrated
Honeywell touch-screens that will be used for cockpit system controls, flight management, communication, checklists
and monitoring weather and flight information.
This new approach reduces pilot workload, while improving communications in a more natural and intuitive way.
These new products are part of our company-wide HUE initiative, and reflect the most integrated and streamlined flight
deck in business aviation.
Staying with Aerospace, in September, we announced that Bombardier Business Aircraft will be the launch business
aircraft manufacturer for Honeywell Aerospace's JetWave Ka-Band satellite connectivity system. Our JetWave
hardware exclusively supports Inmarsat's forthcoming Jet ConneX service which, when it goes live in 2015, will
provide business jet passengers with high-speed, in-flight connectivity virtually anywhere in the world.
To put it in perspective, this will allow passengers to video-conference, send and receive large files and access
streaming content while on the move by enabling them to access Inmarsat's service. This exclusive high-speed
connectivity will also enable us to differentiate our cockpits and mechanical systems through innovative data sharing
and services making aircraft and pilots more efficient.
In our Scanning & Mobility business, we're working with the United States Postal Service, one of the largest global
mail carriers, to deploy more than 75,000 units of our next-generation mobile delivery device by year's end.
This custom branded mobile device is based on our market-leading mobile computing technology, the Dolphin 99EX.
Clever name, eh? Used by postal carriers and mail processing employees, the device improves critical activities related

to making on-time deliveries, including reliable tracking information, proof-of-delivery for priority mail, and postal
route navigation support.
We're also excited about the growth we're seeing from Solstice, our new line of refrigerants, insulation materials,
aerosols and solvents that have global warming potential lower than CO2.
In September, at a White House event, we announced that we will increase production of Solstice products; and as a
result, we'll drive a 50% reduction in our annual production of high-GWP hydrofluorocarbons or HFC on a CO2
equivalent basis, prior to 2020.
We project that the use of our Solstice products will eliminate more than 350 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent by
2025, that's equal to removing 70 million cars from the road for one year.
And in mobile air conditioning, we've had significant wins from global customers and expect our sales to continue to
ramp as Solstice helps customers meet CAFE standards in the U.S. and the new MAC regulation in Europe which goes
into full effect in 2017. So, with the increased order book for our Solstice applications and the new capacity coming
online, [ph] flooring (07:30) this position for terrific growth in 2015.
If I take a look at where we stand for the year with about two months left, we're confident in our ability to deliver at the
high end of the guidance we set for this year last December. As a reminder, we've stuck by our sales and earnings
outlook all year, steadily increasing the low end of our performance, our pro forma EPS guidance to reflect the strong
year-to-date performance. And we're doing it again this quarter, raising the low end of our 2014 EPS guidance by a
nickel to $5.50 to $5.55. That's up 11% to 12% year-over-year. Not bad at all.
So turning to 2015, and you'll hear more from Tom on this, we're going to continue to remain conservative on the
global economy. We haven't counted on much from the macro environment historically, and so far, that's been a good
call. We're confident in our continued outperformance, because, one, our portfolio is aligned to favorable trends like
energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety and security, urbanization, and customer productivity that continue to
trend positive. And, two, we have been conservative on costs.
We're in the process of completing our Annual Operating Plan and overall, we see prospects for another good year in
2015. As I mentioned already, we have a very healthy backlog and see positive order and win rates across the portfolio.
We are also expecting another year of margin expansion. We're going to continue executing on our key strategies for
growth, including penetration of high growth regions and sustaining our investments in high ROI CapEx and new
products and technologies while maintaining our cost discipline and ensuring we deliver the savings from restructuring
projects that we've funded over the last few years. Our strength of execution has Honeywell on the path to strong
earnings growth and another year of outperformance in 2015, remaining on track to the long-term targets we gave you
back in March.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.
Thomas A. Szlosek
Okay. Thanks, Dave, and good morning. On slide four, let me walk you through the financial results for the third
quarter. As you can see, some very strong numbers and every metric came in at or above the guidance we provided in
July. Sales of $10.1 billion were up 5% on a reported and organic basis, and the growth was pervasive throughout the
portfolio. We'll dive into some of the business specifics in a moment, but we're encouraged by the improvement in
organic sales growth as we progress throughout the year. Remember, it was 1% in the first quarter, 3% in the second
quarter, and now 5% in the third quarter.
On a regional basis, organic sales were up 5% in the U.S., 1% in Europe, 4% in China, and double digits in a number of
our other high growth regions. In Europe, we have experienced stable growth rates in the first three quarters of the year,
modest growth rates, which are very consistent with what we saw in 2012 and 2013. We are planning more of the same
for Europe in the fourth quarter and into 2015. As for China, the growth was impacted by our deliberate shift of Resins

& Chemicals exports to other parts of Southeast Asia, so excluding that, our China sales would've been up 7% in the
quarter. On a similar basis, we expect China to grow sales faster than GDP for the full year.
Segment profit growth and margin expansion were both strong in the quarter. Segment profit increased 9% while
segment margins expanded 70 basis points to 17.4%, which, by the way, is 20 basis points more than our guidance. We
had profit growth and margin expansion in each of our three SPGs, so again, a balanced contribution across the
portfolio. The businesses benefited from higher volume in the quarter, and productivity continues to be a key driver of
margin expansion. These elements more than offset inflation and our continued investments for growth in sales,
marketing and product development. Items below segment profit were mostly as anticipated, and so our net income
increased 14% normalized for tax. Not bad compared with a 5% sales increase. Also, we funded $21 million of
restructuring projects in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $120 million.
The third quarter tax rate came in at 24.6% versus 27.2% in 2013 and versus the 26.5% we planned. There are a
number of moving parts that sometimes make the tax rates vary quarter-by-quarter. However, we continue to expect a
tax rate of 26.5% for the full year, consistent with our initial planning. So, reported earnings per share of $1.47 in the
quarter, up 19% versus the prior year. Normalizing for tax, EPS would have been $1.43, up 14%, which is $0.01 above
the high end of the guidance we provided in July. Even with essentially flat share count, we once again achieved double
digit EPS, driven primarily by stronger sales and segment margins.
Finally, free cash flow of $1 billion in the quarter was 12% higher than 2013, despite an approximate 28% increase in
CapEx investment. Overall, another strong quarter, giving us confidence heading into the last three months of the year.
Moving to slide five, we're looking at Aerospace results, which, as you will recall, include Transportation Systems in
both years. Aerospace sales were flat in the quarter on a reported basis, reflecting the Friction Materials divestiture, but
were up 3% organically, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Organic sales growth accelerated in both
commercial Aero and Defense & Space, while Transportation Systems saw continued strong top line organic growth.
Aerospace margins expanded by 150 basis points, driven by productivity net of inflation where material productivity
continues to be a significant driver; also commercial excellence and the favorable impact of the Friction Materials
divestiture.
Starting with commercial OE, sales increased 5% with good growth in both Air Transport and Regional as well as
Business and General Aviation. In ATR, we saw the continued benefit of higher OE build rates while Business
Aviation saw increased engine shipments coming with certifications on the Bombardier Challenger 350 and Embraer
Legacy 500.
Commercial aircraft sales were up 2% in the quarter with strong spares growth in ATR. ATR had double digit spares
growth with increased mechanical and electrical demand across the major regions. We're expecting the ATR
aftermarket growth to be in line with flight hours in the fourth quarter, and would characterize current airline buying
activity as stable to modestly better.
The ATR spares growth was offset by anticipated lower repair and overhaul activity and a decline in BGA RMUs, that
is Retrofit, Modifications and Upgrades. You will recall that RMU sales growth has been on a tear for the last couple of
years, making the comparisons to prior periods challenging. We're still excited by this business and continue to invest
to develop new offerings.
Defense & Space sales returned to growth in the quarter, increasing 3%, and continue the improvement we've seen
throughout 2014. You might recall we were down 8% in the first quarter and 1% in the second quarter. So the trend, as
we predicted, is improving. International programs continue to drive growth with double digit sales increases, while our
U.S. DoD sales grew modestly, and Government Services declines continue to moderate on a year-over-year basis.
Transportation Systems sales declined 10% on a reported basis, again reflecting the Friction Materials divestiture, but
were up 4% organically. Once again, we saw strong turbo volume growth across our three largest regions; Europe,
North America, and China, and in each of these regions our volume growth outpaced auto production. 2/3 of the
volume growth was attributable to light vehicle gas applications where we continued to see increased global
penetration. We also saw our European commercial vehicle volume more than double in the quarter as we continue to

benefit from new programs following the implementation of Euro VI emission regulations in the region.
On slide six, we're looking at ACS results for the quarter. Sales were up 9% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic
basis, again at the high end of our guidance. The difference in the two rates principally reflects the contributions of
Intermec.
ESS sales, so the products businesses were up 6% organically, continuing the trend of progressively stronger growth
we have seen in each quarter in 2014. It's hard to single out one business in the ESS portfolio because the growth was
very broad, but Scanning & Mobility and Industrial Safety accelerated the most. ESS benefited from new product
introductions, higher U.S. residential sales which benefited both ECC and Security. U.S. non-residential improvement
in ECC Fire and Industrial Safety, and further penetration in high growth regions, particularly in China where ESS once
again had double digit sales growth in the quarter.
Building Solutions & Distribution or BSD sales were up 2% with continued strength in the Americas Fire and Security
Distribution businesses offset by flat sales in Building Solutions. We are encouraged, however, as Building Solutions
has seen an increase in North American Service and Energy Retrofit orders. Both the global solutions backlog and
service banks are up handsomely from the same point last year, supporting our outlook for sales acceleration in 2015.
In the non-residential sector, the trends are similar to the first half of the year. In the ESS products businesses that serve
non-residential, we've continued to see modest growth in commercial products throughout the third quarter. However,
we did see an acceleration in growth on the industrial side with strength in the Americas business particularly. We
anticipate further improvement in the fourth quarter and into 2015 on the commercial and industrial products side. As
for Building Solutions, I mentioned that the backlog and service banks are up year-over-year and we continue to expect
energy efficiency projects support global acceleration into next year.
ACS margins expanded 40 basis points to 15.9% in the quarter and were up 50 basis points excluding the minor
dilution from M&A. ACS continues to benefit from higher volume, commercial excellence and productivity net of
inflation, while also continuing to invest for future growth. One such investment area is connected home where we are
quite excited by the roadmap of future integrated offerings in Heating, Air Conditioning, Security and Lighting
Controls. Already we have more than a million Internet connected devices.
Moving to slide seven, Performance Materials and Technologies, PMT sales were $2.5 billion, up 7% organically and
were above the high end of our guidance, driven by stronger than expected results in both UOP and Process Solutions.
UOP sales increased 8% in the quarter driven by increased catalyst and gas processing sales reflecting continued strong
refining, petrochemical and gas markets. We continue to see strong orders trends in gas processing particularly at
Thomas Russell. At the end of the third quarter, UOP's backlog stood at $2.6 billion driven by strong customer
adoptions of new technologies and investments in new capacities.
In Process Solutions, we're encouraged by the accelerated growth of 5% driven by our Advanced Solutions Software
and Service businesses as well as higher sales in field products. High growth regions remain a huge priority for Process
Solutions and they delivered double digit sales growth in China, India and the Middle East. Orders growth also
continued at a strong pace continuing the second quarter trend and the HPS backlog is up nicely over the same point in
2013. As we will preview later on, we're expecting the sales improvement in the second half of this year to continue
into 2015 for HPS. Advanced Materials sales increased 7% in the quarter also continuing the trend we've seen
throughout 2014. We saw volume increases across the businesses with particular strength in Fluorine Products, which
was up double digits driven by new low global warming potential products.
Segment margins in PMT were up 20 basis points to 17.5%, consistent with our expectations driven by higher volume
and productivity net of inflation partially offset by price/raw headwinds in Resins & Chemicals and continued
investments for growth. HPS converted particularly well continuing its successful business transformation and
benefiting from the growth I mentioned in higher margin Advanced Solutions Software and Services. UOP continues
also to deliver outstanding profitability.
So, now I'm on slide eight with a preview of the fourth quarter. We're expecting sales of $10.3 billion to $10.4 billion
approximately flat reported or up 3% on an organic basis. And again, this assumes a euro rate of $1.25 for the quarter.

As a reminder, we're facing a tougher set of comps in the fourth quarter as organic sales were up 5% in the fourth
quarter of 2013 versus only 1% in the third quarter of 2013. Segment margins for the fourth quarter are expected to be
up approximately 120 basis points with pro forma earnings in the range of $1.37 per share to $1.42 per share, up 10%
to 15% versus the prior year. As a reminder, we're still planning a full year 2014 tax rate of 26.5%, so that implies the
fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 28.8%.
For Aerospace sales on a reported basis are expected to be down approximately 3% reflecting the year-over-year
absence of Friction Materials in the quarter. On an organic basis, sales are expected to be up approximately 2% and as a
reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2013 Aero recognized a significant IP litigation settlement resulting in a royalty gain
of $63 million in Defense & Space that was offset by OEM payments in BGA. Both of these items were included and
therefore netted out in sales and segment profit at the Aerospace level last year.
In the fourth quarter, commercial OE sales are expected to be up mid-teens on a reported basis and that's mid-single
digit excluding the year-over-year impact I mentioned from the higher BGA OEM payments. The growth is driven by
the favorable trend in demand for high-value business jet platforms where we have significant new engine content.
Commercial aftermarket sales are expected to be up low single digit in the quarter with an improvement in airline and
business jet repair and overhaul activity as evidenced by the increase we've seen in shop receipts. However, this
strength will be partially offset by more modest spares growth driven by declines in BGA RMU activity that I
mentioned earlier. Defense & Space sales are expected to be up slightly, excluding the impact of the royalty gain in the
fourth quarter of 2013 I discussed earlier. In Transportation Systems, we're expecting sales to be approximately flat on
an organic basis, primarily due to challenging comparison to prior year. You'll recall that in the fourth quarter of 2013,
TS was up 15%. We're expecting Transportation Systems to have good volume growth in the first quarter of 2015,
driven primarily by new launches entering the market. As for Aerospace margins, we expect an increase of
approximately 200 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by significant productivity improvements across the
portfolio and commercial excellence.
Continued focus on driving productivity and direct material costs and the benefits from functional transformation are
helping us support the growth investments we're making in the business as well as to drive the improvement in
profitability. For ACS, sales are expected to be up approximately 4% on an organic basis, excluding an approximate
2% headwind from FX. We expect both ESS and BSD to grow in the low single digit to mid-single digit range on an
organic basis, supported by the trends we're seeing in our short cycle order rates. This is also supported by continued
growth in our projects backlog and the service bank in Building Solutions that we mentioned earlier. ACS margins are
expected to be up approximately 60 basis points, with continued benefits from productivity net of inflation and
commercial excellence, while accelerating investments for growth in new product areas, such as connected home, and
in high growth regions.
In PMT, sales are expected to be up approximately 2% on an organic basis. The strong and improving growth rates we
have seen throughout the year across the PMT portfolio, including in the fourth quarter, are being temporarily offset by
the previously signaled decline in UOP sales for the fourth quarter in the range of 8% to 9%. And to remind you, we
had an exceptionally strong fourth quarter in 2013 for UOP where sales were up 17% organically. Needless to say, a
difficult comparison. On the other hand, a higher mix of licensing revenue in the fourth quarter will result in a tailwind
to UOP and PMT margins. In HPS, the favorable orders and backlog growth will support fourth quarter sales
acceleration, which will also carry into 2015. HPS margin expansion will also continue.
In Advanced Materials, we anticipate another quarter of broad sales growth. However, Resins & Chemicals will
continue to face lower margin rates, exacerbated by planned plant outages and price/raws pressures. Overall, PMT
margins in the quarter are expected to be up approximately 60 basis points versus 2013, driven by UOP and HPS.
Let me move to slide nine, where I'd like to refresh everyone on our full year outlook for 2014. As you know, we take a
conservative view on sales expectation. This approach continues to serve us well, because it forces us to also be
prudent on our cost structure. So sales grow better than our conservative expectations. We tend to do very well. And I
think 2014 demonstrates this. Our sales are coming in a little better than where we planned whereas we've raised our
EPS guidance three times during the year. As Dave indicated, we are taking EPS guidance up a third time, this time to a

range of $5.50 to $5.55, up 11% to 12% over 2013. So, another year of double digit earnings growth. This is our
planning model and we'll continue to follow it.
As you see on the page, we've tighten our sales range to $40.3 billion to $40.4 billion, up approximately 3% to 4%
versus the prior year. And as for segment margins, we're expecting the full year to be approximately 17%, or up 70
basis points over 2013. Again, this puts us at or above the high end of the sales and margin guidance we shared with
you last December. The full year outlook by individual segment is similar to what we shared in July, considering the
performance year-to-date, we continue to feel confident in the segment margins for each business. 19.5% for Aero,
15% for ACS, and 18% for PMT, strong performance across the portfolio with every business contributing to the 70
basis points of segment margin expansion.
While there's still work to do to ensure we deliver 2014, we have commenced our 2015 planning. On slide 10 and slide
11, I'll walk you through some of our key planning assumptions and initial thoughts by business. While it's still early,
slide 10 lays out some of our current views. From a macro perspective, we're not expecting much in terms of global
GDP growth, slightly north of 3%. As I said earlier, we continue to be conservative in our planning and 2015 is
consistent with that thinking. Our short cycle businesses represent about 55% of our sales, and we're expecting
continued growth from new products and technologies in the short cycle.
Examples include products derived from our Solstice molecules in PMT and our new platform launches in
Transportation Systems. Our growth in 2015 will also be supported by continued favorable end market trends, a modest
improvement in non-residential spending benefiting both the commercial and industrial businesses, and continued flight
hour growth. On the long cycle side of our business, which represents the remaining 45% of our sales, we have good
visibility into growth for 2015 based on, one, the strong order rates, two, our robust backlogs, and three, the capacity
from our new plants. We will benefit from the increased oil and gas investments globally, particularly in the
downstream markets where the build out continues with both UOP and Process Solutions well-positioned for growth.
Aero will also contribute to organic sales growth, based on our expectations of a ramp up, a new BGA OE platform and
the strong trend of international Defense wins.
In total, our long cycle orders and service banks are up single digits for the year, which will also drive higher sales in
2015. So from a total of Honeywell perspective, the strength in the U.S. dollar will likely be a minor headwind in 2015.
Our largest exposure to the euro is in Transportation Systems, where we have locked in for 2015 already. With that, to
give you a very rough sensitivity, if the euro were to go to, say, $1.10, we would expect approximately a $0.10 EPS
impact for the full year. Manageable exposure, and right now we're at $1.28, but we'll keep our eye on it.
Overall, the below-the-line items for 2015 remain stable. Even with the recent investment market slide and the
continued low interest rate environment, we are currently expecting pension income to be roughly neutral next year and
continue to not expect a significant required contribution to any of our plans for the foreseeable future. Finally, we
anticipate the continued benefits from our proactive restructuring activity to yield $125 million of incremental savings
in 2015.
I'm now on slide 11, which depicts our preliminary growth outlook by business, compared to the expected growth in
2014. The colored arrows denote whether we currently see the growth rates improving; improving, remaining steady,
so growth similar to 2014, or receding. Again, this assessment is based on our preliminary assessment of the key macro
inputs and variables, our current orders and backlog, and the things we're in control of from an execution perspective.
As you can see, there are a lot of green arrows, again, driven by our great positions in good industries, new product
introductions, high growth region expansion and confidence in our long cycle backlog.
In Aerospace, on the commercial side, ATR OE growth is expected to be similar to 2014 but with an improvement in
the second half of 2015 and into 2016. This is based on the build rate schedules and ramp up in Airbus A350 and other
new platforms. In BGA OE, we expect the continuation of growth to outpace the market with strong shipments of new
engines on new business jet platforms like the Bombardier Challenger 350 and Embraer Legacy 500. We are
well-positioned in the medium to large BGA segments, which are expected to grow the most in the next five years.
Dave also referenced earlier our excitement around the launch of the new Gulfstream 500 and Gulfstream 600 platform
with the first flight of the G500 scheduled in 2015 and shipments starting soon thereafter. We've been working with

Gulfstream for some time in developing these products, so we don't expect to incur significant R&D-related expenses
relative to these platforms that you normally might expect at the rollout of a new commercial platform.
These and other new platforms support the continued growth in our ATR and BGA installed base and service
businesses. Of course, the growth has to be profitable, so we also continue to focus on the cost side with planned cost
productivity in direct materials and functional spending along with process improvement which will further support
further margin expansion in Aerospace.
The commercial aftermarket sales vary based on the quantity of flight hours and maintenance events, inventory levels,
the customer buying and inventory pattern. We anticipate that sales will grow slightly better than they have in 2014
with an expected improvement in airline repair and overhaul activity and higher engine maintenance events in BGA.
Defense & Space is expecting a modest sales increase; call it low single digit, in 2015 based on the strength of the
international business, which represents about 25% of the portfolio. Our recent win rates support this outlook, and we
also expect the full sequester to remain in place, with the U.S. portion of the business stabilizing.
Finally, Transportation Systems is poised for continued growth in 2015, driven by significant new launches, modestly
better European light vehicle production and the acceleration of gasoline and turbo penetration particularly in the U.S.
and China.
For ACS, we're expecting similar growth in ESS to what we've seen throughout 2014. This growth will be led by new
product introductions, further penetration in high growth regions and continued non-res recovery. As a reminder,
roughly 75% of the ACS portfolio serves commercial and industrial markets where we tend to be tied more so to
retrofit activity than in new construction. So our portfolio is well-positioned to capitalize on improvements in these
areas.
On the commercial products side, we've seen modest sales improvement over the course of 2014 which we expect to
continue into 2015 with better growth in the U.S. driven by improvement in ECC and Fire Systems businesses.
In the industrial markets, we're expecting higher sales of Industrial Safety equipment particularly in the Americas,
which represent about half of our exposure. Residential growth will continue, particularly in the U.S. where we're
accelerating our investments in the connected home space. And in Building Solutions, which is a longer cycle business,
sales growth has been muted year-to-date, but we're encouraged by the improvement in project orders and services
backlog which will benefit in 2015.
In PMT, our robust orders growth and backlog position at both UOP and Process Solutions support growth
acceleration. PMT continues to benefit from oil and gas investments occurring around the world. You're probably
aware we're primarily focused on the midstream and downstream segments. These are less impacted in the near-term
than the upstream segments might be by any reduction in capital spending that could come from recent crude oil price
declines. In fact, most of our UOP and HPS backlogs will be executed over the next two years or three years and are for
projects where the bulk of our customers' capital has already been spent. The risk of cancellations is low and is already
reflected in our initial planning framework.
Lower oil prices also mean lower fuel prices at the pump, which drive more demand for refined products from
production. This also plays to the strength of our portfolio. Also, we're excited by the recent loosening of U.S.
restrictions on energy export and are well-positioned to win new business in related verticals like liquid natural gas.
And last, in Advanced Materials, we expect to continue to benefit from our Solstice products and higher production
volumes in Resins & Chemicals.
Given the balance of these various dynamics, we are encouraged by our prospects for 2015. We are in the middle of our
annual planning process and we look forward to providing you with more details regarding our 2015 guidance during
our outlook call on December 16. You can expect that we will count on only modest sales growth and we'll stay
conservative on costs so that we deliver earnings growth on a basis consistent with our five-year plan.
Let me wrap up on slide 12. The strong third quarter results came from every part of Honeywell. We have a solid and
diverse portfolio and management team focused on execution. Combined, these enabled us to add to our performance

track record as we exceeded our guidance on sales, margins and EPS. With one quarter left to go, we are confident in
our ability to continue outperforming despite the continued slow growth macro environment. We're going to continue
investing in our future with a focus on profitable sales growth. This means investing in high ROI CapEx, in new
product development and in sales and marketing resources particularly in high growth regions. The investments are
paying off. You can see it in the results.
As we turn our attention to 2015, we recognize the uncertainty in the macro environment, but this is not new for us. We
have and will continue to plan conservatively. Also, we're confident that our portfolio is well-positioned for continued
outperformance. Our order trends, both short cycle and long cycle, point to accelerated sales growth for next year that
should enable continued strong improvements in our profitability. And we will continue and execute to deliver 2014,
2015 and beyond.
So with that, Elena, let's go to Q&A.
Elena Doom
Thanks, Tom. Leo, we will now take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
Very good. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from
Scott Davis of Barclays.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hi.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Thanks for helping the market go up today. We needed it.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes, I agree.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hey. I've got to give you crap about something, Dave. You know I can't go a conference call
without criticizing you. But 16 slides and not a word on M&A or buybacks or any cash reinvestment. You've had a nice
pullback here. What's holding you back from buying back some shares?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, first of all, I don't think that we ever provided chat on, commenting on that, so that's not
unusual.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: No, I know.
<A - David M. Cote>: I guess 19%, 14%, depending upon how you want to look at it, doesn't suffice. So I understand.
But at the end of the day, our strategy is still the same. It's to stay opportunistic on both the M&A side and the share
repurchase side. And I think M&A conditions are starting to improve with the kind of pullback we've seen. So who
knows how things develop. I'm not promising anything. You never know where things are going to go. But at the end
of the day, times are getting better to buy, so we'll see what happens.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: But, Dave, what is the ideal size of transactions? I mean, in the past you've done some pretty – I
mean you've done some pretty interesting deals, and some of them a little bit big. I mean would you be willing to go a
little larger in size where there's some value now?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I've always said, I never say never on doing anything large, so we'll say, I don't know, $5
billion to $10 billion. But at the end of the day we've never done it either. Doesn't mean we won't, but I've never done
it. We still continue to maintain a very active pipeline of projects, from small stuff to big stuff, and we're going to keep

doing that. And who knows, maybe someday, something bigger strikes. In the meantime, we still keep looking at stuff
that's more bite-size, more manageable. And it's tough to predict where these things go. And as Anne Madden keeps
reminding us, you kiss 100 frogs to find I guess in my case the princess. So it's just one of those things that we're going
to keep looking at and keep working.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: And just lastly, non-res has been a bit of a mystery this year, but it looks like you made some
positive commentary there. I mean do you see projects as finally breaking ground where you've got some visibility that
we can make some shipments? This quarter was pretty good, actually.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes, I would say – so, you've been hearing me say now for over a year I think that we've been
seeing increased quote activity, but no results from it. We're finally starting to see some slight improvement in growth
rates from what we've seen in some of our other businesses. I'd like to think that, that portends a trend. I'm not ready to
declare that yet, but I do believe the time has come. And for me, part of this is just the aftermath of the recession. We
said at the time how you went in is likely how you're going to come out.
And it was stuff that went in quickly, like aircraft spares came out quickly; stuff that went in slowly, like non-res
construction has been slow to come out. And I think we're finally at that point where we're in the kind of slow to come
out range. I don't expect a boom, but I still think it's going to be a tailwind for us.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Good. Well, well done, guys. Thanks, and I'll pass it on.
<A - David M. Cote>: I'm sorry, Scott, what was that?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: He must've gone on to the other call already.
Operator
Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: So just on UOP, I think people are obviously a little bit worried about what's happened
with oil prices here. Could you maybe just get into specifics on what percentage of UOP specifically is kind of oil price
exposed, if you will? I mean I know maybe there's like some offshore projects that they may be involved in, FPSOs,
I'm not sure. Just want to get some further clarity on that. And I totally understand the positive long-term trends, but
UOP is obviously one that people worry about every day, so just maybe if you could give us a little bit color there.
<A - David M. Cote>: Steve, the last thing I'd ever expect from you is a bouquet, but not even a flower or a rose petal
or something? Maybe a little bit?
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Solid quarter, I guess.
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, thank you. I'll take what I can get. Overall...
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: You're doing okay. I never worry about you. You're doing fine.
<A - David M. Cote>: Here's how – I think a reasonable way to think about it is if we take a look at our overall sales,
so about 15% of it is represented by oil and gas in total. So it's not just UOP, but it includes Process. If you broke out
that 15 points, 12 points of it are in the midstream segment to downstream segment, so yes, there is some upstream, but
not a huge amount. And when we think about oil prices, Tom was talking about some of this; that pump prices tend to
be sticky in both directions. And when oil prices are going down, that's a good thing for refiners. So all of those
projects, especially if the money has already been spent, we really don't see it having that much of an impact over the
next two years or three years. Most of those projects are still going to get done.

We also think over the long-term, there's some natural floors here that exist, and there's been big increase in oil
production over the past year, something like 3% in total with a big chunk of it driven by the U.S. But there's an actual
floor that occurs at about $80, when you look at shale oil production, where a lot of capacity just goes offline, so it gets
that supply and demand much more in balance. So overall, I really don't see it having that much of an impact to UOP. It
might have some. There might be some projects that go a little bit sideways, but overall, very manageable is the way I
think about it.
Tom, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Oh, just – I mean there's discussion of cancellations and we've fairly assessed our backlog
and we're really not seeing anything of any significance. As Dave said, there's a natural floor, and maybe if you get
significantly below that, you might see more activity, so we're – the only impacts are minor delays in project financing
but it really haven't shown any impact on the backlog.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: And then, Dave, just one last question following up on Scott's question about buybacks,
when you think about kind of the reticence to buy stock back at this stage, given the prior experience, just worried
about buying closer to peak. I mean, how do we think about that in terms of your relative evaluation and the relative
attractiveness of your stock? Because I mean it doesn't seem like the stock is holding up as well as it should in these
pullbacks, and so as the mindset change – if they're not giving, even though we're at kind of a tough economic time if
people aren't giving you the relative credit as the mindset change?
<A - David M. Cote>: No, not really. I would say going back to what I said before is we're going to stay opportunistic.
We have a lot of faith in our ability to continue growing. And I think we've certainly demonstrated that again this
quarter, and when it comes to both repurchases and M&A, we're going to stay opportunistic, and having money gives
you opportunities. Once the money is gone, the opportunities aren't there anymore. So we're going to continue to drive
really strong earnings growth, especially versus our peers, with or without a buyback; and it's always an opportunity for
us.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Great. Thanks.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good morning
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: It sounds like buybacks are a hot topic this morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Is that?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: So I won't go there. But I do want to touch to the 2015 framework, if you like, and thanks for the
detail. It's really helpful. And I guess the top line, it will be to [ph] our extent (46:38) by the macro, but [indiscernible]
(46:41) think about your margin expansion and what you can control. And obviously, this year's very strong with a
fairly weakish top line year-to-date, but next year, based on the restructuring pipeline, do you think you can be in line
with the 70 bps long-term framework? Or do you think you can do better than that? How should we think about the
OEM next year?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, first of all, same thing, not even a rose petal?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Not a – Dave, great quarter.
<A - David M. Cote>: Not even a splash of toilet water or something?

<Q - Nigel Coe>: I'm splashing away here.
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, first of all, it's too early for us to declare. We're in the middle of the planning cycle and
we just don't do that. So in December is when we talk about it. But overall, I think you can expect something that's
consistent with our five-year plan. Because as you recall, in the five-year plan, we're pretty conservative on what we
expected over five years from the global economy. Unfortunate – well I guess fortunately and unfortunately, the
fortune side is we plan for it that way, so we're prepared. The unfortunate part is it's turning out that way. We kind of
hope that there might be a nice surprise at some point, so we'll talk a lot more about it in December on Tom's call. What
date is that, Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: December 16.
<A - David M. Cote>: December 16, and we'll talk about it more then but you can expect something that is consistent
with our five-year plan, where you'll look at it and go, oh, they're still on track.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. No, understood. Thanks, Dave. And then one of the real hallmarks of Honeywell over the past
decade has been growing top line but keeping fixed costs flat or in some cases down. This year SG&A has been
growing quite a bit ahead of sales and I'm wondering – there's obviously a lot of moving parts in SG&A and COGS but
how much of that increase in SG&A is growth driven? And I'm thinking here about initiatives like [ph] QE (48:37).
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, quite honestly I don't really look at the SG&A line all that much. So I should describe it
more as how I do look at it. On the sales side, we have been adding feet-on-the-street when you look at high growth
regions and that's one of the reasons that you're seeing such good performance there because if you have great products
and services and one guy covering a country you're just not going to sell as much. You got to have somebody who can
be out there and can represent.
I do know on the G&A side, that's going down because a lot of that is a part of functional transformations. So you think
about legal, finance, IT, HR, all that stuff is going down consistent with functional transformation. So all the stuff that
we've talked about is continuing to happen and I suppose we can get a better SG&A answer for you if...
<A - Elena Doom>: Happy to help out with that.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And just a quick one for Tom, perhaps. The hedge on TS for next year – I
believe that's a new – I don't think you've hedged in the past so number one is that new? And second, is there anything
we need to think about in terms of hedge accounting and sensitivity to certain rates?
<A - David M. Cote>: You are correct. It is new and I'll turn it over to Tom to discuss further.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes, it's at or around the current rates now, Nigel, is essentially the way to think of it. So if
you think of the current exchange rates for TS, it essentially locks us into [indiscernible] (50:14).
<Q - Nigel Coe>: But there's no mark-to-market impact?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No. It's pure hedge accounting. The mark on the hedge goes through a similar translation or
goes below the line outside of operating profit and certain offsets.
<A - David M. Cote>: Because at the end of the day, the change in the thought process has been – historically I've
been pretty adamant about never hedging on translation just because I think over the course of 20 years you're basically
out the cost of hedging. This year, I'd say while there's always the possibility it could go the other way because these
things are unpredictable the prospect of it going to $1.10, $1.20 I think is very real. And we looked at it and said it's
better to say protect ourselves on half or so of our exposure and forgo a bit of that upside just to protect ourselves on
the downside in what could be a tougher macro again. And that was the thought process behind it and we were able to
do it with a very good understanding of what the impact was month by month so we were able to avoid having to use
that mark-to-market approach.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Great. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Steven Winoker of Bernstein Research.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. And, Dave, I'm going to save you the pain of soliciting another
compliment and just say good quarter to all the guys inside the SPGs, okay? And leave it there.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thank you, Steve. As you've probably noticed, I'm a very needy person.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: I do, and as long as that makes you keep delivering, I have no problem with that.
<A - David M. Cote>: It helps. It helps.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: So a few questions here. I guess, one, I hate to keep coming back to the capital deployment
but I also remember you often talking about, telling investors now that we've gone through the turnaround some years
ago what are we going to do with the cash? Don't worry, we're not going to blow the cash. To the extent that you are
ramping up M&A and Roger's out there looking pretty aggressively I'm sure as well, what are kind of the minimum
financial hurdles we should still think about for kind of mid-sized deals to large sized deals that you're thinking about
in terms of returning capital or otherwise, the stuff that Anne would actually let pass through for example?
<A - David M. Cote>: Our hurdles are not going to change and they're the same ones that we've used for 13 years. And
that's accretive in the second year, IRR clearly above the cost of capital so think of it as an 11%, 12% range and ROI
above 10% in the fifth year. And that's all in, so that includes all the amortization and everything else, so it's a more
difficult hurdle than people might think.
And at the end of the day, regardless of the size we'll be able to demonstrate 6% to 8% of sales as cost synergy because
I don't want to count on any sales synergies, as you know, and I want to make sure that we stay disciplined as hell in
terms of our deployment, so we're never going to panic. The nice thing about it is we have a terrific organic growth
prospect, so it's not like I have to do M&A in order to deliver, and that's why we construct our five-year plan the way
we do, so that you would look at it and go, geez, these numbers are awfully good whether they do M&A or not. So I
never want to feel panicked, and we don't.
So you can expect that whatever we do, whatever we do end up going, whether it's a bunch of small stuff, something
big, various big things, depending on how you want to classify it, it's all going to meet those criteria.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Okay. And, Tom, a little bit on how you're starting to think about pension. I'm sure you'll go
into more detail in December, but given rates, direction, and all of that, how should we think about sensitivities in the
current accounting structure?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes, it's a good question, Steve. If you drew the line today for pension expense, given the
most recent market developments and the low interest rate environment, we'd be about flat year-over-year for pension
expense effects. And as I said, right now, no foreseeable contributions from cash perspective in the next couple of
years. Mark-to-market wise for 2014, because you know if there is one, we would do it in the fourth quarter. Right
now, again, based on the assumptions as we understand them today, at least for our major plans, the U.S. plan, there
would not be a mark-to-market.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in, which is, in UOP, those CapEx investments, how
do you see that continuing to play out through the next year?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I think, well, I mean, in terms of the quantity of the CapEx, we peak in 2015 in terms of the
expenditure level. But as you know, starting in the second half of this year, we've got some of that capacity coming
online, this year mostly for the Solstice product portfolio and a little bit in the UOP catalysts. But those plants, as we've
said over and over again, pretty much hit the ground running at near full capacity. And so when you look at the growth

Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Good morning. I've been brushing up on my accent, Dave. I think it was a pretty good
quarter.
<A - David M. Cote>: I think it was wicked good myself.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Hey, just a couple little cleanup things. On UOP, can you give us a sense, just following up
on that last comment from Tom, what type of top line benefit do you foresee in next year as those plants come on? I
guess kind of the question is the cumulative revenue weight of that capacity as it turns on.
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say, Jeff, still a little too early to declare on any of that. We'll do more of that in
December. I'd say you can expect that UOP's going to continue to do well.
<A - Elena Doom>: And it's a big driver for the incremental growth in UOP versus the growth rate we are seeing in
2014.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: And then on international Defense, where you're seeing some acceleration it sounds like,
can you give a little color on countries or programs where that's actually happening?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes. In Middle East, Israel, Turkey, some of the regions that you might expect that have
the funding and where there's activity. A little bit in India as well.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: And this one might be a little bit in the weeds, but kind of getting into fluorines and the
like, with this [indiscernible] (57:35) transition coming in the U.S. here in the fourth quarter – well, really, at the
beginning of the year – do you see any noise in the fourth quarter around that? Do you see signs that people are
pre-building, just anything to be aware of there?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No, I think, we're really excited about fluorine overall and the transition that we've got
going, but nothing significant from that perspective.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: Yes, and then just a quick one and I'll jump off. Tom, you did end your remarks by saying
accelerated organic growth in 2015. Obviously you have also hedged the macro and everything, but are you suggesting
you do have line of sight, at least, of being inside that 4% to 6% kind of organic growth goal which is kind of the
compound goal after 2018?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes, I think Dave is telling me not to share anything until December 16, which – I'm going
to follow my boss' orders.
<Q - Jeffrey T. Sprague>: All right. Sounds good. Thanks, guys, and Elena.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: See you, Jeff.

Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hi. Yes. Hi. How are you guys? Just to clarify on Advanced Materials, so why is it not growing
faster in 2015 versus 2014 given that this is where the CapEx is going and Solstice is ramping up? Sorry, and
congratulations, by the way.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thank you. I thought I was going to have to beg again.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: No.
<A - Elena Doom>: So, yes, we are seeing good growth in Advanced Materials, Andrew. I mean, in the quarter,
Advanced Materials grew 7% organically.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes.
<A - Elena Doom>: And I think what we're saying is at this point, the continuation of that type of mid-single digit
growth rate is what we're expecting for next year given it's still early days.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes. Just a reminder on how to read that chart, the side arrows mean the growth rates
themselves for 2015 compared to the growth rates for 2014. So, as Elena points out, we've seen really decent growth,
especially in the second half in the Advanced Materials portfolio, including in Fluorine or led by Fluorine. So we're
expecting that trend to continue in 2015. So I think it's a good story.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Got you.
<A - David M. Cote>: Besides the arrows, if we had a whole page of green arrows, you'd be asking how could we
possibly believe the environment could be that good.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: I appreciate that. And just a comment on BSD, you sort of commented that you're seeing non-res
accelerating. Could you just give more color on what specifically you're seeing, what areas, because it would be a
really good news if we are seeing non-res cycle pick up.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes, I think it's been moderate. I mean, I don't want to overplay the pickup on the
commercial piece of the non-res, but we are seeing a significant amount of quotation activity in the U.S. and
particularly on the federal side of the energy vertical. The municipalities and other institutions are also coming along,
but overall, the orders are starting to pick up. We're expecting good orders story or performance in the fourth quarter
that should serve us well in 2015.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Terrific. Thank you.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks, Andrew.

Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Good morning. Thank you very much.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Howard. I thank you.

<A - David M. Cote>: Only if it's deserved.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: No. Right. You know that. But to talk about a couple of business fundamentals, talk about
what you've done to make Intermec work right. It looks like it had a very nice top line contribution. The U.S. Postal
Service piece of business looks like its market share pick up, and when I walk into Starbucks, I see a Honeywell logo.
So what's gone there that's set you apart, because this is a difficult market.
<A - David M. Cote>: I've got to say, I appreciate you picking up on that one, because we're quite proud of everything
we've done there, not just with Intermec, but by really pulling together several players in the industry and creating a
one Honeywell approach that's really made a difference. They all brought different technologies and perspectives,
whether it was Hand Held, Metrologic or Intermec, and I think our guys, starting with Gary as the leader originally and
then John Waldron is in there now. They've done a great job pulling all that together and rationalizing it so that we
expanded on our offering; push the technology more so than others have including what we've been able to do with
voice or Vocollect coming out of the Intermec acquisition.
And getting better coverage, just being out there and being able to tell our story with feet-on-the-street in a way that we
weren't able to, before. So it's really just a matter of running it better and taking advantage of the technologies that were
brought together and running it better.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: So when we look at the Intermec numbers year-on-year, they're up. It's hard to totally tell,
but it looks like high single digits. So that sort of, I mean I know that's only one part of everything you're doing there.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes, that's right, Howard. And I think we're getting, as Dave said, the technologies are very
strong and they're complementary to what exist in the Scanning & Mobility business. We didn't have printing, we didn't
have voice. We did have mobile computers but Intermec had a very strong platform. And so we've been able to
integrate all three of those product lines nicely and to accelerate the growth there. And as you alluded to the
performance against what our expectations were has been tremendous. And we look at the multiple – the headline
multiple versus where we are today, it's quite remarkable.
<A - David M. Cote>: It's also – good, Howard, you know that we never count on sales synergies which always
provides a nice upside and we've gotten a pile of them here.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you. And then one just final question, sort of, I'm not sure I'm going to ask it right but
as you look at new products that you're introducing with the R&D spend because in each of the business units you've
talked about there being I'll call it growth investments. How are you sort of measuring the premium you're getting on
the new products relative to the spend you're making? How fast do you decide that, gee, this is working really well, let's
put more in or no it's not working very well and let's scale it back?
<A - David M. Cote>: That's something we defer to each of the businesses to make those kinds of decisions and each
of them has their kiss or kill approach to all these projects. And some of it's by country, some of it's by business, so
they're constantly looking at making sure that we get the biggest bang for the R&D buck. And I'd say it's one of the
things that I would look at and say across the company we still have opportunity for. Sometimes we'll have a project
that we look at and go, geez; this is going to cause sales to grow 8%. That's great. Let's do it. But we really don't push
ourselves because it might be a business that could be growing 20%. We're just not thinking big enough for it.
On the other side, there's still projects that we linger with too long or we focus on little stuff when we should be
conglomerating some of that and focusing on something bigger. So I'd say we do a good job overall. Certainly a hell of
a lot better than we used to but I still see more upside to being more disciplined than that in every business.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you for your help today.
<A - David M. Cote>: We hope we'll see what 4 o'clock shows.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you, Dave.

Our final question comes from John Inch of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thank you. Last, but not least.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Hey, guys. So, congrats, Dave.
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, thank you.
<Q - John G. Inch>: You're welcome. So, Tom, you gave us the 2015 I think you said restructuring tailwinds of $125
million. Just to make sure we have the framework, could you tell us what – or remind us what you're spending
expectations are for 2014 and then savings that would've been from 2013 and 2014 and then what you expect to spend
in 2015 that dovetails with the $125 million?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes, I believe the actual savings from 2013 and 2014 is similar – it's in that $125 million,
$150 million range...
<A - Elena Doom>: Yes. Yes.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: ...for 2015. In terms of the cash spend, I think for 2014 it'd be about $200 million.
<A - Elena Doom>: We had an elevated first quarter restructuring charge obviously with the sale of the [ph] B/E Aero
(67:00) shares. But it's probably maybe for just the repositioning portion only it's probably more like in the $140
million, $150 million range...
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes.
<A - Elena Doom>: ...in terms of spend.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Right.
<A - Elena Doom>: Tom, you want to comment on next year?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Thank you. Yes, I think next year I would expect – our unspent backlog as of the end of the
third quarter is about $350 million – a little less than that. And I would expect that we would spend $150 million to
$200 million of that in 2015.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yes. That's where I was going with the B/E Aerospace share gains. [ph] Is this OL sequel (67:35)
– are we going to see some sort of a spending tailwind if you will or absence of spending that could be actually material
or impactful or perhaps you're thinking about some other offset, because you guys are pretty good at doing some
matching opportunistically.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes, so, John, I thought you were asking about the cash before.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Well, I was kind of thinking about both, yes.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Okay. So, right now as I said our P&L expense of restructuring is about $120 million this
year...
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yes.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: ...and we spent the cash that we had indicated. Next, we're always looking at opportunities.
Every quarter we review with Dave – every business reviews a portfolio restructuring opportunities just like we do for
M&A opportunities. We look at them in a disciplined way. We look at the paybacks, we look at the ROIs and so forth.
And, yes, it's true that we tend to look for opportunities to fund those restructurings, and, yes, it's also true we have
some potential funding capacity as we look out, but I don't think we've come to any conclusions at this point on what

we're going to do in 2015. We'll take it opportunistically as we go through the year like we normally do.
<Q - John G. Inch>: No, that's fair. And then can I just follow-up, you guys are a very large Aerospace company, and
your commentary around Aerospace and aftermarket is still pretty constructive, kind of heading into next year. You do
have this sort of Ebola thing that's kind of in the background, and I'm trying to understand, would the analogy be
perhaps to what happened during SARS and the possible impact on flight hours? I'm just trying to understand that at
this juncture how are you thinking about the planning process for the business next year as it pertains to flight hours,
perhaps based on past experience? Or should we just really not be concerned about this?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, as usual, you can expect us to plan for some of the worst, just so that we know what our
downside is. I don't think that's what's going to happen here, though, just based upon what you read about Ebola. In
terms of its actual impact on the U.S., in terms of how many people actually get ill, at least from the best I've been able
to glean, we don't expect much of an impact there. The thing you can't predict is what that fear quotient is going to do.
And as people just start to become afraid and as the media has something new to talk about, tough to predict where that
will go.
So, I would think overall I don't expect the actual impact in terms of illness to be consistent with what we saw with
SARS. You still need to start to factor in what that fear quotient could do. And that we're not really going to know,
except over the next two months or three months, I'd say, and we're going to plan, make sure that we have a plan to
address it in the most conservative way possible, just so we're prepared.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. Well, thanks very much. Appreciate it.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.
<A - Elena Doom>: All right. We're going to hand the call back over to Dave Cote for some closing remarks.
David M. Cote
Over the last few years, we have to say that global macro economy really hasn't provided much help, and we expect it's
going to continue that way, as we outlined in our five-year plan back in March. As Tom and I both mentioned,
conservative sales planning has clearly been the way to go, and we're going to continue with that approach. It's
probably obvious by now that we're pleased with our outperformance this quarter and this year, and for that matter,
over the last few years. And we intend to continue outperforming consistent with our five-year plan. Within the slow
global economy, we will get all the sales we can because of our great positions in good industries, our high growth
region presence and focus and new products.
With that sales growth, we'll continue to drive cost and process discipline through our focus on HOS goals. So said
more simply, we intend to continue outperforming. So thanks for listening, and of course, thank you to all our owners. I
promise we won't disappoint you. Thanks.
