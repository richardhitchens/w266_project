MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, my name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the Starbucks Coffee Company's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Ms. DeGrande, you may begin your call.
JoAnn DeGrande
Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. This is JoAnn DeGrande, Vice President of Investor Relations for Starbucks Coffee
Company. Joining me on the call today is Howard Schultz, Chairman, President and CEO; Cliff Burrows, President of
our US and Americas business; and Troy Alstead our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us here today for Q&A are
John, Michelle and Jeff, the presidents of the other three business segments.
This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that

This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will also be available on our website.
This is the first quarter we're including results from the recently acquired Teavana business in our financial results, and
you'll find them in the P&L for All Other Segments. We've also removed unallocated corporate expenses from Other.
Full year results for fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2012 for All Other Segments as well as our corporate unallocated
expenses can be found on our website.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?
Howard S. Schultz
Thank you, JoAnn, and good afternoon to everyone on today's call. I am very pleased to report the record Q2 results
that Starbucks announced today. Global comp store sales growth of 6%, marking the 13th consecutive quarter of comp
growth greater than 5%; comp growth of 7% in the US; total revenue growth of 11% to a Q2 record of $3.6 billion; 180
basis point increase in operating margin to a Q2 record of 15.3%; and record Q2 EPS of $0.51, which after excluding a
$0.03 gain on the sale of the company's minority equity stake in the JV that operates our stores in Mexico represents a
20% increase over last year's record Q2 results.
Starbucks is continuing to deliver strong, consistent performance in the face of still challenged retail and consumer
environments in many of the markets around the world in which we operate. While I'm very pleased with the record
results we have been reporting and the value that we have been creating for our shareholders over the last several years,
as I've mentioned at our annual meetings of shareholders last month, we remain laser focused on our aspiration to
become one of the world's most admired, respected and enduring brands. I'm honored that the progress we're making on
this journey has been recognized by Ethisphere Magazine, who for the seventh straight year named Starbucks as one of
the world's most ethical companies, and Fortune magazine who recently ranked us as the fifth most admired company
in the world.
Neither this humbling and inspiring recognition nor our Q2 results would have been possible without the hard work and
dedication of our 200,000 Starbucks partners who donned a green apron every day and delivered the unique Starbucks
experience 70 million times from almost 19,000 stores in 62 countries around the world each week. From Starbucks'
leadership team to each one our partners we say thank you.
In a few minutes Cliff Burrows, President of our Americas segment will discuss Americas' Q2 results in detail and
provide a glimpse of what's ahead. Under Cliff's leadership Starbucks U.S. business today is as healthy as it ever has
been. We continue to introduce new, innovative ways to excite our customers around all things coffee, and clearly
anyone suggesting in 2008 or 2009 that Starbucks' U.S. retail store portfolio was approaching market saturation was
just flat out wrong. In fact, stores we have opened the last few years are among the best performing stores in the
42-year history of the company in terms of all key metrics, including unit economics, return on investment, profitability
and the qualitative aspects of how well we deliver the Starbucks experience to our customers. This performance is due
to a new discipline and rigor we have brought to all aspects of store development that is both underpinning and driving
our U.S. retail expansion. We plan to add approximately 3,000 new stores in the Americas over the next five years with
at least 1,500 being in the U.S. and are now on track to open over 300 new stores and to renovate 1,400 stores in the
U.S. this year alone.
Our China / Asia-Pacific region continues to be at the forefront of Starbucks' global expansion efforts, and we are on
course to have 4,000 stores in the region by the end of 2013, including more than 1,000 stores in Mainland China and
more than 500 stores in South Korea. We will establish China as Starbucks' single largest market outside of the U.S. in
2014 and have more than 1,500 stores by 2015. We are building and deepening our connection to customers in China
by continuing to deliver locally relevant innovation including Chestnut Macchiato and Peach Blossom Tea Latte, two
customer favorite seasonal beverages evocative of the flavors of the Chinese New Year season, and actively building

My Starbucks Rewards membership. We have now sold over 2 million My Starbucks Reward cards in China,
representing an average of 2,000 members per store and the highest per store average anywhere across our global retail
system, with sales on cards now representing 35% of total tender. This is a powerful endorsement of the emotional
attachment and engagement we now have with Chinese customers in relationship to the Starbucks brand.
A few weeks ago, John Culver, President of the China / Asia-Pacific segment, and I traveled to Indonesia and the
Philippines, key growth markets as well as being the sources of some of Starbucks' best tasting and best-selling coffees.
John and I observed firsthand how powerfully the Starbucks culture and the Starbucks brand coupled with new store
designs are resonating with our partners and customers. We now plan to open 100 new stores in Indonesia in the next
three years and another 100 stores in the Philippines over the next four. And next month John and I will be in Tokyo to
celebrate the opening of our 1,000th store in Japan, an historic achievement for the first Starbucks market that opened
outside of North America and personally a rich reminder to me of how far we've come since I attended the opening of
the first store in the Ginza district back in August of 1996.
In Q2 we also opened our first store in Vietnam to record crowds, another dynamic market with a rich cultural heritage
and coffee tradition. Our flagship Ho Chi Minh City store will be followed by stores in Hanoi and other key
metropolitan cities across Vietnam in the future.
Michelle Gass and her team are in the early stages of a transformative new economic business model for Europe that
will further move us toward long-term profitability. We are actively continuing to expand our new U.K. franchise
program with a number of experienced and well capitalized regional and national franchise operators as well as
growing our captive licensed store footprint into important customer segments such as rail stations, airports,
universities and hospitals. We're also making considerable headway in the growth of our Drive-Thru operations, adding
our first Drive-Thru store in Germany and adding to our Drive-Thru portfolio throughout the U.K. These and other
strategic moves, together with a robust set of brand initiatives, will provide competitive differentiation and make
Starbucks more relevant to Europe's diverse consumer base.
Starbucks' performance across our joint venture and licensed markets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East continued
to be extremely strong, with growing customer response in markets such as Turkey, Hungary, Russia and across our
Middle East portfolio thanks in good measure to our partnership with the Alshaya group that started with a single store
in Kuwait City in 1999 and now comprises over 500 Starbucks stores throughout the Middle East.
Our Q2 results give me confidence that the strategies we have in place across Europe and the Middle East combined
with an intense focus on execution and elevating our customer experience will enable us to make solid, continuous
progress in the EMEA region over time as we continue to leverage all of the learnings from the U.S. transformation.
Last quarter Jeff Hansberry, President of our Channel Development and Emerging Brands segment detailed the
extraordinary multi-billion dollar opportunity that exists for Starbucks in channels outside of our stores. Today
Starbucks has over 100,000 points of distribution across grocery, drug, mass and club locations around the world and
sales topping $1 billion, with nearly 25% of the $3.4 billion U.S. premium coffee market, making us the number one
premium packaged coffee brand in America. From this strong position, Starbucks' channel development opportunity
remains in its infancy. Premium single cup, currently an $8 billion category, is the fastest-growing segment in the
coffee industry, now accounting for 27% of total coffee sales in grocery. And premium single cup is a segment
Starbucks intends to lead with a solid product lineup that includes Starbucks VIA, Starbucks K-Cup Portion packs and
now Verismo.
We continue to build Verismo's installed base to generate incremental pod sales with a successful promotion on cable
home shopping channel QVC in March. In Q3 we will gear up for a robust fall and holiday by further extending
Verismo distribution to include additional specialty retailers and expand the Verismo portfolio to include both machine
and pod innovations, including tea. All of which will culminate in our stores what we anticipate to be a very strong
Christmas holiday shopping season. Starbucks K-Cup portion pack sales in U.S. food, drug and mass channels
outpaced the industry at large, increasing more than 75% versus the prior year, and maintained a leading share in a
premium single cup category. Just last week Starbucks K-Cups were named one of the top product launches of the year
by IRI's Pacesetters. I'm pleased to report that we have now shipped over 850 million Starbucks and Tazo cups since

launch.
Q2 marked our first quarter since completion of the Teavana acquisition, an important move into the $40 billion global
tea category. The tea category we believe is ripe for innovation, and we now intend to do for tea what we have done for
coffee. Beyond representing a very exciting retail store platform with strong unit economics, Teavana enables us to add
super premium estate teas to our tea lineup and introduce and leverage a multi-brand tea strategy to complement our
existing $1 billion plus Tazo Tea business.
In Q2 we opened eight Teavana stores and have plans to add additional mall stores in fiscal 2013 and to add a complete
line of handcrafted beverages to the Teavana menu over time. We also expanded Starbucks' loyalty program to include
Teavana purchases, giving Starbucks customers the convenience and benefit of using their Starbucks Card and mobile
app to pay for purchases in Teavana retail stores. To further leverage the best capabilities of Starbucks retail, including
real estate design and store operations, I've asked Cliff Burrows to lead the Teavana Retail business as part of our U.S.
and Americas business with Andy Mack, Teavana's founder, reporting to Cliff.
Our Evolution Fresh premium cold pressed juice platform continues to grow nicely and is now in more than 4,000
Starbucks stores and other retail locations including 300 Starbucks stores in the New York and Boston markets. We
continue to see healthy sales lift in juice as customers increasingly make Evolution Fresh fruit and vegetable juices a
part of their daily ritual. And we are working hard to increase production capacity to meet the growing consumer
demand, and our plan to have Evolution Fresh juices available in approximately 8,000 U.S. locations by the end of
2013.
It's now been more than two years since we unveiled and began to execute against our unique blueprint for profitable
growth strategy in the U.S., and the time is now right to begin taking our tested and vetted blueprint on the road to
China. Our success at retail in China is providing us with confidence to both continue building our retail store portfolio
and to leverage our brand, growing retail store footprint and deepening connection to Chinese consumers into a future
overall business that will also include Starbucks products and categories marketed through CPG channels to the rapidly
growing Chinese middle class. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting initiative in the quarters ahead.
I want to turn now to mobile payment, loyalty and social digital media. As I have shared with you before, we are
witnessing a seismic change in consumer behavior due to the emergence of social and digital platforms and the
significance and ubiquity of mobile as a consumer platform. And Starbucks remains on the very leading edge of all of
these developments. In Q2 we introduced new innovations and initiatives that further demonstrates Starbucks'
leadership in consumer card, loyalty and mobile payment experiences, as more and more of our customers choose the
Starbucks card as their preferred method of payment.
Consider the following statistics. Today nearly one-quarter of all U.S. transactions are made by My Starbucks Rewards
loyalty members and nearly one-third of all U.S. in-store transactions are prepaid. Our mobile apps now have more
than 10 million active customers, and we are approaching 4 million U.S. mobile payment transactions per week
accounting for roughly 10% of total U.S. tender. To put this in perspective, Starbucks Card tender now exceeds $3
billion annually in the U.S. and Canada, a scale that rivals many premier U.S. banks. In Q2 we significantly accelerated
My Starbucks Rewards membership by offering a $5 credit for U.S. Starbucks Card holders who became a program
member resulting in nearly one million new registered members and nearly 500,000 mobile app downloads during the
two-week offer period alone.
Through this and other initiatives we are adding approximately 80,000 new My Starbucks Rewards customers each
week and expect to double the number of active members enrolled in Starbucks Rewards program from 4.5 million at
the end of fiscal 2012 to 9 million in 2013. Even more encouraging is that accelerating adoption is not just a U.S.
phenomenon. We are now seeing usage of My Starbucks Rewards at the same or even higher rate than the U.S. in
countries like China, Korea and Canada, providing us with a significant sustainable competitive advantage over
competitors in these markets.
And beginning in May, we will unveil the market's first cross brand, cross channel rewards program, a capability only
made possible by the unique combination of Starbucks' national retail store footprint, broad consumer packaged goods

presence and industry-leading digital capabilities. Our customers will be able earn My Starbucks Rewards stars for
purchases of Starbucks packaged coffee in grocery channels. The stars can then be redeemed for free food or beverages
in Starbucks retail stores, an exciting new example of our blueprint for profitable growth being brought to life.
It's very hard, I think, to actually explain this in the kind of detail or the attachment that we think this is going to do.
And this gives us a significant competitive advantage over other like coffee products that are sold in grocery, and we're
going to see incrementality as a result of that in our own retail stores.
The revenue and operating leverage provided by the scale and synergies among our digital, card, loyalty, mobile and
social platforms provides us with strong core muscle in our U.S. business and increasingly in multiple channels and
markets across the globe. And as Adam Brotman, Starbucks' Chief Digital Officer and I, like to tell the digital team, we
are just getting started, literally in the nascent stage.
Today Starbucks' ability to touch people in and beyond our stores is greater than any time in our history and is a reality
that gives me great confidence that we can attain the high aspiration of becoming one of the world's most respected,
admired and enduring companies. We are very fortunate to have added [ph] Mike Conway (18:30), our new Executive
Vice President for Channel Development as well as Sharon Rothstein and Matthew Ryan as Chief Marketing Officer
and Chief Strategy Officer respectively to help us achieve these ambitious goals joining an already experienced and
talented leadership team. I'd like to personally take this opportunity to publicly welcome [ph] Mike (18:49) Sharon and
Matt to Starbucks.
I am convinced that the next two to three years for Starbucks will be among the most dynamic and exciting periods in
the history of our company. The results we announced today demonstrate that Starbucks coffee company has the
strength, the health and the talent to continue profitably building our business in multiple channels around the world at
the same time as we continue delivering value to our shareholders.
I'll now turn the call over to Cliff who will take you through the Q2 results of the Americas segment.
Clifford Burrows
Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon everyone. I'm very pleased to join you today to discuss the strong second
quarter results of our Americas business and to share with you several of the exciting initiatives we have ahead of us.
Americas' revenue grew by 10% in the second quarter to $2.6 billion fueled by 6% same-store sales growth with 5%
coming off increased transactions and 2% from a higher average ticket. In the U.S., comp sales grew by a very healthy
7%. A number of drivers were behind this. We had great success with our featured beverages, including Vanilla Spice
Latte and Hazelnut Macchiato, which combined nearly 2% of comp growth in the quarter. Food sales also lifted our
comp with strong growth in the afternoon from offerings – from food offerings aided by expanded panini availability
and strong Bistro Box performance.
On our first quarter call we talked about the strength of Starbucks Card sales during the holiday and how that gave us
great confidence in our ability to deliver a strong Q2. That absolutely played out this quarter and what is particularly
encouraging is we're seeing lift in both our afternoon day-part and in our higher-priced indulgent beverages by card
users. There are a significant number of new customers and new occasions being introduced via Starbucks Card leading
to new daily routines and greater loyalty, all which bodes well for our future growth.
While Americas' segment revenue grew 10%, operating income grew 22% to $550 million. We delivered strong flow
through on our exceptional sales growth with margins in the Americas growing by 220 basis points to 21.1% in the
second quarter. That is the highest Q2 margin we've ever reported for the Americas segment and there are several
things contributing to this improvement. Firstly, we are intensely focused on store operations, including labor, waste
and utilities management. We're improving productivity as well and this is allowing us to increase customer visits
without adding costs. For example, our new [ph] labor playbooks (21:37) are leading to simplified operations, which in
turn allows us to bring in new products while minimizing additional complexity to the system.

We're also benefiting from lower coffee prices. This alone provided 40 basis points of favorability in our COGS and
occupancy line in Q2.
Today Starbucks stores are busier than ever, but we remain very conscious that outstanding service is what brings back
customers again and again. That is why I'm so proud of the focus of our store partners – the focus our store partners
continue to place on delivering the Starbucks experience. We can see from customer voice metrics that in the U.S. taste
of beverage and speed of service scores are among the highest levels in recent years. Friendliness and order accuracy
also moved meaningfully higher in the second quarter. All these combined led to the highest quarterly increase in our
overall satisfaction scores in two years.
We continue to grow strongly outside the U.S. with Latin America delivering double digit revenue growth. The success
we're seeing in our licensed markets across the region, together with the potential of Brazil give me confidence for
Starbucks' future growth across Latin America. Our performance in Mexico is particularly exceptional, which is why
we're so excited to build on the strong foundation already in place, and announced our intent to open 250 new stores
over the next five years as part of the sale of our equity there. That sale is consistent with our strategy to simplify equity
structure.
Looking ahead, there are a number of areas that will be critical to our growth. One begins next week as we signal the
return of summer at Starbucks by launching our new caramel ribbon crunch frappuccino and this will be to accompany
the full lineup of signature handcrafted frappuccino beverages that have been in our stores for nearly 20 years. This will
be a strong complement to the returning lineup of chilled summer beverages including iced coffee, iced teas and our
handcrafted refreshers.
Food is also a near and long term growth driver for the Americas. Our overall food program continues to perform well,
and we're excited about what's to come in the U.S. with La Boulange. At the end of the second quarter we had 150
Starbucks stores carrying La Boulange products. As of today we're in 439 stores having rolled out to the entire San
Francisco Bay Area. And the lift we've seen thus far, while it is still early, has been encouraging. I look forward to
sharing more detail with you as our insights become even more meaningful. What I can tell you is that La Boulange
pastries will roll out in the Pacific Northwest including Seattle in June, then will expand to cities including Los Angeles
and Chicago, followed later in the year by New York and Boston. We remain on track to have La Boulange products in
all of our U.S. company operated stores by the end of 2014.
Another area of focus for the team is unleashing the real potential we have in Drive-Thru. As Howard mentioned last
quarter, the majority of U.S. new store growth over the next few years will come from Drive-Thru. The business case is
very compelling. Our Drive-Thru stores have healthy profit margins as we're able to better leverage fixed occupancy
costs and depreciation with sales coming from both out of the window and in the café. We're not only focused on
opening new Drive-Thru stores; over the past two years we've conducted a deep analysis on how best to enhance
efficiency and the customer experience through the Drive-Thru window. As a result, we have already improved our
menu boards, optimized operational standards and upgraded our equipment. These improvements are driving faster
speed of service, higher order accuracy and improved customer satisfaction. We're still in the early days of our overall
Drive-Thru elevation, and we know our relationship with customers is just as important to the Drive-Thru window as
inside the café. And our priority as well as our financial results over the coming years will reflect this.
Meanwhile, we're focused on maintaining the high quality of our existing portfolio, updating stores through
approximately 1,600 renovations across the Americas segment this year. While we don't expect meaningful overall
sales lift due to routine renovations, we do see immediate results when we add new programs or increase capacity as
part of the work.
Howard mentioned, our integration to the Teavana business is well underway, and I'm extremely proud to now be
leading this premium innovative concept. And I know the expertise we have gained over 40 years of coffee
merchandising and our leadership in handcrafted beverage preparation will translate tremendously well to the high
level of product quality and innovation already associated with Teavana. We're excited in the coming quarters to share
more about the ideas and plans that are emerging.

All that we have accomplished and all that we have yet to accomplish would be impossible without what is far and
away Starbucks' most important asset, our people. I can say with certainty that my Americas leadership team has never
been stronger than it is today. We have great stability and rich diversity resulting in a deep, talented bench. And while I
get the fortune of discussing our record results and tremendous growth with you all, it's important to remember that the
partners in the 13,000 stores of the Americas region really make this all happen. So to them I'd like to say thank you,
and with that I'll turn the call over to Troy Alstead. Troy?
Troy Alstead
Thanks, Cliff, and good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely fortunate that the Americas business produces results
that consistently exceed what you would normally expect from a business so large and mature. Cliff cited many of the
reasons behind that success: innovation; consistent delivery of outstanding customer service; and a deep entrepreneurial
spirit. It's the consistent strength of the Americas performance that allows us to nurture the seeds of growth outside of
the Americas. I will now talk to the second quarter results of those businesses.
In China and Asia-Pacific we continued to [inaudible] (28:00) rapidly while delivering strong results. Net revenues of
$214 million represented 22% growth in the second quarter and were driven by a mixture of [inaudible] (28:09) 15 net
new store openings over the past year along with same-store sales growth of 8%. Considering the difficulties that others
are experiencing in this part of the world coupled with the fact that we are lapping extremely strong comps of 18% last
season, we are very pleased with this performance. Half of our Q2 comp growth was due to increased transactions as
customers were receptive to our seasonal offerings with continued strength from the My Starbucks Rewards program in
China also contributing. Ticket growth was due to a combination of pricing as well as sales mix.
Operating income of $68.3 million produced operating margin of 32.0%, down 700 [inaudible] (28:49). We have
grown our company operated store base by 35% in the past year, double the pace of growth in the region overall. And
as I have indicated for some time now, that portfolio mix shift is strategically and financially very valuable, but does
currently have a negative mix shift impact on operating margin in the region. We added 66 new company operated
stores in CAP in the second quarter, the highest number of company operated stores we've ever opened in a single
quarter in this region. We are solidly on track with our previously communicated growth trajectory in China and across
the region. Just as with last quarter and as we expect to continue, this higher pace of growth carries with it investment
spending to open and operate these new stores. That also led to a portion of the margin decline we reported this quarter.
Finally, we reported a year-over-year decline of $2.1 million in income from equity investees in the second quarter.
This is entirely the result of favorable non-routine income of $6.7 million in the second quarter of last year. Our
partnerships across CAP are thriving, including in Japan, where comps and new store growth are both higher this
quarter than in the prior year.
In EMEA the difficult economic climate and continued weakness in retail footfall continued to impact our business.
Total net revenues of $273 million were flat to last Q2, with licensed store revenue growth of 48% offset by a 6%
decline in company operated revenue. The licensed store revenue growth was primarily the result of the addition of 117
licensed stores over the past year combined with strong comp growth. The company operated revenue decline was the
result of a declining company operated store base, which is the outcome of the store closures we had previously spoken
about, as well as the sale of a number of company operated stores to licensed partners. Also contributing was a 2%
decline in comparable store sales.
Profitability in EMEA remains challenged, though we are making progress on a number of fronts. Operating income
for the quarter rose to a positive $5.2 million, up from a loss of $7 million in Q2 of last year. Our continued disciplined
focus on cost management is one of the items contributing to the improvement. Additionally, we're beginning to see the
benefit of our portfolio mix shift to a more heavily licensed model; EMEA net new store growth in Q2 was entirely
comprised of license stores. Also contributing to the Q2 profitability was a $5.7 million reduction to the estimated asset
retirement obligations of our store leases in the region.

We are in this for the long run in Europe. It will take time to grow our licensed business in the region, and it will take
time to drive increased profitability through our existing company operated store base. The opportunity in Europe and
the Middle East is meaningful, though, and the eventual payoff will be well worth it.
Let me now move to channel development where revenues of $344 million grew 7% over the prior year. The second
quarter, as is the case for all of fiscal 2013 for channel development, reflects slower growth as we continue to develop
and invest in the products and businesses that will drive more rapid growth in future years. The channel development
business consists of the larger, highly profitable but slower growing roast and ground coffee and food service
businesses, which account for approximately two-thirds of current channel development revenue and the smaller, faster
growing, single serve, ready-to-drink and international businesses. While these newer businesses account for only
one-third of our channel development revenue today, we are building for the future with new capability, distribution
and innovation across VIA, K-Cups, Verismo, iced coffee, refreshers and tea. The investments we are making now will
help fuel solid long-term growth in this segment in the coming years.
During the quarter, dollar sales in the roast and ground coffee category declined 3.5% versus prior year in U.S. food,
drug and mass channels, and while we are pleased that we are outperforming the industry, we are not pleased that our
roast and ground dollar sales did not grow over that same period. Nearly all of our competitors have reduced pricing
over the past several quarters, and as announced earlier this month we've responded with a list price reduction effective
in May. We believe our move reflects the right pricing in this environment and along with other unique loyalty and
value drivers such as My Starbucks Rewards, we'll provide value and relevance in the category to grow share.
K-Cups continue to be an outstanding contributor to our channel development business, and was a primary driver of
revenue growth in the quarter. Starbucks K-Cups' share of the premium single cup space in U.S. food, drug and mass
channels grew 2.3 percentage points to 14% in the quarter reflecting the continued momentum of this still young
platform.
Bottom line growth in channel development in the second quarter outpaced top line growth. Operating income of $94
million grew 18% over last year; operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 27.4% as lower coffee-related costs
provided year-over-year favorability.
Finally, let me briefly touch on our other segments. JoAnn briefly mentioned at the beginning of the call that we have
included results for Teavana along with Seattle's Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, the Tazo retail store and our Digital
Ventures business and are reporting under All Other Segments. For the second quarter the year-over-year growth in
revenue and operating income of these other segments was primarily due to the inclusion of Teavana results this quarter
for the first time, though the other businesses also contributed to the revenue growth. We are working to integrate and
align Teavana reporting, and as this becomes a more meaningful portion of our consolidated results I expect that we
will enhance our disclosure.
Now I will wrap up the second quarter on a consolidated basis before moving to targets for the remainder of the year.
Consolidated net revenues grew to a Q2 record $3.6 billion representing growth of 11% over last Q2. This increase was
due to comparable store sales growth of 6% including 4% coming from higher transactions and 2% from higher
average ticket. Beverage and food innovation, outstanding customer service and a growing base of highly loyal
customers all repeat contributors to this quarter's growth. Consolidated operating income grew 26% to $544 million in
the second quarter. Consolidated operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 15.3%, the highest Q2 margin we've
ever reported. Leverage on our strong sales coupled with 50 basis points of lower coffee cost drove the improvement.
The combination of strong sales growth in our core business, operational efficiencies in our retail stores and favorable
commodity tailwinds led to record earnings per share of $0.51. This includes a $0.03 gain on the sale of our equity in
our Mexico joint venture, which is reported in the Interest, Income and Other line. Excluding this gain EPS grew by
20%; at the high end of our targeted range.
Also of note Starbucks repurchased approximately 3 million shares of stock during the second quarter. This leaves
approximately 26 million shares authorized as available for repurchase. The combination of these repurchases along
with a $0.21 per share dividend resulted in $309 million returned to shareholders in the second quarter and brings our
first half of fiscal 2013 total to more than $850 million.

Now that we are halfway through fiscal 2013 I will provide an updated outlook for the year. Given our strong first half
results and the momentum we are carrying into the second half of the year, we are raising our full-year earnings per
share target to a range of $2.12 to $2.18. For the third quarter we're targeting EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.53. For
the fourth quarter we're targeting EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.57. We now expect to add [ph] 1,650 stores (36:27)
globally, reflecting the previously targeted 1,300 Starbucks stores in addition to 350 Teavana stores that were acquired
or will open this year. We remain on track to deliver on all of other previously communicated targets, including 10% to
13% consolidated revenue growth, mid-single digit global comparable store sales growth, approximately 100 basis
points of consolidated operating margin improvement, a tax rate of 33% and capital expenditures of $1.2 billion.
Finally, we now anticipate resolution of the dispute with Kraft sometime in the second half of fiscal 2013.
As we now progress into the second half of the fiscal year, we are extremely pleased that we were able to deliver yet
another record set of results in Q2. Our Americas business continued its remarkable top and bottom line performance
and we continue to demonstrate solid growth across our entire portfolio. We recently wrapped up our strategic planning
for the next five years, and I can tell you that I've never been as optimistic at what lies ahead as I am today. The future
growth potential of this company is as clear as it is diverse. Our opportunities to deliver industry-leading shareholder
returns are as great as our opportunity to enhance the communities in which we serve. And the rigor and discipline with
which we make decisions and proceed along this path will only be matched by the focus on the outstanding experience
we deliver to each and every customer. I am excited for what lies ahead in the second half of this year and even more
excited for what lies ahead in the coming years.
With that I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Mike?
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael Kelter>: Can you guys talk a little more about your early experience rolling out La Boulange in the
stores? The word you used was – at the lift was encouraging. I was hoping you could help us with what exactly
encouraging meant and maybe in your answer you could touch upon the impact of traffic versus ticket and whether
you're getting a lift in coffee or just food?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Thanks for the question, it's Cliff here. The reason I said encouraging, we are 150 stores with
any track record and we've been working live with this and refining the projects as we've gone along. We are now in a
meaningful 439 stores. So it'll be much more meaningful when we report the next quarter and the coming quarters. I'm
personally encouraged by the pride our partners in the stores have in sharing and serving and enjoying this food. The
reaction of the customers especially to the laminates, these are the croissant, pain-au-chocolat, and almond croissant,
which are the signature products of La Boulange. With any change, it takes time for people – customers to get used to
new products, ourselves to get confident with those products, and obviously we've got a new routine with warming in
stores. I'm encouraged by the progress we're making, encouraged by the reaction, and again, as I said, I look forward to
sharing more of that in the coming quarters.

Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thanks. On the earnings guidance I guess just a couple of questions. One is why are you raising
it now? It would suggest an acceleration of earnings growth from a 20% range in the first half to 25%. So what are the
components that drive that, first? And secondly, does it include that $0.03? And where is that $0.03, I can't find it?
What segment is that in?

<A - Troy Alstead>: Thanks, John. We're raising because, first of all, we're halfway through the year. So we now have
half the year in the bank, we've been able to see two quarters' worth of great top line growth and great earnings growth
and that gives us increased confidence in our expectations for the balance of the year. I'd also point out that we're just
that much closer now to new products that will launch as we move to the balance of the year, how the seasons are
trending, our ability to drive flow through on incremental sales. All of that now halfway through the year has just
increased in confidence and allows us to increase our guidance for the balance of the year and for the full year.
Specifically to your second part of your question, yes, all year-to-date results are reflected in that full-year guidance, so
the $0.03 of the Mexico gain is included in that new $2.12 to $2.18 range that we put out there today. And that is
reported in the Interest, Income and Other expense. So you need to look at the consolidated P&L and you'll see a
year-over-year change there. There's a number of things going on in that category but there's a big driver of this Mexico
gain that shows up in that line.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Keith Siegner>: Thank you. Just a question about the new multi-channel loyalty program rolling next month. I
mean, this is – it definitely is unprecedented and I'm sure at least to some extent there's going to be some education
required. But that's kind of the big opportunity, right; you get to bring in a lot of the non-current loyalty users as they
realize this opportunity. If you could talk a little bit about that marketing program, maybe how you plan to message
this? Do you roll it out first just to existing users? How do you get the broad based awareness of this new opportunity?
Thanks.
<A - Jeffery J. Hansberry>: Hi, Keith. It's Jeff Hansberry. We're very excited about bringing My Starbucks Rewards
down the aisle. And to your very point, today we've got about 6 million My Starbucks Rewards customers. As we
extend the program into channels, we'll be able to reach an audience and make My Starbucks Rewards available and
create awareness for the program to an audience that is ten times larger than our current My Starbucks Rewards
audience. The way we'll bring that to life is in the store. There will be point-of-sale material and there will be material
on each and every package of roast and ground coffee to create rapid awareness with both our loyal customers and with
new customers as they become aware of the program. We will thread MSR through everything we do in channels; it
will become an integral part of every promotion that we run going forward. So we have great expectations in how it
will transform the way our customers experience the brand and build loyalty to the brand.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Jeff, maybe if you can also say the benefit we have about the stores within all of these
stores, the thousands of licensed stores?
<A - Jeffery J. Hansberry>: Yes, yes. Thanks Howard. So we've got over 3,000 licensed stores that sit within some of
the best grocery and mass merchant real estate in the U.S. What that allows us to do is create an ecosystem within the
store where our customers have the opportunity to buy handcrafted Starbucks beverages and also their packaged coffee
needs, down the aisle. And as Howard mentioned in his comments, every time you buy Starbucks roast and ground
coffee, you'll earn My Starbucks Rewards stars that can be redeemed for Starbucks food or Starbucks drinks. And now
with those 3,000 stores in the best grocery stores around the U.S., that makes it more relevant and helps to thread it
through our blueprint for growth more easily.

Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to just talk about the channel development business
briefly. Obviously you said that you're pleased with the share gains, but would have liked to have seen a little bit more
growth in the biggest part of your business. I'm just trying to reconcile sort of the slower top line growth with, I think,

what is continued confidence that there will be – that ultimately this business will be as big or bigger than retail. If you
could just talk about the cadence you see and maybe when some of these other initiatives will start to look a little bit –
or be a little bit more present, to offset what appears to be sort of a slower growth core packaged business? Thank you.
<A - Jeffery J. Hansberry>: Hi, Sarah. It's Jeff Hansberry again. We remain very confident in the future in channel
development. Q2 was a challenging quarter in that we saw both a slowing in the roast and ground business overall
combined with a lot of competitive activity on our largest segment, roast and ground. That said, we feel strongly that
we have the right mix of value and promotion and merchandising and loyalty activity to re-ignite growth in our roast
and ground business: with the list price reduction that we announced this month that will take effect in May; with the
activation of the My Starbucks Rewards program; with some new, additional innovation that will be hitting the market
in Q3 and Q4, to include a 40% increase in the number of SKUs of K-Cups, across the Tazo Tea brand, as well as the
Starbucks Coffee brand; additional innovation hitting the market in VIA; as well our ready to drink portfolio with
Starbucks iced coffee and some other new innovations that will come later this year. So we remain very optimistic.
And layered on top of what we're seeing in the U.S. business, we continue to be in the nascent stages of our
international expansion. I think I've shared previously that today the channel business only operates in about 20 of the
62 countries where Starbucks has retail operations, and we're working aggressively toward expanding beyond the U.S.
with our CPG portfolio.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Gregory Robert Badishkanian>: Great. Thank you. In the press release you mentioned that you had
considerable momentum in business as you entered the second half, which is very encouraging. And I'm just wondering
what's the read through of that comment to April same-store sales?
<A - Troy Alstead>: Greg, we won't speak specific about April at all. What we can say with confidence is the great
strength that we came through the first quarter, the holiday period that we've reported on previously, as you know, and
then as we progress through this quarter with a backdrop of, as you know, very choppy and mixed results broadly in the
retail environment, and looking at other retail companies, we've produced very steady, healthy, strong growth in traffic
growth and in same-store sales growth in the U.S. and consistent ability to leverage that strong top line into profit
growth at the bottom. So no specific comments about April, but we exited Q2 in a very healthy place and that's given
us confidence in terms of the momentum combined with the pipeline of what's to come in the third quarter and the
fourth quarter. The lineup of innovation across all channels encourages us, it leads to our confidence in the momentum
and it leads to our ability to speak with such confidence about the back half of the year.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I can only add one other thing, and I think it's hard to perhaps really get underneath what's
going on with social and digital media, the loyalty card and mobile. What I can tell you though is that we as a company
have cracked the code on being able to leverage those platforms in a number of ways, to create awareness and trial of
new customers who are not in the Starbucks franchise, to lower our cost of customer acquisition, as a result of the fact
we're using these channels as opposed to conventional advertising, and then thirdly we can analyze with great
specificity that the loyalty and the stars that now will be leveraged onto the CPG channel is significantly relevant to our
core customers.
When you combine that with what we've been able to do during peak periods in terms of efficiency and productivity
plus creating new need states for customers in day-parts that in the previous years we have not been as busy. As Troy
said gives us great confidence that the 7% comps that we saw our first quarter and second quarter are just stunning
accomplishments when you look at the backdrop of the economy and what other people are reporting and especially
given the environment we're in.

So I would say that the ecosystem that Jeff talked about and what we're going to be able to do with these programs

Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeffrey Bernstein>: Great. Thank you very much. Just a question on more so balance sheet. In terms of cash or
even looking at the cash flow statement, after your CapEx spend obviously there's no shortage of cash. I'm just
wondering if you can give us kind of an update in terms of board discussions as it relates to how you determine the
right balance? First of all, just of share repurchase and dividend, what is the right level there, because obviously you
could be doing a lot more of both? And then the potential, whether it's considered around an increase in leverage?
Obviously right now leverage is not your priority but rates are fairly compelling, so I'm wondering whether you
consider boosting leverage or how you even think about the leverage, the right leverage level, perhaps once the
settlement is complete? Any thoughts on that front would be great.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Sure, Jeff. I think the first thing I'd mention is where you ended which is we are awaiting
resolution of our dispute with Kraft and as we come through that, which we now expect will sometime be in the second
half of this fiscal year, that will bring clarity that will allow us to then formulate a little bit more specifically our go
forward plans. What I will say is that we are very committed to sustainable dividends and growing the dividend through
two methods. One is by, as earnings grow over time, the payout ratio where we've been paying since initiation, a 35%
to 40% payout ratio; I would expect to grow dividends just as earnings grow. But I'd also expect to look at that range
over time. Not immediately, not imminently, but we're well aware of what others in the industry payout and I would
anticipate us elevating that payout ratio at the appropriate time, reflecting the strength of our cash flow in the business.
Similarly, with share repurchases, we're committed to a balance of dividends and repurchases. Of course repurchases
are much more opportunistic, but we're committed to the program and our board has authorized continued opportunities
for us to be more active in the open market; so we'll take advantage of that as we believe market conditions exist for
that.
Now with respect to debt, what I'll tell you is I'm looking closely at debt on our balance sheet, and while we certainly
are in a very, very strong cash flow position, we do recognize that we've got opportunity to optimize that balance sheet
and bring some additional debt on, some leverage over time. And I'm well aware of where the market conditions are
today and, again, looking very closely at it. Nothing to announce today but it's definitely something close in on the
radar screen.
<Q - Jeffrey Bernstein>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Jason T. West>: Yeah, thanks. Just a question on EMEA. If you guys could talk about the thinking on holding
onto the company stores there. It's a business that's not earning much of a margin today and just wondering, you
mentioned some refranchising, but I think that's for new growth. Just if you've revisited the thoughts on refranchising
some of the company business to try to pull more profits out of that market?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Michelle is sitting in London. I think she's going to answer the question.
<A - Michelle U. Gass>: Yes. Hi, Jason. Michelle here. Excellent question. Actually, as Howard spoke to, we are
actually now looking at franchising, not only for new growth, but sale of some of our existing base. And we have begun
to do that in London, and as we get some learnings in the U.K., we will explore other opportunities across the

continent. So, to clarify, it's not just about new store growth; it is actually about looking at the sale of some of our
existing base. And we're confident that this will dramatically shift the profitability of the market.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Hey, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Obviously, unbelievable performance, especially
at the core U.S. retail. Last year, Starbucks did a $10 card for $5 with LivingSocial, and I'm not acquainted with all the
details on these deals, but that seemed at the time to be a way to nudge the sales higher after what was a tough June last
year. This year, I think you did one with Groupon at the end of March when the retail momentum seems very strong.
So I'm wondering if you're doing things like this maybe more strategically as you're trying to think about broadening
that rewards user base, or maybe just what were you thinking with these types of things? Thanks.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: It's true that the success that we enjoyed with LivingSocial, coupled with the learnings that
we had in terms of analyzing it, gave us great confidence that during the right time of the year there was an opportunity
to do this again. I think the Starbucks brand and the frequency and the relevancy of the Starbucks experience puts us in
the unique position to leverage these kinds of opportunities versus a traditional retailer or restaurant. I think you're
exactly right; the momentum in this quarter, there was no specific need to be a catalyst, but we felt there's no reason to
embrace the status quo. We learned a great deal from LivingSocial so we had planned to do it again.
I think that Starbucks is in a unique position in that we are a super-premium brand. You don't have to go to Starbucks,
it's a discretionary purchase, but at the same time we've been able to find ways to provide a value proposition
throughout the menu system and take advantage of these kinds of offers. When you couple that with the incrementality
that we have gotten from our rewards program, we have a new level of analytics that we feel is a significant
competitive advantage going forward domestically and internationally, and we're now going to apply that to other
channels of distribution, specifically to grocery.
And I want to go back to one question that was asked earlier about, is in fact the other channels going to be as large as
we've said in the past? And no one on this call should doubt whatsoever the commitment we have and the ambition for
the multiple channels of distribution to live outside of our stores that will rival the scale of the U.S. business. We have
an opportunity, as we've demonstrated with VIA, as we've demonstrated with Evolution, to introduce products in our
stores, create the brand and then draft off that into the grocery channel. These are early, early days but the evidence that
we have about what I've just described, coupled with this new level of analytics and the benefit from these loyalty
programs gives us great confidence that we have the tools, the resources and the multiple channels of distribution that
no other consumer brand or retailer has, to do things that have not been done before. And this loyalty program we're
going to launch into CPG is a significant idea both for the consumer and I also should say, for the trade and we have
been in close contact with.
And I'm stunned that no one has asked a question about the CPG opportunity in China. Did you not hear what I said?
We are looking at the opportunity to take the CPG business into the largest growing market into the world, leveraging
the equity of the brand and our 1,000 store retail footprint in China.

Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Howard, I will be a follow-up on that last statement and then another question if I may?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Finally.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: How many points of distribution do you think you could have in the CPG [ph] end- (58:30)
market in China? Is it like the U.S. in terms of grocery stores? I don't know exactly what the numbers are there.

<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I think the type of distribution that we'll ultimately have in Mainland China will be
different than the core distribution we have in the U.S. That channel does not have the nationwide grocery businesses.
However, the demand for Starbucks coffee and coffee products that we've had from customers and from people
interested on the trade side has been growing. And so we believe very strongly that we can take advantage of that. And
when we look at products like bottled frappuccino and the success of blended frappuccino in China, which has been a
significant opportunity for us, we think we can leverage bottled frappuccino in the same context that we've done in the
U.S., which is a billion-dollar brand. And so this is a big long-term idea and it's built off of the unique trust and
confidence and the relevancy of the Starbucks retail brand in China.
And for any of you who have been to Mainland China and seen that the people who are going into our stores in now
over 70 cities in China, are Chinese nationals, who are using our stores in the same way that Starbucks customers have
for years in the U.S. They're drinking Starbucks coffee; they're drinking espresso beverages and using our stores as an
extension of home and work.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: And if I may follow-up on a slightly different topic. There was I guess some discussion on
the last conference call that your early quarter sales, your March quarter sales, may have been helped by very high
Starbucks card redemptions because of the heavy gifting that happened in the December quarter. So was hoping that
you could kind of comment whether that was the case? Also comment, I don't think I saw the number anywhere, what
the end of quarter, March quarter Starbucks Card balance was? And kind of an aside just in case I don't get cut off,
Troy, if there is any way we can tighten up the coffee cost guidance for 2014 of 2015 if it's an appropriate venue to do
that?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Well, there's no doubt that we got a boost from the sale of Starbucks holiday cards
following the holiday season. But the one thing that has happened over the course of time is that the velocity of
Starbucks card sales are much more significant in the off-peak holiday season than ever before, coupled with the fact
that we now have a significant spike in other smaller holidays: Mother's Day, Father's Day, graduation, birthdays and
gift giving. So the card itself is growing at over 30% and we expect that to continue, and we're just getting started with
it. I think Troy is going to give you the answer to the other question.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Yeah, John, specifically we had on the balance sheet at the end of March, at the end of the second
quarter, deferred revenue on the P&L of $668 million. That largely reflects Starbucks Card balances as it does each
quarter. And our overall loads during the quarter were 32% higher than the same period of time last year. So a couple
metrics that I think tell you two things. One is the huge uptick in Starbucks Card in all forms: mobile, physical card and
on the loyalty program in the holiday period very profoundly came through our business in the second quarter. Card
overall added roughly 2 percentage points of the comp growth during the second quarter, very powerful for us and not
unlike what we've seen over the past couple years as that program has built tremendously.
I think as encouraging as anything is the fact that in the second quarter not only did we benefit from that big holiday
slew of cards that came back into the stores, we also though turned many new card users into loyalty program
members, that now allows us to connect with them much more meaningfully, and we believe gives us trajectory even
more significantly into Q3 and Q4. So the card was very important to us in the quarter.
Now specific to your question about coffee costs. We have now purchased a little bit more than – or priced a little bit
more than half of our coffee needs for fiscal 2014; we have been doing some incremental buying given current market
conditions. So we've got about half, a little bit more than half of our needs locked up for 2014. And given what we've
locked as well as visibility that we have into market conditions and how we might press the balance of the year, we
expect that as I've told you before, about $100 million of commodity tailwind we would expect to come through the
P&L in fiscal 2014. That's the year-over-year benefit in fiscal 2014. Now we're not meaningfully priced at all into fiscal
2015 yet, but I would just point out that given where the market has been trading and where we believe it'll go from
here, we've got opportunity in fiscal 2015 to experience another year-over-year commodity tailwind. Not a specific
number yet but it could be a meaningful tailwind coming our way in fiscal 2015.

Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Mitch J. Speiser>: Great. Thanks very much. My question is on the food program in general in the U.S, A couple
of parts to the question. First, have the same store sales continued to grow quicker in food versus the overall business?
And separately, I sometimes get the push back where that food is a lower margin product, so as it grows it could hurt
margins, but is the offset a higher ticket? And kind of how that works. And then the last part of the food question is just
on health and wellness; and the bakery product looks great, I wouldn't consider it under the umbrella of health and
wellness. If you can maybe give us a little sense of where you might be going with health and wellness in the Starbucks
stores? Thank you.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Thanks, Mitch, for the question. Firstly we are seeing strong, continued growth from food
and that has been the case now for the past 12 months. So really we're reporting very strong growth in food in the U.S.
Obviously overall it's a balance between food and beverage, which is really important to us.
On the margin, I think the – we're getting healthy margins out of our food. The opportunity here is if we can increase
attach, which historically has been one in three transactions, that gives us a big opportunity. The other side is it
increases the relevance of Starbucks as a place for people to come to, whether it's for food on their way to work or
indeed for their lunch. So we see that continuing, and will support increased beverage sales throughout the day-parts as
well. So that is part of our strategy on food.
If I talk about the health and wellness as it relates to our new bakery products, the fantastic thing with those new bakery
products is they are all natural ingredients where we're taking out any -- there are no artificial ingredients. We use
natural sweetening, therefore we can reduce sugar. So although there is butter in there, finest ingredients, calories are
managed both by the balance of those ingredients plus portion size. So that is a good part of it. And health and wellness
remains an important part of our strategy going forward. And you'll see in the coming months that we'll supplement the
La Boulange products with other products, which will give that balance. It's important to us for both food and beverage
[ph] to give our (1:06:40) customer a choice and in all parts of our range of beverage and food to give healthy options.
<A - Troy Alstead>: And Mitch I'd like to just underscore Cliff's point about margins. While food has a lower gross
margin than does our beverage platform, on a net margin level, so at the store level, food is actually additive to margin,
we would expect, over time. And the reason for that is if we're selling incremental food and as we will be increasingly
successful we believe that increasing mix of food in our stores, the rent is already paid, the lights are on, staff is in
place, our partners are in the stores, so we have an opportunity to very incrementally perhaps see that impact to gross
margin very moderately. But I would expect it to be neutral to most likely positive to margin at the store level.
<Q - Mitch J. Speiser>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Joe Buckley>: Thank you. Just a question on the China / Asia-Pacific operating income performance for the
quarter being flat. I know you mentioned making investments in the platform and to grow the business, but could you
talk a little bit about that for the quarter and what we should – how we should think about that going forward?
<A - John Culver>: Yeah, Joe, this is John Culver. With regards to the operating income and the impact that we saw,
when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, there were really three things. First was the portfolio mix shift that
[inaudible] (1:08:13) fact that more and more of our growth is coming from our company-operated markets and in
particular China. So in the quarter, as Troy mentioned, we grew store count 35% on a year-over-year basis.
The second big item that hit us was this non-routine income. And Troy quoted that at $6.7 million. That was joint
venture income that we took last year in the quarter -

Your line is open.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Do we have a question?
<Q - Joe Buckley>: Hey Howard we can – this is Joe Buckley. I don't know if you can hear me. We can hear you, but
John got cut off about halfway through his answer.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: John, you want to take another shot at that?
<A - John Culver>: Yeah. So, with regards to the operating income and what we saw in the quarter, there are really
three factors playing into it. First was the portfolio mix shift and the fact that more and more of our growth is coming
from our company-owned markets.
The second big piece was the investment that we continue to make in accelerating new store growth. And as Troy
shared with you, we grew our new store base over 35% on a year-over-year basis. At the same time while we make
those investments we continued to see very strong returns as – from a sales to investment ratio, and those metrics
continue to exceed our expectations.
And then the last big item which was a non-routine item was this, some joint venture income that we had to lap over
from last year. It was an accounting adjustment that took place last year; it was a $6.7 million accounting adjustment in
the quarter. And that was the other big non-routine item that we had to lap over for the year.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: We'll take one more question, JoAnn.
<A - JoAnn DeGrande>: Yes, one more question, please, operator?

Your last question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael Tamas>: Great. Thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. Just wondering if you could talk about the
consumer habits a little bit that you're seeing from people that aren't using the Starbucks Card. I thought I heard
something mentioned about those users purchasing premium beverages and the like. So I'm just wondering kind of

what the spending habits look like when people aren't using the preloaded money? Thanks.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: I'll try and answer that, Mike. What we were trying to convey was that we were seeing
incrementality in terms of the afternoon day part from our cardholders and also we were seeing an increase in the
purchasing of the indulgent beverages. We were not making, and I certainly didn't intend to make any inference, about
changing habits of customers who pay by other means. They remain the majority of our customers, and they remain
very consistent in their habits.
