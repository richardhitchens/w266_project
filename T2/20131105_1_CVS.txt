I have one important reminder today. On Wednesday, December 18th, we'll host our 2013 Analyst Day in New York
City. At that time we'll provide 2014 guidance and some longer-term financial targets as well as a comprehensive
update on our strategies for achieving those growth targets. You'll have the opportunity to hear from several members
of our senior management team about our PBM, specialty, retail and MinuteClinic businesses, along with numerous
enterprise wide initiatives that will capitalize on the evolving healthcare landscape and drive future growth. If you
didn't reply to your invitation, please let us know if you plan to be there as space is filling up quickly. The meeting will
be webcast for those unable to attend in person but we do hope to see many of you there on December 18th.
Turning to this morning's news, we posted a slide presentation on our website just before this call which summarizes
the information you'll hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and
guidance. I encourage you to review the slides. Additionally, we plan to file our quarterly report on form 10-Q by the
close of business today and it will be available through our website at that time.
During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance mainly
free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP
items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And
as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.
Now before we continue, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor Statement. During this presentation,
we'll make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially. Accordingly for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for
forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We strongly recommend
that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the risk factors section of our
most recently filed annual report on form 10-K and in our upcoming quarterly report on form 10-Q.
And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.
Larry J. Merlo
Thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.
Now given that our Analyst Day is next month, our business update this morning will be brief. However, I do want to
take some time to cover some of the topics that I know is top of mind in the marketplace, such as the impact of the
Affordable Care Act. But before we get to that, let's kick things off with today's earnings because we're pleased to
report that we posted solid third quarter results across the enterprise.
Overall operating profit increased more than 15% with the PBM and retail businesses growing approximately 28% and
8% respectively. And it's important to note that this excludes the benefit from a legal settlement that was finalized
during the third quarter and that settlement related to a prescription drug anti-trust lawsuit with the drug manufacturer.
We recorded a $72 million gain within operating expenses, which equates to a $0.04 per share benefit in Q3. Now that
said, adjusted earnings per share excluding the legal settlement came in at $1.05 for the quarter and that's $0.02 above
the high end of our guidance.
Now we also generated a substantial amount of free cash and year-to-date; the total now stands at $3.1 billion and
consistent with our goal at the beginning of the year we remain committed to returning about $5 billion to our
shareholders this year through both dividends and share repurchases.
Considering our strong operating results to date, along with our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising
and narrowing our earnings guidance for full year 2013 to a range of $3.94 to $3.97 and that's a change from our
previous range of $3.90 to $3.96 and again that's excluding the $0.04 benefit from the legal settlement and Dave will
discuss our results and guidance in more detail during his financial review.
So with that, let me address some of the topics of interest that I alluded to earlier. I think as everyone knows the
healthcare environment is changing rapidly and there are certainly a number of moving parts, from the Affordable Care

Act to the private exchanges, and collectively we expect changes within this environment to be a net positive for our
business in 2014. So let me walk you through the multiple ways that we'll continue to grow our business in this
evolving landscape.
First we'll participate in coverage expansion in the public exchanges as well as Medicaid. Second, we'll participate in
the private exchange market for both active employees and retirees and I think it's important to remember that our
opportunities to participate are not limited to just our PBM, but span across our entire enterprise to include both our
retail pharmacies along with our MinuteClinic business.
So let's drill down a little further through our PBM because we'll participate in the public exchanges through our health
plan clients on a carve-in basis where the health plan covers integrated medical and pharmacy benefits and we provide
the PBM services. In fact, our health plan client footprint spans 25 states covering nearly 70% of the eligible exchange
population.
In addition, as the number one PBM player in the managed Medicaid space, we're also very well positioned to gain
share through Medicaid expansion and we certainly understand what these clients require. Moving to the private
exchanges, we'll participate through both a carve-in basis. Again, through our health plan clients as well as on a
carve-out basis as a stand-alone PBM where we have direct prescription benefit offerings on the exchange products.
And we are well positioned to win lives on the exchanges given our unique products and services as well as our trusted
brand and name recognition. Within the private exchanges, we'll also play an important role in providing coverage to
retirees, through our SilverScript prescription drug plan as well as through our health plan clients' PDP and MADP
businesses.
Now, there has certainly been a lot of speculation about what various employers are going to do with their populations,
recognizing and acknowledging that large employers cannot participate on the public exchanges until 2017. Well the
fact is that less than 1% of covered lives are expected to move to private exchange products in 2014. And based on
conversations we have had with our PBM clients and private exchange partners, we believe that most large employers
are taking a wait and see approach to private exchanges, particularly with their active employees.
Now we recently had a meeting with our client advisory group then and they told us that they feel they can manage
costs effectively in their own environment while still maintaining both control and flexibility. Now that said, large
employers may consider moving their retirees to the exchanges over time, and we may see more movement to private
exchanges by smaller employers over the next few years because the exchanges do offer a way to reduce administrative
burdens, however, I want to emphasize the point that we are very well positioned to gain lives and market share in the
exchange products.
Now recently you have also been asking about the impact all of this will have on PBM margins. And as we've stated
previously, we do expect to see some churn in PBM lives as some members may move from the employer bucket to the
health plan bucket, and although this may result in margin compression in some instances, we expect this will be
mitigated by cost management tools such as narrow networks, our proprietary maintenance choice offering, narrow
formulary, step therapies and the list goes on. As a result, we do not expect a material impact on PBM margins in the
foreseeable future.
In addition to tighter pharmacy management tools, we also expect share gains from both market expansion and market
churn as an additional lever to help offset PBM margin compression, and as I mentioned, again, we're well positioned
to win lives on the exchanges given our unique products and services along with our trusted brand and name
recognition.
Now, I also mentioned it's important to remember that the opportunities from healthcare reform go well beyond our
PBM because our consumer expertise in the new business to consumer world of healthcare is being welcomed by
health plans across the country. And leveraging our retail footprint, we can support health plan marketing initiatives,
ranging from limited pilot marketing programs to full-scale educational programs.
In fact, over the next six months, we expect health plans to host more than 6,000 marketing events in more than 1,000
of our stores across twenty states. Now, some of these health plan partnerships also include participation in preferred or

restricted retail pharmacy networks and many are taking advantage of the convenient and affordable MinuteClinic
services as well as cost saving PBM services and programs to better manage the specialty pharmacy segment. And on
top of these opportunities, our retail business will obviously benefit from the expansion of coverage along with our
ability to drive incremental scripts through our fixed retail cost structure.
So while there are a lot of moving parts, all things considered, we're very well positioned and we'll certainly provide
more specific context around our assumptions for the newly-covered lives and pharmacy utilization that we expect
from reform when we provide our guidance next month at Analyst Day.
So with that, let me quickly review some highlights on the PBM business. We've had a strong 2014 selling season,
despite the fact that the number of RFPs were down year-over-year. To date, we've completed 75% of renewals and we
have a retention rate of 96%. Our gross sales wins currently total $5.1 billion with net new business of about $1.8
billion. And remember that this net new business excludes any impact from attrition in our Medicare Part D PDP
business.
Now with regard to the sanction imposed by CMS earlier this year, as we've talked about previously, it has prevented
us from marketing our SilverScript PDP or enrolling new members, and recall that the sanction primarily affects our
individual SilverScript prescription drug product. Today, we have about 3.3 million SilverScript lives and we expect to
have roughly 3 million lives in our individual SilverScript PDP by the end of January 2014. On our last call, we said
that we expected our remediation efforts to be complete sometime near the end of the year, and we expect to meet that
target. And once complete, the next step will be for CMS to conduct its review to determine whether the issues have
been fixed, are not likely to recur, and ultimately CMS will determine when the sanction will be lifted.
Now while we're obviously disappointed that we have not been able to participate in the open enrollment period, it is
important to remember that we still see significant opportunity to grow our Med-D business over the long-term. And
we believe that the changes that we have made to strengthen the Med-D management team, along with the remediation
steps that we've taken, will allow us to do just that.
Now on the heels of a successful 2014 selling season in our commercial PBM business, work has already begun on the
2015 selling season. And as all of you know, we have a long-term strategic agreement with AETNA to provide their
PBM services. And I'm happy to report that we have successfully completed the 2015 market check with AETNA, and
we look forward to continuing our strong and mutually beneficial relationship.
I'm also very pleased that we have successfully completed the migration of AETNA's commercial business to the CVS
Caremark platform. Now that's pretty significant since it means that more clients will have access to CVS Caremark's
differentiated offerings. And our joint efforts with the AETNA sales team have been successful to date with numerous
clients adopting our unique offerings, like Maintenance Choice, like Pharmacy Advisor. And we're also working
closely with AETNA to implement and administer their exchange offerings and other government programs resulting
from the Affordable Care Act.
Now, turning to our specialty business, growth was strong, revenues up approximately 22% year-over-year. This
growth was driven by drug price inflation, utilization, new product launches and new PBM clients. At our recent client
forum, many of our clients expressed concerns about the rapid growth in specialty pharmacy costs and they are
increasingly open to new ideas and solutions that address the escalating growth in specialty, and we certainly view this
as a significant opportunity. And you'll hear more about our strategies to help clients manage the specialty trend next
month at Analyst Day.
Moving on to the retail business, we had another solid quarter. Total same-store sales increased 3.6%, while pharmacy
same-store sales increased a very healthy 5.7%. Pharmacy same-store sales were negatively impacted by about 320
basis points due to recent generic introductions, and that's about half of the 670 basis point impact that we saw in Q2.
Pharmacy same-store scripts increased 1.4% when counting 90 day scripts as one, and increased 4.5% on a 30 day
equivalent basis. And we have seen a greater than historical rate of conversion to 90 day from 30 day scripts, and that's
being driven by the continued strong growth in our Maintenance Choice programs.

I'm also pleased to report that the retention of scripts gained during last year's impasse between Walgreens and Express
Scripts continues to exceed our expectations. As you know, our goal was to retain at least 60% of those scripts this
year, and we are ahead of that goal.
As for the front store business, comps decreased 1%, reflecting a decline in traffic. At the same time, we saw continued
increase in basket size as well as modestly higher front-store margins. Our ExtraCare loyalty card continues to enable
us to personalize our offers, creating more value for customers and gaining a bigger share of their wallet.
In fact, this quarter we launched the myWeeklyAd, a first of its kind personalized digital circular experience that taps
into ExtraCare insights and the myWeeklyAd provides the unique weekly circular for every customer that's geared to
their shopping preferences, saving them both time and money. We hope you'll log on and give it a try and we'll speak
more about this on Analyst Day.
As for new stores we opened 71 new or relocated stores, closed one during the quarter, resulting in 48 net new stores in
Q3 and this keeps us on track to achieve our 2 to 3% square footage growth target for the year.
Let me turn briefly to MinuteClinic, which posted revenue growth of 18% versus last year's third quarter. We opened
42 net new clinics in the quarter, including clinics in two new states, Hawaii and Louisiana, ending Q3 with 726 clinics
in 27 states and the District of Columbia and our long-term goal is to create a platform that supports primary care by
providing integrated, high-quality care that is convenient, accessible and affordable and we'll talk more about that next
month as well.
So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.
David M. Denton
Thank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone.
Before turning to our results and our guidance I want to highlight how our disciplined capital allocation program
continues to enhance shareholder value. And during the third quarter, we paid approximately $276 million in dividends,
bringing our year-to-date payout to $829 million.
Additionally we repurchased approximately 25.8 million shares for $1.5 billion in the quarter at an average price of
$58.98 per share. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 39.6 million shares for approximately $2.3 billion, again at an
average price of $57.33. As you can see, the pace of buybacks accelerated throughout the third quarter and we remain
on track to complete approximately $4 billion of share repurchase in 2013 which is also included in our guidance.
So between dividends and share repurchases, we are returned more than $3.1 billion to our shareholders through the
first three quarters of this year alone and we continue to expect to return approximately $5 billion for the full year.
We've also generated approximately $3.1 billion of free cash flow through September of this year. Improving our cash
generation capabilities through improved working capital management remains an area of focus for us and over the past
several years we made excellent progress in reducing our cash cycle.
As previously noted, we have some timing issues with respect to CMS payables and receivables that may affect our
working capital and delivery of free cash flow for the year. Even so we are maintaining our guidance of free cash flow
of between $4.8 billion and $5.1 billion this year while we work to offset this headwind to our target.
As for the income statement, third quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.05 per share
was approximately $0.02 above the high end of our guidance after removing the pre-tax gain of $72 million from the
legal settlement. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.03 per share including the $0.04 gain from the legal settlement. Earnings
were higher than expected primarily due to the outperformance in the PBM, a favorable tax rate and a weighted average
share count that was slightly lower than planned.

Now let me quickly walk you through our results. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the third quarter increased
5.8%, or approximately $1.7 billion, to $32 billion. This exceeded the top of our guidance range again driven by the
PBM. PBM net revenues increased 7.8% or approximately $1.4 billion to $19.5 billion. This growth was more than 225
basis points above the high end of our guidance and was driven by higher than anticipated claims volume, primarily
from Maintenance Choice as well as higher inflation within our specialty business.
Script utilization trends were consistent with prior periods and we saw increased utilization in the retail network and in
Maintenance Choice claims offset by declining trends in core mail order. Claims growth year-over-year was driven by
net new client wins and increased membership within our existing book of business. Specialty pharmacy was also a key
driver.
Now slightly offsetting these positive revenue drivers was a strong GDR, which was obviously good for the bottom
line. The PBM's generic dispensing rate increased 170 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 81%. Note that
starting with Q1 of this year, the sequential year-over-year rate of increase continues to slow from the high point of
approximately 500 basis points in Q4 of LY to 170 basis points this quarter. This trend is expected to continue
throughout Q4 of this year given that fewer generic conversions are expected for the remainder of this year versus last
year.
Revenues in the retail business increased 5% in the quarter or approximately $780 million to $16.3 billion. As with the
PBM, Maintenance Choice adoption was better than expected and helped drive overall performance to near the higher
end of expectations. Like the PBM, new generic introductions negatively impacted retail sales with our retail GDR
increasing approximately 160 basis points versus the third quarter of 2012 to 81.5%.
Now turning to gross margins, we recorded 18.9% for the consolidated company in the quarter, an increase of
approximately 20 basis points compared to Q3 of 2012. Within the PBM segment, gross margins increased by
approximately 65 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 6.6%. While gross profit dollars increased
approximately 20% year-over-year.
The increase in margin rate year-over-year was primarily driven by better acquisition costs, rebate economics, timing of
our Medicare Part D PDP margins, as well as the increase in GDR. The increase in margin dollars was driven by higher
volumes from new client and new members and higher specialty volumes versus the third quarter of last year, as well
as the shift of Medicare Part D profitability from Q4 into Q3 of this year. These positive drivers were partially offset by
price compression as well as remediation and operating costs within our Medicare Part D business.
Gross margins in the retail segment were 30%, down about 15 basis points from LY while gross profit dollars increased
4.5% year-over-year. Given that pharmacy growth was stronger than front store growth in the quarter, pharmacy
revenues as a percent of total retail revenues increased by about 135 basis points. This shift in the business mix was the
main driver of the climb in the overall retail margin rate since gross margins in the pharmacy business are lower than
that in the front. Partially offsetting this was the increase in GDR as the continued increase – as the continued increase
in front-store margins.
Excluding the positive impact of the legal settlement, total consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenues
improved versus the third quarter of 2012 by approximately 35 basis points to 12.3% while total SG&A dollars grew by
2.9%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate improved by about 15 basis points to 1.5%, excluding the benefit of the $11
million settlement PBM expenses declined approximately $4 million from the third quarter of last year, and this reflects
reduced spending on the streamlining initiative as the project nears completion.
In the retail segment, solid expense control resulted in an improvement in the SG&A as a percentage of sales of 40
basis points to 21.3%, excluding the $61 million benefit from the legal settlement. Overall retail SG&A expenses grew
by about 3.1%.
Now within the corporate segment, expenses increased by approximately $10 million to $179 million. As a percent of
consolidated revenues, operating expenses were flat. Now adding it all up and excluding the impact of the legal
settlement, operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately 55 basis points to 6.5%. Operating margin
in the PBM improved 80 basis points to 5.1% while operating margin at retail improved by 25 basis points to 8.7%.

For the quarter, we were comfortably within the high end of our guidance for operating profit growth in the retail
segment while we exceeded our expectations in the PBM. Excluding the benefit from the legal settlement, retail
operating profit increased a very healthy 8.2%, while PBM operating profits increased a very strong 27.7%.
Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter declined approximately
$12 million from last quarter to $122 million. The debt refinancing we did in the fourth quarter of last year continues to
be the primary driver of the year-over-year decrease each quarter. Additionally our effective tax rate was 38.2%, which
was slightly better than we expected, and our weighted average share count was slightly lower than anticipated at about
1.23 billion shares for the quarter.
So now let me turn to our 2013 guidance, which we both raised and narrowed this morning. Excluding the impact of
the legal settlement in the third quarter, we currently expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $3.94 to $3.97 for
2013, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 14.75% to 15.75% after removing the impact in 2012 of the early
extinguishment of debt to make the numbers more comparable. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operation is
expected to be the range of $3.73 to $3.76 per share.
Our revised guidance reflects our solid performance for the first nine months of this year as well as our confidence in
our outlook. Embedded in this guidance are share repurchases totaling approximately $4 billion for the year, including
shares from a $1.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we began on October 1st. The details of the
program will be available in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today.
Now let me walk you through our fourth quarter guidance. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of
$1.09 per share to $1.12 per share, down 1.55 to 4.25% from Q4 2012 after removing the impact in last year's fourth
quarter resulting from the early extinguishment of debt. GAAP EPS from continuing operations is expected to be IN
the range of $1.03 per share to $1.06 per share.
As I said in the last quarterly call we expect the fourth quarter to be somewhat atypical this year, driven mostly by the
timing of break open generics and by Med-D profits in the PBM. With respect to Medicare Part D, as I noted on our
last earnings call, we are seeing a shift of profitability within the business from Q4, which has historically been our
most profitable Med-D quarter, into Q3. A number of factors are affecting this, predominantly changes in earned
rebates and the mix of the business across our SilverScript Choice versus our SilverScript Basic plan, as well as the
impact of the sanction. As such we expect the PBM segment's operating profit to decline by 15 to 18% in the fourth
quarter.
We expect the retail segment's operating profit to increase 2.75% to 4.5% in the fourth quarter, driven by gains in both
the front store as well as the pharmacy. For the PBM segment, we expect revenues to increase 3.5% to 5% for the
fourth quarter and adjusted claims to be between $262 million and $265 million.
For the retail segment we expect revenue to increase 3.5% to 5% with same-store sales to increase 2.25% to 3.75%.
Same-store scripts are expected to increase 0.5% to 1.5% while adjusted script comps are forecasted to be between 3%
and 4%. And now as a result for the total enterprise in the quarter we expect revenues to be up approximately 2.75% to
4.25% from the fourth quarter of 2012. This is after intercompany eliminations, which are projected to equal about
10.6% of combined segment revenues.
For the total company, gross profit margins are expected to be down significantly from last year's fourth quarter as both
the retail and PBM segments will experience contraction. Expectations are that gross margin in the retail segment will
be notably down due to fewer new generics available to offset continued reimbursement pressure. Gross margins in the
PBM segment will be significantly down due in large part to the timing of Medicare Part D profitability but also due to
fewer break open new generics to offset pricing pressures. These trends are occurring as expected as we lap a large
amount of break open generics in 2012.
For the total company, operating expenses as a percent of revenues are expected to moderately improve in the fourth
quarter. PBM operating expenses should show modest improvement, driven in part by a reduction of streamlining costs
year-over-year. Retail expense leverage should notably improve and up-turn from recent trends largely due to the fact

that there are fewer generics and therefore less deleveraging of expenses. And we expect operating expenses in the
corporate segment to be between $190 million and $195 million.
We expect operating margin for the total company in the quarter to be down 60 to 70 basis points from last year's
fourth quarter. We expect net interest expense of between $130 million and $135 million, and a tax rate of
approximately 39% in the fourth quarter.
We anticipate that we will have approximately 1.2 billion weighted average shares for the quarter, which would imply
approximately 1.23 billion for the year. And as I said, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow in the range of
$4.8 billion to $5.1 billion, and we remain focused on using our strong free cash flow to drive shareholder value now as
well as into the future.
And with that, I will turn it back over to Larry Merlo.
Larry J. Merlo
All right, thanks, Dave. And just to sum things up, obviously, we're pleased with our strong third quarter results and
optimistic about the outlook for this year and next. We see the evolving healthcare environment as an opportunity for
growth, and we believe we're very well positioned to gain market share across the enterprise.
So with that, let's go ahead, and open it up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Thanks for taking the questions. A lot of good detail on the PBM side, so I thought maybe I
would start off on the front end. Same-store sales down again this quarter, and I know you're citing softer traffic. I was
wondering if you could just maybe share some color on whether you think this has been more macro driven or is there
some competitive changes going on that are driving a little softness on the front end?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Robert, we have discussed in the past that we continue to see a cautious consumer. We did see
some pullback in consumer spending that began in the spring timeframe. It's manifesting itself in fewer trips. At the
same time, we have seen the promotional environment intensify in both the drug and mass channels. At the same time,
we have not made dramatic changes in our promotional strategy.
As a matter of fact, if you look at our year-over-year promotional circular page count, in the third quarter, it was
actually down 12%. And we continue to use ExtraCare as our point of differentiation along with delivering a way to
create value for consumers, and we have been able to drive the basket size of our customers. And as Dave mentioned in
his remarks, it's also important to point out that through these efforts, we've been able to achieve margin expansion.
So I think we're always – on the front store sales issue, it's always a bit of art and science, trial and error. Mark and his
retail team are certainly focused on it. We would like our front-store comps to be better, but we'll be very disciplined
about not chasing empty sales.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: That makes a lot of sense. And Larry, I know you talked a lot about the major topics in the
sector, specifically the exchanges, and obviously look forward to getting more details at the Analyst Day. But one of
the other major topics as of late has been agreements across the supply chain as far as consolidating generic purchasing.
I'm just wondering if you could weigh in given some of the activity as of late as far as your view of your current
positioning in generic sourcing, and whether or not you think, in light of some of these moves, that you would be
interested in trying to garner more scale?

<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, our position has really not changed since we discussed this on our last call. A generic
sourcing alliance could present an interesting opportunity. We're certainly always open to learning and evaluating
opportunities in the marketplace. And if we were to determine that an alliance could drive higher returns for us, we
would certainly consider that. And we believe that we could do that without expending significant capital. So, we'll
continue to watch it, and there may be some incremental opportunities domestically, but we still see the global sourcing
environment less clear. But again, we'll be open to opportunities.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Great, thanks for the question.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Bob Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Hey, Larry or Dave. In light of how fast the CVS share of the Caremark accounts has
grown over the past few years, does it make sense to offer any type of quarterly update where you think your share
stands and to offer any targets on where that could go over the next couple of years?
<A - David M. Denton>: Bob, this is Dave. Good question. I think, as you know, we have seen substantial growth in
share of CVS within the Caremark book. I think over the past few years, we've moved from roughly 18% to in excess
of 31% at this point in time. My guess is those shares – those are longer-term movement trends, so probably
quarter-by-quarter might not make the most sense. Probably year-over-year is probably a more comparable perspective,
so you'll probably see a little bit of that as we cycle into Analyst Day coming up here.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Bob, it's a great question. I think it does make sense to look at it on an annual basis. And
to Dave's point, keep in mind that that retail percent of the Caremark book of business, while it's grown, the pie has also
grown at the same time. There have been north of $25 billion worth of new business wins during that period of time.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Any three-year target, per chance?
<A - David M. Denton>: Not at this point.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Bob.
Operator
Thank you. Continuing on, the next question is from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning. Could you give us any color on the share in the retail business now that has
transitioned from 30 to 90 day, where you think that might go, and how you are running the business or managing
capacity in the stores differently as that has taken place?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, we have seen it grow, Eric, for some time now. Acknowledging growth off of a smaller
base but it has been growing north of 20% and I think that there are a lot of variables in play that are driving that
growth from – I'll start with Maintenance Choice but there are also more plan designs out there that have 90 day
options at retail and there's been a lot of information out there that 90 day prescriptions also improve medication

adherence.
So, I think that we'll continue to see a disproportionate growth and acceleration from 30 to 90. Obviously, we have on
the retail side we have always done an effective job of managing SG&A at the store level and the labor models that we
have built along with our work flow in the pharmacy enables us to flex our labor according to those volumes and there
are some labor efficiencies to be picked up there.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: And then secondly you talked about restricted or preferred networks. Just curious what you're
seeing take place and what you're facilitating through Caremark and what you're seeing take place in the market in
terms of the appetite in adoption and utilization of preferred or narrow networks in the retail front as we move into
2014.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, Eric this is Jon at this end. We've clearly seen the growth of preferred networks in
Medicare. Got off to a slow start when Medicare was first implemented but you've seen a lot of movement, particularly
over the last couple of years. In Medicaid we're seeing restricted networks in the managed Medicaid space. We think
that continues to be something that this segment will be interested in.
And in the employer space you've seen and Dave talked about our growth in Maintenance Choice, which is a form of a
narrow network, and we've seen interest from employers. I would say this year probably less interest because
employers were more focused on healthcare reform, changes they needed to make within their own book of business
but it's interesting that health plans that historically have not been interested in narrow networks, we're seeing a lot of
interest, particularly around their exchange offerings. So we've had several health plans adopt narrow networks for their
public exchange offerings so we think it continues to be an opportunity for plans and clients to save money through
either preferred or restricted networks so we continue to see good growth opportunities in this area.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Eric.
Operator
Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.
Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Thanks, so Larry, two questions. First on Maintenance Choice, any comment on the
relative growth rates of 2.0 and 1.0? And when do you think – how much time do you think it takes for 2.0 to start then
customers migrating from 2.0 to 1.0. That will be one full contract cycle, or shorter, longer? What are your thoughts on
that?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah. John, we'll touch on this more at Analyst Day, but we have seen some adoption on 2.0. I
think that we certainly – as we've talked we see an opportunity to – when you look at 1.0 and 2.0., the opportunity to
cover more than 30 million lives over time. I think that we see an adoption track where a client gets into 2.0 and then
ultimately migrates into 1.0 to maximize the savings, but we'll hit more of the metrics in December.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: All right and then secondly, thinking about the front end and myWeeklyAd, so if you look
at – if you could segment traffic by loyalty of customer, I don't know if you would do a decile or quartile or whatever,
but is traffic down among of the most loyal customers, or is it down more among the most least loyal? Maybe some of
that is by your design. And over time as myWeeklyAd gets greater adoption, what does that do to traffic, and is that a
significant incremental positive to margin as you're getting more maybe wasting less promotional dollars?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, John, those are two great questions. I mean, if you look at our traffic and through
segmentation, we would see more of the declines among our most – or our least loyal customers, okay. We continue to
see growth in our most loyal customers. I think directionally you're spot on in terms of the reality of as we migrate over
time, okay, and reduce our dependency on the weekly circular, there is certainly an opportunity to deliver value to our
ExtraCare members, okay and create a high level of satisfaction and a bigger share of wallet, and to be able to do that

so that there's a flow-through to the P&L.
And by the way, John, I think the myWeekly circular just becomes one more tool. That is not – that's not going to be
the single conduit that drives that behavior. It will be that in addition to many of the other attributes that ExtraCare
offers the consumer.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: When you did ExtraCare that helped gross, right? Will myWeeklyAd help to the same
degree or not as much?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: John, it's early. We're experimenting with it now. And that's something that we'll be able to talk
about over time.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you
Operator
Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thanks very much. I'd like to just go back a little bit to the discussion about the private
exchanges and you talk about some being carve-in of the pharmacy benefit and some being carve-out. Do you have any
sense of kind of what percentage is going to be carve-in and what is going to be carve-out, and then also related to that
is there a difference in profitability when it's carve-out versus carve-in?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Meredith, I'll take the first part of that. And Meredith, acknowledging that A), it's early,
B) it's a small sample size, but what we have seen is a trend that really looks at the historical preference of the client.
And by that I mean if the employer had pharmacy as a carve-out option then they're going onto a private exchange
product that continues to carve-out pharmacy and vice-versa. If they had pharmacy carved in with their health plan then
they're migrating to a carve-in product, and, again, that's a limited sample, but that's what we've seen to date.
<A - David M. Denton>: And then, Meredith, on the profitability. It's really a function of what programs they adopt
that really drives profitability, so it lowers their cost but drives our profitability. Programs like mail, formulary,
network programs and others. And we think with the consumer making that choice, they're going to be more likely to
make those selections for themselves.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Right. And then switching gears, a question back to the discussion of the front-end. Is it
possible that the broad base circular – I don't think you're ever going to eliminate the circular, the one that isn't tied to
the loyalty card or the individual, but can you conceive of it being much less promotional and more kind of like an
EDLP circular? I mean there's other retailers that highlight their good deals every day, but not necessarily being
focused on promotional items.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Meredith, I think that you are right. I don't think any of us see the circular going
completely away, and I think that it will evolve over the next few years. I can see it being smaller. I can see it being
more focused. Exactly what shape and form that takes I think is probably still an open question. I mean we know that
just because of the viewership – readership of the newspaper, circular distribution is down from what it was five years
ago, and so I think directionally you're correct with your hypothesis.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Meredith.

<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Thanks very much. Larry, thank you very much for all the comments on the public and private
exchanges, but I'm actually going to ask a question around Medicare Part D. When you look at your now guidance of
roughly 3 million members versus 3.3 million before, is that roughly in line with the 350,000 that you talked about last
time, one? And secondly anything you're seeing in the open enrollment period that would change any of your thoughts
going into that next year?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: No, Lisa, good morning. In response to your first question, it is consistent with what we talked
about on our last call in terms of the attrition of about 350,000 lives, and it's early in open enrollment but we have not
seen anything that is contradictory to what we've talked about.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay. And then secondly, can you maybe just give us an update where you are on RDS [Retiree
Drug Subsidy] and conversion from RDS? Clearly that the tax benefit goes away in 2014, and based on the sanctions
that you have, can you just remind us if there's any impact at all of move moving people to potentially an EGWP
[Employer Group Waiver Plan] or any other programs as they shift away from RDS.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, Lisa, this is Jon. We saw most employers focused on healthcare reform this year so
most of the movement to EGWPs happened the year before. We think there will be a pickup in activity this year. Our
plan would be out of sanction, so we believe that we'll be able to implement anyone that wants to move into an EGWP
product moving forward.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Lisa, the other thing I would mention is that we have been operating under a waiver from CMS
to continue to enroll EGWP members that we had commitments to prior to the sanction. So that has been ongoing. That
waiver has been extended through January of 2014.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay, great. Thank you for the comments.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Lisa.
Operator
Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. I had a quick housekeeping item, and then I wanted to get to my question. Flu
shots, is that in your script number or not? I can't remember.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Scott, flu shots we do treat as a prescription, and I'll call it season to date, okay, so the
season kicks off in the August timeframe and what I'm going to share with you probably goes through near the end of
October, but we've administered just over 3 million flu shots across our retail business and MinuteClinic and that's up
from last year.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay, perfect. Thanks for that clarification. So the second question I have really goes to the
outlook for the PBM. You guys talked about market share, and that you feel like you can kind of, with the new
environment, gain new market share. It seems to me as we look at Medicaid, I think you're 31% of that business; it's
grown quite a bit so I want to understand, can that go higher? Also you commented that you're in 25 states with the
exchanges. Can you get to more states? Can 70% become 90%? And then the final question about next year is we have
some big contracts out like TRICARE. What's your confidence that you will continue to gain share on the PBM side of
the business in those three different buckets?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Scott, I'll take the first part and then I'll flip it over to Jon. In terms of Medicaid, and I
think specifically you're talking about the managed Medicaid environment, and you're right we have about 30% share
of the managed Medicaid market. We certainly see more room for growth there. We're estimating that the managed
Medicaid market is going to grow by about 40% between now and 2016. We see that again as a driver for growth. And
then your second question -

Page 13 of 16
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, so, Scott, as far as we're in 25 states with 75%. As we continue to win in the
marketplace and win health plans, which we had some wins this year, we'll continue to expand our footprint. And just
as far as winning across all segments, as Larry mentioned earlier, for the 2014 selling season had over $5 billion in
gross wins with 96% retention. We've had, if you look back over the last several years, we've continued to be very
successful selling. Our integrated model continues to resonate in the marketplace with Maintenance Choice, Pharmacy
Advisor, our integrated specialty capabilities we're launching, what we're able to do with our clients with MinuteClinic,
so we're very bullish on our growth opportunities moving forward.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: And then one final follow-up is, if you continue to gain share like you have been, which is
driving tremendous amount of traffic into your assets, particularly your retail assets, and I know you're doing the
promotional stuff. But Larry, we talked about how do you get the incremental sales in a profitable way? It seems like
there's a tremendous untapped opportunity to take that traffic and convert it to some front-end sales. Any other color on
how we get that done?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Scott, first of all, I agree with you. And as I mentioned earlier, I think it was the first
question, that we – our retail team is working hard to improve our comp sales performance. And I think some of what
you're describing lies in innovation and trial and error, and we've got a talented team focused on it, and we'll continue
to work and ultimately crack the code on that.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right, thanks for taking my questions. Really appreciate it.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: All right, Thanks, Scott.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the specialty pharma
environment, and I know you have a pilot going there to kind of join the CVS bricks and mortar stores with the mail
operations on specialty. If you could give us an update on what's going on there, and how do you think that will evolve
as the specialty trends continue to grow?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, Mark, this is Jon. So, if you think of specialty today and you think about it from an
access to a member perspective, it's primarily a mail channel today. What we've been able to do is take all of our
specialty capabilities and connect them to our retail stores. So now members that want to get access to specialty
medications can go in any one of our 7,400 stores as we roll this program out next year. We'll leverage all of the
back-end clinical capabilities, the billing capabilities, the fulfillment capabilities, and then we'll be able to deliver that
prescription either to the member's home, like happens today with specialty pharmacy, or deliver it to their local CVS
pharmacy. And it's interesting, very similar to Maintenance Choice, half the people want to pick up their specialty
prescription in their CVS local store, the other half want it mailed to their home.
When you think about it from a pharma perspective, historically, adherence levels for specialty medications have been
lower in the retail channel than in the specialty channel. In our pilots, we've been able to achieve the same levels of
adherence through the integrated specialty offering that we have at mail. So we think pharma's going to be pretty
bullish on this capability, so we're improving access, we're achieving very high adherence levels, and we're delivering
all of the clinical capabilities that these patients need with a convenience that we're able to offer through an integrated
offering.
<Q - Mark G. Wiltamuth>: And is the bigger win capturing more prescriptions at the local pharmacy or is it just the
convenience of delivery for the consumer?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Well, I think about it in probably two parts. One is, we think because we'll have a
differentiated offering, again, it adds to our value proposition as we're out trying to win new clients. Secondly, there is
a segment of the population that is open. Medicare is an example where the patient has choice where they get their

specialty prescription filled, and so we think we have a better value proposition for those patients, so we think we will
capture more share of that open business.

Operator
Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from ISI Group. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Maybe first, just going back to all of the stuff you laid out re: reform. Do you feel like the more
you continue to dig into this, and obviously there's a lot of things changing, and a lot of unknowns, but do you feel like
the integrated model you continue to figure out sort of new services, new offerings, new potential profit drivers as
things change. And that you really sort of have a structural advantage there having sort of the full suite of capabilities
versus maybe some of your peers?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Ross, I think you said it very well, okay, and I don't know that there's a whole lot I would
add to that other than agreeing with you. And I think it gets back to what we've talked about many, many times, that if
you think about, from the PBM perspective, that it's largely been a B-to-B business. And if you think about the new
world order adding a B-to-C segment, we've got expertise in both. And I think that that's how we're uniquely positioned
to gain share, acknowledging that we are going to go through a period of churn in terms of who's sponsoring the
coverage. But we feel that we're well positioned, and that whether you're talking about our PBM assets, our retail
assets, our MinuteClinic assets, that we can do things and bring differentiation into the market that would be difficult
for standalone peers to replicate.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: I guess, you guys have done a good job of educating us. Maybe just quickly on the selling
season, if you look at some of the net losses, can you maybe just tick through how much of that was acquisition? And if
not, what were the – in terms of the update from Q2, what were the key reasons where you saw maybe business move
away from you?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Ross, in terms of the numbers that we gave to include the retention does reflect the net impact
of acquisition activity, and recognizing that we pick up some from acquisitions and we lose some. But acquisition
activity posed a headwind for us in terms of the impact of that. And I'll let Jon talk about from a client perspective.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, it's a very sticky business. We've got retention at 96%, you add on top of that the
$5 billion in new wins. You're always going to see some movement as people go out and evaluate the market, but we've
been very happy with our ability to retain customers with that 96% retention, including some of the acquisitions that are
moving away from us, like Amerigroup.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: All right, thanks, Ross. So, we'll take two more questions, please.

about your offering for 2014 and how it compares to some of your competitors in the preferred network area.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, Zack, this is Jon. We have a preferred network. It's very similar to what we had or
what we have this year. It's about 25,000 pharmacies where they'll get advantages. The member will have a lower
co-pay if they go to a preferred pharmacy and then we wrap the balance of the network around that so that we have the
full suite of 65,000 pharmacies participating in it.
But it's been very successful and we've created enough co-pay differential to drive pretty good share into those
preferred pharmacies so we're very happy with the performance of that preferred network and it's allowed us to offer a
very competitive product in the marketplace that will help us to continue to grow as we move forward.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Also keep in mind, Zack, that we use Aetna as the example, that we have an Aetna preferred
Med-D product out in the marketplace that we're supporting them on as well.
<Q - Zack W. Sopcak>: Okay, great, thank you. And then just a quick question on MinuteClinic, of the 18% revenue
growth you talked about, I was wondering if you would be willing to break down how much that was organic versus
new store growth and if you could talk at all about how the payer mix might have evolved over the course of the year?
<A - David M. Denton>: Zack, this is Dave. I don't know that number off of the top of my head but we've been
comping, if you look at it from a comp perspective, in the teens to the low 20s, most recently in MinuteClinic.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Zack, your second question in terms of payer mix, we have continued to see a high rate of
adoption from health plans and even government sponsored programs and if you look at MinuteClinic visits now that
have some type of insurance co-pay tied to it, if you will, that number is now in the mid-80s.
<Q - Zack W. Sopcak>: Okay, great, thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of David McGee from SunTrust. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - David Glenn Magee>: Hi, everybody. Good morning.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Good morning.
<Q - David Glenn Magee>: First question just on the specialty pharma. You called out inflation as being a factor and I
was curious if you could quantify that and specify whether that's sort of in-line with the trend or are we seeing a
sustainable trend change there?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: David, specialty inflation has been pretty consistent over the last several years so it's
generally 8% to 10%. You have to add on top of that mix so as new drugs come to the market they're fairly expensive
and then utilization is the third component. So that translates into trend or cost increases that our clients are seeing that
are in the high-teens, low-20s and clearly managing this area has become our client's top priority and we'll talk more
about what we're doing in this area on Analyst Day.
<Q - David Glenn Magee>: Do you have a market share numbers for that business year-over-year?
<A - David M. Denton>: I don't have that, David, with me. I'm sorry. We'll probably touch a little bit on that on
Analyst Day as well.
<Q - David Glenn Magee>: All right, thanks. My last question has to do with the promotional environment that you
anticipate on the front end. Have you sort of baked in a significantly more promotional environment this year relative to
last year as it relates to the holidays or how do you view that just on – ?

<A - David M. Denton>: Dave, this is Dave. As Larry indicated before we have seen the promotional environment
increase over the last several months. I would say that while that has occurred in the marketplace, we have been pretty
diligent in our approach to this. We have not really changed our promotional posture much. I would say we continue to
use our loyalty card program to drive performance for us, and to make sure that there's a good balance between what's
happening from a front store sales perspective, but also quite frankly what's happening from a margin perspective and
we've been consistently kind of growing our front-store margin rate, and again there's a balance there that we'll watch
closely.
<Q - David Glenn Magee>: Okay, great. Thanks, Dave.
<A - David M. Denton>: Thank you.
Larry J. Merlo
So let me just thank everybody for joining us this morning along with your interest in CVS Caremark and we will look
forward to seeing many of you next month at our Analyst Day in New York.
Operator
