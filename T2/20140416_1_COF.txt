factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. For more
information on these factors, please see the section entitled Forward-Looking Information in the earnings release

Stephen S. Crawford
Thanks, Jeff. Let me begin with slide three tonight. Capital One earned $1.15 billion or $1.96 per share in the first
quarter. On a continuing operations basis, we earned $1.12 billion or $1.91 per share and had a return on average
tangible common equity of 16.8%.
As you know, our capital plan was approved in the quarter and our board has authorized $2.5 billion in share
repurchases over the next four quarters. Included in continuing operations results this quarter were a lower provision
for loan losses, driven by lower charge-offs and a $208 million allowance release and $27 million in discrete tax items,
primarily related to changes in New York State Tax Law.
Our historical financial statements have been revised, as we adopted a new accounting standard for investments in low
income housing tax credits in the quarter, resulting in the cost of investing in qualified affordable housing projects no
longer being recognized above the line in operating expense, but rather below the line as a component of tax expense.
In addition, the new accounting standard results in higher costs in the earlier years of the investment's lives due to faster
amortization, resulting in a modest reduction in historical earnings and a one-time $112 million reduction to retained
earnings.
We have provided an appendix slide that outlines the impact of the consolidated company and the segment results due
to the adoption of the accounting rule. Excluding the impact above, operating expenses declined quarter-over-quarter,
largely due to the absence of non-recurring restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter. Additionally, linked quarter
revenues were lower, driven largely by day count and lower seasonal volumes in card.
Turning to slide four, let me briefly touch on net interest margin. Reported NIM decreased 11 basis points in the first
quarter to 6.62%, more than entirely driven from the first quarter having fewer days worth of recognized income.
Average interest earning assets were down modestly quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower average investment
securities and cash, offset by higher average loan balances. Average loans were higher on a linked quarter basis due to
continued growth in our Auto, Finance and Commercial businesses, offset by decline in card balances, primarily due to
seasonality.
Our guidance for card run-off in 2014 remains $1 billion. We are updating our expectation for mortgage run-off in
2014 to $5 billion from $4 billion previously.
Turing to slide five, I will briefly cover capital trends. As expected, Basel III Standardized became our primary
regulatory capital regime in the first quarter. Regulatory capital ratios for periods prior to the first quarter are reported
under Basel I. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized fully phased-in basis, was 11.7% in
the first quarter compared to the same number of 10.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013.
With the benefit of phase-in, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III Standardized basis was 13%, up 80
basis points from the same 12.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013.
While there's still work-in-progress industry-wide on the final implications for capital under the Basel III Advanced
Approaches, we continue to estimate we're above our target of 8%. Based on the quantitative and qualitative outcomes
in the recent CCAR process, we look forward to returning capital to our shareholders through the approved $2.5 billion
in share repurchases over the next four quarters.

The bar for passing CCAR is high and will likely continue to rise. We have and we'll continue to invest in our
processes to exceed these standards. We've demonstrated our commitment to return capital and understand that remains
an important part of the return equation for our investors.
Let me close briefly with an update of our expectations for 2014. The early adoption of the new accounting standard for
low income housing tax credits and the change we made to prospectively recognize auto repossession expense and
operating expenses instead of as a component of [ph] NACO (7:10) impact our outlook for PP&E and its components.
We had previously expected pre-provision earnings for 2014 of approximately $9.8 billion excluding extraordinary
items. Adjusting for the shift in geography of these two items with the impact of the new accounting standard being the
primary driver, we now expect 2014 pre-provision earnings to be about $10 billion within a reasonable margin of error.
Looking beyond the impact of these geography moves, we expect some modest but principally offsetting changes with
higher revenues offsetting higher expenses.
With that, let me turn the call over to Rich.
Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on slide seven with an overview of the Domestic Card business.
Ending loans were down about 7% from the fourth quarter, driven by expected seasonal pay downs and continuing
planned run-off. Ending loans declined about 3% year-over-year. Excluding the planned run-off, the year-over-year
decline in ending loans was about 1%. Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private-label
cards, which don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 11% year-over-year.
Looking below the surface, the year-over-year trends in loans and purchase volumes continue to reflect our strategic
choices, which focus on generating attractive, sustainable and resilient returns. We're avoiding high balance revolvers
and allowing the least resilient parts of the acquired HSBC portfolio to run-off.
In contrast, we're seeing underlying year-over-year loan growth in many segments, including transactors and revolvers
other than high balance revolvers. New account originations continue to grow at a strong pace and we continue to see
opportunities to increase lines for existing customers, which should improve the trajectory of both loan growth and
purchase volume growth over time. As we said last quarter, we expect these improvements to result in overall
year-over-year loan growth in the Domestic Card business sometime in the second half of 2014.
Revenue margin for the quarter was just under 17%, down seasonally from the fourth quarter. Revenue dollars were
down about 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio.
Non-interest expenses improved by $119 million from the sequential quarter, driven by operating efficiency and
seasonally lower marketing. On a linked quarter basis, the charge-off rate increased by about 12 basis points to 4.01%.
Delinquency rate decreased about 41 basis points to 3.02%. The improvement in delinquencies was better than normal
seasonal expectations.
First quarter charge-offs and delinquencies include the temporary increase we discussed last quarter. Recall that in July
2013, we changed the number of customer practices on the HSBC branded card portfolio to align them with regulatory
guidelines and Capital One practices. These changes temporarily increased fourth-quarter delinquency rate. The
delinquency impact has largely run its course, which contributed to the improvement in delinquency rate in the first
quarter.
We originally estimated that the changes to align HSBC customer practices would temporarily increase the monthly
Domestic Card charge-off rate by about 35 basis points from December through March. The actual impact was closer
to 25 basis points, and we expect it to diminish to about 10 basis points in April and be mostly out of the charge-off rate
by the end of the second quarter.

Looking beyond these temporary impacts, we expect that our focus on resilience and our strong credit risk underwriting
will continue to drive strong credit results with normal seasonal patterns. Our card business remains well positioned.
We're poised to return to year-over-year loan growth in the second half of 2014 despite continuing runoff and our
choice to avoid high balance revolvers. We're delivering strong, sustainable, and resilient returns and we're generating
capital on a strong trajectory which strengthens our balance sheet and enables capital distribution.
Moving to slide eight, the Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans declined
about $35 million from the fourth quarter and about $2.9 billion year-over-year. Continued growth in Auto loans was
more than offset by expected mortgage run-off. Auto originations increased from the fourth quarter and remain on a
strong growth trajectory. Subprime originations were relatively stable, while prime originations grew as we captured
additional prime share from our existing dealers. Ending deposit balances grew by about $3.9 billion in the quarter.
Year-over-year deposit balances declined about $1.1 billion, mostly in our legacy Capital One Direct Banking
businesses. Consumer Banking revenue was modestly lower compared to the fourth quarter, driven by declining
Consumer Banking loan balances, persistently low interest rates, and margin compression in Auto Finance.
Non-interest expense decreased $88 million in the quarter as a result of lower marketing expense in our deposit
businesses, the absence of several small non-recurring operating expenses we recognized in the fourth quarter, and
continue aiding operating efficiencies. These improvements were partially offset by a change in the geography of
where we recognized auto repossession expenses, which are now included in operating expense rather than in net
charge-offs. Provision for credit losses improved in the quarter. Auto charge-off rate and delinquencies improved in the
first quarter, in line with expected seasonal patterns and aided by the shift in presentation of repossession expenses that
I just described.
Home loans credit trends remain favorable and continue to perform well inside of the assumptions we've made when
we acquired the mortgage portfolios. The overall Consumer Banking charge-off rate remains strong at about 1%. While
we continue to expect that Auto Finance revenues, margins and returns will decline as we move from exceptional levels
to more cycle average performance, we remain committed to the Auto Finance business. We've built deep and
sustainable dealer relationships. We've developed proven underwriting and customer service capabilities, and we
expect that the Auto Finance business will continue to deliver resilient and well above hurdle returns. Additionally, we
expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low rate environment will continue to pressure the economics of
our retail deposit business, even if rates rise in 2014.
As you can see on slide nine, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. The
current and historical results on slide nine and in our financial tables have been restated to reflect the change in
accounting for low income housing tax credits that Steve described earlier. As shown in the appendix slide, the net
effect on the Commercial Banking segment are reductions in revenue, operating expense and income tax, as well as a
modest decrease in net income from operations.
Loan balances increased about 3% in the quarter and 18% year-over-year, driven by growth in specialized industry
verticals in C&I lending and CRE. Loan yield declined in the quarter and compared to the prior year, driven by lower
market pricing from increased competition and our choice to originate loans with even better credit quality. Revenues
declined 12% from the fourth quarter. Lower loan yields, as well as lower tax equivalent yields in our Equipment
Leasing business drove the quarterly decrease in revenue. In contrast, revenues increased about 5% from the prior year.
The year-over-year increase was the result of growth in loan and deposit balances across the franchise, partially offset
by declining loan yields. Non-interest expense was up 15% from the prior year as a result of the Beech Street
acquisition and continued growth in loan balances. In the quarter, non-interest expense was down about 9% with lower
amortization expense and seasonal trends.
Commercial credit remains very strong, with the charge-off rate at 4 basis points. While the current very low charge-off
levels are not necessarily sustainable, we continue to see low levels of non-performing and criticized loan balances, so
we expect the strong credit performance of our Commercial Banking business to continue. While increasing
competition, particularly in generic middle market lending may continue to impact the pricing and volume of new loan
origination, we expect our focused and specialized approach to deliver strong results in the Commercial Bank.

I'll conclude my remarks this evening on slide 10. In the first quarter of 2014, we posted another quarter of solid results
for the company and across our businesses. We've received no objection to our CCAR capital plan and announced a
$2.5 billion share repurchase program that we expect to complete by the end of the first quarter of 2015. Capital One is
earning very attractive risk adjusted returns and we expect that will continue in 2014. But we're always focused on the
important levers that will sustain and further improve our profitability. We're committed to tightly managing costs
across our businesses. We don't view this as a one-off initiative. It's a major, multi-year agenda and it remains a top
priority in all of our businesses and in every budget cycle. Our credit results are strong, driven by a longstanding
discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our continuing focus on resilience.
Growth remains a high priority for us, but only in the context of a preemptive focus on generating attractive,
sustainable and resilient returns. We expect planned runoff will drive declining home loan balances. On the other hand,
we expect growth in areas we're emphasizing including Commercial Banking and Auto Finance will continue and we
expect year-over-year growth in Domestic Card loans to resume in the second half of 2014.
And with respect to capital, our CCAR submission and our 2014 capital plan are strong evidence of our commitment to
return capital to shareholders. The bar for passing CCAR is high and will likely continue to rise. We have invested and
we'll continue to invest in our processes to exceed these rising standards. Our capital and liquidity positions remain
strong. Our businesses continue to deliver attractive and sustainable returns and generate capital on a strong trajectory.
Industry loan growth remains low. And in our case, planned run-off frees up capital as well. We're comfortable also
with our strategic footprint.
These conditions create excess capital that can be distributed to shareholders. We recognize that capital distribution is
important to our investors. And capital management remains an important part of how we expect to deliver superior
and sustainable value to our investors in 2014 and beyond.
Now, Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Norris
Thank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask
a question, please limit yourself to a single question plus a single follow-up question. If you have any follow-up
questions after the Q&A session, Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Vicky, please start the Q&A

Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Yes, just two quick questions. I guess first on loan growth, you're still talking about returning
positive in the back half of the year. Can you just help us understand some of the drivers behind that? Is it from new
account acquisition driven from the recent marketing spend? Is there an expectation that the existing customer base will
begin revolving against slower runoff? Can you just tease out what some of the main drivers are?
And then for, Steve, just thinking out on longer term on capital returning, you talked several times that the bar does
continue to rise, but given the strong capital position, all else equal, do you think the current year's capital return is
sustainable or given the fact that you don't move to the Advanced for several years, we can actually see further
increases to capital returns in the near-term? Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Ryan, yeah, we continue to be on track to have loan growth in our card business return in
the second half of 2014. What's really driving that is continued success in new account origination. I think we feel very
good about the results we see there. On the existing customer base, things are going very well and we've gotten a lot of

traction in the line increase area where I'm sure you know that we had sort of a brownout with respect to line increases,
as we were adapting to a regulatory guideline. So that's pretty much back on track. So, we feel good with respect to
being able to play offense if you will.
With respect to the defense side, every year the runoff becomes less and we continue on our journey of running off also
our high balance revolver. And so, net-net, the line is finally crossed in the second half of this year, and I think we feel
good about the trajectory from there.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: So, Ryan, as Rich mentioned, we're not at a point where we're prepared to provide
specific guidance going forward. And I'm sure you can imagine there's a bunch of reasons for that. But a couple of
observations, some of which you've heard from Rich and I already, one, the qualitative bar continues to go up for all
banks. And I think there are good reasons for us to empathize flexibility in our future capital plans, this probably means
that share repurchases will be a continuing emphasis.
Now I think in terms of thinking about payout levels going forward, I kind of go back to the way Rich ended, which is,
we have a really strong capital position and continue to deliver high returns. Industry-wide loan growth is relatively
low, and in our case is magnified by runoff. We continue to be comfortable with our strategic footprint. And most
importantly, I think hopefully demonstrated over the last couple of years, we understand how important capital return is
to delivering enduring value to our shareholders.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question please.
Operator
We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. I guess I'll ask my couple of questions upfront. Steve, I was just wondering if you
could just go over that breakdown of the revision in the PP&E again. Just how much is coming from this specific tax
changes versus other stuff of that $200 million increase in PP&E?
And then secondly question for Rich, we've had a couple of large players in auto go public recently, one that's pretty
focused on prime. And I think I heard you say that you guys took share in prime from dealers. I was just wondering if
you could talk about how you expect the trajectory to be going forward in auto lending in terms of growth? Thank you.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: So let me go first. In terms of the [ph] PP&E (23:44) revisions, again these are primarily
changes in geography. So we would have approximately $240 million of incremental operating expense. If we had the
current standards prevail into this year with respect to how we were accounting for LIHTC, we would similarly have
$40 million that would stay in [ph] NACO (24:10) instead of moving up to operating expense. These are, again,
approximate numbers, that gets you to be around $200 million, which is why the guidance went up from $9.8 billion to
$10 billion. Again, that excludes extraordinary items and we're not defining that to the last decimal point.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Right. Sanjay, in the auto business, we continue to feel very good about the auto
business. We've wanted to make sure that our investors understood that the confluence of kind of once in a lifetime
events that led to extraordinary return opportunities and exceptional growth opportunities, that's regressing toward the
mean, but that's not to take away from the fact that we continue to feel good about the opportunities to be very
successful and earn well above hurdle rate returns in this business. The growth, basically I think the way to think about
the growth trajectory is, subprime is pretty flat these days and we continue to grow in the prime space and that's really
just further penetration of the dealers that we have very good relationships with. So it's kind of a natural to do this
growth and so despite the growing competition and of course, we see two players that are now out there with IPOs and
they're going to be intensely trying to generate growth. I think we feel pretty good about our position here. Of course,
the prime growth, as we get a mix change with more prime growth and more flattish on the subprime side that puts
additional kind of pressure on the overall average margin in addition to just what's happening competitively.

The other thing just to say on the Auto growth side is, we continue to keep a close watch on the underwriting practices
that are going on in the business. And I think it's pretty much the same story I've been saying the last few quarters.
There is a little slippage on some of the metrics, but overall still more slippage back toward the mean as opposed to
things that would cause us to really pull back.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question please.
Operator
We'll go next to Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Bill, check your line.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Hello. Can you hear me?
<A - Jeff Norris>: We can hear you, Bill.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Okay, great. Thank you. You guys had a healthy year-over-year purchase volume growth as did
some other issuers that have reported, but you, as did they, also saw non-interest income decreases in your card
segments? And I was wondering if you could talk to what's driving that? It would seem that there is a benefit from the
interchange revenues that would be kind of on the plus side, but maybe if you could talk about what else is going on,
that would be helpful?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. Bill, first of all, just purchase volume continues strong for Capital One. And we
think we're continuing to gain share overall in that space. With respect to non-interest income, there are a couple of
things going on. First of all, our own interchange growth in the quarter was basically flat despite the significant growth
in purchase volume and more importantly the significant growth in general purpose credit card purchase volume. And I
just want to point out there is a lot of volatility in that particular metric in any one quarter, but there is also a medium
term kind of sustaining phenomenon here where we're very committed to our rewards business and we are upgrading
rewards products for some of our existing rewards customers. And consistent I think, with the industry overall,
extending reward product to some existing customers who don't have rewards.
And so, near term, you will see some interchange cannibalization as we do this. This is very intentional and it's all part
of building a deeper customer franchise and all part of frankly our deep belief in the power of building relationships
through strong rewards business. The other thing is, the late fees were light in the quarter, reflecting the real strong
delinquency performance. And that's probably something that a number of other competitors would have seen as well.
But a little light on the interchange side and late fees, that's the flipside of the very good credit effect, are the
contributors to a little weakness on the non-interest income.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you so much, Rich. I was hoping I could ask one follow-up to Steve. I had a question on
your target 8% common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III. I was hoping that maybe you could discuss the extent to
which the severely adverse scenario under CCAR could become your binding constraint. I was just looking to get your
thoughts on whether those two ratios could produce different answers that could impact what you manage the business
to? And that's it. Thank you.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Well, that's a great question. Thankfully it's a long way off in the future for us. And
we've just had the first couple of banks exit parallel. And those banks, to my understanding, even in the 2015 CCAR,
they're not going to be tested assuming the Advanced Approaches apply. So, I don't think anybody can give you a
really good feel as to the intersection between CCAR and Advanced Approaches.
What I would tell you in terms of how we think about our capital side is, we start with an assessment of the proper
capital levels for our inherent risk. As you know, we've talked about companies used stress test for many years in
assessing how much capital we need. And we're also informed by relevant experience, we had hopefully the most
robust test we'll have for a while in the great recession. So, a lot of that is the grounding for the capital that we need but
moving away from the internal view.

There is still moving pieces. It's not just how Advanced Approaches gets into CCAR. I don't think CCAR is stable at
this point. And we haven't even entered parallel run. So, while there is significant uncertainty, we believe the 8% target
is right, and wouldn't communicate that to you if we thought it was totally inconsistent with the regulatory framework.
That's not a guarantee that 8% is the correct point estimate, but any other number at this point would be speculative.
And remember, our 8% number does include 100-basis-point cushion above regulatory minimums.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question please.
Operator
We'll go next to Brad Ball with Evercore.
<Q - Brad G. Ball>: Thanks. Could you talk about the card revenue margin? The compression this quarter was entirely
seasonality, or were there other factors and how do you feel about the revenue margin in the context of the growth that
you're talking about in the second half? Are you thinking around 17% would be still sustainable? And then just lastly
on credit, the delinquency improvement, I suppose, this quarter is what drove the reserve release. Is there still more
room for additional reserve releases going forward? What's your thought on credit broadly? Thank you.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay, Brad. On the revenue margin, yes, in terms of the first quarter, yeah, the revenue
margin for the quarter was 16.9% and that's down from 17.3% in the fourth quarter. And that decrease, you're right,
was primarily driven by normal seasonality of the revenue margin. And sort of putting the revenue margin into context,
in 2011 the revenue margin was around 17%, 2012 we added the HSBC portfolio and adjusting for purchase
accounting effects, the margin was also around 17%. In 2013, after adjusting for Best Buy held-for-sale impacts and the
deal related items, the revenue margin was also in the low 17% range. So the benefits from the removal of Best Buy's
low margin business were roughly offset by, what we call, franchise enhancements, basically moves that we're making
consistent with our very strong customer advocacy, things we're doing in the company.
And going forward, there're going to be many puts and takes on the revenue margin. There will always be some
franchise enhancement actions that we continue to take over time, but I think overall we believe, Brad, the margins will
remain healthy. We're not going to give a specific forecast about the revenue margin, but I think we believe it will
continue to be strong. And credit, yes, the delinquency is what drove the release. You've probably heard. We keep
saying quarter-over-quarter, it's hard to imagine things getting much better than this. And let's really enjoy it while
we're in this part of the cycle, I think we are struck by the strengths of the credit performance. We continue to see the
relatively low delinquency levels and the low roll rates. So, I don't think as we look at it that we're here to declare that
credit is going to get even better, but I think I would say this that the continued strong performance of all the credit
metrics reinforces our belief in the strength and continuation of a good credit performance that can help generate very
nice returns in the business.

<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Hi. Can you hear me? Sorry about that. So, I just had a couple of questions. And I apologize,
I got to the call a little later. But one question I have is, in terms of your liquidity coverage ratio requirements, where do
you stand on that? How far along do you think you are? And how should we think about the impact in net interest
margin as you try to make progress on the LCR?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Is that it?

<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Okay. So, well, let me start with LCR. Basically, we don't think there is going to be a
material financial impact. It's a little bit hard to be too definitive on the ultimate impact because we don't even have
final rules at this point. But I think on this investment rules change materially, we wouldn't see a real financial impact
from this. There is however the greater operational and governance burden that's primarily a function of having to
calculate this ratio on a daily basis and kind of when the industry needs to be able to do that certainly plays into the
operational challenges. But we'll be able to satisfy what currently, it seems like the bar you have to get over which is
the 80% LCR ratio requirement as of January 2015.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Okay, that's helpful. And just my follow-on question is on a different note. I think you
announced that you're going to cease working with some sort of providers like payday lenders and check cashers and
the like. And it'd be helpful just to get your sense or your perspective on that, why cease working with all of these
providers, why not just stop working with some of the ones who are less compliant or is the issue of trying to figure out
who is or isn't compliant with regulatory requirements? I'd just like to get your thought process as far as that goes.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yes, Sameer. We consistently review business plans across the company to – and our
customers individually and as groups to ensure that they're aligned with our strategic goals and our objectives on all
dimensions including regulatory compliance and everything. And we took a number of factors into consideration and
determined that the check cashing business and being bankers to check cashers no longer fits with our strategic
priorities. The financial impact of this exit is really not material. This business was the small part of the overall
enterprise.

We'll go next to Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: Good afternoon. I guess one question on the guidance, and then I have a follow up on auto.
Steve, you mentioned beyond the geography move, so setting aside all that, there were some modest upgrades to the
revenue expectations offset by your expenses? I wonder if you could just – what drove the upgrades to your revenue
expectations, any sense of magnitude and are the offsetting expenses more on the marketing side or the operating
expense side?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah, that's just down to – as you can probably anticipate the answer to this question,
down to a level of guidance and detail that we're not going to go to like last year. We provided guidance and as we
move through the year, we've really centered on pre-provision net revenue. This is a really dynamic business with a lot
of moving pieces. And as was true last year, we may get to the guidance that we laid out at the beginning of the year in
different ways. We've centered on pre-provision net revenue for a bunch of reasons, but it's obviously the foundation
for our ability to invest for future growth and to return capital to you. Adjusted for changes in geography, we are not
changing our guidance, which obviously excludes extraordinary items. And as Rich mentioned, we're leaving out the
credit story, which remains pretty strong as well.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: I appreciate that. And then on auto, I guess with the benefit of hindsight, I mean your
originations pulled back a lot in 4Q 2012 through 2Q 2013. This kind of reaccelerated in the second half of 2013, and
the various credit data that's out there for you and competitors suggest to the extent there was a problem within the first
half 2013 vintages and the second half 2013 vintages are improving or performing better. I wonder if you agree with
that, and if – what was it about the first half 2013, because it's not obvious when you look at [indiscernible] (41:01) or
terms across the industry, why kind of across the industry first half 2013 vintages seem little weaker and second half
2013 and first half 2014 seem to now be doing better?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, I'm not sure what you're referring to. I don't have our origination data right in front of
me, but I'm not sure what you're referring to about a pull back in 2012. My recollection to the following that the auto
business spiked early in the great recession. A lot of people exited. We pulled back to our really core dealer

relationships and then looked for the inflexion point. You may remember that, we've often articulated that some of the
best lending opportunities are actually in the throes of downturns when you pass kind of an inflexion point relating to
customer behavior and competitor supply and demand and sort of underwriting standards.
And so, really into, as I recall, was in 2009 and into 2010 that we really accelerated originations in the auto business
and we have continued very strong right through this point, all through this period believing this is kind of the best part
of the cycle and checking very carefully each vintage. As it's turned out, despite our inflexion point monitoring and our
belief that this was the best part of the cycle and the supply and demand were in a good place, the vintages have
actually outperformed in a good way our own expectations.
And so, certainly in hindsight, we feel very good about our acceleration. And I'm not aware of anything that would
characterize the vintages in the first half or second half of a particular year. Along the way with these vintages, there
has been some loosening of our very tight credit standards back to just tight if you will. And so, a couple of the
vintages have had expected higher risk, but overall this has been a continuous period of accelerating originations and
very strong credit performance.

We'll go next to Daniel Furtado with Jefferies.
<Q - Martin J. Kemnec>: Hi. Can you hear me?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yes.
<Q - Martin J. Kemnec>: Great. Hey, this is Martin Kemnec in for Dan Furtado today. Thanks for taking my
question. First, can you kind of help us think about sort of the impact that higher rates have on the transactor strategy,
and how you guys can maybe potentially look to offset some of the higher cost of carry there? I mean, does that
strategy become uneconomical with short rates pushing up at some point down the road? And just kind of maybe walk
us through what type of leverage you can pull either on the funding side or the rewards side.
And then secondly, Steve maybe for you, pretty impressive when we look at the recovery levels in the card book, at
least what we can see from kind of the master trust seems to be pushing higher in the early part of this year. Is that kind
of an organic effect as the economy improves, we're seeing a little bit better consumer spending numbers, things
picking up or is that sort of an inorganic effect from potentially selling those accounts and then booking a gain there,
maybe just an update on the dynamics you're seeing on recoveries and expectations for that going forward?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay, Martin. Let me take, first of all, your question about our transactor business and its
exposure to higher interest rates. We fund the expected lifetime balances for our transacting customers and we expense
rewards as they are earned. So as such, as rates rise, we feel very good about preserving the profitability and the
benefits for our existing customers. Additionally, we subject our investment decisions, as you can imagine, to
worsening conditions in the marketplace including higher interest rates. So, our products have a built-in resilience even
at a higher interest rate level. Of course, should rates rise enough, I think you get kind of to the point that and all
players would be pretty equally affected. I think the industry would probably react and the going forward product
structures would logically potentially adapt at that point. But in terms of the exposure to us, we've kind of lock-in as the
best we can sort of all the existing things and we build in a buffer. And then I think if there were an adaptation, it would
be an industry adaptation and we would react at that time.
With respect to recovery levels in the card business, I'll make just a general comment about the recovery levels. In
general, recovery dollars tend to come down somewhat at this stage of the cycle. It's kind of the math of a shrinking
inventory of fresh charge offs against which to recover. So, in general, recovery dollars have been coming down just
because recoveries are highest on fresh inventories. And the fresh inventories, the good news is, we haven't been
supplying our recoveries team with as much supply as they'd been used to. So that's a good thing.

It is also the case with respect to asset sales, I mean debt sales. We are probably the lowest or among the very lowest in
the industry in terms of the extent of debt sales. But those are sort of opportunistic decisions made based on pricing in
the marketplace and that can affect any particular quarter for some of the metrics as well.

We'll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kenneth M. Bruce>: Thanks. Good evening, gentlemen. My first question is, bigger picture, Rich, you've been a
long-term observer and Capital has been long-term participating in the revolving credit market in the U.S. in particular.
And I guess, looking at the market today in consumers, do you sense if there is a difference or a change in their
willingness to borrow. Obviously, we've seen very slow revolver growth generally speaking. There is obviously some
higher levels of debt still existing from the housing crisis. I wonder, how you're thinking about the longer term growth
prospects for revolving credit? And I have a follow-up.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yes. Ken, I think we all in this business have just been struck by for really a number of
years now, credit kind of comes in a little better than expected and growth is kind of hard to come by. And I think those
are the flipside of the same phenomenon, and it's really what you're identifying. The consumer is just being very
conservative. And in some ways, Ken, the very thing that sort of frustrates the economy from growing, which is
consumers aren't out spending enough, what are they doing with their money? Well, a lot of times they're paying down
debt and just being extra careful.
From a banking point of view, we should all be careful what we wish for here because the flipside of this growth
weakness on the borrowing side is a tremendous kind of strength on the credit side, and that has been powering a lot of
great performance for some of the banks over this period of time.
I do think though it's part of the macro trend in de-levering that frankly, the consumers and corporations have been
doing for a number of years. So it's hard to prognosticate, but we generally operate with an outlook that revolving debt
will probably be – growth of revolving debt will be pretty slow. You've seen student lending of course, growth has
been pretty electrifying over this period of time and we're not in the business. We've had a few cautions about that, but
certainly that has been up.
And we have been struck too by the strength of auto borrowing over this period of time. Solid borrowing and very good
credit performance, but I think overall what you're seeing is a consumer that has, I think, learned a lot through the great
recession and is cautious. And I think that our metrics are probably likely to reflect that for better and for worse.
<Q - Kenneth M. Bruce>: Okay. And then just as a follow up, obviously the revenue margin has benefited from very
low funding costs over the last few years, it's nice to not hear you speaking about 15% revenue margins anytime soon,
but I guess I'm interested in how you're thinking about defending those margins as rates rise, obviously funding costs
have been quite low. And I guess this discussion around whether those core deposits are going to be sticky at these
levels is really what I'm getting at if you can give us any thoughts around that that would be helpful?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: The business overall or for card specifically, because I think for the business overall, you
can look at our exposure to rising rates. And we actually feel pretty good about our asset sensitive position. And that's
going to occur to the benefit of our shareholders because we think obviously our assets are going to reprice a little bit
faster. So if it's more of a card specific question, we can deal with that, but I think overall, when you look at our
position, we compare I think pretty favorably to the peer group.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question please.

We'll go next to Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Scott J. Valentin>: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just the first question, I think someone
mentioned the pace of run-off in the mortgage book sort of accelerated from $4 billion to $5 billion this year. And just
wondering given what we've seen in the [ph] MD&A data (52:52), the slowing refinance activity, is there anything
specific to the portfolio that seems to be bucking the trend a little bit in terms of slowing prepayments?
And then the second question was regarding commercial bank deals, did it drop pretty sharply this quarter? Just
wondering if they'll continue to compress services in kind of a new level going forward.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: No. There is nothing specific on slight revision and increased mortgage run-off. It maybe
a little bit. I think you have to go back and look at when we provided the guidance and what rates were at that point
versus what rates are now. I think you'd probably find there is a better connection there between the run-off.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Hi, Scott. On commercial yields, if we take the year-over-year perspective, loan yields
decreased by 44 basis points due to a few factors. I think at the top of our list would be the increased competitive
pressure in the market, especially in the vanilla markets that have very, very large number of banks competing in it like
the C&I sort of generic businesses. We also have shifted more towards floating rate loans that has had an impact.
We've always had very high quality originations, but we've even shifted toward loans with even higher credit quality
and with a bit of a trade off with yields there.
And ultimately, in terms of how we make money, our spreads have not decreased by the same magnitude the loan
yields has. It was partly offset by lower funding costs. But overall, certainly the competitive environment is
contributing to that. Quarter-over-quarter, I don't think I'm going to go into details that we had this whole tax equivalent
yield, the kind of effect that makes a lot of noise. But competitively, in the C&I business spreads definitely continue to
compress. And there has been some weakening in the non-investment grade credit structures as well. So we're pretty
cautious in those spaces.
In commercial real estate, the spreads, we see pressure on pricing and limited pockets of weaker lending terms, but
that's largely in construction. I think banks are being a lot more disciplined in real estate. And also you have a big
difference between the C&I business and CRE business. In CRE, the CMBS channel has been largely sidelined while
of course, the CLO market is back to levels that are pretty close to 2007 levels. So that's putting extra pressure on the
C&I business. And again, our strategy is mostly focused on specialty lending which is affected by all of these trends,
but the margins are holding up better because of the more balanced supply and demand.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question please.

We will go next to Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Christopher R. Donat>: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. I just had one question on the comment
about higher rewards that are netted against interchanges. Is this reflecting the growth of the Quicksilver card and the
cash rewards or is it more of a mix with venture or just broader changes in customer behavior and use of rewards?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: It's really – it's several effects. So, first of all, we have our flagship venture in
Quicksilver products that have pretty rich rewards for the consumers and as a percentage of our whole book, those are
growing. Then you have our extension of the richer rewards to existing rewards customers. And then, you also have
extending rewards further to some customers who have not been rewards customers. So all of those contribute to this
gap between purchase volume growth and interchange growth. And in the this sort of transitionary period, where some
of these penetration effects are more noticeable, and I flag that only because we're in sort of one of those kind of
periods, but it's the flip side of our real belief and the power of this business model and in many ways the success of our
rewards business.

We will take our last question for the evening from Matt Burnell.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good evening, gentlemen. Just I guess a question on the income statement, it looks like
professional services costs were down pretty visibly quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. I wonder if that has to do
with CCAR preparation or if there is some other factor driving that, and how we should think about that number going
forward?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: I wouldn't over read anything or seasonal impacts in that, the CCAR if anything would
be a small portion of it, and it's obviously incorporated into our overall guidance for the year.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And just not to get too deep into the weeds, but commercial real estate growth
continues to be high-teens, 20% year-over-year. And I guess, I'm just curious, Rich, I understand your commentary
about remaining very cautious or diligent in terms of your underwriting, but there are some markets in the Southeast,
and particularly D.C. that have been flagged as being relatively aggressive. And I guess, I'm just curious if you're
seeing the same trends in those markets, and how aggressive the competition has gotten in those markets for
commercial real estate?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, again I would say my overall observation from the markets, the blended kind of
observation from the markets we're in, is that commercial real estate is quite a bit tamer than the C&I business. And I
think, it's really just frankly the flipside and the fact that C&I performed so well in the last downturn and is available to
so many banks that you have sort of a lot of folks rushing in there. And then you have the CLO impact, the growing
CLO impact as well. So, that's the area I'd flag as the biggest concern we have. On the commercial real estate side,
again I think in most places people are licking their wounds, and there is generally we see behavior that is more careful,
but that varies by markets. We don't do commercial real estate in the Southeast. So, I really don't have an observation
on that.
We're relatively small players in D.C., but I guess – and more than half of our – the majority of our commercial real
estate in fact is in New York City that has a lot of strong market dynamics going on right now. And generally, the
behavior is not too irrational, but beyond sort of this qualitative descriptions, I mean we've spent a lot of time looking at
key metrics, and what's happening to those key metrics. And when we look at LTV, debt service coverage ratio, and
debt yield in commercial real estate, we see things that are well within the guard rails we would look at. And frankly, I
think we're still pretty comfortable with how we see those metrics moving in the marketplace, at least with respect to
the loans we're originating.
