MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is
scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications.
Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli
Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our
2013 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.
During our call, we will be talking about results for the third quarter 2013 and comparing them to the same period in
2012, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are
the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding
acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies income, or OCI, is defined as operating income
before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles.
You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment,
exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as
reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures, at the end of this presentation, which is also posted on our website.

Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the
forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the
various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.
It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jacek Olczak
Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
As anticipated, we achieved improved financial results in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year, despite
the persistent severe macroeconomic challenges and their extraordinary impact on industry volume. Adjusted diluted
EPS, excluding currency, increased by 10.9% in the quarter.
A key driver of our performance has been the strength of our brand portfolio, despite its strong premium skew in a
weak economy. We have strong market share momentum in the majority of our main markets with the key exception of
Japan and the Philippines, where the issues are known. In the quarter, our market share increased in the EU, EEMA and
Latin America and Canada regions, while the international share of Marlboro, excluding China and the Philippines,
increased to 9.3%. Our quarterly share in Asia was impacted by the timing of our shipments in
Pakistan, as well as the share losses in the Philippines. On a year-to-date September basis, our international share,
excluding China and the Philippines, is stable at 26.7%.
The second key driver has been pricing. During the third quarter, we achieved a pricing variance of $488 million,
bringing our total pricing variance for 2013 to over $1.5 billion. This compares favorably to the $1.3 billion achieved
during the same period in 2012 and significantly more than offset the $900 million in unfavorable volume/mix.
In addition to the substantial amount of pricing taken at the beginning of the year, we have increased prices in a number
of markets since May. These include Argentina, Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Spain and
Ukraine. Strong pricing, coupled with the timing of certain cost items, enabled us to increase our adjusted OCI margin
ex-currency between the first half and the third quarter of this year from 45.2% to 47.5% behind a strong expansion in
the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions.
We anticipate a strong fourth quarter. The adjustment to our reported diluted 2013 earnings per share guidance today
reflects the impact of changes in exchange rates, an estimated fourth quarter charge for restructuring and a cautious
outlook regarding certain markets.
In July, we forecast a reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 of $5.43 to $5.53. Today's guidance includes an
additional $0.02 in unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates for a total of $0.33 per share for the full year. It
also includes approximately $0.03 per share for a fourth quarter charge related to the restructuring program that we
announced at the end of last month, and the $0.01 charge related to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which
we reported in the first quarter of 2013.
Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 is now $5.35 to $5.40. Excluding currency and the aforementioned
charges, this represents a growth rate of approximately 10%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22 in 2012.
Let me now review a number of our key geographies, starting with the EU region.
While unemployment continued to rise throughout 2012 in the 28 EU member states, it has remained stable this year at
an average rate of a 10.9%. However, unemployment has continued to increase notably in France and Italy.
Despite the continued weak macroeconomic environment, the rate of decline in cigarette industry volume has gradually
moderated throughout the year. After a decline of 10.6% and 8% respectively in the first and second quarters, cigarette
industry volume in the EU region declined by 5.4% in the third quarter, helped by the reduction in the excise tax
differential between cigarettes and fine cut in several Southern European countries and stabilization in the prevalence

of illicit trade, albeit at a high level.
For the full year, we are still expecting total cigarette industry volume to be down between 7% and 8%, while fine cut
industry volume should be up slightly. Going forward, we expect market declines to remain above historical levels until
European governments successfully tackle the issue of unemployment and illicit trade, and consumer sentiment and
purchasing power improve.
Our business fundamentals remain strong across the EU region. We have gained share so far this year in all of the six
largest cigarette markets in the region, namely France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the U.K. In addition, we have
successfully leveraged our cigarette brands in the fine cut category, gaining one share point year-to-date September on
a regional basis to reach 14.4%. While our OCI, excluding currency, remained below last year's level through
September, it increased by 5.4% in the third quarter and we expect an improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter.
Our four key brands: Marlboro, L&M, Chesterfield and Philip Morris, continue to perform well. They all gained
cigarette market share in the EU region in the third quarter. During the quarter, the share of Marlboro was higher
notably in Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain, a remarkable result in view of the
economy, while L&M was the fastest-growing brand in the region as a whole in terms of market share.
I will complete my overview of the EU region with an update on the status of the Tobacco Products Directive, or TPD.
The European Parliament debated the proposal last week and accepted several amendments. The Parliament notably
agreed to a 65% health warning rather than proposed 75%; that flavored cigarettes, including menthol variants, should
be prohibited after a transition period of five years following the transposition of the TPD; that slim cigarettes should
continue to be allowed; and that e-cigarettes would not be treated as medical devices but rather be more strictly
regulated under the TPD with higher nicotine thresholds than originally foreseen.
We welcome these marginal improvements, but regret that the European Parliament voted to ban an entire segment of
the legal market, despite the inevitable increase in illicit trade that this will fuel. They have failed to provide a
comprehensive framework for reduced harm products and have continued to include oversized health warnings without
any apparent concern for property rights that the EU charter protects and restrictions on pack formats.
Finally, the proposal still contains an unworkable and discriminatory anti-illicit trade solution, which adds complexity
to the legitimate supply chain without addressing the core problem.
The next step is for the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to reach a final
consensus. While the timing remains uncertain, the TPD is expected to be adopted before the end of this year or during
the first quarter of 2014. There will then be a period of 18 to 24 months for the directive to be transposed into national
legislation at the member state level, so that it may become effective across the EU by the end of 2015.
Let me now turn to the two key EEMA markets, starting with Russia. We implemented an additional price increase of 4
rubles per pack during the June-July period on most of our brands, thus enhancing unit margins. Due to the higher
prices, a deteriorating economic environment and the implementation in June of workplace smoking restriction, there
was an acceleration in the rate of cigarette industry volume decline in the third quarter to an estimated 9%, mainly
impacting the super-low segment. For the full year, we expect industry volume to be down by about 7% to 8%.
Our market share performance continues to be resilient, in spite of competitors again lagging our price increases this
year. Our August year-to-date market share was 26.1%, down by 0.1 share point, with Parliament, in particular,
performing very well in the above premium price segment. Despite the lower volume, our strong pricing enabled us to
increase our profitability ex-currency at a double-digit rate in the third quarter.
In September, the Russian Duma approved the excise tax rates on cigarettes for the period 2014 through 2016. In line
with expectations, the ad valorem rate will increase from 8% to 8.5% next January, while the specific excise tax will
increase from 550 rubles to 800 rubles per 1,000 cigarettes. The pass-on for Marlboro would be around 8 rubles per
pack, or approximately 11%. The increase in the specific excise tax is 45% in 2014, while the increases in 2015 and
2016 are slated to be 20% to 25%.

In Turkey, cigarette industry volume declined by an estimated 5% in the third quarter. Illicit trade declined only
marginally from the second quarter. For the full year, we are forecasting an industry volume decline of around 7% to
8%.
Our business fundamentals remain strong with sequential volume improvement. Our market share was up by 0.1 point
in the quarter through August to 46.1%, with further gains from premium Parliament and a mid-price Muratti. Both
Lark and L&M suffered some share erosions at the 6.50 lira per pack price due to the rapid emergence of a 6 lira and
below per pack segment. This was partly offset by our successful launch of Chesterfield at 6 lira. The brand achieved a
1.2% market share in August, just three months after its introduction.
Finally, Asia, where I will start with the Philippines. Tax paid industry volume in the third quarter declined at the rate
of 6.7% to 23 billion units, and this is in line with the second quarter trend and the significant improvement over the
first quarter decline rate of nearly 40%. However, Nielsen consumer off-take, adult smoking incidence and adult daily
consumption data indicate that cigarette consumption is essentially stable, while down-trading has been significant.
The difference can be explained by the huge under-declaration by our main local competitor. While it increased its
tax-declared volume from an average of 500 million units per month in the first quarter to 1.1 billion units in the second
quarter and 1.4 billion units in August, we estimate that this represented less than half of the volume it sold during this
period.
The retail price of its main brand, Mighty, has remained at 1 peso per cigarette. This is an economically unsustainable
level when paying full taxes. We continue to work with the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs and
other government authorities to address this issue.
During the third quarter, we started to reduce our pricing support behind Fortune and especially our lowest-priced
brands. As a result, our monthly volume declined and our share of the tax-paid market dropped from 82.5% in the
second quarter to 77.2% in the third quarter. We will continue to tactically balance the volume and profitability
equation, but until the authorities address the issue decisively, the Philippines will remain a significant challenge.
Let me now turn to Japan where the cigarette industry volume was down by just over 1% in the third quarter and
remains on track to decline by about 2% for the full year. We have two key objectives in Japan: to reinforce our
leadership in the growing menthol segment and to improve our performance in the larger non-menthol segment. To
address the latter, we launched a new smoother-tasting Marlboro Clear in three variants in September. It was to widen
the appeal of the brand to mainstream non-menthol adult smokers and improve Marlboro's relatively small 6.2% share
of this segment, which still accounted for 73.7% of the total market year-to-date September.
Our market share decreased by one point in the third quarter to 26.5%, reflecting the impact of competitors' launches in
the second quarter on Marlboro's menthol segment share and continued out-switching from the more traditional Lark
and Philip Morris non-menthol variants. Marlboro's market share of 12.2% was, however, in line with the previous
quarter, helped by the launch of Marlboro Clear. This new initiative and our pipeline of consumer-relevant innovative
offers should enable us to gradually stabilize our market share in Japan. Our optimism is backed by the gradual
reduction in the quarter-to-quarter share decline during the year and positive preliminary adult consumer off-take data
for September.
Earlier this month, the Japanese government confirmed its intention to raise the consumption tax from 5% to 8% next
April. The pass-on for Marlboro would be about ¥14 per pack, but keep in mind that any price increase in Japan
requires approval from the Ministry of Finance.
Let me now turn to Indonesia, where the economic slowdown and the increase in the cost of basic foods and fuel
impacted the cigarette industry, which grew by just 0.3% during the third quarter. As a result, we are now expecting
full year industry volume growth to be about 2%. The pressure on consumer purchasing power has been most acute
among the lower income strata, resulting in a 7.6% quarterly decline in cigarette volume in the low-price segment,
while the premium and mid-price segments, where PMI is strongest, grew by 3.5% and 1.4% respectively.

This development, along with the growing adult consumer preference for machine-made kreteks, has enabled us to
continue to grow share. Sampoerna A and a U Mild gained 0.6 points and 0.9 points respectively in the quarter. In
addition, Marlboro has strong momentum. It gained 0.5 point to reach a quarterly share of 5.4%. Meanwhile, Dji Sam
Soe has lost share since it became the first major brand to move above the 1,000 rupiah per stick price point, ahead of
competitive brands.
We have continued to increase prices on a regular basis and have now fully offset the impact of the January excise tax
increase as well as higher clove costs.
Effective October 1, the government enacted an amended regulation that addresses the loophole whereby large
manufacturers could spread their production volume across sister companies and benefit from lower excise tax rates.
This will affect around 2% of our volume, while the impact will be much more significant for several of our
competitors. We await the government's decision as to whether the regular annual excise tax increase will be eliminated
in 2014, or at least moderated, to take into account the anticipated imposition of a new regional tax of 10%.
Let me also say a few words about the exciting business development projects that we have recently completed. The
purchase of the remaining 20% interest in our Mexican affiliate for $703 million closed in the third quarter. This is a
profitable 34 billion unit cigarette market, in which we achieved a 72.8% market share through September this year.
Marlboro had a 51.7% share over the same period, one of the highest in the world. The acquisition is projected to be
marginally accretive as of the fourth quarter this year.
The second deal that closed during the third quarter was the acquisition of a 49% stake in Arab Investors-TA for $625
million. Algeria is a profitable 30 billion unit cigarette market in which we achieve an estimated 40% share this year
through September driven by Marlboro. This investment significantly enhances our prospect in this important North
African market. The agreement also opens the door to additional business opportunities in certain other North African
and Middle Eastern markets such as Egypt. The acquisition is projected to be accretive as of 2014.
Our free cash flow was up by 45.5% excluding currency in the third quarter, due mainly to a reduction in working
capital and higher net earnings. In September this year, our board approved a 10.6% increase in our quarterly dividend,
which now stands at $3.76 per share on an annualized basis. It has more than doubled since $1.84 rate at the time of the
spin. Our target dividend payout ratio remains 65%. This reflects our strong confidence in our business fundamentals
and future prospect. Our dividend yield is currently around 4.4%.
We spent a further $1.5 billion on share repurchases in the third quarter and expect a similar level of expenditures in the
fourth quarter. By year end, we will have spent about half of the $18 billion three-year program that was authorized by
the board in August 2012. Since the spin through this September, we have repurchased 539 million shares representing
approximately 26% of our shares outstanding at that time at an average price of $60.02 per share. During this time, we
have been able to sustain our very solid balance sheet and remain committed to maintain our single A credit rating.
In conclusion, our business fundamentals are solid and our commitment to reward our shareholders remains steadfast.
Despite persistently difficult macroeconomic conditions, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations and
we anticipate a strong fourth quarter. We have updated our guidance to reflect prevailing exchange rates and the fourth
quarter restructuring charge as well as a cautious outlook regarding certain markets. Our 2013 reported diluted EPS
guidance is $5.35 to $5.40 and represents a full year growth rate of approximately 10% excluding currency and charges
compared to our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22.
Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions.

<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So I guess, Jacek, first question is just looking at the Asia region. And I think at the corporate
level, the pricing variance was very strong, but within Asia, I think sequentially, the pricing variance actually
decelerated. So I'm wondering if you can just give us some perspective how much pricing you've taken in Indonesia?
What was the timing of that? And then how much of that was offset by the Philippine lowering of the price? And how
we should think about that in the fourth quarter? Is this something that will continue to drag down the fourth quarter?
Or is the timing of the Indonesia pricing such that pricing actually accelerates in the fourth quarter? And does that help
your margins in Asia?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Maybe I'll just start with the margins in Asia to give you some color. Asia, if I were to exclude
Philippines, Asia margin for the quarter essentially would be flat. So the Philippines is driving the margin performance
in Asia in the quarter. Pricing-wise, I mean, Indonesia is going as per plan. As you know, we have a regular, pretty
often I should say, price increases there. And as we said on the second quarter call, around this time of the year, we
should offset the impact of excise tax and the clove prices. So Indonesia now is in a positive territory when it comes to
margin improvement. It should remain like this for the remaining fourth quarter.
One thing which we have to remember which we don't have in Asia is the lack of pricing in Japan, right? So that's
something which just appears from time to time.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just following up on Indonesia, can you just give us your thoughts on the
likelihood of the new excise tax going in, in Indonesia next year? And then just in light of the magnitude of the
potential excise tax increase if all of that goes through next year, how you're thinking about kind of the volume outlook
as we go into 2014 and your ability to pass on the pricing in Indonesia?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean the pricing, Indonesia remains strong for this year and the previous years, so despite
the tax increases and also the pressure on the input costs. So I mean I don't see today anything on the horizon which
would put a question mark on our ability to price in Indonesia. Pricing remains strong in Indonesia.
What we know at this stage is that there will be a local tax of a 10% increase to the current rate. And that the question
is whether the international government will try to put something on the top of that and then what magnitude. I think at
this stage, I think it's more of the speculation. I mean we'll know for sure what is the tax for Indonesia by the end of
November. That's it on the pricing in Indonesia.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then last question, Jacek, just looking at the volume decline, obviously, in EEMA
and Russia, Ukraine. First, just in terms of the outlook for those markets, you've kind of given the rest of this year, but
is this illicit trade situation really a problem that we think will continue to impact as we get into 2014? And then I think
there's been some chatter about the government potentially looking at reversing the excise tax increases or their plans to
reverse the excise tax increases in Russia given the illicit trade ramp-up. So I'm just wondering if you have any
thoughts on that prospect.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: In the relative terms, there is more of the issue of illicit trade in Ukraine than in Russia. In
Russia, we start observing some incidents, I think, of about 3% as of second quarter in Russia. I think it stays about that
level. Actually, I think very recently Prime Minister Medvedev gave an interview in which he hint that maybe they
should look into the tax rates, lower the tax rate in the three-year plan.
For the time being what we know is that the tax will – the specific component and a little bit of ad valorem will go up
in January next year. It will create a pass-on, or force the pass-on on Marlboro of, I think, about 8 rubles. And then if
you follow the three-year plan, i.e., remaining two-year, the pass-on should be 5 rubles and 8 rubles, so 5 rubles in
2015 and 8 rubles in 2016.
So for me, it's not maybe it's pretty much a speculation today, but I think they more refers to the tax increase in the last
year of the three-year plan than on the third year of the plan. It is very welcome by us. I mean Russian government

starts watching how they prices compare to surrounding countries, which we know also plays a factor in any incentive,
if you like, to illicit trade. So as long as the Russian government is on alert and they try to think practically, I mean we
very much welcome this development.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, David.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Couple of questions. First of all, Jacek, what's the prospect that in China managed the
business in what's clearly a difficult macro and difficult volume environment that you feel that in retrospect six months
from now, nine months from now, that you haven't done either sufficient marketing in certain of the markets or that
maybe that you, in retrospect, will have pushed pricing a bit too hard?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, my spend behind the brands is, for the total year, my spend will be above the last year's
level. I mean I know that we have some comps, various comp issues this year. I mean that's quarters-on-quarters but for
the full year, we actually will invest more than the last year. And as you see also from our brand portfolio perspective, I
mean that the brands wouldn't grow market share if they would be lacking any investments. So I think we're doing the
right job. It's the deployment, it's the commercial organization, the number of innovations which we're bringing behind
the Marlboro and all other brands.
The brand portfolio in terms of the equity, the health of the brands, I think might be our strongest year we've ever had
since the spin of the how portfolio performs. Now, you mentioned the macros, which we had. They are macros in a
country, they are not macros on a global basis. So we need to start looking into this a little bit more selectively,
because, yes, there is a bit of accelerations in Russia for the known reasons. Yet we have a major challenge in
Philippines. But we also have the markets, frankly speaking, where the total industry volumes are growing and there is
up-trading. So I would be very careful how we talk about the thing. The macro does not necessarily mean global.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. Second question, Jacek, presumably your budgeting's not done for next year. You
don't know all of the excise tax increases that you would necessarily face. And I'm not asking for a specific prediction.
But broadly speaking, what's your confidence level today looking out to next year that the company can deliver
financial results that are consistent with the mid to long-term plans that you have?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: David, it's pretty challenging this year as many have noticed. With our guidance today, we said
that we're going to deliver approximately 10% growth. And we have a number of challenges this year. Some of them
may fade out. Some of these may continue next year. I think when I feel strong, when I feel confident is the number of
the quarters which we demonstrated that our brands are very strong including Marlboro despite the adverse
macroeconomic in some countries especially European Union.
Pricing power, I mean you've seen our pricing power for the first three quarters of this year. It's $1.5 billion. I mean
that's very strong and that remains and I don't see anything on the horizon which could challenge this one. I think the
tax structure is playing into our hand. And frankly speaking, at this stage, we are not aware, we don't hear that there is
any attempt to have a disruptive tax increase in the near future. So there are a number of factors which plays into our
hand.
Total markets [ph] sub price (32:11) driven by various factors in some geographies may continue through the 2014. I
mean this we'll have to see. I mean you noticed that EU is getting sequentially better and better. But I don't see
underlying data which would give me more optimism. I am referring to unemployment, right, because unemployment
is flat like a pancake since January this year although the industry volumes development is encouraging. But I think I
need another quarter or so and then we'll be more confident to say more firmly how do we expect our performance

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Vivien.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: I wanted to touch on price elasticities globally given some of the guide-downs that you've
seen across some of your major markets and Indonesia really comes to mind. I'm curious, I appreciate that inflation is
becoming a bigger and bigger issue, but have you noticed a deterioration in your price elasticities as well?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. I think on a global basis, the elasticities are between minus 0.3 to minus 0.5. And in some
countries, you will see the higher elasticities, but they are driven by the fact that the consumer's disposable income is
on a negative side, right? So in real terms, our price increases might trigger the higher elasticities. I think Italy, Spain, a
couple of the Southern European countries they are today in a heightened elasticity levels just because there was an
erosion on the disposable income. Indonesia, as you referred to, I don't think the elasticities would be fairly in the range
which I gave at the beginning.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: So for Indonesia, it's the third guide-down in terms of your outlook for volume growth in
that market in roughly four months. So in your mind then, it's strictly that inflation has just gotten that much worse that
quickly?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you, Vivien. The difference was this inflation. There had been inflation and the food
inflation. And I think the food inflation impacts more in relative terms some of the consumer groups. Therefore, we see
the volumes in the lower part of the market actually declining and the volumes in the mid and the premium segment
going up to make the total market growing. So I think you will have different elasticities, depends again on the
disposable income of consumer. I think the underlying rate for Indonesia, the growth rate for Indonesia, it must be
somewhere in the range of 2%, maybe above 2%. I mean this you will – you have it from the demographics and some
positive GDP per capita to develop.

<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Good morning. So I just have a couple questions for you. I wanted to ask first about the
Philippines and it sounds like there has been some sequential improvement in tax collection there. You gave some
numbers on that, which is great. And so just if you have any color on that and basically what's going on in the low end
of the market? My kind of follow-on question to that would be the tax increase, because there's a tax increase in the
Philippines next year as well. It's more heavily focused on the low end. Is it going to take something like that to help
move those low-end prices up? Or is there enough the government can do in the short run to get more tax collection

among these low price brands?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, yes. That's true that there is an increased sequential tax collection. But the issue in
Philippines is not about their collecting more taxes, but collecting the right amount of taxes. So that somebody is
paying more, but is still under declaring, frankly speaking [ph] doesn't help (36:15) so the same sort of tax evasion, or
cheating, or whatever is the appropriate word for the situation. Now, there is a tax increase next year. I think partially
also why we are now moving with the prices up is to – when we're sitting on the lower prices at the bottom of the
market and waiting for the government to take some actions there, the government was immune by the fact that I was
paying taxes on a lower price portfolio while my competitor was not paying. So I think that partially us going with the
prices are bringing the government into the play, because somebody is going to also suffer by not collecting the taxes.
So we see how does this unfold. I mean the Philippines remains challenging, but situations might change in Philippines
if government is really decisive and if law enforcement, tax enforcement authorities are decisive, they can fix the
problem in a month.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Yeah. Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: But we have to wait for that one.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And I had just one more question for you, just sort of a broad question. You had
several investments in several key markets that started last year. You've now lapped a lot of those investments. I guess
as we see softer volumes, is that an indication that the investments weren't enough that maybe to invest some more? I'm
just trying to look ahead and think about what you can do to help stem some of the declines in volume? Is it something
you can do from an investment standpoint? Or is it more about the total market decline?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, as I would see the softening of my market shares or market share declines, I think would be
indicators for me that I am underinvested with regards to the support. I mean my investment, marketing, sales,
investment, et cetera, I mean I cannot mitigate the impacts of the total market declines especially that in some
countries, I am competing with illicit products. So I mean that's not a function of the marketing investment to offset
that. As I said at the earlier question, I think this year we're going to spend more than last year, is different phasing in
the quarters. But the market share advancement of all of our brands or most of our brands including Marlboro in a
number of the geographies, I mean is just the best testimony that we're doing the right things and we're supporting the
brands in the right way.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you for your answers there.

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: I guess I am still trying to understand how realistic your 10% EPS guidance is given what
this implies for volume growth in Q4. In other words, I think your volume growth needs to be positive in the quarter
with pretty strong pricing to get close to your revised 10% EPS guidance. So how realistic is it for you to generate
positive volume growth? And then I guess what gives you the confidence that this is achievable?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, the total PMI volume outlook for this year is about in a range which we have now for the
nine months. So I think it's about 3% ex-Philippines. That's about our volume outlook. Pricing will continue as you'll
see quarter after quarter, we're delivering strong pricing. There were some prices which were into some places where
we implemented pricing in the third quarter so that will have a full benefit in the fourth quarter. Plus as we said earlier
at the Q2 call, we'll have some better comps on the cost side. So I feel very confident that we will deliver the fourth

quarter. Although we're fully aware that the fourth quarter growth rate will be significantly higher than what we had
demonstrated in the third quarter. But this is all going as per plan. As you remember how we started from the beginning
of the year was that we'll have a low start of the year and in the second part of the third and the fourth quarter, this is
where we expected to deliver the growth for the full year.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: So everything's falling in line relative to your expectation?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. And then I guess just my final question, Jacek, is the EU directive decided not to ban
e-cigs as medicines. So I'm curious how does this change your thinking on the category and your timing for entering if
at all?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean, you know our plan, right...
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Yes.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: ...that we said that we're working on three platforms and we showed that that we aim at the 2016
to 2017 for the full commercialization. I think we stay on track with this one. What we're missing in the directive is a
little bit more time spent by the legislator and trying to figure out what the framework legislation should be for
admitting new product being e-cigarettes or other new generation products, modified-risk tobacco products into the
market. A lot of focus was spent on some other elements which I don't think addressing really the public health
concerns which the directive was supposed to address and that the whole novel product territories are not fully
addressed. But, yes, I mean it's a good development that the e-cigarette will be in the Tobacco Products Directive rather
than under the pharma legislation. We will see.
For obvious reasons, I can't talk where we would enter the market and how we could accelerate our entrance to the
market. But we're very excited about this category working on our plan and we're making the progress in accordance
with the critical path delivering the critical status researching the consumers and building our capacity to be on time, if
everything goes okay, maybe ahead of time with the products in the market.

Your next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster with UBS.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Morning, gentlemen. I've got a few questions, actually. On Indonesia, the market volume
growth sort of 2% for the full year seems to imply, yeah, sort of 3% to 4% in the last quarter. I mean is there any reason
that the Indonesian volumes should improve quite rapidly in the fourth quarter after a relatively weak sort of third
quarter?
And secondly, Italy was quite a major market, volumes down 4% in the third quarter; a significant improvement on
what we have seen in the past. Is there some particular factor behind that? And do you expect that to be sustained?
With the recent sort of VAT increases, is that likely to deteriorate again?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay. I'd maybe start with Italy. I mean Italy as we've said, has had some improvements in the
decline rate over the total industry volumes. I think what we observe also in Italy is a little bit less of illicit products and
I think this also partially must have contributed to the better results in the quarter. We'll have to see how the lower
incidence of illicit product versus the beginning of the year as you remember, I think they had a spike to 11%, this
lower illicit incidence. I don't know how long it's going stay.
So that may support the volumes. And I mean the VAT increase I mean is another sort of a government trying to
impose some extra taxes and hoping for the better consumption. So that's a little bit – that's not very welcome but let's

see how does it unfolds in Italy.
In Indonesia, I think there is some seasonality also behind the quarters. And I think this is what drive us to believe that
Indonesia will deliver on or above the 2 % for fiscal year. And we are aware that this calls for the better or stronger
volume performance in the fourth quarter of this year.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Thanks. Secondly, just going back to the Philippines, so you lowered prices. I'm just
trying to get the timeline right. So you lowered prices in Q2 and then what sort of period in Q3 did you actually sort of
increase them again?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We lowered prices. Actually, we start lowering the prices at the end of Q1. We were in full
fledge into Q2. And I think towards the end of the Q3, we start moving the prices up.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: So does that mean in the end of Q3 you started raising them? So in fact, the price
reductions really didn't help at all in terms of market share?

Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: I saw that German courts have banned the use of the Don't Be a Maybe campaign in Germany.
How does that impact your business?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: They banned some executional aspects of that campaign without considering available to us legal
remedies how we're going to go forward because we're pretty confident that we have not violated any local legislation.
The other forms of the marketing or support to the brand which we can continue delivering there because they're just
questioning some aspects of that campaign. So I don't think we should have any negative impact of a suspension of
these executional elements of this campaign.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Any concerns that other European courts will pick up the same line of argument?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean Germany is one of the few, if not the only one country in the EU which still allows
you a billboard campaigns, right? So they were questioning the billboards and some I think cinema commercials. In
most of the other European countries, the campaign is being delivered to consumers more for the one-to-one and other
means. So, no, I don't think it will have any repercussion in the remaining European countries.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. And then I have also seen reports out of Australia that convenience stores are now
reporting an increase in illicit trade after the plain packaging and all that went into effect at the beginning of the year.
Are you seeing the same thing?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We're seeing the same thing. I don't have hard data but early information which we received from
our affiliates in Australia indicated there was about – illicit trade has about doubled versus what it used to be before the
implementation of plain pack. So there was something on the illicit trade but not extremely surprised by this because
we thought that the plain pack might facilitate the illicit trade. So unfortunately, this is happening.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Do you think that the fact that the data is now starting to come out makes legal challenges easier?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: What? Sorry, the data I think on the illicit trade will come out soon. Once this data is out to
confirm the speculations, I mean when it comes to our claim under the BAT in Hong Kong I mean we are progressing
there as per the calendar. But, yes, I mean certain of elements which we have been raising with the government before
that the plain packaging is not addressing consumption, frankly speaking. If we look at the total volume developments

in Australia, you don't see any declines in the total volumes. Yes, you have heightened appearance of illicit trade. And I

be the impact of the plain packaging.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Hello. Just back on Indonesia for a second, obviously, the inflationary pressures are
some of what's slowing category growth. But it also was the easiest comp of the year in the third quarter. What did it
look like sequentially? Was there improvement coming out of the quarter? I guess I want to understand a little better
where the strength would come in 4Q, because that was one of the toughest comps last year as well.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, usually, I think the fourth quarter in Indonesia was the strong quarter. So that's what I was
referring that there was some seasonality impact, et cetera, which you have in Indonesia. So therefore, yes, we expect a
stronger quarter this year. As I said earlier, I don't think that the growth rate of the industry in the third quarter is the
underlying growth rate of the industry, right? I think the underlying growth rate is closer to 2%, above 2%. So, yes, you
will have fluctuations between a quarter.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: No, I understand that. I guess but the two things I am trying to get at is if there is
seasonality, but it's a stronger growth rate in the fourth quarter, does that get more and more exaggerated every year?
And then just back to the third quarter, do you have any visibility on what the progression was throughout the quarter?
Was it, say, down in July and then flat in August and up whatever percent in September? That you can see the
consumer adjusting to the inflation pressure? That some of that momentum should continue into 4Q?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean the consumers are adjusting to the inflation pressures. As I just said earlier, I mean
that you have a different rate – sorry, different impact by consumer income classes, okay? So I think there was second
spike in a food inflation this year, one was at the beginning of the year, one was in the third quarter. Well, this has an
impact on the consumption levels in the lower price classes. Presumably more on the daily consumptions than smoking
incidence but this is what we observe. So there will be adjustment in the consumer pattern. So that's on the volume
side. This was all happening.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay. And then just on Japan for a moment, you reminded us that the Ministry of
Finance needs to approve any of the price increases, which is of course true. Are you worried about getting that
approved at all? Or was that just stating that to kind of highlight the procedures involved?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. I mean the role in Japan is if you want to change the prices, you have to seek the approval of
the Ministry of Finance. So that's going to stay. There's also some Prime Minister and others have publicly I think
before when the discussion was about the sales tax, they've been talking about the fact that they wouldn't like
necessarily to spike inflation by having the sales tax increase. But we'll have to see. We have not filed for the price
registrations in Japan. And there is still a time before the sales tax is implemented.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay. Thanks. And then I just want to make sure I have one clarification earlier in the
call, I believe you said you expect profitability improvement in 4Q. Was that versus 3Q 2013 or versus 4Q 2012?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I was referring to the growth rate of the EPS ex-currency in the fourth quarter over fourth
quarter.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay. Okay. And then just lastly, following up on e-cigarettes, I understand you have
your next-generation products that you're developing and the EU TPD doesn't really directly involve any of that, I don't
believe. But just in terms of e-cigarettes and then having what seems like maybe a little bit more of a regulatory green
light, at what point do you consider that a threat enough, if those keep growing, that you would want to maybe get
involved in something on an earlier timeline than your NGPs with something like an e-cigarette? Is that a launch you

would consider? Obviously, you've got the U.S. market where the Big 3 are getting involved and Lorillard is coming to
the U.K. Do you think that's a place that you want to play? Or are you content to just wait for the next-generation
products that you have coming?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I said we're very closely watching the developments in the category. I think between the reasons
why we said earlier that we're working on the three platforms and one of the platforms is essentially in the territory of
e-cigarette is that we believe there will be a reason, there will be a market for all three platforms. The question still
remains and if you look at the performance of e-cigarettes category, a lot of attention is more on the marketing side
than just to our knowledge that attention is on the product side. So I think what is extremely important is in our element
of strategy is to get the product right. So I don't think – I said it on a number of occasions, it's not that you need to be
first to the market. You need to go to the market with the right product.

Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Hello. I was hoping you could comment on Russia, in particular, and why the premium
shipment volume was down so severely in the third quarter with Marlboro in particular down 17%. That seems a bit at
odds with what's been a relatively stable to rising trend for the mid to higher-priced segments. So I was wondering if
something had been going on there that would explain that as an aberration. Or is that something we should be
considering as something that could have some continuing effects?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: This is the difference between our shipments to the distributor versus what is happening in the
market. So sometimes, we have timing issues. Now, if you look at the total market size in Russia, maybe to give you
more color on this one, I mean the market was down about 7.9%, if I remember correctly, for the quarter. And if you
look at the composition of that decline, about up to 17% of the decline came from the low-priced segment with the
value and above.
So value, mid and the premium segment, they declined by a little bit by less than 3.5%, that's 3.3%. So you could see
that the upper segments in Russia are doing relatively well despite the fact that there are price increases and the lower
segment is under more pressure. But again, I think it's a bit the same explanations as I used for Indonesia. I mean
different consumer groups are impacted differently by the price increases.

taking. Have you thought about which brands may get which level of pricing? I think you mentioned that it's ¥14 per

gaps versus Mevius? And which brands will get what level of pricing?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, we haven't yet decided on our pricing strategy. And I think it wouldn't be appropriate for
me to comment further on this at this time.
<Q - Ryan Eric Oksenhendler>: Okay. And then just regarding the illicit trade that you're seeing in certain countries
like Turkey, you said it's still pretty bad, maybe got a little better sequentially. Ukraine and Russia are still also pretty
bad. Does it have to get worse maybe before the government really steps in there and it actually starts to get better?

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Actually, I mentioned earlier, I think the Prime Minister Medvedev referring also to some
incidence, higher incidence of illicit product, tobacco illicit product and I think alcohol and that the government is
considering now an option how to tackle the problem at early stages is very welcome. I wish many other governments
would act so promptly when the problem is small rather than let the problem to grow to almost in some places difficult
to manage levels.
Ukraine is a little bit different story. Ukraine's also the story of the counterfeit products, not only illicit products. So
every country has its own sort of the background in that.
Turkey, sequentially, there was a slight improvement. We know from the past that the Turkish government was highly
very decisive and they could act very promptly to address that issue. We wish that they can repeat more of the same
soon. So let's wait.
<Q - Ryan Eric Oksenhendler>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just my last question. Is it possible maybe to get
some insight in terms of what the FX impact would be, overflow into fiscal 2014 especially I think you're lapping some
yen hedges as well. So can you maybe give us some magnitude of what you see in fiscal 2014?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, everything depends what's going to happen with the U.S. dollar, right? So a lot of surprises
also coming from the U.S. side. But I think yen may stay. Remember that we have hedged quite a portion of the yen
exposure for this year earlier. So some of the pressure from the yen for us in terms of effective exchange rates may
continue to next year, depends where the yen is going to lap. Our issue is when we revised the forecast, now guidance
now is essentially not because of the yen. It's very much because of developing countries' currencies. So I think
Indonesian rupiah was the biggest driver of our revised currency guidance.

Your next question comes from the line of David Hayes with Nomura.
<Q - David H. Hayes>: Hi, gentlemen, hi. Just in terms of coming back to the underlying EPS cut since the second
quarter, you've obviously called out Russia is a little bit worse since then; Indonesia as well; Turkey looks a little bit
better; EU about the same. I just wonder whether there is anything else outside of those markets, if you like, that's
driving that slightly lower underlying EPS outlook that we haven't spoken about?
And then I guess related to that in terms of the Russian side of things, you mentioned at the second quarter stage that
despite the volumes down more than you expected, you still saw profitability. You said explicitly the profitability will
be up year-on-year on a slide. It wasn't there this time. I just wonder you can confirm that you still see profitability in
Russia itself being up for the full year. Thanks very much.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes. I mean we see the profitability in Russia being very strong year-on-year as we demonstrated
in this quarter. In terms of the countries of the markets which we're referring to in our guidance, I think, yes, it's
Philippines which is on the list, is that Japan's share of market. Sequentially, we're still seeing stabilization in Japan but,
yes, we lost that one full share point on the quarter. The Indonesia total market is softer in terms of the growth rate that
we initially thought for the full year. So we have to acknowledge that one. That's about it, I think, the main drivers.

<Q - Chris Burritt>: Thank you for taking my questions, Jacek. First, I wanted to ask about...
<A - Jacek Olczak>: My pleasure.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: ... in light of your recent success in Thailand and postponing the placement of those big health
warnings on packages. What's PM's outlook for regulatory efforts in emerging markets? Which markets do you see
your biggest threats on that front?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Frankly speaking, it's not much that we have more news on the regulatory front because, yes, the
TPD, the regulatory developments which we have to wait. There's still a few months until we see what is the final
conclusion of this one. And, yes, I mean, here and there you might have some regulatory initiatives but nothing actually
on the horizon which would not allow me to sleep these days.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: Okay. If I may ask one last quick question, a bit of an oddball one. Given the rising popularity of
electronic cigarettes here in the U.S., what's the policy for PM in terms of employees in your New York office
consuming e-cigs? Has it always been allowed? Is this something you're allowing now given the popularity? What are
you guys doing with that?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, our New York office is a non-smoking office. This is for the conventional cigarette. I know
myself that presumably you've seen me on a number of occasions and I am smoking my NGP. There is much more to
that element of how disturbing you're actually for others around you and more of the matter of a courtesy than defining
any policy on it.
<Q - Chris Burritt>: Okay. Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

That was our final question. And I'd like to turn the floor back over to Nick Rolli for any closing remarks.
