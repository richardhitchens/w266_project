Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in today. I'll walk you through our second quarter results and then
take your questions.
Net revenues were $8.6 billion; net earnings, $1.9 billion; earnings per diluted share, $3.70; our annualized return on
common equity, 10.5%. For the first half of the year, our return on common equity was 11.5%; all in, a solid outcome
in what continues to be a dynamic market environment.
On our earnings call last quarter, we discussed how the evolving economic outlook impacts client activity. Varying
economic data and substantial central bank actions during the quarter caused our clients to continually reassess their
expectations for global growth. As a result, our clients' risk appetites and activity levels fluctuated over the course of
the quarter.
At the beginning of the quarter, our clients remained focused on the European economic outlook. As the quarter
progressed, solid economic data out of the U.S. began to moderate economic concerns. Client activity, risk appetite,
and asset prices improved as a result of the increased confidence in the U.S. economy. Macro concerns emerged again
toward the end of the quarter and were reflected in lower activity levels and risk appetite in certain businesses. In
addition, the market volatility created more challenging periods within the capital markets for managing client flows.
As I'd previously mentioned, central banks around the world were particularly active during the second quarter. This
activity was a key driver of market sentiment during the quarter. In Japan, the central bank undertook unprecedented
monetary action to stimulate their economy. During the second quarter, the yen declined by approximately 5% versus
the U.S. dollar and 7% versus the euro.
The marketplace tried to weigh the potential near-term benefits for the Japanese economy against the relative
headwinds for other parts of the world. In the U.S., commentary from the Federal Reserve about potentially tapering its
bond buying program led to a significant rise in interest rates. Market participants continued to debate the timing and
impact of tapering on both the market and economic activity.
Clients were also concerned with the potential slowdown in China during the quarter. Ultimately, our clients are
assessing the broader global economy, specifically whether a recovering U.S. will offset potentially slower growth in
other economic regions.
I'll now run through each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced second-quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion,
roughly consistent with the first quarter. Second-quarter advisory revenues were $486 million, consistent with the first
quarter.
Year to date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of
important transactions that closed in the second quarter, including: News Corporation's approximately $9 billion
spinoff of its publishing business; Hess's $2.1 billion sale of its Russian subsidiary to Lukoil; and Siemens' £1.7 billion
acquisition of Invensys Rail.
We're also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. They include: Canada Safeway's $5.8 billion
Canadian sale to Sobeys; Springer Science and Business Media's €3.3 billion sale to BC Partners; and Lender
Processing Services' $4 billion sale to Fidelity National Financial.
Second-quarter underwriting net revenues were $1.1 billion, relatively consistent with a robust first quarter. Debt
underwriting revenues were very strong at $695 million and represented a record quarter.

While the pace of commercial mortgage-related activity slowed, leveraged finance activity remained strong. Equity
underwriting revenues of $371 million were down 5% compared with the first quarter. Year to date, Goldman Sachs
ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs.
During the second quarter, there were several noteworthy transactions: Apple's $17 billion first-ever debt offering;
Valiant Pharmaceuticals' $9.6 billion debt and equity financing; and JCPenney's $2.3 billion term loan. Our investment
banking backlog was consistent with first-quarter levels.
Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services. Total net revenues were $4.3 billion in the second quarter. FICC client
execution net revenues were $2.5 billion in the second quarter, lower than the first quarter but higher than the second
quarter a year ago. This quarter results continue to reflect a broad contribution across businesses and reinforce the
benefits of having a diversified franchise.
While activity levels in our currency business remained strong as clients reacted to increased volatility, particularly in
Asia, results in other businesses were lower than the first quarter. As you would expect during a period of increasing
interest rates and widening credit spreads, client risk appetite declined in rates, credit, and mortgages, and inventory
management was a bit more challenging during the latter part of the quarter. Commodity results decreased relative to
the first quarter, as volatility remained low in many of our core products and client activity was lower as a result.
Turning to equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down modestly from the first quarter.
Equities client execution revenues were $638 million, down 21% sequentially, largely reflecting the impact of the sale
of our reinsurance business. Commissions and fees were $836 million, up 5% from the first quarter due to improved
market volumes. Security Services net revenues of $376 million were 18% higher sequentially due to seasonally
stronger client activity.
With respect to risk, average daily VaR in the second quarter was $81 million, up 7% from first quarter levels due to
higher volatilities, mainly in currencies. Adjusted for volatility, VaR was relatively unchanged quarter on quarter.
Let me now review Investing & Lending. We produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in the second quarter. Investing &
Lending includes direct investing, investing we do through funds, as well as lending activities. These activities occur
across a diversified set of asset classes, including both equity and debt.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $462 million, primarily reflecting gains from private equity investments.
This increase in fair value was driven by company-specific events and strong corporate performance. Also, we sold our
remaining stake in ICBC during the quarter. The net gain over the quarter was a modest $7 million. Net revenues from
debt securities and loans were $658 million, driven by company-specific events and interest income. Other revenues of
$295 million were driven by the firm's consolidated investment entities.
Switching to Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion, roughly consistent with
the first quarter. Management and other fees were $1.1 billion, up 4% sequentially. During the second quarter, assets
under supervision decreased $13 billion to $955 billion, primarily reflecting net market depreciation in fixed income
assets.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior-year equity awards, and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net
revenues ratio of 43%, which is consistent with the firm's accrual in the first quarter. Second quarter non-compensation
expenses were $2.3 billion, 5% lower than the first quarter, largely due to the sale of our reinsurance business.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%, driven by earnings that were permanently reinvested abroad. Year to
date, our effective tax rate was 30.4%.
On capital, we repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock for a total of cost of $1.6 billion during the quarter.
Our basic shares outstanding were 468 million at the end of the second quarter, down close to 6% over the last four
quarters. At the end of the second quarter, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under the advanced approach
was approximately 9.3% and reflects the final Basel III rules that were issued by the Federal Reserve on July 2.

Obviously, we're still reviewing the final rule, but this is our best estimate subject to change depending on regulatory
clarifications.
Now over the quarter, we took a number of strategic actions to bolster our capital position. As you will recall, we
announced the potential sale of a majority stake in our reinsurance business given the Basel III capital charges that we
incurred as a 100% owner of the business. We completed the sale of our reinsurance business in the second quarter.
This sale improved our Basel III capital ratio by approximately 50 basis points and reduced the firm's balance sheet by
$17 billion. This benefit was partially offset by implementation of the final Basel III rule set. Now at 9.3%, we are
close to having achieved our previously stated target of the 8.5% requirement plus an approximate 100 basis point
buffer.
Regarding the leverage ratio, we also received the NPR last week. Even if it's in the proposal stage, it's hard to
speculate on how it will ultimately be finalized. However, we have significantly reduced our leverage since 2007. Since
then, we've reduced our assets by roughly $180 billion while increasing our equity base by over 80%. As a result, we
feel reasonably well positioned for the new leverage requirements at both the holding company and the bank
subsidiary. But once again, it's a proposal, so we will work with the regulators over the coming months.
Effectively managing the firm requires us to comply with a variety of different regulatory measures. Just as we have
improved our Basel III capital ratio, we will have to continually adjust to any new regulations as they are finalized. As
we've said in the past, a high level of risk-adjusted capital not only provides protection against tail events to all of our
constituents, it also creates the foundation for capturing opportunities. With higher risk-adjusted capitalization, we are
better positioned to help our clients navigate an uncertain economic environment, and we can provide them with risk
capital where capacity is diminished. An essential part of our role as managers on behalf of you, our shareholders, is to
manage our capital effectively and efficiently in order to generate superior long-term returns.
Now in closing, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the operating environment. Nevertheless, we remain
vigilant regarding expenses and risks. Given the dynamic nature of the marketplace, it's natural for people to become
somewhat short-term focused. However, everyone at Goldman Sachs remains keenly aware that our success will be
measured over years as opposed to weeks or months. To that end, we are going to continue to invest in deepening and
expanding our client franchise, building relationships that will pass the test of time. We will continue to invest in our
people, recruiting and retaining a group of professionals who are committed to providing solutions to our clients and
driving value for our shareholders.
With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today, and I'm now happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Howard. How are you?
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Well, thanks. How are you?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Great, thanks.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: The more challenging conditions that you spoke to in the back half of the quarter with
respect to client risk appetite and inventory management -- was hoping you could just comment. Have those difficult
conditions persisted as we've rebased it at new higher levels of U.S. benchmark rates, or have they abated a bit?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So I'd say it does feel like they've abated a bit. You see it in the day-to-day volatility.
And that really is about I think the adjustment to people basically recalibrating to both a somewhat wider credit spread
environment and obviously higher absolute interest rates. And you can see that. Obviously it's quite visible, for
example, in movements in the 10-year. So I think people are adjusting.

What I would say is that it's now a very information-centric environment. What I mean by that is people – all of our
clients are going to be very keenly watching data, economic data, whether it's non-farm payrolls in the United States,
GDP growth in Europe, Japan, China, really trying to form their view, because for a very long period of time, I think
there was an expectation that this unusual low-rate environment would persist. And to some extent, people could build
expectations around that. And now that we might be entering a different regime, you'll see people probably respond
more to data. But again, it's hard to [ph] say. (15:55) But to answer your question the short way, which is it does feel
like people have recalibrated this stage.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: And by the way, some of this, Howard, is returning to normal interest rate levels, it feels
good in some respects in terms of economic activity.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: And that's where I was hoping to go next. It feels like we've been talking for a couple years
about this wall of client liquidity that's out there and the near-zero interest rates creating more of a one-way market in
certain clusters like credit and mortgages. Have we seen enough of a move, in your mind, to see more two-way flow in
some of these businesses that we've been hoping for?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think it's too early to tell, which is why I highlighted the sensitivity to economic data.
People are going to form their impressions over the next several months, and certainly everybody will be watching.
Clients are basically sitting on the edge of their seat for every communiqué out of the Federal Reserve. And so there
will be some sensitivity, but it feels like we're tracking more back to a period of normalcy.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great; thanks. And then I was hoping you could just update us on all of what the firm
experienced as we progressed through Phase 2 of U.S. mandatory clearing, not only in all of what you're doing with
respect to centralized clearing efforts, but also maybe just broad health, liquidity, bid/ask spreads of the
over-the-counter markets as we went through that transition.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right. So obviously from a Goldman Sachs perspective and jut as an industry participant,
we're thrilled to see clearing really coming into vogue now. And as we talked about on the last call, while it has taken a
while and people can be frustrated at the pace of things, the reality is that I think the regulators and market participants
have done really an excellent job of the progression of Phase 1 and Phase 2. And as you saw, there were lots of
concerns in the marketplace. And for all intents and purposes, it went through without any hiccups.
I think as it relates to any material moves in bid/ask spreads or volumes, there're no material change there, and it's too
early for that. I think to the extent to which clearing has a long-term impact on market structure, it will happen over
many months and years, like we've seen in other marketplaces.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay; thanks. And then just finally for me, thanks for the color on Basel III preparation. But
just given the proactive steps you took with the reinsurance business and ICBC stake, I was hoping you could just
update us on your current Basel III RWA breakdown and just where you are on passive and active mitigation. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure, so it's been a while since we've updated this audience on risk-weighted assets, so I
just want to walk through this a little bit carefully. The last time we talked to you last year, we gave you a number of
$728 billion in terms of risk-weighted assets. That number is now $600 billion. I'm going to break it down and then I
want to come back and reference the $728 billion I just mentioned.
So the $600 billion, our best estimate, given the final rule, is $180 billion for market risk-weighted assets, $340 billion
for credits, $80 billion for operational. Now you can obviously do the math, but that translates into $56 billion of Tier 1
common.
The reason why I want to draw everyone's attention to the comparison of the $600 billion to the $728 billion is because
the way the final rules came out, there were certain deductions that we were previously assuming would be
risk-weighted assets which actually became deductions to capital. And so the $600 billion versus the $728 billion is not
really apples to apples. The best way to think about our current position under the final rules is the 9.3%, which

obviously, as I said during my prepared remarks, is 20 basis points within range of the buffer.
In terms of passive, you should be thinking about roughly $35 billion in risk-weighted assets that will roll off between
now and the end of 2015.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Thanks, Harvey.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Roger. How are you doing?
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Good, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess one, just maybe bouncing off
a couple things Howard was asking, so the market quality in rates and credit -- would you characterize that as more
normalized now in July? It sounds like in June that lack of dealer liquidity provision maybe contributed somewhat to
the gapping in spreads. And I'm wondering if that's part of the new world we live in now with the new regulatory
environment, where asset prices move and dealers are less apt to take positional risk.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes, so I think I would describe it more as things are episodic. In other words, I don't
think there's a massive transition that has occurred in terms of four weeks ago to today. Clearly when you get big
moves in interest rates, all market participants are going to adjust their risk profiles; and you'll see flows, for example,
out of fixed income asset into other assets. As I said, I think it is quite normal for us to see this, and people are really in
a position of reassessing their risk profile. But in terms of Goldman Sachs, I can't speak for the rest of the Street.
Goldman Sachs is, we feel, quite well positioned in terms of our ability to commit capital for our clients.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay; thanks. And in I&L, you talked a lot about this in the past, but just help us
think about maybe the average age of maybe buckets within there. I'm trying to – you've been coming in ahead of
expectations; obviously, this is a tough one to forecast. But I think you, like a lot of the public/private equity firms we
cover, have aged portfolios and there's a realization process going on. And wonder if you can help us think about really
where you're at in that cycle.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Well, as we've guided everyone in the past, generally speaking for the equity portfolio, a
reasonable guide could be the MSCI. Obviously, there's divergence in this period. And as we've always told people, it's
really just a guide. And there are going to be periods where idiosyncratically there's elements of the portfolio where we
underperform, and there are going to be periods when we overperform. Obviously, relative to that kind of benchmark,
this quarter we outperformed. And it really is a combination of things like debt repayments and adjustments.
Obviously, interest income is in there, and again, idiosyncratic components of the portfolio.
In terms of aging, I didn't bring specific numbers with me, Roger, but the private equity portfolio obviously tends to
have a longer-term frame on it relative to the debt portfolio, but we can follow up with you and give you more detail if
that's helpful.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay, all right; thanks. Maybe lastly, liquidity levels continue to run high. And
again, it's early days in thinking about leverage ratios and how some of those liquidity assets get calculated into that.
Does that change your thinking about how much liquidity you want to run with?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we're always going to run with an amount of liquidity which is really designed to
protect the firm and at the same time put us in a position where we can provide capital and liquidity to our clients.
With respect to the metrics out there, things like the liquidity coverage ratio, we feel very comfortable with respect to
things like that. I don't know if you were going there. But in terms of – because you mentioned leverage ratio, the only
comment I would say is that we're not [ph] where (24:16) we're going to modulate our liquidity down because of a

given metric that's in the marketplace, even if an incentive exists for that.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay; great. Thanks a lot, Harvey.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Hi. First question, maybe just back on the leverage ratio, some of your peers have put out
some guidance in terms of a first take. If we look at Goldman and what you've done on the Tier 1 common ratio, there's
obviously some mitigation that can be done. So if you are below that 5%, how do you guys think about achieving that,
whether it's through areas of asset mitigation that won't have significant impact on the earnings power of Goldman or
raising preferreds? What are the levers that you guys have to get there?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Again, this is a rule that just came out. It's in proposal form. As I said, our first
assessment is we're very comfortable with where we are. Now again, that probably shouldn't be a surprise to anyone
given all the work that's been done on the balance sheet since 2007, with an 80% increase in shareholder equity and a
decrease of $180 billion on the balance sheet. As I said, that's the kind of metric that we should be reasonably well
positioned for.
Having said that, it's in proposal form, so we'll have to see the final rule. And the only reason I'm not being more
specific about numbers at this stage is our team really hadn't had a time to do the kind of diligence that we would
normally want them to. But as I said, first read we feel comfortable. Let's see how the final rule goes. We'll work with
the regulators.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay; got it. And then on the fixed side of the business, there's a lot of, I'd say, uncertainty
or debate on what the outlook is, just given higher rates, potentially a decline on the down-rating side, and then fund
outflows in certain products. On the flip side, though, you basically have market growth. And then as central banks are
less – are backing out and are not as intervening in the market, it seems like volatility levels, particularly in rates and
FX, could resume to more normalized levels. So when you look at the longer-term outlook of FICC, it doesn't seem as
if it's that simple that rising rates should be more negative to the business. But I just wanted to get your take on when
you think about the headwinds versus the potential for a more normalized market environment in some of the product
areas. What could we potentially see over the next couple years?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's a good question but obviously exceptionally difficult to answer. Time will tell on that.
We as a firm have had to navigate multiple rate regimes. If you just think about the rate regimes that we've experienced
since 2000 and the volatility associated with that, and not to suggest we haven't been in an unprecedented period of
globally coordinated declining rates, but I do think that to the extent to which rates are a proxy for thinking about the
fixed income business from a forward view, I think it really depends on what the driver is. I think even though it seems
exceptionally unlikely, if rate increases were due to things like inflation, then I think it's a different scenario than if it's,
as I said, returning to a normal world of more steady economic growth. I think that's a reasonably attractive opportunity
set, not just for FICC potentially, but obviously across the entire firm. And so that's what we're rooting for.
Now in terms of strategically positioning the business, we benefit from the fact that it's diversified. We can interact
with our clients across the full suite of their interests, whether it's currencies, mortgages, interest rates, and we have the
global footprint required to do that. So in a quarter like this, where Asia becomes particularly interesting, we can
deliver for our clients because we're positioned and we're strategically connected to do that.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay, that makes sense. And then just finally on the expenses, I think you mentioned the
non-comp impact on the reinsurance business. On the compensation side, anything – it just seems like with the pickup
in activity, you get a higher – the competitive environment gets a little tougher; just any update on that front? And then

just on the tax outlook, when you said the earnings permanently being I think directed outside, is there something that's
going to be more ongoing in terms of the tax rate, or was this more of a quarterly benefit?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So as it relates to the tax rate, you should just think of this as a quarterly benefit.
The war for talent, it's something that we do every day. I would say that there's nothing that we see in terms of a shift.
Goldman Sachs people are always in high demand, and our competitors are always looking to take them over to their
firms. I will say over the past several months, we've always felt like we're well positioned to recruit. I will say it felt
like we've had some recruiting tailwinds this year. Whether they're sustainable, we'll see.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.

Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Hey, how are you, a couple of questions. One, just on the leverage ratio, when you say
you are comfortable, what's your definition of comfortable?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Comfortable. I'm not trying to be cute with you. Look, it's just come out. Our team has
looked at it. Our early read is all the things we've done on the balance sheet over the past several years have left us
reasonably well positioned. And so I know that perhaps you'd like me to get more specific into the math. But at this
stage, I just want to give the team the final time to really dot the I's and cross the T's. We think we can manage without
any major adjustments certainly.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. Just to get – by year end 2018, to get to the 5% and 6%, is that...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sorry, by comfortable, I don't mean that timeframe. But again, I want everyone to really
note. This is a proposed rule. So let's see how the dialogue evolves with the regulators.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Yes, I get it, okay. On the RWA walk-through, which was helpful, I guess I'm
wondering. You mentioned the $56 billion on the common Tier 1, and that there were incremental deducts relative to
what was in the proposed rule. So could you help us understand what you think you can do to mitigate those deducts
going forward?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Right now as it relates to the ratio, we're pretty comfortable. As we stated before, we plan
to run with a 100 basis point buffer, putting us in range of 20 basis points of that. Given the incredibly long glide path
to compliance in 2019, we feel pretty comfortable.
Now one thing I do – you didn't ask specifically about this. But one thing I do want to give people a sense for is we
talked about this 100 point buffer so that we could give people an estimate of where we thought we would ultimately
land. Of course, that was operating under a proposed set of rules not finalized. So the way we typically work with
metrics at Goldman Sachs is, when we introduce our own metrics, for example, is we'll work with them, we'll monitor
them, we'll see how they move. And so we're going to do the same thing with this final Basel III rule now that we have
it. And so in that sense, we feel quite comfortable.
Now in terms of the specific deductions, they mostly relate to financial institutions. And if it's a specific deduction, we
can get into the weeds offline, if you'd like, but it relates to investments in funds and other things on the balance sheet.
Now it happens to be the case that that coincidentally runs parallel with mitigating actions that we're taking under what
we think the Volcker Rule is going to be when it's finalized. So we feel pretty good about that too.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Yes, I was just wondering what optionality you have to reduce those deducts, and it
sounds like there's some and you'll work on it and you'll address it as it happens. Is that fair?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It has always been the case. Look, we like to build it into the muscle memory of the firm
that everyone knows we're going to have to adapt. I think if you look at what we've done over the past 18 months as it
relates to the Basel III ratio and now that we have the final rule, we can really discuss it with you in clarity, which is
nice. I feel very good about our team's ability to continue to make progress.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: And on the tax rate, you indicated in the press release and on the call that you made
elections to permanently reinvest some earnings overseas. Does that imply a tax rate going forward that's different than
what it has been in the past? The first half was 30%. Is that what we should use going forward?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, I answered that question just a second ago, Betsy. You might have missed it. You
should just think of it as a one-time event for this quarter.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay, all right. And then lastly on the reinsurance business, did you go through how
that's going to be impacting? You indicated the capital impact, but I'm just wondering. Is there more to come with
buybacks since it is positive for your Basel ratios? Did you do everything with the buybacks that you were going to do
this quarter with the reinsurance business? The reinsurance business changed, freed up capital.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Correct.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Did you finish doing what you wanted to do with buybacks relative to that this quarter,
or is there more to come in the forward quarters?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Okay, I think I understand the question. But if I don't, you should correct me.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We don't think about the capital management necessarily as being specifically linked to
one individual asset disposition, so it's a much longer timeframe in terms of how we think about capital management.
And so an easier way for me to say that would have been based on the quarter that we just went through, if we had
ended up selling the reinsurance business in the third quarter, you would have seen the same repurchase activity. Am I
getting to your question, Betsy?
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Yes, I got it.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Actually on the reinsurance business, again, I would say it was a business that we liked in
Goldman Sachs. It didn't make sense, obviously, under the new rules. And so we were in a situation where, quite
frankly, it was a win-win for us and our clients in the investing division because we were able to take the actions that
we did.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: All right, thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So to follow up on Mike's question, if the market is a bit more data driven, does that mean
that you guys would expect that the rates business should remain strong as clients continue to adjust and reposition
based upon incremental data points coming out?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Very difficult to tell, and we don't run the business week to week in terms of how the
market is responding. Obviously, we stay very focused on the risk dynamics in the marketplace when we go through
them at risk committee and, obviously, in the trenches. But strategically, the way you have to interact with clients,
whether it's, for example, long-term investors that are managing pension obligations or insurance companies, and the
flip side, those might be even more market sensitive to our total return business. So we just have to make sure that we
stay very, very focused on our clients. And it's a good opportunity because it's a content differentiating world right
now, and so we have an opportunity to do that. We just have to deliver.

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then I guess when you think about – in that context, thinking about your business
and how you guys are approaching it given what you're seeing, we're seeing some slowing growth out of China, the
strengthening dollar. How do you think about the positioning of the commodities business in that context? And while
certainly it might not change strategic perceptions of that business, maybe does it have an impact on your thinking from
a tactical perspective?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think it's accurate to say it literally has zero impact in how we think about the
day-to-day management of the commodity business. I emphasize the zero only because we run that business for the
long term. We entered that business in 1981. It has been core to our clients and core to the entire integrated strategy of
the Securities division, which includes both fixed income and equities. And so those kinds of near term adjustments in
the marketplace, super relevant to the conversations that our people on the ground are having with their clients all
around the globe, but not a dictator to us in terms of how we think about our multi-decade commitment to the
commodity business.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: No, sure. I just was curious about whether or not it might impact more short-term tactical
decisions as far as capital allocations and the like.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, the capital, we don't dial down the capital to the business. The client demand and the
client activity levels will drive the capital needs that we provide.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, that's fair. And then the last one for me, it looked like there was a moderate issuance
of some preferred this quarter. Did that have anything to do with the leverage ratio coming out or was that something
else driving that issuance?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, that was part of our long-term capital plan. We had no insight into the leverage ratio.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, I had to give it one last parting shot for the leverage ratio there.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I like the persistence.

Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Kian.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Yes, hi. The first question is regarding SEF [Swap Execution Facility] platform. We have
some clarity in respect to the definition of SEF platform. I'm wondering how you're preparing for this, how you're
positioning yourself, if you can give us a little bit of color in that respect.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we have a long history of adopting and participating in platform developments.
Obviously, it goes all the way back to Tradeweb, and we've both developed our own internal platforms and we have
participated in external platforms. So I don't think this represents any specific hurdles in terms of participating in that. I
do think it will be quite interesting. As trading moves over to swap execution facilities later in the year, maybe the
beginning of next year, I think it will be quite interesting to see the market dynamic around that, and particularly as we
enter a phase of finalized rules how the business evolves.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And in terms of technological platform, is there anything that you're developing new now
that you have a bit more clarity in terms of a technological platform? Is there anything that you can add in respect to
how you respond to that, how you try to differentiate, to keep flow or gain new flows?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So one, it's yet to evolve. The way – and we talked about this before. One of our
competitive advantages, assuming we execute, is the fact that we have SecDB, which is our internally developed
platform. It is a platform that we use across all of our businesses, whether you're trading currencies in Asia or you're
trading stocks in the United States. And so that should give us some advantage in terms of how we position ourselves

and our speed and our ability to adapt. But I think the early phase of this, I can't – maybe I'm wrong, but I think the
early phase of this is somewhat similar to clearing in that it's all about educating the clients, interface with the clients,
and making sure that connectivity works for them because it's a big adjustment in terms of execution protocol for them.
And then what we just have to do is – really the differentiating thing is the content. We just have to keep providing
content.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay, that's helpful. That's very helpful. Just on securitization, we clearly heard from some
of the banks that at the current level of interest rates, production of mortgages could decline. I was just wondering –
and it could have a material impact. I was just wondering. Since you are such a big securitization player, especially on
mortgages, I was just wondering. How do you see that business developing, assuming that yields do stay at a higher
level, and how material?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Probably you have a better view on the competitors and their exposure to securitization.
We've never really been big in securitization as it relates to the new issue pipeline of, for example, residential
mortgages. Obviously, we've been a big participant over the past several years in our ability to commit capital for
clients, moving portfolios, secondary portfolios, for example, people derisking out of Europe and connecting investors
in the U.S. But I don't know necessarily that I would attribute any concern to higher interest rates for us as it relates to
the securitization activity level. Now that may translate into less activity for the entire industry. And it's really, I think
to some degree, a bit of how it evolves over the next six months in terms of people's expectations. Again, if it's a
particular volatile period, it could have a different impact. If we settle in and people feel a certain confidence around
economic activity, it could clearly translate quite differently.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay, that's quite helpful. And the last question is, on the securitization consultation
document by Basel that came out quite a while ago now, six months ago, I'm sure you had the chance to look through
it. I'm just wondering if this could have a material impact on your risk-weighted asset changes that you just outlined...
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes, that's a...
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: ...assuming that it comes as discussed in the paper.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes, so I don't have any specific comments as it relates to the details of the paper. What I
would say is I think a really important takeaway as it relates to all of these regulatory processes is it's all about an
ability to adapt. All firms are going to operate in the same rule set. And so historically, we've done a pretty good job of
adapting. We just need to continue adapting. And one of the things I said is, and I like to think of it a bit as an operating
principle, is there's a very, very low premium on trying to predict the outcome of rules, but a huge, huge premium on
adapting once you see them. Predicting rules and responding can be incredibly costly. You can get wildly misdirected
and you can lose track of your clients. Responding to rules once they're finalized, that really is a differentiating factor,
and we have to execute.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Kian.

<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: A follow-up question to your comments that the pipelines were relatively stable versus
the end of last quarter. And I know it's early in the quarter here, but just any thoughts in terms of a change in the mix? I
think a lot of people view that if rates increase like the way they did, that's when debt issuance would dry up. As we
know, that's not always the case. Has there been any change in the mix of the pipeline, maybe even within the debt

business a mix change in terms of away from high yield in terms of like away from high yield towards certain things?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: As I said in the opening, the backlog was basically unchanged Q-over-Q from first
quarter to second quarter. Just to give you a little bit of color, it was down a very small amount in advisory at the end of
the quarter and it was up in underwriting. In terms of where it is, it's too early in the quarter to see how things will
evolve. So I wouldn't take any material takeaways from any changes over the past two weeks.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then the sale of the reinsurance business, was there a gain or a loss?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So there was nothing material with the sale of the reinsurance business. Just to give
people some context on that business, obviously, I've gone through a lot of detail already. But since you're asking the
question, it represented just under 2% of last year's pre-tax income.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, if we back out some of the revenues from the
reinsurance business, you just have a stub piece this quarter. If you back that all out, it seems like the equity derivatives
business is doing pretty well, and we're seeing that at some other banks as well. I'm just wondering. Obviously,
volatility had been low, blowed out a little bit. Sometimes that can be good, sometimes not. Just what's driving some of
the good trends in the equity derivatives area?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes, so as you mentioned, last year, second quarter 2012. There was $259 million from
revenues in the reinsurance business; obviously significantly less, $80-plus million in this quarter. So when you adjust
out for that, you're right, a strong performance in the equity business. Part of that's equity derivatives. I will say there
were, I'd say, two other drivers.
One is there were some good opportunities to provide our clients with capital around index rebalancings and other areas
where we could really lean into the strength of client relationships, technology, and capital committing in a way that I
think leaves us quite well positioned; and obviously, as I noted, better performance in the equity derivatives business
broadly. But there was a little bit of a – everybody keeps talking about the rotation out of fixed income into equities.
And who knows how that will play out over the next decade, but certainly a lot of activity in equities space, particularly
in Asia.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Miller (sic) [Mitchell] (48:20) with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hi, it's Jim Mitchell.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Jim, sorry about that.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: That's okay. On the central clearing, just to follow up, have you done any work – and I
know it's early days – in terms of what the potential capital benefits could be in moving to more of the business's
central clearinghouse, and what that may mean also with respect, if anything, benefit with respect to the leverage ratio
as it relates to derivatives?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We haven't spent – it's early days, so we haven't spent a huge amount of time in terms of
the capital benefits. As these leverage ratios unfold, one of the things that I'm sure will get a lot of debate in the
proposal process is the extent to which custody of client assets, effectively people just putting money in a safe or
holding collateral, how that plays out in the leverage ratio, but we haven't done a huge amount of work as it relates to
capital benefits at this stage.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: I think it's fair to assume it would have some net benefit, but you just haven't really put your
arms around it.

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes, we would expect over the long term capital benefit. But more importantly, we've
always been quite conservative, we feel, relative to the broad marketplace as it relates to the extension of credit. And
the extent to which more activity is cleared, obviously, that levels the playing field...
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: ...and removes the ability of call it a third or fourth quartile more marginal competitor in
a specific space to compete on terms. They have to compete on content and execution. But look, again, early days;
we're not seeing any tailwinds or headwinds at this stage.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, thanks, and one quick question on the asset management business. You guys have
seen pretty consistent outflows in alternatives the last year or so. If you look at the industry, you've seen pretty much
inflows in alternatives. Has it just been a performance, or is it a mix issue? How do we think about the alternatives
space for you guys?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So we're very focused on it in terms of the trend. Obviously, it has been a very important
component of our business, nothing specific there. The only thing I would say is that obviously, as we've previously
announced, in anticipation of adjusting for that component of the Volcker Rule, which we think we will be in the
finalized rule, we have been removing our own capital.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: And that would show up as outflows?

Your next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead, sir.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hi, good morning. This is a slightly different kind of a question than was asked a minute ago
on OTC derivatives. As we transition to a regime of much more of what used to be OTC being centrally cleared, is it
the right way to think about the existing OTC derivatives portfolio as essentially being a runoff portfolio in a way, and
therefore a source of passive relief?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, I want to make sure I understand your question clearly. The things that, for example,
that we think of were in the past related businesses, for example, pre-crisis businesses like correlation books and things
like that, which just aren't relevant to our clients today and are quite capital consumptive under the new rule sets. As it
relates to clearing, given the number of instruments we have cleared now, I don't think that – I don't think the two really
overlap. I do think that, and I'll speculate a little bit here. I do think that as these rules get finalized and we're only
living with really clearing for a couple of months now, and then when we come into swap execution facilities it would
be very interesting to see the impact that has on client activity, which as best as we can tell was a little dampened for
the industry, given the uncertainty around the rule sets. And so as we get certainty, it could be a little bit of a tailwind
for volume.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yes, the question was – that was helpful. But the question really was around as you think
about, for example, leverage ratio, and I'll stipulate to the fact that all of my numbers show that you guys are pretty
much where you need to be. But as you think about ways of mitigating toward – down to where you might want to be if
you weren't where you wanted to be, and the add-backs to the denominator of that ratio include a lot of off-balance
sheet OTC derivative driven assets, won't those be coming down quite significantly naturally over the next several
years if, in fact, the regulatory shift towards centrally cleared derivatives really takes hold, or am I thinking about that
the wrong way?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, I think you're right. To the extent which clearing leads to, depending on the metric
that you're observing, reduced notionals or other things, then that's a natural tailwind for the industry.
I think more importantly, one thing – and look, we're all subject to having knee-jerk reactions to these proposed rules
when they come out. I will say the regulators consistently, at least so far, have been very thoughtful about the glide
path. So the adjustment process, if we needed to make one, the way we would approach that is the way we've
approached all the other rules that we've lived with as they've come into place, which is we evaluate the rule. We
deploy tools to our people. And in the context of delivering to our clients and at the same time maximizing the return to
the shareholders, we'd adjust. So that's how we would handle it. But I think the nuanced question around whether
clearing is a tailwind to reduced notionals, I think the answer is yes on that. But I'm not in the weeds on that specific
issue, but we can get back to you on it.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that would be great; just a couple of quick housekeeping type questions. Have you
spoken to the RWA that was associated with the reinsurance business?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, and the reason why I didn't do that is not because I'm not happy to have the
conversation. But the way the sale of the reinsurance business worked, it actually is a bit of an adjustment to equity and
it's also an adjustment to RWAs. So I think the best way to frame it for all of you is just to say the net outcome is 50
basis points.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that helps. And then the final one would be, you talked about your 9.3% estimated
core Tier 1 under Basel III under the advanced approach. Can you tell us what it would be under the standardized
approach?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So with respect to the standardized approach, where we're finalizing the numbers there,
but our first review is we're comfortably over the minimum requirements. But at this stage, the same with the leverage
ratio, I want the team to really finalize the numbers before I cross the I's and dot the T's on that. But we're comfortable
that we're comfortably in excess.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. You mentioned some inventory management in June. Can you give us some sense of what
marks were involved?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, there's nothing specific to comment on in that. I was just trying to give you a little bit
of extra color on how the quarter wrapped up, but I'm sure it wasn't surprising to anyone given the volatility of markets.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And can you give some sense of breakdown between the U.S. and non-U.S. revenue growth
you're seeing? And are you still as fully committed to the BRIC strategy as you've always been?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So no change in commitment, and the mix hasn't changed significantly. It's down a little
bit in the Americas, up a little bit in Europe, but there really are no material changes. But the core part of your question,
which I think is the most important part, is in terms of the strategic approach of the firm, very, very committed, very
focused to those markets.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, and I think the word of day is comfortable, and so I'll ask probably the fifth or sixth
question or seventh question on the leverage ratio.

peers will do. So on a disclosure basis, you're behind peers. I'm just trying to reconcile the two thoughts.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: When we look at NPRs, our approach might be a little bit different than you've seen from
the peers. Look, I suspect you could have said the same thing of the Basel III process, where I think you probably felt
the same way in terms of being behind peers in terms of level of disclosure. Look, one of the reasons that is, is because
if we give you $728 billion and we updated quarter to quarter to quarter and then it drops to $600 billion, I'm not sure
we're giving you a lot of value in that. I think there's much more value in sharing the process with you. Now when we
have real confidence in the exact number, then we'll be fine to share it with you. But as I said, maybe comfortable is the
word of the day, but we're comfortable.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Can you just give us a sense of it's above some number and give us that number?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: You're looking for shades of gray in comfortable?
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Yes.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Pretty comfortable.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Pretty comfortable. Now last follow-up on that because it goes – someone said by 2018 you'll
get there or by 2015, or you'll pass the Fed stress test, or will you be able to buy back shares as quickly as you've done?
That's really what it comes down to, I think.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yes, I wouldn't extrapolate too much information from the proposed rule set with respect
to – 2018 is miles away, if that gives you some context to how we're thinking about our initial review of the ratio. I'm
not trying to be flippant with you. When we really finalize the numbers, I'm happy to come back to you on it.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Hi, good morning. I just had questions in two areas. I'm sorry to come back to the 9.3%
Basel III, but I was trying to understand the movement in the quarter. I think you mentioned some offsets to the 50
basis points. So it was really – I thought ICBC would also have been positive, and you made a little bit of money over
and above the buybacks. Could you explain where it was that the rules got tighter versus your original expectations?
And the secondary was just generally there seems to be a lot of discussion about wholesale funding, particularly
secured. I wondered if you could discuss whether you're doing anything to change your weighted average maturity or
what your view is on the wholesale funding area.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So with respect to the first, there are always going to be pluses and minuses when you get
a final rule set in terms of things that impact your ratio, but the reality is that – I think the key driver here – and we're
happy to spend more time with you offline – is what's referred to as the financial institutions deduction. And as I said
before, it's a deduction from capital, and it relates to both investments in funds and also financial institution assets that
we hold on balance sheet as part of our liquidity provision to clients. And so we're happy to walk you through that in
more detail. The rest of it is pluses and minuses back and forth.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: So just to follow up, is the $600 billion number that you gave for Basel III, has that been
relatively consistent excluding the insurance noise over the last couple of quarters?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: The one reason why I tried to draw the distinction between what we brought out in the
fourth quarter of last year, the $728 billion, is just the change in the rule set. So obviously, there are passive things that
have occurred. There is incremental capital built up during the quarter. But I think the primary takeaway should be the

Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas C. Sipkin>: Yes, thank you and good morning. I just wanted to drill down, actually, on some of the
operations, specifically debt. Just curious for your perspective, I think it was touched on earlier. What do you guys
think if rates start to move up? Obviously, debt underwriting has been a real nice area for you guys, my first question.
And then secondly, it does look like within that, you guys are maybe out punching. I'd be curious to hear where you
think you're gaining some market share, either by product or geography, with respect to debt underwriting. Thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure. So in terms of the recalibration of interest rates, I think very difficult to predict near
term what impact that had in terms of the debt market appetite for new issues and issuers' ability or desire to pull the
trigger on a particular transaction. I will say – I think one of the most frequently asked questions we got at the end of
the fourth quarter was the ability of the debt performance to continue, and it was the same question the end of the first
quarter. So obviously, we'll see how things unfold.
With respect to how we position the business, I listed off some of the transactions that we executed during the quarter,
and really leveraged finance was a significant driver. And this is all about, again, staying extremely focused on our
clients, particularly in our Investment Banking franchise where we're working with CFOs and CEOs and how they
think about their balance sheets or how they think strategically about merger activity. But again, the core message here
is we're less focused on the quarter activity and much more just focused on the client long term.
<Q - Douglas C. Sipkin>: Great; thanks for answering.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: And perhaps I could go back to the leverage ratio without actually asking a direct
question about that. But it was really about the other components of your Tier 1 capital. Clearly, apart from your core
Tier 1, you have $7.2 billion now of preferred stock and I think about $2 billion at the end of the last quarter in junior
subordinated debt. I'm finally getting my head around how much of that is Bal III compliant and whether or not any of
that is going to have to be replaced as you go through the amortization, which obviously is important in terms of the
leverage ratio. And also perhaps whether you've already considered part of your effort to improve the leverage ratio –
not improve it, but to reach the number – is to actually start to issue some of this additional Tier 1 capital which is
going to be compliant with bar III and whether the regulator have given you any clue yet, your regulator, as to what
exactly the characteristics of that new debt would have to be.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, we don't have any specific insights in terms of any of the new debt proposals that
you would have seen. As far as observations about the capital structure, obviously, preferreds are fine. Trust preferreds
are being looked at, but we'll circle back to you with respect to it. But there's no change in anything as it relates to

capital planning. By the way, I would say that with respect to how we're thinking about share repurchase too, no
changes with respect to capital planning as a result of the any of the finalized or proposed rules that we've seen in the
marketplace.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Have you looked at all at what the cost of boosting your Tier 1 capital might be,
because clearly that's an issue a lot of banks are looking at, certainly in the European markets at the moment?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We evaluate the cost all the time. But it's not a question of cost so much as it a question
about basically positioning the firm to run it conservatively and position it for clients. And look, I think if you were on
a discussion with our treasury team and myself talking about how we should think about cost, at the margin we're much
more concerned about the stability of the capital structure and less about cost.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Okay, that's encouraging. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning, Harvey; thanks for taking my questions, just a couple of quickies, I think.
Your long-term unsecured debt, at least according to the press release, is down roughly $5 billion quarter to quarter.
How are you thinking about debt levels going forward, and have you changed your thinking at all on OLA and how that
will affect your debt balance going forward?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So just orderly liquidation authority, just for everyone dialing in, obviously, any rule set
that conceptually is designed to create order, in principle, we don't have any issues with. We haven't seen the detail in
the weeds on that, and it gets back to what I said earlier. We're not going to adjust the capital structure of the firm based
on a discussion or where we guess things would come out. That's not the way we're going to think about it or manage
the capital structure, so no changes. Now as best as we can tell, again, these are all in discussion, so we don't have
details. As best as we can tell, given the amount of debt we have at the HoldCo, one might say that we're reasonably
well positioned. But again, really big caveat on that: we haven't seen any details.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Let me come at the same question from a different direction. Are your capital markets
teams and debt underwriting looking positively at that idea, or are they of the same opinion?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think we need more detail. We've seen a lot of views in the marketplace.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Let me switch the question to activity levels across your broad geographic groups,
Europe, Asia, U.S./North America. Were there any meaningful improvements in activity levels maybe outside the U.S.
this quarter that helped the revenue side of things, or were there any areas of particular weakness?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Certainly the activity levels in Japan, and when I say Japan, I don't necessarily mean
specifically Japan geographically, but activity that's driven around Japan. So one of the – given the global nature of our
clients, one of the most important things that we need to do across the entire firm is make sure that we connect
geographically in a way to deliver content. So it might be clients in Europe that are very focused on events in Japan the
same as the U.S. So a lot of the capturing that is making sure that the content mechanism works and the transmission
mechanism works. And so I would say Japan was a driver certainly of increased activity, but not just isolated to Japan
as knock-on benefits.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: And would you characterize Europe as still being a little bit below Asia and the U.S. in
terms of activity levels given the economic conditions there?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think that's fair. I think there's more upside in Europe. And I think there's more upside
specifically – and again, this could play out over many years. There's more upside specifically for U.S.-based firms like
ourselves, Goldman Sachs.
