Sherilyn S. McCoy
Thank you, Amy. Good morning. By now you've seen our press release with results for Avon's fourth quarter and 2012.
As I said in the release, the business has shown early signs of stabilization, which is good. We have a lot of work ahead
of us, but I'm confident that we'll continue to make progress toward the financial goals that we laid out for you in the
third quarter call, achieving mid-single-digit revenue growth and an adjusted low-double-digit operating margin by
2016.
My remarks this morning will be brief, as we look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY next week. At CAGNY I
will provide you with more perspective on our plans to return Avon to growth, but this morning I wanted to reflect for a
moment on 2012. I do believe we are beginning to gain traction in key areas, and the organization is engaged and
working hard against our priorities.
Let me give you a sense of where I'm seeing progress. These fall mostly into the areas of market performance, cost
management and talent development. First, we delivered improved performance in some of our key geographic
markets. In Brazil, we strengthened the management team and they are making important improvements in the
business. As I said before, this is a very management intensive business and it is critical that we have strong leadership
teams on the ground.
There is substantial work to be done to stabilize and then consistently grow Brazil, but the Avon Brazil team is making
progress. They are creating locally relevant product offerings with improved marketing and merchandising, and
importantly they've made substantial progress on inventory management and have built improved processes in this
area, and they continue to address service issues.
Likewise in Russia, we have a very strong team and the business is now moving in the right direction. We have a good
pipeline of new products and the Avon Russia team has taken an innovative approach to enhancing the representative
experience.
On the other hand, the U.S. is not delivering the results we need. We continue to work through the process of
redistricting and are also increasing focus on improved marketing execution, and we've taken action to reduce cost and
improve efficiencies, but the business results remain weak. While the U.S. team is working hard to address the
situation, clearly this is performance that needs to be improved. As I've said before, we are committed to doing
whatever it takes to fix our U.S. business and we are working aggressively to put an effective stabilization plan in
place.
Next in the area of cost management, we've become much more disciplined and I'm seeing improvement across the
organization. Importantly, we've also made strides in inventory management and working capital. We've completed the
initial actions of our $400 million cost management initiative. This included a reduction of head count of approximately
1,500 and the closure of several facilities, including the Pasadena and Atlanta distribution centers in the United States.
And we've exited two under-performing markets; South Korea and Vietnam.
I'm pleased to say that we completed this initial round of actions with minimal disruption to the business and we are
continuing to aggressively address costs in the area of both SG&A and cost of goods sold.
As we announced in late January, we've appointed a new Senior Vice President of Supply Chain and Business
Transformation, Dave Powell. In addition to managing the supply chain, Dave will be leading business transformation
efforts to ensure we hit our cost management targets, and we put in place the processes to ensure those savings are
sustainable. Dave has a very strong track record of delivering results and I'm thrilled that he's joined my team.
Dave joins a number of other strong additions to Avon's executive team, and all-in-all I have a good management team
in place with a mix of direct sales and consumer products experience. And I can't emphasize enough the importance of
building strong leadership and a robust talent pipeline. We are keeping the organization focused on stabilizing the
business by growing sales, reducing costs, and improving talent capabilities. We are focused on what matters most and

prioritizing resources against the highest impact areas that will drive growth.
We also continue to challenge the status quo and identify opportunities to simplify our business ensuring that we
maximize our resources. In this vein, we are currently evaluating strategic alternatives for Silpada.
Finally, one of the things that I'm most encouraged about is the change we are starting to see in how the organization
works. We've put the representatives back at the center of our business. We have a renewed focus on understanding
consumers and are rebuilding our own employees, pride and product. And most important we're beginning to act as one
team with a common set of objectives and the shared purpose of restoring Avon to growth.
I will now turn it over to Kimberly for a more detailed look at the fourth quarter and year-end results. Kimberly?
Kimberly A. Ross
Thank you, Sheri. Today I'll start by providing a high level of the results for 2012 and then I will cover the quarter. As
Sheri said we're going to keep our common focus on the results since we'll be speaking with you again next week in
Florida.
Sales for the year were flat in constant dollars or down 5% on a reported basis due to currency translation. Adjusted
operating margin was 6.5%, down 380 basis points due to higher supply chain costs and mix which was impacted by
investments in unit driving offers. Actions to flow excess inventory, mainly in Latin America, also had an impact.
Additionally operating margin declined due to higher overheads, investments in RVP and negative foreign exchange.
Reduction in advertising partially offset these negative impacts.
We reported adjusted EPS of $0.85 per share and cash from operations of $556 million. We made solid progress on
working capital management particularly in the latter part of the year, and I'll come back to this in a bit.
With that said, let's talk about the Q4 results and then I'll also give you some color on how we're thinking about 2013.
During the quarter, we made some overall progress but we still have a lot of work to do to ensure that progress we've
made is sustainable and to continue to drive recovery in some key markets, most notably the U.S.
Our constant dollar revenue was up 1% for the quarter. On a reported basis, sales were down 1% impacted by currency.
Positive growth in Latin America and Europe offset weakness in North America and Asia. Units rose 2% given mostly
by Latin America in line with our strategy to grow units and regain market share. Europe also posted growth benefiting
from our focus on unit driving offers across all price tiers in that region. Price/mix was down 1% in the quarter due to
lower Beauty sales in North America and focus on unit driving offers. These items were partially offset by the price
increases in inflationary markets in Latin America.
Active Representatives were up 1%, largely driven by increases in Latin America due to strong additions in Brazil.
North America continued to decline double-digits due to lingering disruption from the redistricting. Adjusted gross
margin was down 130 basis points to 59.9%, largely due to unfavorable mix. This reflects the flowing of more
unit-driving offers in several key markets and actions to flow excess inventory, mainly in Brazil.
Adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points to 9.2% in the quarter. We were able to partially offset the gross
margin decline with better expense control. Net brochure costs were down in every region except Asia. Overheads as a
percentage of revenue and legal expenses were also down. Adjusted EPS was $0.30 per share compared to $0.39 a year
ago. With that said, let me move to the regional discussion.
Starting with Latin America, sales rose 7% in constant dollars, driven by increases in Active Representatives and units.
Brazil constant dollar sales were up 10% with Active Representative growth of 9%, benefiting from continued
appointment growth. Beauty was up nicely, driven by new products' success including Christmas gift sets, Color Trend,
Blue Rush Paradise and our continuing effort to drive trial and consumption of Avon Care.
The strong unit growth I mentioned earlier was the result of the strategy to grow units and improve market share as
well as offers to flow excess inventory. We saw strong results in Fashion and Home as we benefited from improved

merchandising and the price adjustments we took in quarter two.
While we are encouraged by the progress we made in Q4, Brazil's results are still being pressured by service challenges
and competition. We will continue to focus in 2013 on improving service and strengthening brand health by delivering
a stronger, more relevant product portfolio. Continuing to drive the Brazil recovery remains a key priority for our team.
Growth in Mexico continues but at a lower rate than in recent quarters. The 4% constant dollar growth was driven by
strong representative additions, though we continue to work on improving retention. One example is a new incentive
program we recently launched to build retention by providing insurance to representatives who achieve certain goals.
This will only be available while they remain active and we expect this to help improve retention rates over time.
I'd also mention that in Mexico, we are seeing some slowing in GDP growth and retail growth in general, which could
have some impact on results in 2013. We also expect a softer Q1 in Mexico as early signs indicate we missed the mark
on some of our merchandising decisions in recent brochures. We believe that this has now been fixed and should not be
an issue in future campaigns.
In addition, the timing of the Easter holiday in 2013 versus 2012 will reduce delivery days at the end of the quarter,
leading to a weaker result in quarter one in Mexico.
Venezuela was up 2% in both reported and constant dollars as growth slowed significantly. The growth was driven by
pricing as both representative growth and units were down. The economic and political turmoil remains high, impacting
consumer confidence, which is resulting in reduced activity. I'll come back and further discuss Venezuela in a bit.
Argentina revenue was up primarily driven by pricing to keep up with inflation but the underlying orders and units are
soft due to the economic challenges in that market. GDP growth is slowing, there is a high inflation and we are seeing
import and price control, and the local currency is devaluing as well. So we are conscious on the outlook for Argentina.
Latin America adjusted operating margin was 10.8%, up 50 basis points, largely due to lower net brochure costs and
improved bad debt. Distribution expenses also improved due to the elimination of the dual distribution cost last year.
Gross margin was impacted by the net effect of price/mix partially due to the planned flow of excess inventory in the
quarter as well as foreign exchange. Operating margin was also negatively impacted by higher RVP.
In terms of the outlook for Latin America, we feel good about early signs of progress in Brazil. With that said, we
expect quarter one growth to slow partly due to the timing of Easter. In addition we are watching Mexico closely given
some of the recent slowing as well as Easter timing which impacts Mexico more than other Latin American markets.
Moving to Europe, sales rose 2% in constant dollars, driven by 5% unit growth as a result of slowing unit driving offers
across all price tiers as well as an increase in Active Representatives. Active Representatives rose about 1% and
average order was up 1%. U.K. sales declined 2% in constant dollars. The sales decline was due to lower Active
Representative count. Average order was up, benefiting from the success of A-F33 as well as Christmas offerings.
However, we expect Q1 results to be softer as we continue to work through our executional challenges.
Russia sales rose 3% in constant dollars due to better unit growth driven by the flow of unit-driving offers across all
price tiers and an increase in Active Representatives in that market. We saw good progress in growing our Fashion and
Home category due to the success of seasonal brochures. In addition, we had success with our new higher Luxe color
line, which was developed specifically for the Russian consumer and appears to be resonating well.
Turkey sales declined 1% in constant dollars due to lower average order. Our execution in this market remains very
volatile and we continue to work to identify the key problem areas.
South Africa sales continued to grow, rising 8% in constant dollars in the quarter driven by a strong average order. We
believe we have now found the right balance in managing our order growth along with the right level of credit risk.
However, comparisons are more difficult in quarter one given that the change in credit terms didn't take place until
second quarter last year.

Adjusted operating margin in Europe was 14.5%, down 100 basis points due to lower gross margin caused by negative
mix due to planned investment in unit-driving offers. This decline was partially offset by improved bad debt and net
brochure costs, primarily in Russia. Looking ahead, we expect current trends to continue in Europe.
Turning to North America, the region remains challenging and reported a 12% sales decline. Active Representative
count remains soft as we continue to experience disruption from the redistricting. Average order was up 1%, which is a
decline from recent quarters. The weakening was due to softness in our new product launches as well as poor reception
to our current year Christmas offerings compared with a stronger offer last year. Additionally, sales at Silpada were
down 18% due to lower average order and a decline in Active Representatives.
Adjusted North America operating margin was 5.2%, up 160 basis points due to lower overhead expenses, primarily
from lower compensation costs related to the redistricting initiative. We also had lower advertising. Additionally gross
margin was up due to improvements in Silpada resulting from the lower price of silver and more positive product mix.
Increases in RVP were an offset.
In the near term, trends in North America are likely to remain soft as we won't lap the redistricting changes until
quarter three. We have a new recruiting and retention campaign in place this quarter to stimulate recruitment coupled
with a focus on retention but there is still more work to be done. In addition to the redistricting benefits taking longer
than we expected, we need to improve our marketing and merchandising execution. We have recently made changes to
our marketing team in the U.S. but it will take time to witness improvements in this area.
Fixing North America remains a key priority. As we've said in the past this is a complex business and it will take time
to fix, but we are committed to taking whatever steps are necessary to return the U.S. market to health.
In Asia, sales declined 6% on a constant dollar basis due to continued weakness in China. We continue our focus on
independently owned retail locations, Beauty Boutiques in China. The Philippines was up 2% on a constant dollar basis
due to growth in Active Representatives and average order. This growth is slower than in recent periods in part due to
the tightening of our credit policies in this market. We have some work to do to strike the right balance in this area over
the next several months. Some of our other markets were weaker as well including Australia, Malaysia and Taiwan,
though India and Thailand reported strong double digit growth.
Adjusted operating margin was 8.8% in Asia, down 80 basis points. This was largely due to weaker gross margin which
was caused mainly by unfavorable net impact of pricing and mix due to the flow of excess inventory as well as foreign
exchange.
Now, I'll take you through four adjustments we've had to our GAAP results in the quarter. The first is Silpada. As a
result of the weaker than expected performance in quarter four and corresponding lowering of our long-term estimated
growth, we have taken a non-cash impairment charge in the quarter of $209 million. As Sheri said earlier, we are
evaluating our strategic alternatives for Silpada. Secondly, we had charges associated with our cost savings initiatives.
We reported total costs to implement restructuring in the quarter of $58 million, primarily related to our most recent
cost savings initiatives. Third, in quarter four, we have recorded a benefit of $24 million in Venezuela relating to the
release of a provision associated with the excess cost of acquiring U.S. dollars at the regulated market rate as compared
to the official exchange rate. This provision was released as a result of capitalizing the associated intercompany
liability.
Lastly, in addition to the above items, during the fourth quarter of 2012 we determined that we may need to repatriate
offshore cash to meet our domestic funding requirements. As a result, we recorded an increase to the provision for
income taxes of $168 million. All of the above items, except for the restructuring charges, are noncash items.
Moving to cash flow; cash from operations for the quarter was $337 million, down $72 million from last year primarily
as a result of lower net income, partially offset by improvements in working capital. Cash from operations for the year
was $556 million, down $100 million from last year primarily as a result of lower net income and higher payments
associated with CTI restructuring initiatives. This has been partially offset by working capital improvements as well as
lower contributions to the U.S. pension plans and a payment in 2012 associated with a long-term incentive
compensation plan.

Working capital improved by 12 operational days with improvements in all regions. Inventory was the key driver as we
continued to make solid progress and ended the year down 9 days on an operational basis due to process improvement
and slowing of excess inventory. In addition, we had a timing benefit of about 3 days which will reverse in quarter one.
In short, we made progress in the year on working capital and we are working on further initiatives for continuous
improvement and to ensure that we sustain the progress we experienced this year.
Moving to the capital structure, this has been a key area of focus for me. Let me start by saying we are currently in
compliance with our financial covenants at yearend. In the fourth quarter, with the support of our relationship banks,
we successfully negotiated an amendment to our $1 billion syndicated facility to allow exclusions for certain non-cash
items such as the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency and the non-cash impairment of Silpada in China. It also
allows an exclusion for up to $400 million of cash charges for items related to restructuring and settlement of legal
matters. However, the process of renegotiating with our private placement noteholders has taken longer than we would
have liked and it has not been constructive. Consequently, we have notified the holders of our decision to redeem the
note, which will require us to pay a make-whole premium of approximately $65 million in addition to the $535 million
face value of the note.
We intend to repay these notes by the end of March and we are able to fund this from our cash on hand overseas. While
we're not pleased with the outcome, we believe it is a necessary step to remove the covenant uncertainty and allow us
to focus on the rest of our capital structure. The debt capital markets are healthy, and we are currently in advanced
constructive discussions with our bankers regarding the refinancing of our syndicated credit facility and the upcoming
debt maturities. We will keep you updated as we advance the refinancing activities.
Looking forward to 2013, we remain focused on driving sales, operating profit, and cash flow improvement. We are
managing to a very conservative level of sales growth, and we are putting measures in place to drive the necessary
sustainable recovery, but we aren't going to get ahead of ourselves until we witness clear signs of sustainable
improvement in key markets. And we continue to be diligent on costs so we are expecting some margin recovery but
modest at this point. Recall that we stated that the measures we've taken to date are not expected to benefit results until
the latter part of this year. As I've indicated in the past, in my experience, turnarounds tend to not be linear, so you may
not see a straight line recovery quarter after quarter in terms of the growth rate for both sales and margins.
As you saw, last Friday the Venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue the bolivar from 4.30 per U.S.
dollar to 6.30 per U.S. dollar. We estimate the one-time P&L impact on quarter one results to be approximately $50
million, primarily reflecting the write-down of net monetary assets and deferred taxes. Additionally, hyperinflationary
accounting requires us to carry some non-monetary assets, primarily inventory and historical costs where sales are
reported at the devalued rate. We estimate this will have an impact of approximately $50 million in 2013, primarily in
the first half of the year. As we've done in the past, both of these items will be adjusted for the purpose of our adjusted
non-GAAP results. In addition, had the devaluation happened at the beginning of 2012, it would have had an
approximate 2% impact on both revenue and adjusted operating profit, assuming no mitigating factors such as price
increases.
On cash flow, we continue to focus on driving improvements, especially in the area of working capital, and as I
previously indicated, sustainability is just as important as generating results in any given quarter.
With that said, I look forward to seeing you next week at CAGNY and now I'll turn this back to Sheri for a few closing
remarks.
Sherilyn S. McCoy
Thank you, Kimberly. As you've heard from Kimberly, we have a number of complex issues that we're dealing with to
move the business forward. Today, we have early signs of stabilization in some key markets, a strong management
team in place, and a disciplined approach to cost and cash management. We have a lot of work to do, and as we move
forward into 2013, there are likely to be a few bumps along the way, but with that said, I'm confident that we're in a

good position to continue making progress toward our goals.
I look forward to seeing you at CAGNY next week, and we'll now open the line for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Please note you will be limited to one question and a related follow-up question until all callers in the queue have posed
their questions. Please note once you've asked your related follow-up question your line will be muted once again.
[Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Chris
Ferrara. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hi. It's Bank of America. Can you guys talk a little bit more, I guess, about the negotiation
process with the private placements and the decision to repatriate the cash? And, I guess, can you talk a little about
what the implication is for credit costs – credit cost going forward?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yes. So this is Kimberly. I guess, let's start with the repatriation of the cash. So under the
accounting rules of APB 23, and I promise not to go very technical here, but every year management needs to assert if
earnings will remain permanently reinvested abroad or not. Due to the potential need for cash in the U.S., we were no
longer able to continue to assert that the earnings would continue to be reinvested abroad, and thus, we took the charge
for $168 million that is a non-cash charge. That then allows us to be able to bring cash back when we need cash and
however much we might need of those balances that are abroad, which will allow us to be able to meet any potential
obligations that we have here in the U.S.
So I think the key thing for us, as I said before, is we need it to move forward. We were not having constructive
discussions despite the fact that we put very different – we put different proposals on the table to the noteholders, so
ultimately, we just need to remove the uncertainty and move forward with getting our refinancings in place. And so
we're in very active dialogue at this point in time and I can't give you all the details of that but we're looking forward to
being able to say more in the near future on it.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks. Good morning. It's Barclays. I was just curious you guys mentioned sort of an
"innovative approach" to the representative experience in Russia. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're doing
there that's different?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure, Lauren. This is Sheri. The Russian team really came in and started looking at what
the local consumer insights were as well as starting to work closely with representatives. They have gone digital as it
relates to the brochure and online. They've done a terrific job on the social media front where they have Facebook
pages for their representatives. They've used Google in terms of people being able to find representatives. And then
they've worked hard to look at their sales leadership model and making sure that it was easy for people to advance from
a title standpoint. So they've really taken an integrated approach and really I would say contemporized the approach to
going to market so we've been very impressed with what they've been able to do and we're sharing those learnings with
other markets.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks. How long have they been at that? Because I think they – I'm just curious how
long it took to kind of get there on the sort of, you know, updating of and getting on to social media and online.

<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: They started working on this and they've typically been a little bit more advanced on online
than some of our other markets, but they really took a hard look at it beginning in the first quarter – first, second quarter
last year and also brought in some new marketing capabilities into their markets. So very locally oriented and that's
where they started focusing on local product offerings as well as the digital approach. So I would say several months.

<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi. Can you talk about just, like, the interaction between gross margin and inventory so they're
sort of unit focused which I agree with. How much of that is just cleaning up a lot of the legacy inventory that's in the
system before you kind of work on price realization? And how much of it is, like, the real sort of ongoing strategic
direction? And then could you actually say what the gross margin would have been if you didn't sort of flow some of
the stuff through or is that just too hard to calculate? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, Bill, the impact on the gross margin from the flowing of excess inventory is about 60
basis points. And to your comment about strategy, really looking at how we have offerings at all price tiers so if we
look at mass and we look at the value area, we look at core mass and upper mass, our focus needs to be that we are
getting people in at the lower level so we have to have units at that level but certainly we see the opportunity to trade
up, particularly in some of our categories.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Okay. And would you – how would you describe the inventory situation now? And I do have a
follow-up; I promise. Like, are you happy with the inventory levels or is there still a lot of work to be done to get some
of the legacy stuff out of the system?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: I think – you know, I think we made really good progress during the year, Bill, in 2012.
With that said, I think we still have a bit of work to do, and I think also we need to make sure that we have consistency
of the processes around the globe to ensure sustainability. So, you know, a couple of things we're doing is, for example,
going to rolling inventory days now versus a point in time, which will also I think help in the business to try to reduce
down peaks and valleys in our inventory. And I think some markets are more advanced with regards to really having
the process in place to ensure that we're really on top of flowing the inventories on a consistent and regular basis.
Also we are revisiting the lifecycle, especially on Fashion and Home inventories and we'll be shortening that down a
bit. So we'll continue to have some flow of inventories there. But, you know, it's – I would say we're making pretty
good progress in 2012 on that.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Great. And then the follow-up is if you look at the One Simple Sales Model and the
redistricting in the U.S., I know you did something similar in Mexico three or four years ago and there was also kind of,
like, a year and a half period of disruption, so is the U.S. implementation worse than Mexico? Why is it different? And
then maybe do you see light at the end of the tunnel?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, certainly the U.S. has had major disruption and it's a much bigger market and we had
a more – a larger impact as we looked at the number of people that were impacted. So it's taken us time to get through
that. I will say that as we look at our strategy going forward it really needs to be an integrated approach and we've been
very focused on the redistricting and the sales component of it. Our opportunity is really to shore up the brand and the
marketing and merchandising and that's where the team is really focused. So we have to get both of those working in
balance so we need to continue to work through the redistricting and the team is very focused on that with the

Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, from Citigroup. Just following up on the U.S. comment, first question, can you
remind us how big Silpada is? So what would the U.S. results have been ex-Silpada? But the bigger picture question is
within the U.S., you talked about I think some of the new products falling short of expectations and I guess could you
give us a sense of your confidence that you have a handle on the U.S. business? In other words, once you get through
the redistricting issues, do you have a sense for what drives that business and what you want it to look like and how
much money you need to throw at it to get it growing again? How you feel about the business? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. I think, Wendy, it goes back to the point I was making with Bill. I think it's going to
take us time and we're working through the stabilization on the field, but at the same time, it is really important to make
sure that the – that we continue to improve the brand relevance. So a lot of our effort is on digital and social media,
making sure we get the right marketing and merchandising. We have made a change to the marketing organization in
the U.S. to get it more focused on understanding the consumer insights and making sure we're more relevant there. So
that's the area that I think we need to shore up moving forward and the area that I am going to be very closely focused
on with the U.S. team.
Our new CMO, who comes in, Patricia, she has also been looking at the total branding approach for the company and
will be closely working with the U.S. team because that's the area that I think we need to continue to strengthen.
On Silpada, Kimberly...?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. On Silpada, I mean, we don't normally break it down but sales are about $155 million
for that business in 2012.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, is it fair to say, Sheri, that kind of with the state of
the U.S. business that any margin recovery for the company next year is going to be weighted to the other regions and
the U.S. probably is still an area for reinvestment and less margin recovery?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. I think the way I would look at the U.S. is really to slow the decline and really to
prevent it from being a drag on the rest of the business. I'm not looking for it to contribute but we want to slow the
decline and make it less of a drag. Our focus is really on some of the developing markets in terms of the growth areas
and margin improvement.

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, I'm from Bernstein. Just to follow up a little bit on the thread that a couple of questions have
asked, just do you have any sense at all about kind of the go-forward costs to really start growing the business? Because
it looks like this quarter there is really good expense control and continued, I guess, stagnation or bottoming, depending
if you are a bull or a bear, of the top line. But with what we've been hearing from Natura spending more in Brazil, for
example, your own desire appropriately so to increase rep incentives and branding, some of the tax rates going up,
potential issues in Mexico and then of course the U.S., possibly Asia Pacific and Europe still being tough, do you still
believe like you did a quarter ago that you won't actually need to spend more overall as a company going forward?
And then perhaps, you can also talk to us in that context about a description you made of the U.S.,

"whatever it takes" to fix the U.S. Do you – like, how do we ensure that there's not going to be good money thrown
after bad? And does whatever it takes also potentially include just getting out of the U.S.?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yes, certainly, I think as we look at the opportunity for growth, I think there are a couple of
things that we need to be focused on. One is optimizing our geographies and understanding the role that each of the
geographies plays. So certainly making sure that we're investing behind the faster growing markets and we will
continue to do that. We also know that there's an opportunity to strengthen the effectiveness of our spend. If you look at
some of the decisions that we have made relative to putting money behind representative incentives or advertising, I'm
not sure that was as effective as we would like it to be. So, moving forward, we need to make sure that we focus the
money in the right places and focus on what matters most and make sure that it's effective.
As it relates to the U.S. market, look, it's a big market in general. It's only – if you look at North America, for us it's
about 15% of our sales but it's important relative to the brand name; it's important to continue to support that business
and we're doing everything we can to make sure that it's successful. Again, we're very thoughtful in terms of how we're
placing our resources and so we'll make sure that we're looking at the effectiveness of spend. That doesn't mean, Ali,
that we're going to get everything 100% right, we are going to – there are going to be times when we're going to make
mistakes along the way, but we're very focused on doing the right thing and building the business for the long term.
Thank you.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So you don't think you have to actually increase the level of spend overall? And then – that's one
question, and the follow-up really is just around the people. It sounds like you made some people moves. Where are
you on that trajectory, kind of what inning, if you want to tell us, are you on the trajectory of people moves? Thanks a
lot.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: And I've said this, I think repeatedly on the calls, that I fundamentally believe that people
drive results and that it's a very management-intensive business and we have to have the right local leaders and local
teams in place. I think we've made a lot of progress in that area and we're supporting people from an internal
development standpoint as well as supplementing external, and we will continue to do that moving forward. It's
critically important that we do that and make sure that people have all the tools they need to continue to drive the
business. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Joe Lachky. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Joe B. Lachky>: Hi. I'm with Wells Fargo. So I wanted to focus my questions on Asia Pacific and I guess you
recently announced you're exiting South Korea and Vietnam, and obviously you sold your Japanese operations a few
years ago. China's still down and it appears you're giving up on the direct sales model in that country. I guess correct
me if I'm wrong, but with the possible exception of the Philippines and India, it seems like every location is struggling.
I mean is that evidence that a direct sales model doesn't work in Asia? And do you have a growth or expansion strategy
for the region?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. Asia is certainly a very important region, and you look at the macro factors in terms
of growth and population, and certainly that's an area that I think has tremendous possibilities. I will say I'm
disappointed with where we are relative to that in terms of our overall footprint. I think we have an opportunity to do a
lot more there. If you look at competition, there are a number of very successful direct sellers, and direct selling makes
sense and works there.
I think some of the questions and challenges we have is whether direct selling works with our model in certain markets,
and so we have an opportunity to continue to focus in that area and make some decisions. We had made the decision to
move away from South Korea, not because it wasn't a good direct selling market, because it is, it's just we came in late,
given the amount of investment that we needed to put behind it, it really didn't make sense and we felt that our
investment would be better for other areas. But certainly I have my sights on Asia Pacific. Right now, we're stabilizing

Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Hi, good morning. BMO. Sorry. Just to follow up to Joe's question, and then my
question. If you were late to South Korea in direct selling and decided to pull out, is your focus now on the Beauty
Boutiques in China your decision that you were also late to direct selling in China as well?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, I think China is a complex situation, obviously, a very big market. We've had some
strategic shifts multiple times in that market, so kind of in retail – in direct selling, in retail, we've had challenges
relative to channel conflict. The way I would explain China is really that right now, we need to stabilize where we are.
We said last quarter we are predominantly Beauty Boutiques. We need to stabilize where we are, build the brand and
get the brand back because it's a very brand-focused country. Once we do that, then we can talk about the future. But
right now, our focus is giving the Beauty Boutique owners, the entrepreneurs, the tools that they need to build the
business and continue to restore the brand, and then determine what makes sense moving forward. Thanks, Connie.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: And that leads to my – that actually leads to the question I wanted to ask you, which
is, how has Avon's brand equity fared through all these years of disruption? I know it means different things in different
countries, but how has it fared and where do you see the challenges and opportunities for the brand?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. And you're absolutely right. It does, it's in different places in different parts of the
world. The positive side of it is we have extremely high brand awareness. There's a lot of goodwill towards the brand
and a lot of optimism that's associated with the brand. In certain areas, we haven't done a good job of making the brand
relevant and contemporary and I think we have an opportunity to do that, particularly in some of our more developed
markets and so we'll be focusing on that. And we have opportunity to make sure that we continued to build the
underpinnings of the brand, so making sure that the beauty, the packaging, the component all ladder up to the brand and
then as we talk about it, making it more aspirational.
So one of the things that our new CMO is working on is looking at brand relevance and brand health in a more holistic
way, and then we'll be working with the individual markets to improve the brand health and brand relevance.

Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: And good morning. It's Stifel. Curious how the underlying assumptions for
mid-single-digit revenue growth long-term and then the double-digit operating margin expectations have evolved as
you've had more time in the business. And then talk a bit, too, about where you are as far as representative earnings
potential is as well in terms of just how you've thought about that, where you need to be, where you are today. Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. So as we look at the goals that we've set forward, certainly from a top-line
perspective, if you look at where the beauty market is projected to grow over the next five years, it's projected to grow
about 6%. Developing markets are projected to grow about 12%, so double that. And if you look at our split of
business, we're about 75% in developing markets and 25% developed, so we over-indexed from that standpoint. And
certainly, looking at some of the innovation and capabilities we have as we went through that, we felt that was
reasonable.
Kimberly and I spent time visiting all of our top markets to understand their growth potential as well as where they
were from an operating margin perspective. And as we looked at that coupled with building the plans from bottom up

as it relates to 2013 and some other things, we felt comfortable with that. That doesn't mean they're not aggressive
goals, but those are the things that we felt that were important to put a stake in the ground, get the organization focused
on that, and we're very confident that we're going to continue moving forward and delivering on our goals.
As it relates to the representative earnings, again, it varies and it's – in a little bit of different places in different parts of
the world. I think we have an opportunity to always make sure that we are listening to our representatives,
understanding how we make it clear for them to earn, putting the right product portfolio in place and then making sure
that the incentives allow them to earn. And so I think we have places where we've done a nice job, there are other areas
where we have work.
So it's a very broad question, but I think we have an opportunity to continue to focus on that. And one of the things I've
talked a lot about with the organization is making sure that the representatives and the consumer is at the center. We
need to make sure that we're continuing to evolve with the market and making sure, for example, where we have digital
applications or we have different ways of getting service to them, those are things that – we have to make it easy for her
to earn. And we are very committed to doing that and we have a lot of work underway in the various regions to drive
that piece.

Your next question comes from Greg Hessler. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Greg Hessler>: Yeah, hi. It's Bank of America. I just wanted to dig deeper on the comments about the plans to
take out the private placement notes. Do you – I guess, do you plan to use the proceeds from the repatriated cash to take
those notes out of the make-whole? And then my second question, the follow-up would just be, would you ultimately
plan to term out – to basically term out those notes via some sort of refinancing? I guess I was just a little confused on
your comments, what exactly you plan to refinance versus what you plan to pay down with cash on hand.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: I think my comment was that if we needed to, we can – we have sufficient cash to pay down
those notes. But we are in very advanced discussions with our bank groups with regards to working on refinancing both
of our credit facility as well as refinancing of upcoming maturities. So, again, we'll provide you the detail as we move
forward. And I think the good news is, is the capital markets are healthy at this point in time, and we've removed the
uncertainty now by making it clear what we're doing with regards to the term notes. So all of our focus now is moving
on very quickly getting refinancing in place.

<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, everyone. Consumer Edge Research. I would like to – if you can comment on
Brazil and you can help us understand the impact of the – flowing the excess inventory by breaking out the 10% local
sales growth into volume growth and pricing. Also, if you consider Q4 as to be a clear sign of sustainable improvement
given that yourself and Natura has been losing market share for two years and this market is growing at 18%. Thank
you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, as it relates to the overall performance in Brazil, as I said, we are happy that we're
seeing early signs of progress and stabilization there. Certainly, we recognize that we have a lot more work to do to
gain share, but we're moving in the right direction. I think the team is very focused on the consumer proposition, the
representative earnings and improving service. As it relates to the question on inventory...
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, so I think – yeah, it's very hard to break out exactly how much it is due to price and
how much it is to mix, I mean I internally call it mixflation because it all kind of comes together. What I can say is
obviously there was an impact with regards to the flowing of the excess inventory particularly in Fashion and Home,
but with that said, we also saw good movement of units in Fashion and Home because we're getting the right products

Your next question comes from Leigh Ferst. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Leigh Ferst>: I'm with Wellington Shields, and I was wondering if you could give us more information on how
you're going to stimulate the top line and perhaps give examples by regions or countries? Where are you going to focus
on the reps, the brochures, pricing, advertising, et cetera?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. I think that – and I'll talk more about this at CAGNY, we actually have three focus
areas as we drive top line growth. One is getting the consumer proposition right, which is making sure that we have the
right product offerings and market approach, 360 marketing approach. The second area is making sure that it's easy for
the representatives to earn and we're really – we see them as a competitive advantage. They are the social connection
between the brand and the consumer. So that's an area that I'll talk some about. And then the third area is optimizing
our geographies and making sure that we're putting the resources against those areas that we think that we're going to
drive the most growth. So that gives you sort of a top line of how we're thinking about growth.
<Q - Leigh Ferst>: Can you give us examples of differences by geography?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, certainly I think we have different – so as an example, we are much more heavily
skewed in fragrance in Latin America than we would be in Asia Pacific and so we will be looking at how we have local
offerings of fragrance in that market. We look at China; our focus needs to be on skincare, so there will be different
priorities there. We also have slightly different models from a sales model perspective and so we'll be evolving those
differently.
So it does differ by geography. I think we have the capabilities of doing that, but again we need to make sure that we
put the representative and the consumer and have the local insights in each geography to make sure we're addressing
that and there's areas where we're very similar in markets, cross-markets and there's areas where we're different and
understanding that and making sure we put the resources appropriate – appropriately is critically important.

Your next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: Hi. B. Riley Caris. Kimberly, can I just ask you to clarify on the cash flow, I remember
some very rough guidance you gave I think in the very beginning of the year that operating cash flow in the year would
be flattish in 2012, but I was a little confused about $100 million of unusual positives that I think you mentioned were
in 2011, so can you just clarify like were there positives in 2011 that then caused this decline? And so you meant it
would be flat excluding those positives? And I mean the operating cash flow level is the lowest it's been in like 10
years, so I'm just wondering how worried we should be; and I know you don't want to give guidance but I'm hoping
cash flow will grow in 2013. So can you just kind of comment a little bit on that? Thanks.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah, let me first start by clarifying, I did not give guidance for 2012. So what I gave at that
point in time was an example, and at that point – and at that point I noted that we had $100 million of pension
contributions that were made in 2012 that – in 2011, I'm sorry, that were not repeated in 2012. For this year, I think our
cash generation especially in the latter part of the year we saw improvement in it, again because we had improvement
in working capital, I mean working capital improved by 12 days. So I think the overall emphasis that we have
internally, we did this in 2012 and make cash as part of the incentive. So I think the overall mindset internally around
cash and working capital has improved. And we'll continue to focus on that during 2013.

<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: Thanks. And can I just ask one follow up? It has to do with a similar question that was
asked about Asia and direct selling in Asia. In North America, there's not really an identifiable Beauty business that is
doing well in Beauty direct selling in North America. Tupperware has a business; their business is declining and
actually had an operating loss in the fourth quarter. Do you have intelligence about Mary Kay and whether Mary Kay
grows in the U.S.? I mean what is it that tells us that Beauty in direct selling will work in North America? And if it's
not going to work, if you're going to have declines, even more moderate declines, then it seems like the cost cutting has
to be even more significant and very weighted toward North America.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, certainly. If we look at direct selling in general, not just Beauty, direct selling is
growing in North America. Avon is obviously the big brand in North America and with us declining it impacts the
overall. So my focus is on getting the brand so it is relevant and making sure that we define direct selling in a new way
in North America, and that's really where the energy will be focused; so still very committed to making a difference.
With that said, we are going to continue to drive cost out at the same time, but we need to make sure that we are getting
the brand relevant and continuing to work with our representatives who are very committed to our business to give
them the products they need to make them successful. Thanks.

Your final question comes from Nik Modi. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Yeah. UBS. I just want to get your perspective on advertising spend versus RVP. It looks like you
were able to stabilized the business but still moderating the advertising spend. So a couple years ago, advertising spend
was a big push. It didn't look like it was very effective. So I just wanted to get your early thoughts on kind of the role
each plays on Avon's P&L.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah, I'll talk about it from just an overall perspective. As we – what we need to do is
make sure that we are supporting our representatives, and they are ambassadors and in some ways they are media
because they actually represent the product and the brand. At the same time, we will use advertising where it makes
sense and where we have a differentiated story. But I think there are a lot of vehicles that we have to actually get our
brand voice out there, and word of mouth is critically important, which is the representative. I think we can do a lot
more from a digital and social media perspective and more grassroots component.
Advertising, it's very expensive to do it. You need to make sure you have share of voice. And we will focus it and
target it but we – I think we have an opportunity to really improve the effectiveness of our spend. And so when I look
at the buckets, in my mind, I don't necessarily break RVP and as advertising, I look at what's going to the
representatives to support her in her business and how we're continuing to build the relevance to the brand for the
consumer. And I think we have a lot of opportunities to use those two components together to actually drive our
business. And so it's not an either/or, it's looking at what's the key message and where it can be most effective to drive
our business.
