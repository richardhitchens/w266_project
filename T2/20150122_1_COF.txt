Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking
statements. For more information on these factors, please see the section titled Forward-Looking Information in the

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Crawford. Steve?
Stephen S. Crawford
Thanks, Jeff. I'll begin tonight with slide three. 2014 full year results reflect solid underlying performance across all of
our businesses. Consistent with our expectations provided at the beginning of the year, 2014 pre-provision earnings
were $10.1 billion. Net income grew 7%. And earnings per share grew 10%.
For the year, return on average tangible common equity was 15.8%. Our balance sheet remains strong with an ending
common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.4%. And we reduced our common shares outstanding by 3%, reflecting our
share buyback program that began in April.
For the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $999 million, or $1.73 per share. On a continuing operations basis, we
earned $1.68 per share. Pre-provision earnings of $2.5 billion were down $125 million from the third quarter, as higher
linked-quarter revenues were more than offset by higher marketing and operating expenses, largely driven by seasonal
and growth-related costs and investments in our technology and regulatory agendas that we have highlighted for you
over the past several quarters.
Provision for credit losses increased on a linked-quarter basis, as higher charge-offs more than offset a smaller
allowance build over the previous quarter. As you can see on slide four, reported NIM increased 12 basis points in the
fourth quarter to 6.81%. Average interest-earning assets were up quarter-over-quarter, driven by growth across our
segments.
Turning to slide five, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel III standardized basis was 12.4%, which
reflects current phase-ins. On a standardized fully phased-in basis, we were at 11.4% in the fourth quarter. We reduced
our net share count by 5 million shares in the quarter, primarily reflecting our share buyback actions. We expect to
complete our previously announced $2.5 billion buyback program in the first quarter of 2015.
We formally entered parallel runs for Basel III advanced approaches as of January 1, 2015, and we continue to estimate
that our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is above our target of 8%. Regarding the LCR, as of year-end, we estimate
that we are comfortably above the fully phased-in requirement for our consolidated company.
With that, let me turn it over to Rich.
Richard D. Fairbank
Thanks, Steve. I'll begin on slide seven with our Domestic Card business, which delivered another quarter of strong
growth and results. Ending loans were up about 6% year-over-year. Growth from the linked-quarter was also about 6%,
stronger than typical seasonal growth. Continuing momentum in new account originations and credit line increase
programs drove loan growth in the quarter. Purchase volume on general purpose credit cards, which excludes private
label credit cards that don't produce interchange revenue, grew about 18% year-over-year.
Revenue margin for the quarter decreased modestly to about 17.3%, consistent with normal seasonality. Revenue
dollars grew 5% year-over-year, in line with average loan growth. As expected, non-interest expenses increased
significantly from the third quarter. Strong growth opportunities drove higher marketing, and operating expense
increased to support loan and account growth as well as our continuing investments to be a digital leader and meet
rising industry regulatory requirements.

Credit trends in the fourth quarter were in line with our expectations. Last quarter, we explained that the third quarter
charge-off rate was unusually low. It was the seasonal low point for charge-off rate and also included the temporary
benefit from better than expected delinquency rates in early 2014. In the fourth quarter, charge-off rate increased 56
basis points to 3.39%. About half of the increase resulted from expected seasonality, and about half from normalization
of the temporary delinquency favorability.
The fourth quarter delinquency rate increased in line with normal seasonal patterns. Our expectations for the charge-off
rate have not changed. We continue to expect the quarterly Domestic Card charge-off rate throughout 2015 to be in the
mid- to high-3% range. We expect normal seasonal patterns throughout the year, including an increase in the charge-off
rate in the first quarter.
In addition to seasonality, we continue to expect that loan growth will impact the charge-off rate. As new loan balances
season, they put upward pressure on losses. While this impact on the charge-off rate will be modest at first, we expect
that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond.
In addition to rising charge-offs, we expect loan growth to drive allowance additions. For the full year 2014, the biggest
story in our Domestic Card results was the return to growth. Ending loans grew 6% and general purpose credit card
purchase volume grew 16%. Revenues declined 5%, driven by our choice to sell the Best Buy portfolio. Excluding the
revenue impact of the portfolio sale, full year 2014 revenues were flat, in line with average loans.
Non-interest expense declined 6% with lower operating expense partially offset by higher marketing. Lower operating
expense resulted from tight cost management across the business, lower acquisition-related expenses, taking out costs
associated with the Best Buy portfolio, and the absence of a non-recurring legal reserve that impacted 2013 expenses.
Provision for credit losses improved modestly with lower charge-off rate offset by additions to the allowance.
The re-kindling of growth along with our continuing focus on delivering strong and resilient returns enabled the
Domestic Card business to post strong net income while improving the quality of our franchise in 2014. Our card
business remains well-positioned.
Moving to slide eight. The Consumer Banking business delivered another quarter of solid results. Ending loans were up
about 1% from both the linked-quarter and the prior year. Growth in auto loans continues to be offset by expected
mortgage run-off. Auto originations increased about 25% year-over-year, driven by strong auto sales and deepening
relationships with our existing dealers. Ending deposit balances were essentially flat compared to both the
linked-quarter and the prior year. We've had an abundance of deposits since the ING Direct acquisition and we've been
allowing the least attractive deposits from Capital One's legacy direct bank to run-off.
On a linked-quarter basis, Consumer Banking revenue was up 2%. Non-interest expense increased $89 million or 9%
from the linked-quarter, driven mostly by auto loan growth, infrastructure and digital investments and higher
marketing. And provision for credit losses increased $24 million from the linked-quarter, driven by expected seasonal
trends in auto charge-offs.
For the full year 2014, revenues were down 3%, driven by the impact of persistently low interest rates on the deposit
business, declining mortgage balances and margin compression in auto. Auto loan growth partially offset these
negative revenue impacts.
Full year non-interest expense was up 3%, driven by auto loan growth and the change in the income statement
geography of where we recognize auto repossession expenses. Full year provision for credit losses increased $47
million or 7%, consistent with the gradual normalization of auto charge-offs and allowance builds for auto loan growth.
Full year 2014 trends show that our Consumer Banking businesses are delivering solid performance in the face of
continuing industry headwinds. While our auto business remains well-positioned, we remain cautious and continue to
closely monitor pricing, underwriting practices, used vehicle prices and other competitor and market factors. Returns
on new origination vintages are lower than returns in the overall auto loan portfolio, but remain resilient and above
hurdle. And in our retail deposit business, we expect that the inexorable impacts of the prolonged low-rate environment
will continue to pressure returns even if rates rise in 2015.

As you can see on slide nine, our Commercial Banking business delivered another quarter of profitable growth. Strong
loan growth continued in the quarter; although the pace of growth is slowing. Loan balances increased about 2% in the
quarter and 13% year-over-year. Most of this growth is in specialized industry verticals and C&I lending and CRE.
Loan yields declined 6 basis points in the quarter and 59 basis points compared to the prior year, driven mostly by
increased competition, lower tax equivalent yield, and our choice to originate more variable rate loans. The declining
trend in loan yields stabilized somewhat in the quarter.
Revenues increased 5% from the third quarter and about 2% from the prior year. Year-over-year, higher loan volumes
have been largely offset by declining yields. Non-interest expenses were up 4% from the prior year, and 9% from the
third quarter, as a result of growth in our portfolio and continuing infrastructure investment. Provision for credit losses
increased $23 million from the linked-quarter to $32 million. Charge-offs, non-performing loans and criticized loans
remained strong in the fourth quarter. The current levels of commercial credit results are exceptionally low and we
continue to closely manage credit risk.
For the full year, ending loans grew 13% and average loans grew 17%. Revenues grew 6% as volume growth was
partially offset by declining yields. Non-interest expense grew 13%, moderately lower than the growth in average
loans. Provision for credit losses increased $117 million from a negative $24 million to positive $93 million, driven
entirely by the swing from allowance releases in 2013 to allowance builds in 2014.
Our Commercial Banking business is well-positioned to navigate current market conditions. While falling oil prices are
likely a positive for our consumer businesses, we're closely monitoring and managing the potential impact of low oil
prices on our $3.7 billion energy portfolio. And competition remains intense in the Commercial Banking business,
pressuring margins and returns.
It's likely that the pace of our commercial loan growth will be slower in 2015, but we expect our Commercial Banking
business will continue to deliver solid results. Pulling up, Commercial Banking is thriving at Capital One. The business
has steadily and profitably grown to over $50 billion. We've built deep industry specialties and established great
relationships with our commercial customers.
I'll conclude my remarks this evening on slide 10. 2014 was a strong year for Capital One. As Steve mentioned, we
delivered 2014 pre-provision earnings of about $10.1 billion. We posted strong earnings. We strengthened our balance
sheet. We returned to growth in our card business and continued to prudently grow our auto and commercial
businesses. We improved the quality of our franchise. And we returned significant capital to our shareholders. We're
poised to build on the momentum in 2015.
Our expectations for 2015 include the impacts of the investments we've been discussing for several quarters. In our
Domestic Card business, we see attractive marketing opportunities to drive future growth. Marketing efficiency, cost to
acquire new accounts, and the net present value of our marketing investments are strong. We'll continue to invest to
drive and support growth in loans, deposits and account relationships across our businesses.
We're making significant investments in our foundational infrastructure and capabilities to be a digital leader. Banking
inherently is a digital product, and digital will transform banking over time. Capital One is well-positioned to succeed
in a digital world with our heritage as an innovative information-based company. We are committed to deeply
embedding digital in how we work, not merely bolting digital on to the side of our company.
We're also spending to continue to meet rising industry regulatory requirements. We're enhancing our capabilities,
infrastructure, and talent to deliver on the broad set of expanding regulatory requirements and meet increasing
expectations for risk management and regulatory reporting. And we're continuously improving processes for capital
and liquidity management, including CCAR and the new LCR.
Capital One is delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns today and we expect that that will continue. We have the
financial strength to invest in our future without compromising current financial results. Pulling all this together, in
2015, we expect growth in full year revenues driven by growth in average loans. We expect that full year marketing
and operating expenses will both be higher in 2015 than they were in 2014.

Let me turn to our efficiency ratio, specifically our expectations for the full year 2015 efficiency ratio. In July, we
articulated an expected range of 53% to 54%, excluding non-recurring items. We reaffirmed that range in October.
Since then, we've experienced a sizable adverse change in interest rates. As a consequence, we now expect full year
2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53.5% and 54.5%, excluding non-recurring items. This change in range is driven
entirely by the movement in rates.
We don't take this change in expectations lightly, but we don't believe we should make long-term business decisions
based on spot prices for interest rates. We continue to manage costs very tightly across our businesses while making
our planned expenditures to drive growth, be a digital leader, and continue to meet rising industry regulatory
requirements. These expenditures are essential to our ability to deliver strong shareholder returns on a sustainable basis.
We also expect that efficiency ratio will vary, perhaps significantly, from quarter to quarter based on factors, such as
day count, the timing of growth and associated revenues, and the timing of investments throughout the year.
Pulling up, our strategic priorities for 2015 have not changed, and we remain focused on the levers to create value and
sustain strong performance. We'll continue to pursue growth opportunities in card, auto, retail banking and commercial
banking. We'll maintain our long-standing discipline in underwriting across our businesses and our preemptive focus
on resilience. We'll manage costs tightly, while we invest to grow, be a digital leader, and to continue to meet rising
industry regulatory requirements. And we'll actively work to return capital to shareholders, as capital distribution
remains an important part of how we expect to deliver value to our investors.
And now, Steve and I will be happy to take your questions. Jeff?
Jeff Norris
Thanks, Rich. We'll now start the Q&A session. As a courtesy to the other investors and the analysts who may wish to
ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up. If you have any follow-up questions after
the Q&A session on the call, Investor Relations team will be available after the call to answer them.
Becky, please start the Q&A session.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. Rich, could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment both in
the kind of branded card business and in the retail card business? Maybe – I saw one of your competitors announced a
portfolio acquisition today. Are there any – I mean, any things you can kind of discuss in that area?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Moshe, the competitive environment in the card business, I would describe as intense but
consistent and fairly rational. Industry balances remain flat – I mean, have been flat for quite a while. Now, we're
seeing a little bit of growth. Of course, there have been some increases in marketing levels with respect to direct mail.
You can certainly feel in the rewards segment in particular, especially in cash-back products, a lot of competition. And
it manifests itself in their version of teaser rates, which is early spend, bonus offers. Long-term pricing, in general, has
been stable in the segments that we compete in. And, overall, while, again, I think it is intense, I would describe this
industry as pretty rational and more stable than the other markets that we compete in, most notably auto and
commercial. Now, that was the description of the branded card business.
The partnership business, which, as you know, Moshe, is sort of a deal flow business. And the – as one who has
certainly been around the branded card business for more than a couple of decades, the most striking difference
between these two businesses is the auction nature of the partnerships. And that has – that is the biggest factor that
leads this business to have, in my opinion, on an apples-to-apples kind of basis, lower inherent returns and the wildcard

of the marketplace and the nature of sort of auction prices that exist at any point in time.
That – there are a number of partnerships that are sort of "up for grabs" in the marketplace. I would stress that one of
the characteristics of this business is the significant majority of all partnerships actually sort of stay with the incumbent,
but they certainly go – nonetheless, most go through the RFP process, so there is fair amount of activity in this space.
And I am struck by how competitive that is. And certainly, we've been to some auctions where people are stepping up
and paying prices in excess of what we're comfortable with. But certainly, I would describe that as pretty intensely
competitive and one that we're going to stay very disciplined in.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Just as a quick follow-up, Costco Canada launched a couple of weeks ago for you guys. I
mean, could you – anything you can tell us about it?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, we were very happy to win the Costco partnership in Canada; and this, of course,
is, as you know, a premier retailer with an amazing customer base. That partnership, I think, is off to a very good start,
but that is very early days and – but it's a manifestation of the strategy that we have in the partnership business, which
is to try to focus more on the sort of premier players in the marketplace. And that is where – of course, there's more
intense competition to win these partnerships, but one that I think the players are more focused on really using these
partnership card relationships as a way to really drive value for customers and that lines up exactly with the value that
we think we can add.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good afternoon. Just – I noticed there was an absence of PPNR guidance; although you did
suggest that revenues would be higher in 2015, marketing and operating expenses would be higher in 2015. Would you
be able to provide us some PPNR guidance? Or does it sound like the revenue increase would offset the increase in
expenses, and, therefore, you would end up with about $10 billion again in pre-provision net revenue but with higher
loan loss provisions?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. Matt, thanks for the question. We didn't give you PP for a specific reason, but
what we did do is, give you a lot of the building blocks. First of all, we've said that basically revenues are going to be
driven by growth in average loans.
We've obviously provided you an update on the efficiency ratio. And, in addition, what we didn't do last year, but have
done this year, is give you a sense for where charge-offs are going in our biggest business, within card.
So we really are trying to provide kind of the major building blocks. The primary unknown for us is the ultimate
growth that we're going to experience in card. And that really contributes to almost every part of the income statement
in an important way and it's why we're reticent to be as specific on a particular number as we were in prior years.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Fair enough. And then in terms of U.S. billed business you had – what appears to be stronger
purchase volume in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis than many of the other domestic competitors, although
the interchange was a little bit, I guess, below our expectations. Is there some dynamic there that you can provide a
little additional color on in terms of the growth in the spending, but somewhat lower growth in the interchange?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yes, Matt. First of all, I want to say that the net interchange metric can have
quarter-to-quarter variability, because it includes partnership, contractual payments and international card, and we also
periodically adjust our rewards liabilities based on customer trends and redemption rates and things like that.
But even beyond that variability, and sort of if you look past quarterly noise, the phenomenon you're talking about is
real and that net interchange growth has generally lagged general purpose credit card interchange growth for Capital
One. And we would expect this trend to continue.

Our rewards programs have been and they continue to be very successful with, of course, flagship products like
Quicksilver Card, the Venture Card, the Spark Card for small business. We're also building a long-term franchise by
upgrading rewards products for our existing rewards customers, and in many ways consistent with the industry,
extending rewards products to some existing customers who don't have rewards. And there is some near-term
cannibalization when we do this, but it's all part of building a stronger, deeper customer franchise.
But the net effect of all of this, including leading with great flagship products, all of this contributes to that delta that
we think will continue although there'll be a lot of volatility in that between purchase volume growth and interchange
growth.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Don Fandetti with Citigroup.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yes. Thanks. Rich, I wanted to follow-up on the comments about the loan growth and the
potential variability. It seems like you have sort of a general sense of where things would be headed in terms of the
market, your market shares. Is the variability maybe private label? Can you just talk a little bit about where you could
go from here? Are you feeling like the 6% number could have upside?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: I think I learned quite long ago that when you have growth opportunities, trying to
predict the growth rate, at least from Capital – the way we do business at Capital One is just something that's not
probably in anyone's interest. Because the – just to reflect on how we make our decisions. We – as you know, we're a
fanatical information-based company; and across all the segments and sub-segments we're in, we are reading the data
that is coming back and readjusting constantly our choices and so on.
What you have seen from our commentary for a number of quarters now, and this commentary even actually preceded
when you started to see our growth numbers, is that we believe we're well-positioned to grow in ways that are right
down the power alley of Capital One and the product of having invested for years to have this competitive position and
this opportunity.
That said, I've been around the block enough to know that the market can change, and most importantly, competitive
dynamics can change. So what we do is, try to share with you a general sense of, and, hopefully, you can feel that
reflected in the comments, a general sense of – about the opportunity.
And I say yet again now, and it's been several quarters that I've been saying it is – I think we see a nice growth
opportunity in front of Capital One. I don't think we want to quantify this, but what we're going to do is seize the
opportunity as we have it and then, when windows of opportunity, if they change, then we change accordingly.
But this is why comments like we're – marketing will be up, and we think the growth opportunities for next year, that
would be consistent. And in many ways my message and the feel is pretty similar to the message I've been saying for a
number of quarters now.

We'll go next to Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I was just curious in terms of the efficiency ratio
guidance. Again, if you could just clarify, have you assumed any sort of interest rate increase in the second half of

2015? I know some other banks have. So I was just curious about that. And then I had another follow on. Thank you.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. So our interest rate forecast that we use is based on forwards. So, yeah, there are
some modest increases in the second half that we would have.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Okay. Thank you. And then, I was trying to think of the interplay between, say, your
consumer – and when I say consumer, I'm just thinking catchall, everything ex-commercial loans. But the efficiency
ratio dynamics between your commercial lending activities or Commercial Banking versus Consumer Banking, I know
many other regional banks have actually had significant pressure in terms of managing their efficiency ratio, primarily
because of revenue pressures. And so I was curious, from your standpoint, have you implemented any structural
changes to try to bring the efficiency ratio down in the Commercial Bank? And how do you think of the interplay of
commercial versus consumer? Are they moving in the right – in the same direction or one is offsetting the other? That'd
be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. Rich, I'm sure you may want to add to this. I think the biggest thing that the
industry's talked about with respect to the efficiency ratio is the rate environment and how that impacts pretty much all
of the businesses. And I think you saw a lot of commentary from a number of players that it would be difficult to
improve their efficiency ratio unless we had more of a normalization in the rate environment. And that plays out in the
commercial and the consumer business probably more than it does in the card business.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: And the other things that affect efficiency ratio, of course, is what's happening on the
cost side and the investment side. And if you think about the drivers of our commentary about efficiency ratio and costs
at the margin, one is growth opportunities. We have been stepping up increasingly sort of in the card business to invest,
because we see particular opportunities there.
On the commercial side, if anything, our growth opportunity is decelerating because of the choices that we're making in
response to market conditions. But those are factors that will play out over time. The regulatory costs are pretty much
all across the enterprise. And that's going in only one direction and I'd be pretty surprised if, over the next few years,
there's any forces that would move those cost pressures in the opposite direction.
And, finally, the investment in digital. And while digital is a big opportunity across consumer and commercial,
certainly, on a relative basis, I think the revolution is going to be greater on the consumer side and it's literally going to
transform all aspects of how banking is done. It's going to transform not only – people often think through the lens of
the customer experience, but really the whole way, the way retail distribution works, the way operations, marketing,
servicing and even something that's very, very core to how Capital One works, which is information-based strategies
itself. So this is a big deal on the commercial side. It's pretty much a revolutionary deal on the consumer side.

We'll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Thank you. Good evening. I guess I would – I'm trying to maybe reconcile between some of
the comments that you're making around auto and in still what is a very strong origination business for Capital One.
Can you just give us some understanding as to how you believe you're navigating what is increasingly a very intensely
competitive part of the market, please?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: So, Ken, we've been saying the same things for quite a while about the auto business.
And it sort of started with our comments for some – for many of the years right after the Great Recession started
raging, which is we went into this kind of – I don't think it's an exaggeration to call it sort of once in a lifetime kind of
confluence of events that led the auto industry, both from a growth and from a returns and credit point of view, to be
absolutely exceptional. And most of what we have seen happening since then is sort of a regression more toward
normal, if you will. And so what's happened, I think for Capital One and certainly for other players, is with each

passing quarter, the intensity of the commentary that people in the business make is increased.
But if we pull way up, we don't see things that would cause us to have great alarm about the business, but what we see
is just – on the pricing side, increased pressure. Although that's stabilized [indiscernible] (38:28) if I look at prime and
subprime, that's stabilized more recently; but frankly, in the prime space at a little bit below cycle norm. So things are
very tight there. In the subprime space, it's been steadily declining; a little bit stable of late.
On the underwriting side, the most noteworthy place that there has been any risk expansion has been in terms of terms,
and there has been significant growth of the over-72 month loans. But still things like LTVs, which is probably the
single most important variable, have remained, certainly on the prime side, stable and healthy; on the subprime side,
moderately increasing, but well below sort of pre-recession levels.
So more the way I would characterize this auto business is that we just have to stay very, very vigilant. And what I find
is our choices, sort of one dealer and one deal at a time, end up with the growth moderating in subprime. For example,
subprime has been flat at Capital One, I think, in originations for about, I'm guessing, since 2011, I think it's been pretty
flat, so that essentially all of the growth in originations has been on the near-prime and especially the prime side.
So those – I think that's a manifestation of our reaction to the marketplace and continuing to pursue opportunity where
it is prudent and where we can build deeper dealer relationships. But I would say – the important thing I want to leave
with you is, while – even new originations, you can see, have pound for pound kind of a bit higher credit risk than some
of the exceptional stuff of the past. The business that we are originating we still feel is well above hurdle and we like
the opportunity.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Okay. And just as a follow-up. In terms of your guidance on credit card charge-offs, it seems
that really what you're saying is that, just the seasoning of some of the recent growth is going to have an upward bias
on the loss rates that you're not really witnessing deterioration in terms of the underlying portfolio?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Absolutely. Absolutely. In fact, let me just talk a little bit about the credit situation in the
card business. First of all, it feels to us pretty much exactly the same as when we talked about this a quarter ago. But
just to put this in perspective, card credit has been exceptionally strong over the past few years. And our portfolio has
benefited from the improving economy and the generally more disciplined consumer. And our back book, which is
made up mostly of customers who weathered the Great Recession. That continues to show exceptionally low risk and is
very resilient.
We see great opportunities for resilient new business. But from the starting point of our highly seasoned back book,
most new business will have higher losses. So the credit performance of our new originations and our credit line
increases has been strong, and, in fact, it's meeting and – well, it is meeting and in some cases even exceeding our
expectations in a good way. And since we've returned to growth, I've been emphasizing that these new loan balance –
as these new loan balance is seasoned, they will start putting upward pressure on card's overall charge-off rate, and this
impact is going to be modest at first, but we expect it to grow through 2015 and beyond.
And we've been growing in the segments we've always been focused on. We continue to avoid the segments that we
think lack resilience even if they have quite nice returns in today's environment. And that is really the essence of our
credit story. And we wanted to make sure that people exactly understand what is the dynamic that is leading
charge-offs to increase. But back to the original question that you asked, this is not driven by a worsening of credit
performance of the existing book or anything like this; it's really the byproduct of our seizing a growth opportunity and
sort of the vintage math of that.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: Thank you. I guess a question on the revenue margin assumptions for 2015; I
guess implicit in – your revenues are going to grow with – average loans is flattish revenue margin. Is that a fair
statement?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Talking about card?
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: Consolidated.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Yeah. Plus or minus, I think that's right. We've got – card obviously is a big contributor,
the run-off of home loans is a positive on the other side. We've talked for a while about compression in auto and
commercial. And the biggest kind of unknown is what happens to the rate environment overall. So you put those all in
the mix master, our best guess right now is relatively stable.
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: Okay. And then I guess second question following-up. Rich, you mentioned kind
of the impact of lower fuel prices on consumer. I mean, how do you factor that into your guidance for next year's
charge-off? I mean, does that marginally benefit that ratio? And then just – I'm sorry, one quick data point question.
Steve, if you could help out on the tax rate for 2015? Thank you.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: So let me do the easier one first. Our tax rate will be – if you look at the tax rate for the
year, our best guess is it'll be plus or minus to the tax rate that we experienced for the year in 2014.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Sanjay, I can only just speak intuitively about the gasoline price impact. Obviously, that
would be kind of hard to measure at this point. The one reason it's hard to see is, of course, the sharpest drops in gas
prices have been just over the past three months. And any credit benefit from falling gas prices is going to be really
hard to disentangle from other economic effects.
But it's just clear that falling gas prices translates into the equivalent of a wage increase for most households. I do want
to caution, though, that the flip side of sustained low gas prices may be economic stress in geographies that are heavily
dependent on economic – excuse me, on the energy sector, so we'll have to keep that in mind. But just intuitively, I
think you have a pretty good net positive for consumers overall. We are not putting any of that into our own projections
and – but there is clearly something we're going to start to see if we can measure it. But, most likely, I think it's going
to be embedded in an overall economic performance.

We'll go next to Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is a little bit esoteric, but I'm curious if there
was any change in policy related to funds transfer pricing at the Consumer Bank either in terms of rate that you apply
or balances?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Short answer is no. My guess is, the reason for the question is, you're looking at the other
part of our income statement and the change year-over-year. And the biggest driver there was Treasury. I mean, there
are other things in there as well. We've got corporate items that run through, they tend to be lumpy; but the biggest
year-over-year change was Treasury. And there were several reasons for the improvement in Treasury in 2014,
including change in rates, hedging actions we took in 2014 to manage the rate risk in our balance sheet, and improved
securities yield because of slower run-off. And there were a couple one-time items in there too. We had roughly $70
million of expenses for redeeming a preferred issuance in 2013 that we didn't in 2014. The one thing we did do a little
bit along the lines of what you're talking about is, with LCR coming on, we continued to refine the way that we charge
our businesses for the liquidity that they use, so we were passing out more liquidity cost of the business, really
consistent with things like LCR.

Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much and good evening. Rich, in the past you've highlighted some of the areas
in which you are also seeking cost savings; I think vendor relationships was the one that's been mentioned and I think
there are few others. So I was wondering if you could just update us on the progress on those initiatives and whether all
of that benefit gets reinvested or whether some of it gets manifested into earnings?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well, Eric, there are a number of areas that we – well, first of all, across the board we've
been working incredibly hard on expenses for a long time. And this is, of course, in the context of headwinds that are
pushing things so hard in the other direction. And you can see over the – starting with – well, the second half of 2012
and through 2013 and 2014, the trajectory of operating expense – and, of course, some of that comes from deal-related
expenses that sort of automatically happened; we've also worked hard to make sure that we get the synergies we talked
about in the deals and drive out the integration costs and things like that.
Also though – other big areas of focus have been the area of procurement and we – you know, we've always sort of
worked hard at that by building a big centralized and almost the whole science about it and making it – have the feel
almost like a line of business, has been something that's even exceeded our own expectations. And we pretty rigorously
measure not just talking to ourselves about how things are better, but really a before and after kind of thing. And that
has led to some tangible; I mean, pretty sizable, tangible benefits.
Another area that, of course, should generate increasing benefit is in digitization. So a lot of the impacts of digital are
really sort of hard to measure and it really relates to the way we work. But things like going paperless, driving people
away from some of the more expensive channels into the digital channels, and some of the transformation in terms of
marketing to be more online and so on; these have affects that we measure; and the numbers are starting to grow.
On digital, just take digital itself, that is a net trade that has costs a lot higher than benefits, at the moment, in terms of
what you can purely measure, because we're investing heavily in digital. And all of our – there is almost nothing that
we're investing in digital where the primary objective is to save money. This digital transformation is such a
comprehensive revolution, it really allows for things to be faster and way better for the customer, a better associate
experience, much better control from a compliance point of view, more scalable; and, yes, lower costs. So right now
one of the important net negative trades is what's happening on just the pure cost side with respect to digital.
But by the way the overall economic benefits of digital – I would argue that an important reason that we're on the
growth trajectory, we're on in the card business, is, in fact, because of our digital success, not only in terms of the
customer experience but really in things like how we do marketing and things like that.
So this will – I believe the long-term payoff of the digital investment is going to be very significant; in the near term,
from the cost line, this is going to be a net negative trade. And, of course, the investment in the regulatory thing is very
substantial; and, of course, we know which direction those things are moving.
And the other thing on the cost side, of course, is the investment in growth itself. And there the biggest number is, of
course, marketing; but there are also operating costs that go along with that as well. And, as you know, Eric, we – that's
our highest priority for our own expenditures is just to make sure that we're investing in our own growth and those
investments will continue.
So net-net, one, minus all of that, needs to be just – there is kind of a fanatical multi-year quest to wring out every
single penny that we can. And all of that is – nets out in this number that I'm sure some people look at and say, well,
with all the growth and all the digital, somehow shouldn't that be lower.

We'll go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hi. Good evening, guys. Just first on the card reserve. This is the second straight quarter, I
think, provisions did come in a bit higher than some of us were expecting. And just given your outlook from mid- to
high-3% U.S. card charge-offs, how should we think about the reserve on top of charge-offs? Steve, is there a target of
13 months forward? How do we think about the right level that you guys manage to reserve to?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: So I'd go back to what Rich was talking about on credit, because that's really the driver
of our reserve, and it's not as simple nor would it ever be as simple as we take 13 months of anything; it's actually
looking at loss content in our portfolio. And there are two things that are really going on. One is the growth that we've
talked about. And unless you assume growth has zero losses, adding growth will drive up a need for allowance.
The second piece of it is a little bit of the mix movement that Rich talked about from an incredibly low and resilient
back book to a very much expected but higher loss front book. And as that becomes more of the equation, that is going
to drive up the loss content, which ultimately is reflected in allowance.
It's not a matter of not wanting to be helpful. To actually give you a sense as to where allowance would end up, we
have to accurately forecast 24 months of losses and 12 months of balances. And that's better than, frankly, anybody has
been able to do. And we think we're pretty good at looking how credit evolves. So we're not trying to be difficult. It's
just out beyond – particularly your delinquency roll rates, I think it's very hard to predict credit from a quarter to
quarter basis.
So, in general, one can think a little bit about how the balances are growing as being the first factor, and a trend rate in
losses being a second factor. But even that's not enough, because our balance growth quarter to quarter has a seasonal
component, right? So the fourth quarter uptick that you see isn't necessarily going to last throughout the entire year. So
we're actually trying to figure out which of those components are going to be more lasting.
So there's a whole bunch of things going in there. But I think you can see, since we expect growth going up, since
we've talked about losses going up, there's going to be more need for allowance going forward.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Got it. And, Steve, Rich has talked a lot about digitization. Can you size for us how big these
costs are and over what timeframe? We've seen a lot of other banks try to self-fund a lot of these investments and to
what extent do you think you can self-fund these? And I guess, just related to the near-term, can you at least commit to
PPNR growth in 2015?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Well, look, I think we said we expect to grow revenue and we expect our efficiency ratio
basically to be flat to a little bit down on a GAAP basis. So I would draw a conclusion from that that we expect PPNR
to grow. We'll leave it more up to you as to – by how much.
We're not going to go through and kind of evaluate how much of the spend is digital. I think we're trying to do a whole
bunch of things here, deliver very good returns in the near-term, but also make sure we can do that for the next 20
years.
And as we try and set our priorities, it's kind of cognizant of both factors. And so far we think we've done a pretty good
job managing that and plan on continuing to going forward.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: And let me just add to that that I want to go back to a comment I made before, and some
other banks may feel differently about this, but I think it may also manifest what we're trying to achieve here.
I think, in the long run, there's going to be very significant cost benefit from all these digital investments, but the
biggest benefit, and the reason we're doing it is, in almost all cases, not for that reason. And what I'm most excited

about is actually the opportunities to generate growth and to generate better real-time decision-making, to make better
credit decisions, and in the end build a deeper franchise though very significant improvements in the customer
experience and things that really create more loyalty and more stickiness with customers.
And so, over the years, it will be very, very hard for us to measure that, because digital and digital – I mean, digital
investments are more and more turning us into a digital company as opposed to a company that just tries to digitize
what they do, or the phrase I said earlier, to bolt digital on the side of a bank.
So it's more and more becoming, over a longer period of time, who we are in terms of how we operate and how we
make decisions and how information is used in the company. And if you notice, my passion about this is because I have
not seen – and probably this speaks for mankind as well over our long history. But, certainly, I haven't seen anything
remotely like this in terms of the ability to transform how a business works. The only parallel is – the thing that led me
to go out and build Capital One in the first place was looking at how information and technology we're going to
transform, starting with the card business and ultimately banking. This is going to be a very, very big change. And I
think its biggest impact will not be the impacts that they have on cost.
But what is also clear is that for anything as transformational as this, one has to, on a sustainable basis, invest to build
the foundational capabilities upon which the sort of digital innovation that the world can see will occur. And this is
going to be a longer journey, but I think it's ultimately as significant a transformation as what the information based
opportunity we saw 20 some years ago turned out to be.
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: And just one last thing. One other hesitation with separating out these expenses is the
overlap between our expenses. So things that one considers to be digital that also have enormous regulatory impact or
enormous growth impact, is pretty considerable. So the three things we've talked about that are growing – causing a
growth in investment kind of overlap in a lot of ways.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Yeah. The pretty much number one way to make sure that we're successful with respect
to the breathtaking number of compliance requirements is, in fact, automation. Just trying hard and making sure we're
well organized just doesn't cut it with the magnitude of what's going on. So it's just another aspect of the breadth and
depth to which investment in digital can really put a company in a very good position.
<A - Jeff Norris>: Next question, please.

We'll go next to Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Christopher R. Donat>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on the issue of the
provision as we look forward. Given that there have been a lot of changes in consumer behavior and timeliness of
payment, I'm just wondering if the assumption that new originations for card loans will have their peak charge-offs in,
say, 18 months to 30 months; is that based on what we're seeing sort of post-crisis? Or is that really based on what
you've experienced over the history of the credit card business? I'm just wondering if anything is there that might be
different this time around.
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Okay. Well, first of all, there is few different phenomena that are going on. When we
talk about our charge-offs, especially in the second half of next year and into 2016 going up as a result of growth, that
is the composite effect of all the different vintages of actions that are being taken. And I want to separate out a couple
of different effects. One is originations and one is credit line increases. These themselves have quite different
dynamics. They also have quite different flow in terms of many other metrics, including the timing of profitability and
cost in the near-term and so on.
But anyway, with respect to credit, I would characterize credit line increases tend to – right when they happen, they
have a benefit with respect to losses, and, then, over time, the charge-offs on a more delayed basis build over time.
Originations tend to – they have a momentary kind of benefit from the speedboat effect that they have, but then they

tend to peak earlier and then actually improve over the longer-term.
And, again, our credit guidance is just a sort of composite of all the different things that are going on. We have sizeable
credit line increase activity. We have very significant origination activity. That's been going on over the past year and
we hope will continue. And the most important thing we have wanted to do is just make sure that – as we started
signaling some time ago, the charge off math of this very good development for Capital One is pretty predictable and
we wanted to just make sure we got in front of that and that's what we've done.
<Q - Christopher R. Donat>: Okay. So no real change in either – from the originations or the credit line increases in
consumer behavior kind of pre-crisis versus post-crisis, right?
<A - Richard D. Fairbank>: Well – so not in terms of the shapes of these curves. The consumer behavior pre-crisis
was tended to lead to what turned out to be higher losses and a lot of things back then that was not nearly as cautious
the consumer is now.
So just about anything we do these days versus an equivalent action in 2006 or 2007, certainly we would expect, would
peak in a better place. But this is – and the main thing is – we're also saying is that, paradoxically, even as we are
guiding to higher credit losses, and, frankly, guiding to more growth in credit losses than it appears that our competitors
are, this is in the context of a very stable and good credit environment. It's in the context of originations that are coming
in very much as expected and consistent with what we've seen recently, and one that is really, therefore, entirely just
the result of charge-off math associated with acceleration of growth; and, then, frankly, going strikingly from a
shrinking situation into one of some pretty good growth.

Our final question this evening comes from Brian Foran.
<Q - Brian D. Foran>: Hi. I guess the only thing I had left was on the rep and warranty reserve. If you could just – I
guess any color on the $1.1 billion going to $700 million? Was there a settlement? And should we expect a reasonably
possible losses and that kind of stuff to come down in tandem?
<A - Stephen S. Crawford>: Well, the reasonably possible losses, we have to wait to the 10-K. But, yes, I mean, it
was settlement activity; that were the primary driver of the reduction in the reserve.
