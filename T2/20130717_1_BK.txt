Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everybody, and welcome.
As you saw from the release for the second quarter we reported earnings of $0.71 per share. This included an after tax
gain of $0.09 per share related to an equity investment. Now, looking at how our business model performed, we believe
we earned about $0.58, $0.59 per share on a core basis and Todd will take you through the numbers in just a moment
on how we get there.
Clearly the headline for the quarter was strong revenue growth across all of our businesses without exception. Total
revenues reached a record $4 billion for the quarter. After excluding the impact of the investment gain, revenues were
up 6%. It's a clear sign of how our business model benefited from better market conditions during the quarter. But more
importantly, it's a sign of our success and collaborating across our businesses to deliver solutions our clients need.
Turning to investment management, we continued to have strong revenue growth again in the quarter. This quarter,
investment management benefited from the 15th consecutive quarter of long-term inflows and improved equity value.
We had net long-term flows of $21 billion with particular strength in the liability-driven investment area, certain equity
and fixed-income funds. Our success in attracting new assets helped drive a 10% increase in assets under management
year-over-year to a record $1.43 trillion.
In investment services, fees also showed nice improvement across the board, driven by growth in asset servicing, issuer
services and clearing services fees. We also had a strong quarter for foreign-exchange revenues, which benefited from
improved market conditions, as volatility and volumes increased.
In terms of our FX business, we are seeing some growth in our traditional products, as well as our new product
offerings. We are also beginning to see the early benefits of our FX technology enhancements, and we expect those
enhancements to drive further growth.
Now, that's a theme running throughout all of our businesses. We are making targeted investments to enhance our
product capabilities, and it's starting to pay off. A good example is in global collateral services. Our investment in
creating an end-to-end solution for our clients' growing collateral needs is starting to show up in our revenue numbers.
Optimization and segregation balances have grown nicely.
We were also awarded a U.S. patent for a key process enabling the secure management of collateral. It's a
demonstration of our innovation in market-leading practices in this area, and it positions us well as new collateral
regulations continue to kick in.
Within investment management, we made progress on a number of fronts. In the Asia Pacific region, we have been
granted a license to establish a separately managed account business out of Hong Kong. And that's leveraging the
partnership between investment management and Pershing. And we are already in the process of closing our first SMA
client win.
We're also investing in expanding the Dreyfus share of the U.S. retail market, where we just launched our first
closed-end fund in a number of years, which has already attracted nearly $300 million of assets under management.
Now, last quarter, I mentioned how we have begun expanding our wealth-management franchise. During the second
quarter, we officially kicked off the next phase of our multi-year growth strategy. We are proceeding with plans to
increase our sales force by 50%, add private bankers, portfolio managers, and wealth strategists, as well as additional
sales support staff. The new hires will strengthen the sales teams in our current locations and establish offices in key
wealth-management markets. It's early days, but again, it's strong commitment to driving organic growth.
Meanwhile, wealth management is also focused on better leveraging the rest of our firm. For example, we recently
started making private-banking loans available to Pershing customers, and we're already seeing a nice level of
receptivity.

Now, we're also investing in our brand to help raise awareness that we have a more complete investment solutions. The
message of our branding campaign is beginning to resonate as clients and prospects are recognizing that we are the
only financial-services firm that can provide solutions across the entire life cycle of a financial asset, and it's our sole
focus as a firm.
We are working across the firm – whether it's wealth management partnering with Pershing, or asset management
partnering with Pershing or asset servicing – with everyone focusing on anticipating and satisfying clients' needs in
thoughtful, creative ways that competitors can't match. That's the power of our brand and the power of our firm.
The bottom line is we're making significant, highly targeted investments in our businesses, which come with some
expenses, but they are critical to driving future revenue and profitability. It's an investment in growth.
Now, a good way to sum up our quarter is this. We are pleased to see nice revenue growth across all of our businesses.
We remain highly focused on driving organic growth, controlling expenses, returning capital to shareholders, and
growing shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it over to Todd to take you through the numbers, and importantly talk a little bit about how we
are thinking about the leverage ratio under the new guidelines. So, Todd?
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review and will start on
page 2.
As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.71. That includes roughly $0.09 related to a gain on our equity investment in ConvergEx.
It also includes the benefit of approximately $0.03 related to the accrual that we took in the first quarter related to
administrative errors and there was also a loan loss provision credit in the quarter, so that nets to core earnings of about
$0.58 to $0.59.
Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis, total revenue was a record $4 billion, that's up 11% or 6% on a
non-GAAP basis. Our investment services businesses: asset servicing, issuer clearing and treasury services each
showed nice growth. Investment management and performance fees continued their upward momentum. FX and other
trading was up sharply and NIR benefit a bit due to higher rates.
Expenses were down 7%, and up 6%, if you exclude amortization of intangibles, M&I litigation and restructuring
charges. So that 6% increase was primarily reflecting higher staff costs which was related to improved performance and
some meaningful granting initiatives. Our return on tangible common equity was a healthy 25%.
Turning to page 4, where we call out some business metrics that will help you understand the underlying performance,
you can see the AUM of $1.43 trillion was up 10% year-over-year. That resulted from net new business and higher
market values. During the quarter, we had net long-term inflows of $21 billion, that was driven by strength in the
liability driven investments. We did see some strength in equity as well, and some fixed income funds. Short term
outflows were about $1 billion. Sequentially AUM was flat as net new business was offset by lower fixed income
market values during the quarter.
Assets under Custody and Administration were up 4% year-over-year to $26.2 trillion and that primarily reflected the
impact of higher markets and net new business. Linked-quarter AUC/A was down $100 billion, as the impact of higher
equity values was more than offset by lower fixed income values and also the impact of the stronger dollar.
Many of our key metrics show good growth on a year-over-year basis. Most clearing metrics were up, DARTs volume
and average long term mutual fund assets were again up quite significantly. Average loans and deposits in wealth
management and investment services continued to grow and average tri-party repo balances were up. The market value
of securities on loan was down as a decline in short interest continued to negatively impact demand and the number of
sponsored DR programs declined as we have exited less profitable programs but we did see a nice increase in global
IPO activity.

Looking at fees on page 6, asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year
increase primarily reflects organic growth and higher market values partially offset by lower securities lending revenue.
The sequential increase primarily resulted from seasonally higher securities lending revenue, increased core asset
servicing fees which reflected organic growth.
We had an estimated $201 billion in new AUC/A wins for an estimated total of $1.1 trillion in AUC/A wins over the
last 12 months. Issuer services fees were up 7% year-over-year and 24% sequentially. Both increases primarily resulted
from higher corporate actions and there were also expense reimbursements related to technology expenditures.
Clearing fees were up 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Both increases were driven by higher mutual fund fees
and clearance revenue. The latter reflecting the strong increase in DARTS partially offset by higher money market fee
waivers.
Investment management and performance fees were up 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The year-over-year
and sequential increase was primarily driven by higher equity market values and net new business and it was partially
offset by the stronger U.S. dollar and once again higher money market fee waivers.
FX and other trading revenue was up 15% year-over-year and 29% sequentially. If you look at the underlying
components, FX revenue was $179 million, that's up 14% year-over-year and 20% sequentially as we benefited from
higher volatility and increased volumes. The improvement was largely driven by the market, but there are early signs
that growth initiatives are yielding some benefits.
Other trading revenue was $28 million compared with $23 million in the third quarter a year ago and $12 million in the
prior quarter.
Investment and other income totaled $269 million in the quarter compared with 48 million in the year ago quarter, and
$72 million in the prior quarter. Both increases reflected a gain related to ConvergEX's recent divestiture of its
technology business.
Turning to page 8 of the earnings review, you see that NIR was up $23 million versus the year ago quarter and $38
million sequentially. Both increases were primarily driven by a change in the mix of earning assets, lower funding
costs, higher rates and higher average interest earning assets and the higher interest earning assets are driven by the
higher deposit levels.
The net interest margin was 1.15%, compared with 1.25% in the year ago quarter and 1.11% in the prior quarter. The
year-over-year increase reflects a higher average interest earning assets and lower yields partially offset by a change in
the mix.
Turning to page 9, total noninterest expenses and that's ex-amortization of intangible assets, M&I, litigation and
restructuring charges, they were up 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The increase in staff expense
year-over-year and sequentially was primarily driven by improved performance with the year-over-year increase also
impacted by higher pension costs.
The growth in software and equipment expenses versus both periods were primarily related to reimbursable customer
technology expenditures. The reimbursement for these expenses is actually included in our fee revenue.
The growth in business development costs versus both periods was primarily driven by higher corporate branding
investments and a number of client conferences. Lower other expense primarily resulted from a decrease in the reserve
we took last quarter that I mentioned earlier. In terms of any future liability related to this issue, the timing still remains
uncertain. However, we have lowered the reasonably possible loss estimate. Currently we are estimating a reasonably
possible loss of up to $100 million and that compares to our previous estimate of $175 million and that is after the
reduction in the reserve.
Turning to page 10, you can see that our operational excellence initiatives remain on course to exceed the original
target established in 2011. Our efforts during the quarter resulted in $150 million in quarterly gross run rate savings, as

the $13 million in incremental growth savings came with about $11 million of program cost.
In terms of the savings this year we continue our migrations to global delivery centers and we realized the benefits from
reengineering activities related to our boutique restructurings and real estate footprint consolidation efforts. We also
generated some savings as our investment services group continued to optimize their organizational structure.
As you can see on page 11, we've generated $892 million in gross Basel Tier 1 common during the quarter. As you are
thinking about our Basel III Tier 1 common ratios, our estimate at June 30 is based on preliminary interpretation of and
expectations regarding the Fed rules that were released earlier this month. At June 30, 2013, our estimated Basel III
Tier 1 common equity ratio, and this is under the standardized approach, was 9.3% compared to 9.4% at the end of
March. And that also reflects the impact of the rate rise on the portfolio.
As regards the supplementary leverage ratio, we feel it's early to provide a firm estimate of the ratio because the final
definition, mostly related to the denominator, is very uncertain at this point, but before I provide our estimate, let me
give you some color on the rules. The agency has released a final rule that included a leverage ratio and then issued a
draft for comment that increased the requirements for large banks, and raised some important questions on how it
should ultimately be calculated. Around the same time, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released a
consultative paper for comment with a very different approach, primarily to the denominator. So at this time, it's
impossible to know exactly where we are going to ultimately be.
That being said, however, as per the July 2 rule, we estimate our supplementary leverage ratio would be in the low-4s.
We also believe that there are good arguments that central bank cash and certain government guaranteed debt should
not be included and that would have a major impact on us. Just to give you a little background there, we have more
than $200 billion of cash and government guaranteed debt on the balance sheet of $360 billion. So as we get more
certainty, we will update you where we think we stand.
However, we think it would be helpful for you to know that there are a lot of levers we can pull if necessary. So I am
going to walk you through a few of them now. There are a number of actions on the liability side where we could
reduce certain deposits and payables and we would expect to be able to do that with only a modest impact to our clients
and our earnings. We could also work to deconsolidate certain asset management funds.
As monetary policy normalizes, now remember this is a five-year implementation period, we expect our balance sheet,
which is already bloated due to this rate environment, to normalize. So there's no need for us now to urgently pull the
liability levers. Some of it should happen naturally over the time period anyway. We also have significant room to
reduce unfunded commitments, again with limited impact to clients and earnings.
We could also issue other forms of Tier 1, if needed, such as preferred stock, which is significantly less expensive than
common. Given our credit ratings we were able to issue noncumulative perpetual preferred this quarter at 4.5% and that
is a record low coupon, and we did that to replace some of the trust preferred that we redeemed in the quarter.
We also generate a lot of capital. Let me illustrate. Currently our FirstCall consensus for 2013 net income is
approximately $2.6 billion. In addition to net income we have over $200 million in after-tax intangible amortization
that runs through the P&L on an annual basis but it comes back into the capital account. So assuming our current
dividend payout and CCAR buyback plan this scenario would result in capital retention of approximately $800 million.
So that includes the $1.35 billion of approved buybacks.
Finally our business can grow without significantly growing risk weighted assets. That doesn't impact the leverage ratio
but it does the Basel III Tier 1 common. So let me sum this up.
There may or may not be some impact based on the final rule, and if there is, we have many levers to pull and a lot of
time available to us before we consider interrupting our planned capital actions.
Now, page 12 details the composition of our investment securities portfolio. You can see that at quarter end we had a
net unrealized gain on the portfolio of $656 million. The decrease from $2.2 billion at the end of the quarter was
primarily driven by an increase in market rates. In order to mitigate some of the impact to capital due to changes in
rates we've increased the percentage of assets in the held to maturity portfolio over past year.

Looking at our loan book on page 13, you can see that the provision for credit losses was a credit of $19 million, which
is identical to the year ago quarter. The credit was driven by the continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan
portfolio.
The effective tax rate during the quarter was 27%. That primarily reflects the impact of the ConvergEX gain, as well as
the termination of investments in certain tax credits.
A few points to factor into your thinking about the current quarter, now, traditionally third quarter earnings have been
impacted by a slowdown in transaction volumes and capital markets related revenues, particularly foreign exchange
and securities lending, which has also been offset by the seasonal increase that we have traditionally seen in DRs. NII
should be equal or slightly better than the second quarter as we benefit from higher interest rates and we would expect
lower securities gains in this environment.
The quarterly provisions should be around zero. Our merit increase was effective as of July 1. We expect the tax rate to
come in the range of about 26%. In terms of any future liability related to the administrative error, we really don't know
where the timing is going to be on that and ultimately where that will land. And finally we plan to continue to
repurchase shares during the quarter based on market conditions.
So all in all, we had a strong quarter across all of our businesses. With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Great, thanks, Todd. And Wendy, I think we can open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] The first question today is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: A couple of questions. One, on Todd, what you were going through with regard to
actions that you could take to manage the denominator. I was intrigued by your comments on your view that you could
lower the deposits without impacting business, lower your commitments without impacting your business. Could you
give a little more color on how you are thinking about doing that?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. Well, some of it is going to happen naturally as we go back to a normal rate
environment, we expect that to take place, Betsy, over the next five years. But if we had to take more direct actions, we
have, for example, encouraged some deposits to come on, rather than be out in money market funds, so we could
redirect some of that activity, for example, to reduce the deposit base.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: And do you think that you can raise awareness with your customer set as to the potential
impact if this rule was, you know, kind of required by the market to get there sooner rather than the end of 2018 as it's
currently described? In other words, are you going to have any help on the comment letter process from the client base?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Boy, I really haven't – I don't know, Gerald, whether you – whether we are going to reach
out to clients?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, I think the client impact, Betsy, which I think relates to your unfunded commitment
issue, is I think, many of the institutions are going to look at unfunded commitments in terms of their capital treatment
or their leverage treatment and so perversely, it may cause the industry to lower some of those commitments or let them

fall off so that they don't pay a whole lot and they have a high capital attraction, particularly in the leverage ratio.
So some clients may want to weigh in to the authorities that they may see some negative impact on availability of credit
as a result. We have not anticipated that in our discussions with the supervisors. You know, the main point that we are
going to talk to the supervisors and through the comment period is the treatment of cash at central banks. You know,
it's kind of perverse to think that we have to hold capital against cash that we hold at central banks. So the bulk of our
discussion or comments are going to be in that category, which is a meaningful impact to us as it relates to leverage
ratio.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay, super. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. I was hoping to dissect the NII picture a little bit. I
guess looking out for the next couple of quarters, A: I wanted to see if you guys got any benefit from the lower
premium amortization this quarter, and if you didn't, how we should think about it on a go forward basis and maybe
some sensitivity around that?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, Alex, we did get a modest benefit in this quarter and we would expect it to pick up a
little bit going forward as the number of the securities extended and therefore we amortize the purchase premium over a
longer time period. It was a little bit of the reason for the benefit, for the increase in the second quarter, and we expect
that to continue unless or until rates were to come down.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Okay. But no way to size it? Because I think you guys last quarter it was a fairly sizeable
number, I think 140. Any sense of where that stood this quarter?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I know what the number is, Alex, but it is a little bit misleading for me just to give
you the number. The actual number is larger but it's because of the mix of assets. So, the way to think about it is the
existing assets, if they got extended the amortization of that premium is going to be extended and that net benefit was
about $5 million or so for the quarter and we would think it would be more than that in the future quarters.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got it. That's helpful. And then the second question is on issuer services. I guess, A: I
wanted to clarify the expense reimbursement comment. I'm not sure if there's a way to size that and how we should
think about that: one-time in nature or maybe more a recurring event? And then maybe just the broader backdrop of
higher interest rates on the issuer services business because it does look like the, you know, debt issuance activity
around the world is likely to slow.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Why don't I take the first part of that question and I can turn it over to Tim for the second
part. Now I forget what the first part of the question was.
<A>: It was about the reimbursement.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: The reimbursement, I'm sorry. The reimbursement was about half of the increase in the
issuers – in the corporate trust component of the issuer services line, Alex, and that's kind of an episodic thing for us.
From time to time, we see it, so we agree to take on whatever expenses are to meet the client's needs and that gets paid
to us on the revenue side. You see it typically it matches up. It doesn't always match up in the same quarter but
typically it matches up in the same quarter. We called it out this quarter because it was a uniquely large and we
wouldn't expect it to be that large every single quarter.
As regards to the impact of higher rates at issuance, Tim or maybe even Curtis could add to that.
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Maybe I will look at the new business pipeline. We have been encouraged, I think
particularly in the U.S. CLOs remain pretty strong. We have seen very good growth, particularly this quarter, outside

the U.S. and the pipeline is surprisingly strong in corporate trust, although as we said before, I would certainly
characterize new business that's coming in being priced a little bit lower and thinner than what we see rolling off. And I
know you didn't ask, but I would also say the pipeline in the DR business has picked up nicely. So I'm encouraged by
the outlook on the issuer services side.
Curtis, I don't know if you have a point of view on interest rates.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yes, our pipeline going into the third quarter is as attractive as it has been in a very long
time.
I would tell you that we actually had a previous pipeline in the second quarter that we were working through, and I
think in mid-June when said tapering dynamics played a role, and people thinking about where the world might be
going next, we did see people hesitate a little bit. But it does seem like the pipelines and the discussions that we are
having with clients are pretty promising.
I will tell you that I think that the other dynamic that's happening is that, as you know, we have a very large LDI
business and with higher rates. We actually have seen many people who were thinking about LDI being more interested
in actually coming into it. So I know everyone's looking for the great rotation, but I would actually tell you that there
are absolutely flows both ways from clients as rates have risen.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got it. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Josh Levin with Citi.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Good morning. Todd, you listed some levers you could pull to help mitigate the impact of the
supplementary leverage ratio. Could you quantify what those levers in aggregate could be worth?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: It could be pretty meaningful, Alex – I mean, Josh. So I think we could get there,
depending on which ones we pull. I think what we were trying to indicate, is if the rule is as it's currently stated we
could get comfortably in place over, you know, over a reasonable time period of a couple of years, well ahead of the
final ruling, without doing anything too dramatic.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Okay and on asset sensitivity, could you walk us through how we should be thinking about your
sensitivity to different parts of the yield curve and the shape of the yield curve, what really matters most for you?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: In terms of NIR, the biggest benefit we get is on the short end of the curve. So, we get a
little bit from the extension on the longer end of the curve from the extension of the unamortized premium, but the
short end is where we get biggest buck and that would kick in. The lending portfolio would kick in against a lot of our
free deposits since most of our assets are shorter duration. A lot of it is in the form of cash as we just pointed out and
we would also – we also get a pickup from the longer part of the curve on our pension expense. So, you know, 100
basis point increase in rate is worth probably about $60 million a year in our pension expense and if you put the
combination of higher rates and good equity performance, then we could finally see some relief in pension expense
starting next year.
Also, as it pulls in the probability of an earlier Fed move, there's going to be – there's going to be some value reflected
properly in the LIBOR curve which helps a number of our businesses, including sec lending.

<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Hi, guys.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Morning.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Yeah, so last quarter, you noted that you rarely lose a lot of business in the servicing
business, but a back of the envelope analysis, using your quarterly disclosures on gross wins suggests that net new
business is roughly flat over the last three years, if I back off market appreciation and deals. So, I'm not sure what we
might be missing on the calculations. I just thought maybe you would comment on what you believe the organic trends
look like in the business and perhaps offer a little perspective on why you and your competitors aren't a little more
transparent around those trends?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Tim, do you want to take that one?
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Yeah, I would say, we track a lot of things. I would say we have been a net winner.
We track net wins versus net losses. I think one good point for our industry is we see a lot more clients outsourcing,
about a third of our pipeline in new business is new business for our industry versus takeaways from the competition.
I'm encouraged, if you put securities lending aside and our core asset servicing business you would see our fees
growing at 6% versus AUC growing at 4. It's always good for us if you look at a new client versus organic growth.
New clients bring generally more expense with it. So I think it's actually a good sign that we see net new and organic
tilting towards organic because it has less expense with it. And I think we are also seeing our investments in,
particularly collateral services, which Gerald outlined, is a big driver of our new business pipeline. So, you know, the
things we look at net new, are we winning more than we lose? Yes, we are. Win rate of 52% but I'm encouraged by the
organic flows and people coming back into the market.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And Luke, we don't provide a waterfall around our custody business but we do – it is more
concentrated in fixed income. So it – it did benefit from some of upside, but certainly less than the equity markets have.
So it's hard to decipher that just from looking at what – just from estimating as I think you have done it.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay. All right. Thanks, that's helpful. And then I was hoping you might update us
regarding the comments you made last quarter about the potential to announce some incremental spending to reduce the
complexity of your technology infrastructure and really just broadly give us your latest thoughts on where you stand on
the ongoing asset servicing technology race?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, sure, the – it's Gerald here. You know, we – it's basically included in the operational
excellence initiatives and the table that we've already outlined for you that we are continuing to produce quarterly. We
are making further progress. As you can imagine, it's part of our annual strategic planning process and getting ready for
the budget cycle coming up in the end of the year. We are targeting, you know, further investments and simplifying the
operating platform that will yield, you know, longer term expense benefits. We are not ready to publish those numbers
for you yet, but it is part of our psyche to go after that even more aggressively than we have in the past.

investments you are speaking about, how important is it, you know, for you and the management team to balance that
with just achieving more positive operating leverage?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sure, no, it's a great question because we are, in fact, using some of those operational
excellence savings and reinvesting in the businesses that aren't yielding necessarily bottom line income right now, but
we are convinced and we are seeing it empirically in ourselves that the investments are starting to pay off.
I cited some of the APAC platform – the Asia Pacific platform, using the Pershing technology to introduce a separately
managed account offering in the Asia Pacific region. We have gotten approval for it. We have our first client for it. We
have several other clients lined up for it. So we have been bearing all that expense of both the technology and enhanced
distribution and sales capabilities in the investment management area. All of that expense is being borne in our P&L
today. We think it is going to yield revenues and earnings in the future. So we are trying to do that delicate balance of
reinvesting some of those savings in our future growth and delivering some profitability to the shareholders.
We think we have gotten a pretty good balance here so far. But it's something we talk about every day.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: But Howard, when we budgeted for this year, we recognized if we made these – if we
continued to invest in these initiatives it was going to have a negative impact on our operating leverage over the course
of the year. It just has to. And we decided that it was worth it.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Right, understood. Makes sense. Todd, just a follow-up for you. Thanks for all the thoughts
on the leverage ratio. I appreciate a lot of this is not finalized, but I was just hoping you could distill this conversation
down to two main points for us: One) What do you see as the ultimate impact on how you all do business and firm
profitability as you pull these levers if you have to; and Two) do you think this will change the amount of capital that
you are returning to shareholders?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, that's why I kind of walked you through the numbers and the numbers that I walked
you through in terms the capital generation and the return don't even take into consideration any growth we might
expect over the next couple of years. So before I go out and speculate on something like that, Howard, I need to have a
little more clarity around exactly what the rule is going to be.
In the meantime, just like we did with the Tier 1 common, we are not going to take any knee jerk reaction and change
anything until we get a good sense of where the rules are. The other thing is we haven't been managing to it. So if you
think about it, back when we – when the Basel III Tier 1 common rule was introduced and we first disclosed, we have
reduced our risk-weighted assets by 25% under that rule, under the advanced approach. We haven't had any impact on
our business by reducing that 25%. It's just optimizing and being more efficient. And we haven't even begun that
process around the supplemental leverage ratio or the new Basel III rule. So, you know, I would like to be able to take
some time, first of all to understand what the rule is, and to pour over the data before I answer that question.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Let me just add, if I could, as a reminder, you know, we do have a very different business
model than everybody else, where the supplemental rule is being applied. We are a very, very highly liquid
organization, as Todd pointed out. We have almost $200 billion of either cash or very, very high grade government and
agency securities on our balance sheet, and so yes, our leverage ratio, by absolute levels is relatively low, but it's
relatively low because we have a highly – we have a very different business model, that's highly liquid and very low
risk weighted assets.
We have to rethink some of the levers that Todd described on deposits, unfunded commitments, the treatment of certain
types of assets, et cetera. We think we have those capabilities within our tool set to be able to manage to the new
requirements over the course of time that's been laid out. So I do want to stress that we – that we do think we have
many tools available to us, long before we consider interrupting our planned capital returns.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Appreciate that. And thanks again for all of the early thoughts on it.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Thanks, Howard.

Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask you about the servicing business, a little bit of a follow-on
to Luke's question. You know, obviously you guys have a bigger mix of fixed income assets and we saw that you still
had really nice wins, $200 billion again. Can you guys help us understand the growth trajectory of core servicing
ex-securities lending from here and within that, just how do we understand the effect of the fixed income market
sell-off on revenues within that part of the custody business?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Tim, that's all yours.
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Yeah, well, maybe we start at investment services first. Todd mentioned the broad
based growth we are seeing in fees where we are really pleased that that's really across the board.
Clearing has been leading the way. We are seeing some interesting drivers there. We are seeing small and mid-sized
brokers get out of self-clearing. We are seeing private banks looking to us for our unique product set. You are seeing
core issuer services net wins and organic growth. We are seeing good uptick in our issuer business. So broad-based,
one point is we are delighted that the core business is growing, and we are seeing the new business convert.
Todd mentioned we are highly geared towards fixed income. So we continue to be aggressive on the equity mix. We
didn't mention that we have about $350 million left to convert, which is about twice what we did this quarter.
So it is a little harder. We are seeing less gearing to AUC in core asset servicing, also because outsourcing our
collateral and our transfer-agency and sub-transfer-agency businesses are playing increasingly important role in the
portfolio.
But as I step back and look across all of that, we like the fact that the core businesses are growing. The pipeline is
incredibly strong. Our win rate is high. And the new things that we have been investing in are pulling through. And
over that – over the cycle, that portfolio should perform very, very strongly.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And, Ken, maybe just to add, you know we do have a diverse set of businesses within
investment services and – which is a plus. And we are trying to rely less on fixed-income securities as the driver for our
businesses.
And so as Tim pointed out, Pershing is a very good example where it's a terrific platform that serves the end investor –
the end individual investor. As the individual investor moves more into equities and more into other instruments, that's
a plus for us. We see the DR business being more equity-driven. A lot of our asset-servicing wins have been more
equity-based or more fee-based, not tied to assets under custody.
So we are further diversifying our revenue streams and being less tied to fixed-income securities. That's a conscious
effort on our part.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay, understood. Thanks.
Then my second question is just related to operational excellence. The program has continued to have a nice quarterly
benefit where you are taking out more costs each quarter. And you are already at a $600 million run rate on an
annualized basis, well above where you were originally targeting for this year, and even closing in on the total program
costs.
I was just wondering, first of all, should we continue to see every quarter that there's still incremental costs coming out?
And then secondly, it looks like you are going to be well ahead of that original goal. Any chance you can size for us
how far ahead you might end up being at the end of the program, relative to initial guidelines?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, sure, Ken. The – we are a bit ahead. I mean, part of the reason was we took some
more aggressive actions in the fourth quarter last year, related to our – to our real estate footprint, and we will start to
reap the benefits of those.

It does tend to be lumpy. So that there are actions that we are taking in a particular quarter that may pay off. So you
may see a couple of quarters where it could actually be flat. And in fact, we would have thought that might have been
the case, but we were able to do some more in the fourth quarter of last year.
Hopefully we are going to beat it. So we put out a target that we thought we could meet. We intend to meet it or beat it.
But as Gerald said, we are also investing in our businesses elsewhere. And we have used some of that benefit, frankly,
to drive – try to drive the future revenue opportunities.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. The next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Cynthia Nevins Mayer>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning.
<Q - Cynthia Nevins Mayer>: Maybe just a follow-up on the liabilities-driven investment. If the rise in rates spurs a
lot of clients to do LDI, does that lead to sort of a one-time spike of inflows followed by a lull? And could some of
those clients take those assets in-house over time, instead of using outside managers?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: There's definitely been a trend towards LDI.
The biggest part of our LDI business today is in the UK. One of our initiatives is actually to expand. We have U.S.
business as well. But we are really growing pretty rapidly in the U.S. and other developed parts of the world, where
pension funds have not been as aggressive in using LDI strategies.
So it definitely is a trend. And at some point, when LDI is fully on plain with the clients who wanted to go that
direction, I think you will see it leveling off.
I will tell you that some clients have looked at moving it internally, and in some cases, have done that. I think
managing their liability – again, liabilities across the world are of different complexity. In the UK, they have an
inflation component that is sometimes complex to manage against, and they work with us to do that. And I think clients
make different decisions on whether to do it in-house or not. But so far, I would tell you that the trend has been more to
work with investment-management firms, and we have been a real beneficiary of that.
Our investment firms that provide LDI services, one of the great things that they do is they really do understand client
liabilities. And those liabilities can be very defined, as in the case of a pension fund, or they may need a tremendous
amount of analysis, in the case of even individuals, high net worth clients, and a broader range of institutions.
So a lot of the intellectual capital and modeling tools around the liability side, I think, can be applied much more
broadly to the full universe of investing clients. I think it's part of what you see spawning the broader solutions
movement that's happened in the investment-management landscape, and we think we are extremely well-positioned to
be a leader in the solutions space, helping clients understand their liabilities and how to invest against those liabilities.
So LDI is absolutely a very large trend we expect to continue for a while. And we think that we are also
well-positioned to evolve it as the market evolves. But I really do believe that's years away.
<Q - Cynthia Nevins Mayer>: Okay. And then also I'm just wondering if you can give a little color on money market
fee waivers, your outlook there. And more generally, the impact of the very, very low repo rates and short-term rates
that you are seeing?

<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: I'll give an investment-management answer – this is Curtis Arledge again. I'll give an
investment-management answer, and then maybe Todd or Ken, if you guys want to talk more broadly.
We absolutely have seen an increase in fee waivers in this quarter versus a year ago. Some of that actually is – we have
been working to – as the rules have been proposed by the SEC, we see clients starting to think about what their
longer-term plan will be.
And we have absolutely seen – I think we are better positioned. We think that we are going to be one of the winners in
the new money market world. Institutional prime funds we think are going to end up taking less risk. The yields will be
different – will be less different – less varied across providers.
And we are – we think we are very well-prepared to benefit from an environment where clients are more focused on the
sponsor that they work with. Being the safest bank in the United States and doing really well in all the stress tests and
what not is definitely on our clients' radar screen. We have seen where we work with other parts of investment services
an increasing usage of us and our money market funds by clients that are coming to us either from asset servicing or
from Pershing or other parts of our company.
So part of the reason we have increased fee waivers is absolutely because rates are lower, but part of it is also because
we think our business is actually doing well. So there's a revenue offset to much of the fee-waiver business.
We have done a lot of analysis of our client base. We have looked pretty closely at the options that may play out when
reform actually gets put into place. There essentially are four paths that we think make up the bulk of where clients will
go in the money market world with institutional prime assets. For those that absolutely have to have constant NAV, you
know, many of them will choose going into Treasury and government funds. Again, we will lose revenue on the
institutional front side, but pick up some share of that revenue in our Treasury and government funds.
Some sub-segment of our client base has said that they will accept floating rate. It is not a large portion of it, but some
will. Others will stay with the constant NAV with liquidity gates, if both of those end up going forward as proposed.
And then finally, there will be some that exit that need to move to deposits or to other types of stable investments.
When we look across the whole thing, we think it is going to have an impact but not an incredibly large impact, some
of that driven by the fact that we have already seen a diminution of our profitability from the low interest-rate
environment.
So again, if rates normalize, we think a lot of assets will come back to the money market space. We think we will see
meaningful growth there, potentially. And it may not be what it would have been without reform, but we, again, think
we are well positioned.
Maybe the last thing I would say, this whole leverage ratio discussion, to the extent that – if cash and high-quality
assets, Treasuries, and agencies are not excluded from the calculation, and banks broadly end up owning fewer of them,
you would think that it would shrink the demand side of the equation and actually push short-term yields up, which
would shrink our fee waivers.
So there are some positive offsets to some of these leverage ratio discussions in our earnings profile.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And Cynthia, for the rest of the company, in fact, fee waivers are about consistent with the
size of our businesses. About 25 to 30% of the impact is felt by the investment-management side, and the remainder by
the investment services side.
It is largely driven by very short term rates, and the best correlation is just to the Fed Fund's effective, which inched
down a basis point or so in the quarter, and continues to trade at about that level. We've indicated in the past that it's
about $0.05 or $0.06 right now a quarter, with where these – where the fee waivers are running for the entire company,
in terms of the pre-tax income impact.
<Q - Cynthia Nevins Mayer>: Great. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Is there a little shift in terms of your emphasis on wealth management? It seems like you are
talking about it more forcefully at the start of this call.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: You know, Mike, wealth management has always a business we love. And I personally have
been a strong proponent of our wealth management business. I wish it was a larger percentage of our company. And
we're just making good investments in people, and in some of the infrastructure to make them more competitive in
more markets across the country.
It is a good business. It's a very sound business for us. It is a steady grower. It has good margins. It has all the right
attributes and utilizes our investment-management capabilities. So we think it's got all the right attributes for further
investment. So it's just one of the examples of – of many examples where we are investing in our businesses for
long-term growth.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I think I would add to that, Mike, these investments – of all the things that we do, the ones
that have the greatest probability of actually meeting our expectations would be this type of investment. But the
challenge is it is a long payback period. You invest and you see it two or three, four years out.
But we think we just need to continue because there's real value there to building this organically. It would be great if
there was something that would be a perfect fit, but there's not. We are going to have to do it organically.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then my second question. I know I asked it last earnings call, but each time I go
down to the courthouse for the Bank of New York hearing with the $8.5 billion settlement with Bank of America, I
hear some lawyers – I will paraphrase – I think they say that Bank of New York rubber-stamped the $8.5 billion
mortgage putback agreement.
I know you can't comment on the particulars of the case, but I just happened to be down there. I guess yesterday was
the internal counsel. And last time I was there it was the external counsel for Bank of New York. And my question is, if
the judge refuses to accept the $8.5 billion settlement, what would be the implications for Bank of New York?
And my thought process, which I invite you to correct, is that you only get a few basis points to act as custodian for a
lot of these fees. You don't incorporate the possibility that you have to expend a whole lot of effort for this sort of
problem-asset resolution. And so, if they deny the settlement, does that imply that you have a much higher level of duty
to the certificate holders that you act as trustee for?
<Q - Gerald L. Hassell>: You know, Mike, we think we have managed this process and our role as trustee in these
securities quite well. It's going through the typical court process. You are going to hear lawyers from all sides argue
their case. We think we have handled our duties properly. And that's all I can say.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I will just add one thing to that cost question, Mike. The agreements that govern the trust
provided by BNY Mellon as trustee – we are indemnified for any losses, liability, or expenses. So if there are higher
expenses, we should be indemnified for them.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: You know what I am kind of getting to – the price competition among the processing banks has
been tough for the last many years. If you look at processing fees to assets under custody, it's still very low. Each of the
big players has talked about being more selective in how they price things. Are you seeing any change in the pricing
when you act as custodian?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: You know, Mike, for the very large clients, the largest investment managers or sovereign
wealth funds around the world, it continues to remains very price competitive. And we try to win on service capability

and value-added capability, rather than win on the pure commoditized element of it. That's why the diversified business
model we have and the different solution sets we have to offer, we think, has put us in a positive competitive position.
The pure custody business is very commoditized, I'll grant it to you. And that's why some of the operational excellence
and some of the expense initiatives we have in place to constantly improve our operating platforms so that we can, in
fact, maintain our operating margins. That's part of the nature of the business.
Overall, the company's operating margins are quite healthy, and we showed strong revenue growth. We improved our
operating margin. And we are investing in our businesses for the future.
So we like these businesses. There are elements of it that are clearly commodity-driven.

Thank you. Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Todd, I know you have given some us some color on the supplemental leverage
ratio, and I think many of us on this call would agree you guys are clearly different than our largest banks. If you are
successful in convincing the regulators to allow you to deduct the cash and the government guaranteed securities on
your balance sheet, just that portion of it, would that put you over the 5% number, do you think, on the leverage ratio?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Gerard, I could barely hear you, unfortunately. I'm not sure what's wrong with the
communications.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: I will try again, maybe this is a little better. You gave us some color on the leverage ratio
and clearly you guys are different than the biggest banks. If you're successful in convincing the regulators that
deducting cash and the guaranteed government securities that you own and others would do the same from the
denominator, would that put you over the 5% by just doing that alone?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: If you deducted – the way to look at it, we have a $360 billion balance sheet and if you
deducted cash and the government guaranteed securities, that's $200 billion. So yeah, that throws us...
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: The answer is yes.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: That throws us way over. Under the way – and I always want to phrase this under of the
way they are currently proposing that it be calculated.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. And speaking of the leverage ratio, do you have an estimate for what the lead bank
ratio is, which is going to be 6% for everybody?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: It's close to where we were at the holding company.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. And then Gerald, finally, coming back to the wealth management business, what
kind of projections do you guys see in terms of future revenue growth from this initiative now to grow this business
pretty dramatically as you pointed out, I think you said 50% types of increases in staff and people. What do you think –
two or three years down the road, relative to where you are today, how much higher could the revenue be?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, I don't want to give guidance and speculation, but we wouldn't be making the
investment if we didn't think we could meaningfully increase the rate of growth in the wealth management business,
and we have – as Todd said, it's pretty predictable when we make these kinds of investments how the growth rate
actually increases. You are starting to see some of it in things like loans and deposits, which is the easiest thing to point
to where we've had meaningful growth already, we had almost a 20% increase in both of those categories
year-over-year. So it's starting to show up in the numbers already.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi, good morning, folks. Gerald, I think you mentioned in your earlier comments on the
collateral management initiative beginning to show up in revenue, maybe if you and/or Tim could talk about the
progress there that you are seeing so far, if you can quantify the revenue in the asset servicing number and then where
you think, you know, maybe a type of range we can think about that in 2014? I think you had previously said it was
more of a 2014 type of build. It looks like you are seeing some early returns there.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Right. As I said in my opening comments we are seeing it in the optimization and
segregation balances and then it's starting to show up in some of the fees. We are not breaking it out yet, you know. It's
basically included in the overall investment services fees but one of the reasons for the year-over-year growth is then,
you know, related to that. We were also seeing it in some of our secured loan category, which is part of the
optimization and that's one of the reasons why net interest income and our secured loans are up.
Tim, maybe you want to add some comments?
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Yes, Brian, thanks for the question. I still go back to Dodd-Frank is still only about a
third written; EMIR, the European cousin to Dodd-Frank, about the same. These regulations continue to be phased in.
The buy side is playing a more important role because they have to comply with these regulations as well. So we are
doing a lot of education of the clients.
Gerald nailed it. Between secured term, loan financing, the number of accounts we are segregating, the amount of
collateral we are reinvesting through our portal, all the vital signs there are very healthy. About a third of our asset
servicing pipeline is being driven by overall activity in collateral but I think the two areas – so I think the – those
services will continue to grow as clients are forced to put more of their derivatives volumes through CCPs and
collateralize them, so that will happen steadily over time.
And then the two services that are going to become increasingly more than important to clients, probably in mid-2014
and later, is segregating all of their collateral positions around the world and then providing optimization services on
top of that and we charge for both of those things. I don't know if that characterization is helpful but those are the areas
that we have been reinvesting in our technology capabilities.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: It is helpful. Do you feel you are most of the way through that technology investment? You
mentioned the patent that you were awarded, or is there still a significant amount of build out, you know to capture
those revenues out in 2014 and 2015.
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Yeah, I would say the majority of it is behind us, Brian. We are testing aggregation
now with a couple of clients, so yes, I would say most of that investment is behind us. It is now more, you know, the
ground assault and marketing effort in getting out and talking, mostly to the buy side.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: All right, okay, great, and then just one more for Todd. On the unrealized securities losses that
changed in the first – the second quarter, how do you think about that on the go-forward basis in terms of capital
management, you know, in context of your comments on the Basel III leverage ratio and your mitigation strategies? Is
it if we get a backup in the yield curve substantially faster over the next several quarters would you move more
securities to help the maturity or are there other mitigation strategies to that in terms of your capital planning?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes, we certainly take it into consideration and we model the sensitivity to it and we have
become a bit more defensive in both what we are buying and which accounts that we are placing it so that we could –
as we get closer to the ultimate days that the Fed actually does something, it will be less impactful. But securities are
still a big part of our balance sheet. As a percentage basis, it is something for us to keep an eye on.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Would you shorten duration then as a potential mitigation strategy?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Certainly shorten the duration that would be exposed to the capital.

<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: All right, okay, thanks very much.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you, Brian. Wendy, we have time for one more question.

Thank you, our final question today is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. I just want to follow up on the net interest margin you guys were up four
basis points sequentially. You said it did not really benefit too much from premium amortization this quarter, you
talked about an earnings mix shift but in the previous question, you are talking about potentially being more defensive
if you need to be in shortening duration. So how do we kind of put that all together? What drove the NIM performance
sequentially? Was it – was it taking a little bit more duration or how do we think about that in the quarter and then
going forward?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: There are two drivers. One is actually cost of funds declined. So if you look at our interest
earning deposits they declined by one basis point. One basis point doesn't sound like a lot but on $140 billion, it
actually adds up. So we went from 8 to 7 basis points. The other thing is we called our trust preferreds which fell
through the debt line. Those were relatively expensive. So we got a nice kicker from a reduced cost of funds and the –
then the other driver is mix.
So we did see an increase in our loan portfolio. We would like it to be a little bit bigger but we did see an increase in
the loan portfolio. We saw a modest increase – actually, the securities portfolio from period to period was about flat. It
was bigger on average, but from period to period it was about flat. So we saw a decline in the available for sale and an
increase in the held to maturity as we used that a little month more aggressively.
So we think that as – and the we saw a little bit of a benefit from the fact that the unamortized premium is going to slow
down. That was – that helped us a few million, $5 million or $6 million as well. So you take that into consideration on
a go forward, we are going to pick up the benefit from the – the benefit from the unamortized premium that will be
more than offset from allowing the duration to shorten a bit.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: So you would expect the core NIM to stabilize, but potentially getting more benefit from
premium amortization?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I think that's the way to look at it. We think we can hang in here without doing a lot to the
portfolio.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay, great. Thanks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.
