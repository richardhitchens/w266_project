Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the
forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the
various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.
It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jacek Olczak
Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
We had a relatively sound start to the year when one considers the difficult comparison with a very strong first quarter
last year. Our business fundamentals continue to be solid and we have a good momentum in key markets and segments.
In February, we provided a reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 of $5.68 to $5.78. We see no reason to change our
guidance today due to business factors. However, we have witnessed increased currency volatility and in particular a
weakening of the euro and the yen due to the economic crisis in Europe and changes in economic policy in Japan.
Accordingly, at prevailing exchange rates, we now forecast a full-year unfavorable currency impact of approximately
$0.19 per share, rather than the $0.06 included in our previous guidance.
Our revised reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 is therefore $5.55 to $5.65, compared to $5.17 in 2012. This
reflects a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of
$5.22 in 2012. This is matching the growth rate that we announced in February.
This is fully in line with our mid-term to long-term, currency-neutral, annual growth target, highlighting the continued
strength of our underlying business model and the robustness of our growth algorithm.
Let me now take you through our first-quarter results and provide you with our outlook for some of our key markets.
Organic volume in the first quarter was down by 2.1%, excluding the Philippines. This reflects three main factors. First,
we had a difficult comparison with a very strong first quarter last year when organic volume grew by 5.3%
year-on-year. This was helped by the leap year.
Second, there was a reversal of trade inventory build-ups that took place in several markets during the fourth quarter of
2012, ahead of expected tax and price increases. This notably impacted Turkey. And third, cigarette markets in the EU
region continue to be influenced by the economic crisis and high unemployment levels.
I would nevertheless like to highlight the fact that, excluding the Philippines, we achieved organic volume growth this
quarter in the Asia and EEMA regions, and continue to expect organic volume growth on a global basis for the full year
of 2013.
The decline in our volume and the overall difficult comparisons with the prior year impacted our financial results in the
first quarter of this year. Net revenues and adjusted OCI were up by 3.2% and 2.9%, respectively, excluding currency
and acquisitions. Despite this, our adjusted diluted EPS performance excluding currency was solid with growth of
8.8%.
Pricing continues to be the key driver of our income performance. Our pricing variance in the first quarter reached $531
million, significantly higher than that achieved during the same quarter last year.
Since October, we have notably increased prices in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, the
Philippines, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine and the U.K. In addition, last week, we
announced new prices in Germany. The favorable pricing environment is backed by the strength of our brand portfolio
and supported by an excise-tax environment which, with the exception of the Philippines, has been rational and
characterized by structural improvements.

Our market-share-growth momentum continued in the first quarter with gains in three of our four regions, and the Asia
region essentially stable, excluding the Philippines.
Marlboro volume, excluding the Philippines, was down by 2.2% in the first quarter, driven by cigarette-industry
volume declines in the EU. Nevertheless, Marlboro's market share increased or was essentially stable in all four
regions, excluding the Philippines. Marlboro achieved notable share gains of 0.7 points and 0.8 points respectively in
the EU and the Latin America and Canada regions during the quarter.
Our above-premium Parliament continues to show great momentum, with a volume increase in the quarter of 5.4%,
despite the trade inventory reversal in Turkey. Parliament continued to gain share in its key markets of Kazakhstan,
Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, while making further inroads in the Middle East.
L&M volume increased by 4.3% in the first quarter of this year, driven by its positive momentum in the EEMA region
and the resilient share performance in the EU region. Three markets stand out, namely Egypt, Russia and Saudi Arabia.
We are also pleased by L&M's renewed growth in Russia.
Let me now review what is happening in key geographies. Let's start with the EU. The situation in the EU has attracted
considerable attention, given the region's high level of profitability, and the depth and duration of the economic crisis.
Consumer-products companies have been suffering as average unemployment levels reached double digits and
continue to grow. The key driver of our 10.1% decline in cigarette volume in the EU region during the first quarter was
the decrease in industry volume of 10.5%, with a notably steep decline in southern European markets. This decline was
exacerbated by unfavorable trade inventory movements and fewer selling days.
Let me also remind you that the first quarter was the strongest for cigarette industry volume in the region last year.
While overall tobacco consumption levels remain fairly stable, there continues to be down-trading to cheaper fine cut
propositions and to illicit trade. Fine cut industry volume increased by 2.1% in the first quarter, while the latest
EU-wide study indicates that the level of illicit trade has climbed to 11.1% from 10.4% a year earlier.
Taking the distortions of the first quarter into consideration and based on our analysis of current expectations for the
remaining three quarters, we continue to forecast that cigarette industry volume for the full-year 2013 in the EU region
should decline broadly in line with that of last year.
We are encouraged by our market share gains in the EU region. Our share was up by 0.7 points to 38.1%, though I
should mention that this was partially flattered by the impact of competitive trade inventory movements. We gained
share in our five most important EU cigarette markets, namely Italy, Poland, France, Germany and Spain. We also
gained share in some of the smaller markets such as Finland, the Netherlands and Hungary, while market share
declined notably in Greece, the Baltics, Denmark and Portugal.
Our four key brands continued to perform well, highlighting our strong business fundamentals. However, our volume
was hampered by the prevailing very weak economic conditions.
Marlboro's regional share increased in the first quarter by 0.7 points to 18.7% as the brand performed well in its five
largest markets.
L&M's share was stable at 6.6%. Chesterfield's share was up by 0.2 points to 3.7%, driven by markets such as Austria,
Portugal and Spain, as well as geographic expansion. Finally, the Philip Morris brand gained 0.3 points to reach 1.9%,
thanks to its continued growth momentum in France and the success of Philip Morris Selection in Italy.
While the overall growth of the fine cut category slowed down in the first quarter, we again outperformed the
competition with an in-market sales volume increase of 7.6%. We are continuing to successfully roll out fine cut
variants of our leading cigarette brands, Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield, into new markets. As a result, we increased
our category share by 0.7 points to 14.1% and captured 48% of the additional industry volume.
Let me now focus on two of the most important markets in the EU region, namely Italy and Germany. The economic
downturn in Italy has been severe with a decrease in real GDP of 2% last year and an increase in unemployment from
10.1% in February 2012 to 11.6% a year later. This has resulted in a decline in consumer purchasing power, which, we

believe, was the main driver of the 9.5% decrease in cigarette industry volume in the first quarter of this year. The
second important factor has been an increase in illicit trade, the incidence of which doubled year-on-year. The fine cut
category, meanwhile, no longer grew following the reduction in the excise tax and price differential with cigarettes that
took place in the middle of last year.
We believe that the rate of decline of cigarette industry volume in Italy should moderate during the remainder of the
year. However, this is contingent upon the elimination of the previously planned July VAT increase. The underlying
fundamentals of our business in Italy remain strong. Our cigarette market share grew by 0.6 points in the quarter to
53.2%, as the continued momentum of Marlboro and the success of Philip Morris Selection in the international
low-price segment more than offset the decline of Merit and Diana. We are also continuing to gain share in the fine cut
category, with an increase of 3.3 points in the first quarter to 30.5%, thanks notably to the successful recent launch of
Marlboro fine cut.
German market was distorted in the first quarter by the leap year effect, trade inventory movements and an increase in
border sales. While cigarette industry volume was 6.6% lower in the quarter, we estimate that the underlying decline
was a more moderate 2.8%. During this period, fine cut industry volume increased by 1.2%. The German economy
continues to be resilient with low unemployment, and this has translated into more robust overall tobacco market trends
including a recovery in the premium cigarette segment.
Our business is in a good shape with our cigarette market share slightly higher at 36.1%. Marlboro grew by 1.5 points
in the quarter to 22.3% and achieved its highest cigarette share since the fourth quarter of 2009. This confirms the
positive response to our new Marlboro initiatives. While L&M's cigarette share declined by 0.7 points to 10.5%, this
reflected timing as the brand's share is sequentially stable. Importantly, we have consolidated our leading position
among young adult smokers with a 20% share for L&M and a 17% share for Marlboro.
Last week, we announced to the trade an increase in our cigarette retail prices of essentially €0.20 per 19 cigarettes
across our whole portfolio. This should come into effect at retail in May.
I will now turn to Asia, where we are continuing to strengthen our business. Our organic volume grew by 2.8%,
excluding the Philippines, during the first quarter. Indonesia was a key contributor.
Our cigarette volume increased by 4.9% in Indonesia during the first quarter of 2013. We again achieved a strong share
performance, with a gain of 1.4 points to 36.3%. As anticipated, the rate of growth has moderated as certain brands are
being impacted by the crossing of key price thresholds, in line with our strategy of regular price increases. Our share
gains were driven by the continued strong performance of premium Sampoerna A, which was up by 0.8 points, and by
mid-price U Mild, which was up by 1.2 points. Marlboro meanwhile expanded its share of the white non-kretek
segment by 4 points to 75%.
Industry volume was up only slightly during the quarter, after a 13.9% surge in the same period last year. For the full
year, we are forecasting a growth rate of around 5% to 6%, in line with the current 12-month moving average. The
resilience of the Indonesian economy, continued improvements in consumer purchasing power and the growth of the
adult population underpin the continued industry volume expansion.
In Japan, cigarette industry volume decreased by 3.2% during the first quarter and we forecast an underlying decline of
around 2% for the full year, in line with recent trends in adult smoking incidence. Our shipment volume increased by
6.9%, reflecting favorable distributor inventory movements.
Intense competitive product and marketing activities, notably around Japan Tobacco's morphing of Mild Seven into
Mevius, impacting the – impacted the Lark and Philip Morris brands. As a result, PMI reached a first quarter market
share of 27.5%, 0.2 points below that of the last quarter of 2012. Marlboro meanwhile maintained its share. We believe
that the recent launch of Lark Ice Mint 5 milligram and 1 milligram, a natural mint 100 millimeters product, and the
planned launch in May of Marlboro W-Burst 5, a double capsule menthol innovation, should enable us to resume a
more positive share trend.

In the Philippines, the disproportionate tax increase that took place in January has, as expected, caused significant
market disruption. In January, we increased our recommended retail prices of key brands by 60% to 70%. However, the
price of individual cigarettes, set by the trade, which account for about 70% of total retail sales, increased by a larger
amount in numerous outlets.
In the first quarter, our volume declined by 42.5% reflecting the consumer reaction to the higher prices, the prior-year
trade inventory build-up and the impact of the new prices on the trade's working capital requirements. Cigarette
industry shipments are estimated, based on Bureau of Internal Revenue data, to have been down by 39%. However,
Nielsen consumer off-take and our market research data indicate that cigarette consumption was down significantly
less. The difference reflects the aforementioned trade inventory movements and, in particular, a surge in illicit trade.
In March, we saw a sequential improvement in volume and provided the government is successful in its efforts to
improve excise tax administration, we still believe that the industry volume should decline by about 20% to 25% for the
full-year 2013. We expect some share erosion due to aggressive competitor pricing at the bottom end of the market.
Let me now turn to the EEMA region where we achieved a 1.4% volume growth in the first quarter of the year. This
strong result was driven by share gains in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and favorable distributor
inventory movements in Russia, partly offset by the anticipated reversal of the December trade inventory build-up in
Turkey.
In Russia, cigarette industry volume declined by about 5.5%. This was due to recent tax-driven price increases of
RUB6 to RUB7 a pack, which corresponded to between 9% for Parliament to 22% increase for Optima. In line with
previous years, we expect this decline to moderate once adult consumers adjust to the higher prices. We estimate that
the total market will be down by around 3% on a full-year basis.
Our volume increase of 1.8% in the first quarter reflected the timing of shipments to our distributor. Our market share
during the first two months of the year was stable at 26.2% with gains from above-premium Parliament, mid-price
L&M and low-price Bond Street and Next offset by declines from mid-price Chesterfield and super-low price Optima.
Turkey is an example of a market where a strong underlying performance was distorted by specific dynamics in the
first quarter of this year. There were significant increases in trade inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2012 that
were reversed following tax-driven price increases at the beginning of 2013. As a result, while cigarette industry
volume declined by 11.6% year-on-year, the underlying market showed a slightly positive trend, thanks to lower levels
of illicit trade. On a full-year basis, we forecast that underlying industry volume should be relatively stable.
Our volume was down by 17.4% in the quarter as we were disproportionately impacted by trade inventory movements.
Our market share in the first two months of the year was up slightly to 44.7% as premium Parliament and mid-price
Muratti continued their growth momentum, while Lark and L&M lost ground to competitive brands that were priced
lower at the bottom end of the market.
In conclusion, we expect to deliver strong results again in a very challenging year. We remain confident that despite
another difficult year ahead in the EU region, we should be able to generate organic cigarette volume growth on a
global basis, excluding the Philippines. We expect this year to again achieve the financial target of our mid to
long-term currency-neutral annual growth algorithm.
Our new reported diluted 2013 earnings per share guidance includes the latest currency rates and is $5.55 to $5.65. This
reflects a full-year growth rate of approximately 10% to 12%, excluding currency, compared to our 2012 adjusted
diluted EPS of $5.22. I should point out that we foresee our growth will be skewed towards the second half of the year.
We anticipate strong free cash flow growth, excluding currency, in 2013. We remain committed to rewarding our
shareholders through attractive dividends and substantial share repurchase programs. We will continue to judiciously
invest to reinforce the long-term prospects for our business. In the first quarter, we spent another $1.5 billion in share
repurchases. Since March 2008, we have returned a total of over $50 billion to our shareholders and repurchased 24%
of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin.
Thank you and I will now be happy to answer your questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hey, thank you. So it sounds like you're broadly reiterating industry volume projections for the
year in most places like the EU and like Indonesia. Despite what was a pretty poor volume quarter, so I guess the
question is, was Q1 volume worse than you had expected or was it pretty much in line with what you thought it was
going to be?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, taking into consideration. You remember in February, we said that we had about a 75% of
the pricing already implemented or announced for the year, which was pretty high compared to other first quarters in
the years before. I think it was rather expected that usually after that – after the price increases, there is this initial sort
of dip in the market and then the markets are coming to some sort of a recovery. So this was not unexpected.
But you also remember that in the first quarter for both PMI in total, but also specifically for the EU, first quarter of
2012 was pretty strong quarter. We've been almost growing at a 6% PMI, and the EU has just a decline of 1.5% in the
first quarter of 2012. So no, I don't think we had any surprise in the performance on the first quarter.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Thanks. I guess what I am trying to get to is whether – how do you feel about the 10% to 12%
on a constant currency? And whether you just – whether Q1 represents just a little bit more of an obstacle, relative to
getting to that number, but you just still had the flexibility to get there? Or whether there really is no change, and you
still feel like you are in the same place within that guidance range of 10% to 12% than you were before.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, I mean we are very confident about the guidance. You notice we are revising the guidance,
the February guidance, only for a currency.
I think the business fundamentals are very strong. The brand's portfolio performance essentially – all of our main
markets is pretty solid. We've had some distortions in a quarter, which I had been always mentioning in my remarks.
The only thing which I would like to add is that – I mean we clearly are looking in the second half of the year to be
somehow stronger than the first half of the year, right? For a number of reasons. We have annualization of some
increased spending behind the – mainly marketing and sales from the last year, which are going to have an impact on
us, especially in the first half of the year. There are still some inventory distortions, which will continue through the
second quarter of this year.
But all in all, I mean we feel pretty confident about the guidance. I mean all the risks which we knew are there. I mean
EU volumes, [ph] new (27:25) pressure on the volumes. Also Philippines, the initial impact are included and baked-in
in our guidance. And as I said, we are pretty confident on a 10% to 12% growth for this year.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: I'm curious – as we think about Italy, I recognize your guidance reflects no VAT increase.
Can you speak to the probability of no VAT increase occurring? And conversely, if you do see an increase, how would
that impact potentially your guidance for EU volumes?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I maybe start with the second part of your question.
I think we're still at this stage – despite the 10% decline of the reported volumes in EU for the first quarter, we still
think that broadly the rate of decline for the full year will be in a range of that which we had last year. So 6.3%, if I
remember correctly.
The underlying volume decline in the EU region for the first quarter we estimate was somehow in the range of 8%, if I
eliminate some distortions [ph] which were in (28:39) the quarter.
Italy is essentially the only market or the main market which we have on the watch-list in EU, as we still don't have a
clear clarity – what's going to happen with the announced VAT increase. I mean if you follow the politician's
announcement, no one, regardless of the party they belongs to, would like to have the VAT increased. However, in
order to – that wish to materialize, I mean they have to form the government and they have to change some legislation.
So we'll have to watch how the situation unfolds in Italy.
But I think with the exception of the VAT increase in Italy, I think EU still can be broadly with the rate of decline that
comparable to last year.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Fair enough. As a follow-up to that, can you comment perhaps on your outlook for
operating income growth in the EU? I think you've said in the past, you could hold your EBIT flat. But considering the
significant trade-down that you're seeing in the market, I wonder whether that needs to be adjusted downward at all?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, it's very much dependent again on the total volume [ph] but the development (29:53) in
EU. If news from Italy are positive, I think we can maintain the – all the profitability. [ph] If Italy talks will happen –
and then depends on the pricing, et cetera, actions – (30:06) that might have – this might have some impact on the
profitability in the EU.
But assuming my forecast of our estimates for the total EU volumes to be broadly in line of the rate of decline over last
year would hold, I think we can maintain the profitability.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Understood. Thank you very much.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: On the EU, with weaker volumes – not just for you, but obviously for the competitors – are
you seeing any change in – or an increase in competitive intensity? Companies going more for share than they might
have a year ago? Or is it fairly stable?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. No, whatsoever. I mean we had that pricing in a quite number of markets at the very
beginning of January or towards the end of the last year. So on a pricing side, I – we haven't observed anything. No, I
don't think there is any risk of that nature.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. And then in the Philippines, you mentioned, to get to 20% to 25% declines in volume
for the year, you need the government to crack down on the non-duty-paid dynamic. But that's been a historical factor
in the market. Is there any evidence that with prices up and the illicit volumes growing, that the government is taking

that any more seriously than it has in the past?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think there was a problem historically. You are absolutely right. Historically, we had some
problems with some non-duty paid domestic product. However, that thing essentially exploded since new tax kicked in,
and we increased the prices.
As I said, if we look at the consumption trends, I mean our estimate of the consumption trends in the Philippines at the
moment, as we speak – so this is still relatively early after the new prices hit the market – I would argue that the
consumption actually is in a – consumption decline is in a lower range of a 20% to 25% decline, which we foresee for
the market for the full year. The incidence – smoking incidence stays relatively flat at 50%. Actually flat at 50%.
And, yes, we do observe some decline in the daily consumption. As you know, market is very much driven – sorry, by
the daily consumption – market is very much driven by stick purchases. About 70% of the volume goes on the stick
purchase. And we see the daily consumption drop from a 13 to 12 sticks per day.
So you add these numbers together, you are actually in the lower range of a 20% to 25% decline.
We see our shipments volume and the industry volumes as estimated by the Bureau of Internal Revenues, and we have
a huge gap to reconcile.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We see that volumes in the market, so they're clearly coming from the illicit sources.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. And then just lastly, Jacek, on cash flow, you reiterated the objective of having a
growth year-on-year, currency-neutral, in free cash flow. But it's down quite substantially in the first quarter. I think
that's the second-consecutive first quarter with a substantial decline in cash flow.
Can you just speak to what happened in the discrete first-quarter cash flow? Why is it down? And then what's going to
be different in the remainder of the year? Thanks.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think the developments on the finished goods, receivables and the tax payables, excise tax
payables connected with corresponding volumes, build-up inventories – they actually improved.
We had one one-off item, if you like, which was the timing of the payment of the withholding tax on the profit which
we repatriate to the U.S., which happened to take place in the first quarter of this year. If I take that item out, actually
my free cash flow would be up.
So we're still confident that the free cash flow for the full year can grow actually at the higher rate than our earnings.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: And so that repayment cash outflow was later in the year last year, and it was in the first
quarter this year?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Happens to be it will take place in the first quarter of this year.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Judy E. Hong>: A couple of questions in Asia. So first, just in terms of your margin performance there, clearly
you had the impact of the Philippines volume there, but you had pretty strong volume in Japan, as a result of some
inventory movement. But the margins were still down. So can you just help us understand the margin performance in
Asia in Q1?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think it's mostly driven by Indonesia. The cost pressure – as you know, the clove prices – the
key raw material which we use in [ph] very (35:08) manufacturing – significantly increased over the last period. So we
have the pressure of that.
And pricing in Indonesia, where it has a tendency to be built over the year, rather than just at the beginning of the year.
So usually, you will have a slower start and you have a cost pressure coming from Indonesia. And at the beginning, we
cannot offset it fully by the pricing. And I think this should disappear during the year, and actually Asia should be able
to improve the margins for the full year.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then in Japan – so I think you called out share was down a little bit. Called out the
increased promotional activities from your competitor. So can you just elaborate sort of the promotional activity – the
nature of those promotional activities – how much do you think that that's in part driven by the currency movement
that's giving JT more of a cost advantage in that market? And do you think that will continue to put a little bit more
competitive pressure in your business, and how you're sort of responding to that?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Difficult for me to comment how JT is allocating their resources. But clearly the marketing
promotional spend – both in terms of new product introductions and the promotional support of existing products in the
market from JT in the first quarter – was massive.
And to that extent, yes, we lost some share on the Lark and Philip Morris. However, on a positive note, I haven't seen
the Marlboro losing [ph] adult in a (36:45) share. So frankly speaking, I would read it as a positive on Marlboro that
despite it's a very high spend from a JT, we maintained the market share of Marlboro. But I have to admit Lark and
Philip Morris, yes, they contributed to some erosion of overall share.
We have launched two Lark variants towards the end of the quarter – so we don't see them in the quarter – two
innovative, custom products behind the Lark. And we have also announced launch of a new Marlboro, highly
innovative – the first two-capsule product – which will hit the market somewhere May/June.
So our ambition is still to grow the share in Japan. But as I said, we are confronted with the massive spend from JT.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just lastly, in Australia, just following the implementation of the plain
packaging, what kind of consumption performance or trends are you seeing? And then what's happening in terms of
your actual volume?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay. In Australia, I mean we are roughly four months since the introduction of plain packaging.
At this early stage, the Australian market has not yet shown any significant changes in consumer purchasing behavior. I
mean the volumes in the quarter were stable and this compares – actually, if you compare that with the 4% decline
which happened – which took place in the first quarter of last year.
This reflected – stable volumes, I believe, reflect the impact of disruptions in connections with the transition to the
plain packaging last December, and there was some inventory depletions, et cetera, when manufacturers had to replace
the old packs with the new packs.
And frankly speaking, based on the first-quarter data, it would appear that consumer down-trading might have
accelerated slightly. But this trend, however, has been a part of the Australian market for several years, where the
consumers are showing a bit more sensitivity to the rate of tax and the price increases. And as you remember in
February of this year, there was a price increase, I think, of around 4% in the market.
So if I take all of these things together, in short, I think at this moment, the impact of plain packaging itself is not yet
evident in the market.

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: I just wanted to ask a little bit about price gaps, and maybe if you could give us more color on
whether or not down-trading pressures are increasing in some of your non-OECD markets? And I guess what's going
on broadly with some of your price graphs and then your outlook for this, as the year progresses?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, frankly speaking, I don't see that much of a pressure on the down-trading. I mean if I have to
take the EU out of the equation. Although as you have noted, I mean Marlboro share continues quarter-on-quarter
growth in the EU. And even in Germany, recently, I mean we see that there is – actually premium segment is slightly
growing, a phenomenon which we have not seen for the long time.
Outside the EU, there is different forms of an up-trading. I mean you see the premium segment growing in a number of
markets, being Indonesia, being Turkey, being Vietnam – bigger, smaller markets. In Russia, more up-trading is
happening from the low-priced segment to the mid-priced segments. I think the premium segment in Russia is flat, as
we've more or less seen it over the last – during the last year.
So no, I don't think it's that much of the risk to us, or any worries which would come from the down-trading. And as
you've seen, I mean Marlboro actually – Marlboro and Parliament, I should mention – I mean that they are growing
across all geographies.
<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: Okay. That's good. And then in terms of Japan, could you touch on what you think the
likelihood for price increase ahead of the consumption tax increase in April 2014 is? And then what are the necessary
steps and then timing of getting this to happen in the country?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, Japan still is a market where there is sort of a price control, if you like. This would require
the consent of the Ministry of Finance.
<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: Right.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: And as you know, we are not the market leader of this market, so that's not necessarily we are
calling the shot here.
So there also we have to see over the tax – announcement of the tax in sales tax increases at the beginning of the next
year will happen because we also hear some news that maybe government want to change the policy, nothing concrete,
but we have to see how does it unfold.
<Q - Bonnie Herzog>: Okay. And then just my final question would be on NGP and just maybe an update on some of
the progress that you've had with your clinical trials and then recently BAT has talked about their less harmful
cigarettes and then their strategy to transfer their technology to their existing cigarettes. So – and I guess not necessarily
new line so I'd like it if you could talk about sort of your approach with your NGP and then how you plan on rolling
that out and how you'll address that either with your brand franchise or new lines and sort of the pros and cons of these
strategies.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, our progress or we're progressing as per plan. I mean both with the clinical, the regulatory
engagement and also with being ready to finally start building our manufacturing capability. As you remember, we
have three platforms of NGPs which we're working on potentially simultaneously. I believe all of them altogether

should address all consumers' needs which are in the market. Our however fundamental or common denominator
behind these three platforms is we are not going for the selective reduction of a small constituent, we just want to bring
the high level – all constituents down. So therefore, we focus on the reduction of the changing the process from the
combustion to heating, et cetera. So that's our approach and we feel pretty confident about this.

Your next question comes from the line of John Leinster of UBS.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Thank you. Good morning. Just quickly, on the Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa and
the Latin America/Canada region all seem to have surprisingly strong sort of price mix. Can you particularly given the
sort of geography of where the volume growth has been in the Africa, Eastern Europe, can you explain why that is?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, it's differential in the whole belt of the North Africa. So the Egypt, other locations as well.
We are also benefiting from some disruptions which we have on our supply chain, especially at the beginning of last
year. As you remember, there were some disturbances because of – or connected with the Arab Spring, et cetera. So
once we broke the stability to our supply chain, our brands are in a full distribution. I mean clearly we're reaping
benefits of this. And I think Latin America pricing, which we've taken in Brazil, I think there was a pricing in a Mexico
at the beginning of the year, pricing in Argentina. I think in the first quarter nothing go together this contributes the
stronger pricing contribution coming from this territory, and also the volumes as I mentioned in North Africa
especially.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Just with regard, if you ignore the Philippines for a time and look at the sort of various
trade inventory movements compared to what occurred in the first quarter because obviously it's positives in Japan and
Russia and negatives in Turkey and Ukraine. I mean excluding the Philippines, has that been a net benefit to the sales
line or net negative?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. I think we've had – if I think a positive from Japan and positive in Russia and this essentially
took place where we have the positives. I think still the negatives would've said this one, so it had a drag on the quarter
rather than a benefit, if you like, in the quarter.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Okay. Lastly, I mean the pricing is obviously in the quarter is very strong. I mean can
you – I mean presumably at that rate, do you think you'd be able to exceed this $1.8 billion from last year in price
variance?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I – for obvious reasons, I cannot comment about the future pricing but, yes, I mean as the
quarter indicates that pricing is strong. And it's obviously supported also by the pretty pragmatic, if I may say so, tax
regime. So I mean, again, excluding the Philippines, which we discussed separately.
So EEMA is a good pricing environment. And, yes, we have a strong [ph] pricing variant (45:54).
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Okay. Thanks very much.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: I just had a couple country related questions for you, Jacek. The first one is in relation
to the Philippines; I just was curious about two factors there. One would be that you are seeing some low price
competition and I guess I'm curious, is Fortune not going to basically lower prices or get more promotional or more
aggressive to meet that? And then related to that, Marlboro did relatively well, so I'm just curious if the price gaps, and
I know it's very early there, but if the price gaps are at all allowing for some – a better performance for premium
brands?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, as we said, the unfortunate thing about the Philippines' tax change is the magnitude of the
change in a short period of time, the magnitude of an increase. However, migration of the reduction of the tiers and
fully specific system, they do support narrowing that the price gaps narrow. So clearly, Marlboro are – going forward
should benefit from closure of the gaps in a relative terms. When it comes to the low price competition, I think we have
to remember about one thing. Philippines is a free-pricing market, okay? So retailers can set their prices on their own in
the outlets. There about million outlets, 1 million outlets in Philippines out of which we cover about the quarter,
roughly about the quarter.
So what our sales force has to do, have to go and manage the right price for stick, which is important in that market and
price per pack and bring that price down to the recommended level. That's clearly something which we're doing in the
first quarter. I think it's going to continue very heavily in the second quarter. This obviously requires some extra
spending, but I think once we bring the prices to the recommended level, we should be in a good situation. I also should
mention that the sequential evolution in the volumes in Philippines when we started the year, I think, the first weeks of
the year, our shipments were down by about 50%, but it quickly move to the 40%, then the 30% decline and actually if
I look at essentially last few days, we almost at the 20% something decline. So we know that the market is – the total
market goes in the right direction, we just have to manage the price and address I will have the government – I hope
that the government will improve the tax collection from all market participants.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. That's very helpful color. Thank you. The other question I had for you is in
relation to Russia, and Marlboro had a bit of a softer performance. I was curious if that was somehow related to
inventory movements a year ago? I know that inventory overall was a benefit to Russia. And then just to understand the
investments you made in that market, I know Marlboro has been a real key focus for you, any comment on that? Or any
in relation to the weaker performance this quarter?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay. Investment in Russia is behind Marlboro, but also behind the Parliament and a number of
other brands. And we, in general, are building a much stronger, much more robust infrastructure, sales marketing
infrastructure. So this is not just the Marlboro, which we're investing. There obviously Marlboro is our focus as you
know it's the only brand which internally we have a much higher expectations for the performance. There is a
significant price increase, so I would have to wait a little bit how this price is, so how the situation stabilizes in the
market.
I would argue that Marlboro essentially for the last few quarters in Russia is flat, okay? We've obviously showed
higher, but for the time-being is flat. Marlboro, for the past two years, took a RUB5 higher price increases than the rest
of the market, because in the meantime, we're trying to reposition Marlboro really to the premium segment. So if I take
overall large price increases in Russia and Marlboro adding on the top of this, RUB5, and I have a brand stable for the
last few quarters, I think it actually tells you a good thing about the brand. However, we still have to wait until the
Marlboro market share is going to go.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: I want to ask a question on Indonesia first, just to understand how you think about the
competitive threat, if any, from the Gudang Garam Milds that's just launched a couple weeks ago. Obviously, it's just
new in the market but they're doing TV commercials, they've got a little bit of a price discount to A Mild. Is there
something that you might spend to defend against or do you see that – mild has been obviously where a lot of the share
gains have come, how do you think about that as an addition to the competitive equation?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, as you remember last year, we grew the share almost by three points. We – this quarter, we
opened with almost 1.5-point share advancement there, so our share continues to grow. I have to admit that the last
year, our share growth was somehow supported by the more attractive price points for a number of our key brands.
Some of this as we're taking continuously the pricing – in increasing the pricing in Indonesia some of this price –
attractive price points we're going to lose. But we're still looking into the share growth in Indonesia. And we're
launching our products, we're expanding our products as well. So I don't think it's any sort of a threat which I would see
at this stage coming from – frankly speaking, any competitor in particular.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. That's helpful. And then I know you've touched on this a little bit but could you give
some more color on the pacing you said the second half would be stronger but 2Q and 3Q are your easiest comparisons
and so can you just highlight some more of the reasons that 2Q wouldn't also be as strong or what will help 4Q that the
whole – that the second half would be stronger or just what – some of the drivers are that shape how the year plays out?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay. I think the reason why I said that we expect second half of this year to be stronger than the
first half, there are few reasons. One is we have – we'll annualization, we have annualization of increased spending. We
started already in the first half of 2012. This was mainly Russia but also some Asian markets. It's also in the timing of
our launches, which we've had the first half of the last year versus the first half of this year.
Secondly, as I mentioned that we had to increase our spending in the Philippines towards the end of the first quarter and
I think it's going to continue for the second quarter to address the situation which we have with compliance with the
recommended prices at the retail level and also to understand competitive pressures there. Also as you remember, we
said already in February that the three quarters, about 75% of our pricing was already in pretty early in the year. So,
yes, I mean that we – some of this volumes will have to recover and that recovery in some places may continue through
to Q2. Then obviously, there's also the shipment patterns, which we have in some markets with some distortions may
continue, will continue actually for the Q2. So as I said, we expect the second half to be much stronger – to be stronger
than the first half of this year.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Well, that's helpful. And then just my last question, you've talked before about the
opportunity that it could be to regain even sort of your fair share of illicit trade or just to stem that growth even. But it
seems to be still more of a threat than an opportunity. What could make that type trend, I know you've put money into
Poland and things but is that – how far off is that from having any impact? When can we see that actually start to
become something that is heading the other way instead gaining share?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, this is a process, okay? It's going to take time. I mentioned Turkey in my remarks, it's one
of the markets where despite the price increases, et cetera, tax increases and price increases, the government doing a lot
of right things on illicit trade and we see the volume coming to the industry. I mean despite the tax and the price
increase in Turkey we still think the volumes for the full year helped by the recovery of illicit trade, it's going to be flat,
so we can see it. I think also that recently, this week we'll start in New York, going to be another serious wake-up call
to the number of the states in New York. Because letting the contraband growing from a 10% plus last year to 11% plus
this year in the middle of the crisis, it doesn't necessarily tell us a good thing about a number of the law enforcement,
authorities in many of the EU countries. But this is going to take time. I admit it. We are working with Interpol. We're
working on tightening the supply chain. There is a cooperation among the industry members – the legitimate industry
members but more have to be done.

Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good morning. It looks like think you alluded to us already, but in markets like Italy and the EU,
you have a down-trading market, yet the premium brands that you have there are gaining market share. Can you give a
little more background to how the dynamics there work?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think – well, first of all, there is a number of the brand-support activities which we're deploying
behind Marlboro, okay? The whole commercial organization, commercial approach, which we have already announced
at the time we had the Investors Day last year here. And we start yielding results.
Second, in most of the countries, the tax regimes are actually more and more are supporting – or not allowing for too
much of the down-trading. Price gaps, despite the fact that there are price increases, tend to narrow. So you have – they
have the minimum taxes, very high minimum taxes or just a specific structures.
I think this all together helps clearly brands like Marlboro. But I think also Marlboro quarter-after-quarter, in terms of
image equity, et cetera, is getting into better and better shape.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. And then in Japan, for the last three quarters, your market share has been drifting down
again after the post-tsunami gains. What's your outlook at what point you can actually maintain your market shares in
Japan?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I still think we can make a share advancement in Japan. I mean there were – the quarterly
27.5%. I mean that's not what we would expect.
So I think the year is not over. There are still three quarters to go. We have a pipeline of our products and the programs
in place.
But as I said earlier, answering one of the previous questions, I mean, there is a massive support from a JT behind the
[indiscernible] (57:36) in terms of the product promotions. The other manufacturers are already pretty active with of
launching the product. It's a competitive environment. I look at this also positively that this pie, that there's a massive
spending and activity coming from a competition or competitor. Marlboro actually is extremely resilient. I mean, that's
a very important for us. We will have to address the situation with Lark/ Philip Morris going forward.

<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, not much to add on the U.K. actually, because the government still have not revealed what
is the conclusion of the public consultation and pack assessment, et cetera. So I mean we're waiting for the decision of
the government which directions they really want to go.
At the same time, as you know, there is still a topical product directive which is in the making. I mean there's still some
pretty important steps to go with topical product directive. We'll then I think have a much better also visibility, really
how many markets are key and, if you like, of colleagues introduce the plain packaging and how many markets will do.
As you know, the plain packaging in the European Union, also at the member state level has a number of legal
challenges for its implementation. So we'll have to see. And as I said, I mean so far, it's early, but so far especially on
the smoking, on a consumption of a cigarette in Australia, you don't really see, as expected frankly speaking, any
impact coming from the plain packaging despite what was promised at the beginning. So that the evidence, I've got a
feeling, is not being built in Australia. I mean there is still no evidence.

of 3.4% in Germany's, so is it fair to say that cigarette volumes are getting worse? And then in Spain I think you
reported cigarette market volume down 15% so I was just wondering about the shape of the quarter and the underlying
decline in this market?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think that France is still toward the end of the year – last year we had price increase in France
so the market is still in a recovery although I have to admit that the macros in France are not the most encouraging,
right? I mean as the unemployment, GDP, et cetera, are not necessarily going in the right direction. Spain also had the
beginning of the year price increase, but early in January. I think there was a $0.15 price increase in Spain. So we'll
have to wait presumably a few months to see how the situation develops there. But as I said, this is all both France and
then Spain as we see today are all in my sort of forecast or estimate of the total market decline for EU to be broadly in a
range of last year. Italy I will repeat it as well, I mean it's the only country. The main country which I have on the
watch-list with regards to the VAT development.
<Q - Rogerio S. Fujimori>: Okay. And secondly, you mentioned that we should expect some trade inventory
distortions in the second quarter. Could you just elaborate on that to help us with our models, please? Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, I think it would be mainly in Asia and mainly still in Japan. I think last quarter when we
revealed our inventories to the safety level what we're required with regards to the safety level for the Japanese market
took place in Q2 if I remember properly of last year. So clearly I will be meeting this one this year.
<Q - Rogerio S. Fujimori>: Thank you, Jacek. Very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.
