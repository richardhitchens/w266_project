At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Art will go through the details in a few minutes, but,
first, I would like to highlight two of the key drivers of our first quarter earnings growth, cold weather and continued
economic growth.
First, the weather story. Around the industry, much has been reported lately on the polar vortex. The Southeast
experienced its second coldest first quarter in the last 20 years, and we set a new all-time winter peak on our system of
39,130 megawatts. While the colder-than-normal weather had an obvious impact on revenue, that's not the only
important story. Operationally, the Southern Company system delivered on our commitment to provide clean, safe,
reliable, and affordable energy to the customers and communities we serve, as demonstrated by our crews' tireless work
under the most challenging of circumstances to restore power to nearly 800,000 customers affected by the severe ice
storm in mid-February.
The winter weather also underscored the importance of developing the full portfolio of energy resources. As
weather-related demand and delivery challenges proved once again how volatile natural gas prices can be, Southern
Company dispatched one of the industry's most diverse and reliable generation fleets, delivering more than $100
million in fuel cost savings by taking advantage of our fuel optionality.
Second, the economy continues to improve. Nine of our 10 largest industrial sectors, which account for approximately
80% of industrial sales, reflected positive year-over-year growth for the first quarter, and all 10 of them were positive
in March. Combined with solid customer growth and usage growth in our residential class, we are increasingly
confident in the sustained momentum of the Southeast economy.
Let's turn now to our major projects. Construction progress continues at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia and at
the Kemper County energy facility in Mississippi. First, tremendous progress continues in the construction of the
Vogtle project, which remains on schedule for the fourth quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2018, for Units 3 and 4
respectively. Nearly two months ago, as planned, we successfully executed the heaviest lift to-date, placing the 2.2
million pound CA20 module into the Unit 3 nuclear island. Our critical path focus remains on the major elements of the
Unit 3 nuclear island with the CA05 module scheduled to be installed in the second quarter. Other signs of our
continued construction progress include the walls and concrete under the containment vessel which will support the
installation of the shield building panels later this year. Outside of the nuclear island, we continue to progress on the
major other elements including the cooling tower and turbine building.
We are also very pleased with the progress on Vogtle Unit 4. The CR10 module, commonly known as the cradle, was
placed in the nuclear island during the first quarter, and the containment vessel bottom head is scheduled to be set in
May. In February, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary, Dr. Ernie Moniz, joined us at the Vogtle site to commemorate
America's first loan guarantees for nuclear construction. The DOE loan provides a committed source of funds that
reduces financial risk while delivering an estimated $250 million in present value benefit to Georgia Power customers.
These savings should translate to lower base rates for customers over the life of the loan.
Including the DOE loan benefits, Georgia Power highlighted $2.3 billion of customer benefits in a combined 9th and
10th VCM report filed at the end of February. This came on the heels of the 5-0 vote by the Georgia PSC to verify and
improve the actual capital costs reflected in the 8th VCM. The current VCM report, which reflects $389 million of
actual 2013 spending, is expected to be voted on by the Commission in August.
Turning now to the Kemper project where we are winding down construction and ramping up our start-up activities.
We continue to work toward our next major milestone, the heat up of the first gasifier, which is now scheduled for midto
late summer. Additionally, we expect to place the combined cycle portion of the plant into commercial operation this
summer. As we mentioned last quarter, the start-up activities for the combined cycle are largely complete, and it is
expected to be able to serve customers' energy needs during the upcoming peak season.

As we shared in our most recent disclosures, we have experienced decreases in construction labor productivity due to a
combination of adverse weather, labor turnover and inefficiencies. Having assessed the impact of these issues and the
risk that additional, unanticipated factors could have on the construction and start-up of the project, we have recorded
an additional pre-tax charge of $380 million. This estimate includes the previously disclosed $184 million in increased
labor and weather-related expenses, an additional $135 million due to the extension of the expected in-service date, and
$61 million of incremental construction costs as an adjustment to the earlier number.
Our confidence remains high in the value of the TRIG technology and the entire Kemper project to Mississippi Power's
customers. Our ongoing commitment to safety and quality is of primary importance, as we focus on completing
construction of this first-of-a-kind plant, and working through Instrumentation and Controls integration that is critical
for the project's success.
Meanwhile, Southern Power continues to expand its generation portfolio. Recently, Southern Power closed on the
20-megawatt Adobe Solar Facility, our second solar plant in California. This brings Southern Power's solar portfolio to
approximately 222 megawatts, all with quality long-term contracts. We continue to work diligently on additional
projects and hope to announce another solar acquisition very soon. Looking ahead, we remain confident in Southern
Power's ability to execute its business plan for the remainder of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic review.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. For the first quarter of 2014, we earned $0.39 per share compared to $0.09 per share in the first quarter
of 2013, an increase of $0.30 per share. Included in these results for the first quarter of 2014 is an after-tax charge
against earnings of $235 million, or $0.27 per share, related to the current cost estimate for Kemper, as detailed in the
8-K we filed yesterday. Included in the 2013 results are after-tax charges of $333 million, or $0.38 per share, for
increased costs of the Kemper project, and $16 million, or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease
investment.
Excluding these items, we earned $0.66 per share in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $0.49 per share in the first
quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.17 per share. The major factors which influenced our year-over-year adjusted
earnings were weather, economic growth, and retail revenue effects at our traditional operating companies. A detailed
summary of the earnings drivers can be found in our slide deck for this call.
Weather in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the first quarter of 2013 added $0.08 per share to our earnings.
Weather was $0.07 above normal for the first quarter of 2014, compared with $0.01 below normal for the first quarter
of 2013. Average temperatures were almost 5 degrees below normal. And as a result, we saw the second highest
number of heating degree days in 20 years. Total weather normal retail sales for the first quarter of 2014 increased
1.3% compared with the first quarter of 2013. Our original forecast was based on a GDP growth estimate of between
2.5% and 2.7%.
While it's still early in the year, it appears as though GDP growth estimates could actually be between 2.7% and 3%.
Weather normal residential sales increased 1.2% over the first quarter of 2013. Residential sales were positively
affected in almost equal parts by an increase in usage, reflecting demand growth beyond the amount avoided through
energy efficiency, and the addition of 10,000 new customers in the first quarter of 2014.
The first quarter industrial sales increased 2.8% compared with the first quarter of 2013, continuing the strong
performance and momentum seen for 10 straight months. Manufacturing employment growth in our service territories
exceeded the national pace in a first quarter that featured growth that was very broad-based. Some specific examples of
segments that performed particularly well were primary metals and transportation, which grew at 6.4% and 6%
respectively. In addition, housing related segments, including stone, clay and glass, textiles, and lumber as a group
grew approximately 6% year-over-year. This positive momentum was also evident at the Port of Savannah, where
container exports increased 8.1% over the first quarter of 2013.

Finally, one of the best leading indicators is economic development activity. The pipeline remains robust with 340
potential projects that could deliver 30,000 more jobs and generate more than $11 billion in additional capital
investment. This reflects a 58% increase in projects, a 46% increase in potential jobs, and a 107% increase in potential
capital investments compared to the same period last year. This potential is on top of a very strong quarter of
announcements which are expected to create an additional 3,000 additional jobs and represents $4.5 billion in new
capital investment.
Before turning the call back over to Tom, I'd like to share two additional items. First, as we have shared many times
over the years, Southern Company is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity, including our A
credit rating. This commitment has served our customers and shareholders well by providing low-cost financing and
beneficial access to the capital markets. Our plan to issue equity, which included a total of $1.3 billion of new equity
over the 2013 and 2014 timeframe, contemplated additional risks for the Kemper project. As a result and based on all
of our current assumptions, we do not anticipate the need to increase our equity issuances due to the new charges
reflected in our earnings results. We continuously monitor our capital structure and relevant credit metrics. As
conditions change, whether it is unexpected costs or better-than-expected success in acquiring new projects at Southern
Power, we will reforecast our equity needs as necessary. Finally, I'd like to share with you our earnings per share
estimate for the second quarter of 2014, which is $0.66 per share.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thank you, Art. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors voted to increase Southern Company's common dividend to
an annualized rate of $2.10 per share, an increase of approximately 3.5%. This marks the 13th consecutive year that our
dividend has increased. In fact, since 2002 our dividend has increased a total of 57%. This track record is a direct
reflection of the strength of our business model and the region our company serves. We have the privilege of serving
4.4 million customers in a region with an improving economy and a stable constructive regulatory environment. Our
value proposition is bolstered by our ability to deliver industry-leading customer satisfaction, low electricity prices, and
the highest level of reliability.
In fact, the success of our customer-focused strategy and how well it has positioned the company to earn top quartile
returns and generate strong operating cash flow over the long-term is the underpinning of our board's dividend action.
Despite our challenges with the Kemper project, our performance during the first quarter is a direct result of the
sustaining successes we produced elsewhere in our business during 2013. We will continue our focus on providing
clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy to customers and the communities we serve, which supports our value
proposition objectives for investors.
We are now ready to take your questions. So, operator, we will now take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please
proceed with the question.

<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you. I am. So in reading through your 8-K on Kemper, there was also a section where you
discussed, because of the decision to delay the start-up till May of 2015, a reduction in bonus depreciation. So, in order
for you guys to not have to sort of pin that on the shareholder, what now has to happen on the regulatory front?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Greg, this is Art. There's a number of things that could happen that is not part of any
of the write-off amount that we have included in the numbers to-date. We are in the process of working with regulators
in Mississippi to reach what we think will be a global settlement of prudence and issues related to our seven-year rate
plan. Now with the loss of bonus depreciation, we'll certainly have to rework the seven-year rate plan, assuming that,
that bonus depreciation is lost, and we'll come back and address that in a minute, in order to make sure that we don't
violate tax normalization rules. So that's an absolute requirement.
Now when we think about bonus depreciation, there's a couple of avenues here. One could be that we get an extender
bill coming out of Congress that extends bonus depreciation into 2015, so that would take care of it on its own.
Secondly, there could be issues in our global settlement whereby we mitigate the impact on customers. So all of these
things are in kind of a settlement stage with the Commission as we address how we will help that through the
regulatory process.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: One other point. We anticipate – you know that we produced electricity during, I think, it
was January, we made about $1 million in revenue off the combined cycle. We expect that to go into dispatch this
summer and go into service. As that goes into service, that eliminates a slug of the bonus depreciation at risk.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Combined cycles or running off a natural gas line that's going straight into the plant now?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Right, right.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Got you. One more question on the negative side, and then a positive one. So on Vogtle, we
haven't heard much on sort of the trend, what's gone on in court in Augusta with regard to your case against CBI, nor
have we heard any progress publicly on a potential settlement. Can you give us an update on where that stands and
whether or not the costs, all things equal, notwithstanding the overrun that you're dealing with there, have been staying
pretty steady and on track?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Greg, I'm not sure it's going be much of a substantive update. It will be roughly the
same we've been telling you. Essentially, we have venue in Augusta. We have, I think, askings by both the consortium
and us with respect to the dispute. I think the issue resides more clearly within the consortium right now. They have
issues to work out among and between themselves, that's Toshiba, Westinghouse, and Shaw. But we have constructive
conversation with those folks all the time.
In fact, I want to say next week, Philip Asherman, the CEO of Chicago Bridge & Iron, I think the head of
Westinghouse, representatives from Toshiba, Georgia Power management, Southern Company management, we're all
meeting at Plant Vogtle. We do that regularly just to kind of cut through any of the issues in order to continue to
advance the project as well as it has been. So I guess the point is we continue to have a very good relationship. And I
think we've said before, it's much better now since Shaw is out of Chicago Bridge & Iron is in, we'll see. It could
happen quickly or it could happen late.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. And my final question is I'm noticing, and it's not just you guys, but we're on the front end
of earnings. But there's been a handful of companies where their weather normal earnings – I'm sorry – weather normal
sales growth numbers in the first quarter tracked ahead of the baseline expectation for the full year. Are we seeing just a
little bit more of a bounce in the economy than you had modeled because you wanted to be conservative? Or is there
some friction in your weather normalization model when you have really extreme moves in weather? That was the
explanation of one of the other managements gave, is that they're not sure that they're getting an accurate weather
normal reading because it was such a big, such a strong weather quarter. So is it we're definitively trending better? Or is
it that we won't really know until we get a few more quarters ahead?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Greg, this is Art. And I've always said that weather normalization is more of an art
than a science. But when we look at industrial sales, industrial sales are largely not weather normalized. So when we

have a 2.8% increase in weather – in industrial sales, that's a very good strong indicator, and as we've talked about in
our remarks earlier, that's the 10th month in a row we've had year-over-year growth in our industrial sales. So that is
not impacted by what you brought up. Now on the residential side, we could be seeing a little bit of that, but it is only
one quarter of growth. We did have a 0.5% growth in the fourth quarter. So I – if it's not 1.3%, I don't think it's a whole
lot less than that due to the fact that we've had extreme cold temperatures.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And you know my position with the Fed, the Fed was more bullish than we were as we
developed our annual guidance. And just as of the first quarter, here again, one quarter does not a year tell, but it does
indicate that the kind of economic – the macroeconomic effects are more closely 2.7% to 3% in terms of GDP than they
were our 2.5% to 2.7%. So we'll see but it's a good start.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital. Please proceed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Hey, Tom. Hey, Art. How are you?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hey, Jim. Good.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Hey. I'm confused. And don't comment on that. So your fourth – your second quarter
last year was $0.66, and you're guiding to $0.66 for the second quarter this year. What might be some of the big
mechanics that would at least, under that condition, would put you at the high-end of your $2.72 to $2.80 guidance
range for 2014?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, good question, Jim. When you look at non-fuel O&M, and I think we outlined this in
our last call, we estimated we're going to spend roughly $300 million more at least in our regulated core business than
we did in 2013. And if you look at our spending in the first quarter, it was only up year-over-year about 1.3%. So we've
got some heavier lift to do on the expense side for the remainder of the year. And when you look at our outage
schedule, it is somewhat back-end loaded as well.
There are a few other elements at least in the quarter-over-quarter numbers that you need to remember. Alabama Power
had entered into an accounting order that allowed them to defer some non-nuclear outage costs this year which will
make their non-fuel O&M look a little lower year-over-year, and that's a big influence on the first quarter non-fuel
O&M numbers. But when you look at the O&M that we're going to add this year at least in the second quarter along
with new rates and you take normal weather, you're seeing about a flattish kind of equation there.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Jim, Art and I talk about this stuff all the time. It's not a – don't be ashamed of being
confused. Look, we have the same questions here. But I think it really does go to Art's pattern of O&M and being
roughly flat for the first quarter. That presumes you're going to spend a lot more in the rest of the year, so I think that
really kind of does go there.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Okay. But in that same vein, I'm still confused on Kemper County now, if you don't
mind me changing topics.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Right.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: So I just need to be – my memory needs to be refreshed. So if the gasifier goes into
service, let's just call it September 1, how do the mechanics work under all that if you're a customer of Mississippi
Power? Who benefits?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The economics to Mississippi's customers are relatively fixed. In other words, there's $2.4
billion that accrues at a full mix of capital up to [ph] $2.88 billion (27:23), it's the tax-exempt bonds.

<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: ...the combustion turbines. I'm sorry, that's my mistake.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, no problem. Well, I mean, a lot of how that might work is tied up in this global
settlement as well.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: There's a host of issues. In fact, there was some language in the recent continuance of
discussions, which indicated that there is some conversation going on between the company and the staff. So I would
look for all of that to be kind of handled as much as it could in that settlement.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Any idea on the timing of when that might happen?

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please
proceed.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Hey. Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Dan. How are you doing?
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: I'm doing great. Thank you. You guys, when you kind of talked about the growth rate update
last quarter, and you pointed to the back end of this decade, the reacceleration of environmental CapEx, part of that
being coal ash and some other things, we've seen some other folks in the region have some issues around coal ash. So
I'm wondering if you could just kind of walk through maybe in a little more detail the spending needs you guys have
there, and kind of how that paces out? And with more scrutiny, does that change the timeline for when you guys might
start spending that money?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I'm going to turn this over to Art in a second. But I think if you kind of globally look at it
here, we kind of have $6 billion of future environmental compliance investments that will manifest themselves at the
end of the decade; certainly coal ash is part of that, certainly effluent guidelines, certainly 316(b). There's a lot of
moving parts there, and the number can move pretty dramatically, both in terms of the quantum, again, our estimate is
$6 billion, as well as the timing. And it would not surprise us but that these other issues could have some bearing as to
the ultimate resolution for companies like us. We're following it very closely, and we'll see.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Okay. And I guess on the CSAPR decision, where it is right now, is that going to have any
effect on near-term spending? Or is the MATS obligations pretty well covered for you guys?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Dan, the MATS contemplates most of that. I think when the original CSAPR was passed, it
was prior to the development or finalization of the MATS rules. So since they're both directed at SO2 and NOx, most
of that will be addressed through SCRs, through scrubbers, or through whatever other compliance equipment we may

are further back in the stack, that won't operate a lot. And so the only real impact may be fuel costs on an extreme day.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, it is much more a dispatch energy issue than a capital issue for us. The MATS
already spoke to the capital.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Okay. And I guess one more on coal. We've heard a few people talking about a little more
concern about coal inventories for the summer, after the cold winter and having to run the coal fleet hard. Where do
you guys sit on your coal inventories? And how is that going to get captured if you have to start buying more actively
in the open market for the fuel mechanisms?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's fascinating. We've made a big play in the past. We talk a lot about 70% coal six years
ago, 16% gas now. What we've said before was 45% gas, 35% coal. Fascinating. Average gas prices during the first
quarter of 2014 were $5 in round numbers. First quarter of 2013, they were $3.50. So you were up almost 50% in gas
prices, with coal prices being relatively constant. So what that's done is we've been able to shift our dispatch around to
save our customers about $100 million. So we're marginally more on coal than gas, is what we saw in the first quarter,
kind of 42% coal, 38% gas. It's fascinating to kind of think about how that may roll out for the rest of the year.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Dan, when you think about our inventories, we are very close to the targets we've set for
ourselves this year. We are building up coal supply to meet the summer peak demands. And that will – basically runs
our average target up to 35 to – from 35 days, say, to 45 days. So we're just in the process right now of rebuilding after
we increased our burn quite a bit in the first quarter to above what we thought it would be.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And that moves around a lot from plant to plant. Obviously, if we have plants like the
branch units that we're planning to close a little bit later, you'll treat those a little bit differently than you will kind of a
Bowen, or a Scherer, or a Miller.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Got it. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, sir. Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Hey, Tom. Just to follow up on that last question, would you – is it fair to characterize that
you're running gas more maybe in these shoulder months so that you can rebuild the coal piles or is it just, you're just
running dispatch as you normally would and you're just bringing more coal in?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, we're in great shape. We're running normal.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. Just maybe if you could spend a little more time – Art, you mentioned that you're
starting on a settlement in Mississippi of various issues. Could you just go remind us what the issues are? Is it both the
prudency case in that seven-year deal that you got...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: ...that you're trying to kind of wrap altogether? And timelines and how much are people
caught onboard together, is there going to be a lot of opposition, and likelihood that you'll be able to get a settlement?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, we think there is an opportunity for both the regulators and the company to come out
with some kind of agreement here. The seven-year rate plan was designed to recover costs and keep rates at the set
level that we agreed to in January of 2013, and that was a 15% increase in rates last year followed on by a 3% rate

increase this year, both of which are in place. So as these numbers move around, as our in-service date moves around,
we're going to have to amend that to make sure that we comply with tax normalization rules, as I mentioned. So that's
one element, and there are some other pieces of the pie that we might be able to include in the grand settlement that will
keep customers harmless in this agreement. But it's mostly focused around those two very issues, the seven-year rate
plan and the prudency issue. We would like to get those solved on a simultaneous basis.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And I guess just roll into that, the in-service of the combined cycles, we fully expect those
to run. They're actually attractive, and we've actually had some interest in the wholesale markets for those things. All of
this could be wound up together, we think, in a beneficial discussion.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: And just timing of this and...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's always hard to predict those things. We got the continuance order. Let's let that play
out and let events take their course.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then just separately on Vogtle, I might have missed this in your presentation,
but is there any updates on the schedule for Vogtle Units? And if not, when will we get the next schedule update?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: As we filed in our VCM 9 and VCM 10, we've reiterated our plan to leave the schedule in
place, COD dates for Unit 3, fourth quarter of 2017, Unit 4, fourth quarter of 2018. And we did not change the amount
that we are contemplating in terms of overnight costs at the same time.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And if you just go back, Steve, to the VCM 8 filing, that is our most recent schedule.
Now, of course, we always continue to move things around within, but that's it. And I would argue that probably Unit 4
is actually probably a little bit ahead. So we feel very good about our schedule right now.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And just – I'm just tying in commentary from SCANA, which obviously different
units, but they talk about having kind of a new schedule from the E&C guys in the fall to layout. Is that a timeline that's
relevant for you at all, or are you just on a separate track?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's interesting. I mean, we try to work together to coordinate best practices and share
information and a variety of other things, but it is very clear that we have a different contract. And without commenting
on their situation, I can tell you that our contract as we've suggested in the past is essentially fixed with performance
schedules that are also fixed. So I wouldn't spend a lot of time comparing, say, for example, CA20 for us and CA20 for
them. You will have...
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: They're operating under a different regime than we are.

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay, thank you. Sorry, having a little phone issue. A couple of questions. If I look at your
fourth quarter 2013 slide deck and went back to the appendix just at the CapEx by subsidiary, can you just walk us
through – and a lot of this is Kemper-driven but a little of it may also be Southern Power-driven. Just what's different
from the CapEx you laid out for 2014 through 2016 back on slide 25 of your fourth quarter deck versus what it is today
when you look forward for the next couple of years?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, Kemper will change a bit as we push more dollars into 2015 now. And when I think
about all the other companies, nothing has really changed that I'm aware of. Our plan for Southern Power remains.
Some of that is capital for maintenance and other capital for our expansion plan. So when I think broadly about that,
Michael, I just can't see a lot of change that's occurred since that date.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And so what's the – I just want to make sure I'm getting Kemper right. What's the
remaining amount of CapEx in Kemper for 2014, meaning second quarter through the end of the year? And then, is the
amount – is that $25 million-a-month number for 2015 kind of still a good number, so four, five months into 2015?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, yeah, if you look at it, we've got about $925 million remaining. About $800 million of
that in 2014 and the remainder, the $125 million, would be five months in 2015.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's the $25 million a month.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Yeah, and maintenance CapEx is a little bit, $100 million to $150 million, so that would
get total Mississippi Power?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. A nuclear construction question. Just curious, is there any insight or any update you
can provide from the folks in China who are a couple of years ahead of us in the process in terms of building new
nuclear plants? Just, any updates on kind of the construction timeline for either Sanmen or the other units that are
coming online there that are using AP-1000s?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sanmen and Haiyang, you know that we have people that live there, and other various
members of our team go there from time to time. It's interesting to think about how that's helped us. Some of it, I would
argue the very first benefit that we've seen out of all – them going first and our people on-site had been supply
chain-related. I would argue also, the way that some of the material was handled on-site, once it is fabricated, has been
helpful for us. We've had better performance than they have. There are some significant differences particularly in the
late-end construction, where when you think about, for example, modules, or you think about how these things are
erected, they tend to be much more people-intensive than we are. Our processes tend to be much more automated.
The other thing that we find is, where they have a specific problem, can we learn from it? Well, I'll tell you one. The
way some of the panels were erected, they erected them horizontally when they were picked up, they deformed a little
bit and they had to worry about correcting that. What we learned was to erect them vertically so we didn't have that
kind of deformation.
The other thing is, just kind of issues that relate to the engineering around some pieces of equipment. I know one issue
has been reactor coolant pumps. I know that's been surfaced in China. We have that equipment. It will be resolved to
our satisfaction well in advance of any critical path.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Okay, guys. Thank you very much, and appreciate the update.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good afternoon. How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Super. I hope you're well.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: I am. Thank you. You mentioned some wiggle room in your equity forecast. I mean, if there
were continued pressures at Kemper, is there still contingency built in there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: We are probably on the cusp. If we have additional costs, then we may need. It just depends
on any other offsetting issues, either in CapEx or that might affect our equity needs. But we'll keep an eye on that over
time and certainly advise you of any needs we may have. Again, our target, Paul, is 44% equity ratio. And right now
we're solid in that range.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And either I missed it or you didn't address annual guidance on the call?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We almost never do that. What we do is we do annual guidance twice a year. We do it
once in January that sums up kind of where we believe we'll be for the year. And that has been our practice really since
I was CFO, so we're dialing back eight years or so now. We only do a revision to annual guidance once we get through
the third quarter. So that's typically our October phone call. What we provide is just quarterly estimates beyond that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Anthony.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Just following up on Paul's question, I think the guidance for equity in 2013 and 2014
was roughly about $1.3 billion. How much of that has been, I guess, issued already?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: In the first quarter, we issued right at $140 million. So we are on track for our $600 million
number this year.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: And I guess, lastly, when you think of Kemper, and you guys have, I guess, quantified
maybe 2015 roughly to, I guess, $25 million a month, I guess, over-budget or incremental charges, I mean what do you
think is the biggest risk on cost overruns there? I mean it seems that there's been a labor issue, last quarter you spoke
about it and also this quarter. I mean what's the biggest issue, I guess, with – or, I guess, sensitivity with the higher cost
at Kemper?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So I think it remains. We've been very confident on this. When you transition away from
construction to start-up, that's kind of the lion's share of risk ahead of us now. The integration of the different systems
of Kemper, it's a very complex animal. In a combined cycle unit, you may have three systems that need integration.
Recall this one is coal gasification. It is gas handling equipment, and all those related things. It's about 13 different
systems. I mean, I like to think of it like fine-tuning a six-cylinder car versus a 12-cylinder car. So just getting the
integration of the various systems through start-up is the biggest issue. Beyond that, it is, I think, the unknown
unknowns. There's always something that could happen that nobody can contemplate. We, I think, are allowing for
normal disruptions through start-up. You have those anyway. It's something that nobody has foreseen. We'll see.
When we rethought this schedule, I can tell you, we did a lot of soul-searching about it. You know from following us
that we are a conservative company. We always try and take the long view. And I think it is absolutely the right thing

to do in our judgment to adjust this schedule. Because even though it produces some near-term pain, this is absolutely
the long-term trajectory that represents the best interest of our customers. And it's so important that we get it right at the
outset. So that's what you see us doing here.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Just lastly, like a really weird question, more or like I guess to your point unknown
unknowns. It seems that the conventional part of the Kemper unit or Kemper plant, the CCGT or whatever, is working
fine, it produced electric first quarter. I mean are there any changes to that seven-year rate plan you guys entered into
back in January of 2013, if the gasifier just for some reason just doesn't really reach commercial operation as intended?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: There's nothing in the seven-year rate plan that is contemplated around that. But I will
remind you, Anthony, that we have a lot of experience with our pilot project whereby we have over time perfected the
operation of the gasifier. So our confidence in the gasifier and having problems with it is not high on the list. But as
Tom mentioned, we have the gas clean-up island, so we've got to be able to continually integrate the gasifier, the
clean-up island, collection of the byproduct, and delivery of reliable syngas in order to make sure that this plan operates
as intended.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And I know we've talked about this in the past where we've made mistakes, I think, on this
project was entering into a fixed-price commitment back in like 2009 or so, with only 10% of the engineering. And I
think where we did the FEED studies and all, we were very good in terms of what the combined cycle island's going to
cost and how the gasifier. Where we got bit was in the gas handling systems. Remember as we ramped up our carbon
capture profile, the quantity of the pipe, the quality of the pipe, the hangars, and all of the related equipment, it's going
to be that, that is – that we had a lack of experience.
The good news is we do have experience with the gasifier. We have the combined cycles already working. We know
that the gas management system exists elsewhere. So, my sense is, all of these components will work. That's my
judgment. Integrating them and optimizing them and fine-tuning them is going to be the challenge.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Great. Thanks for that color, guys. I really appreciate it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Great.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: So you talk a lot about Kemper and Vogtle. Can I just ask a couple of quick questions around
Southern Power to round it out? You mentioned you might have something coming down the pike pretty soon here in
terms of another solar project. Assuming that that is the case, would that largely speak for the placeholder that you have
in your CapEx guidance for the optional Southern Power projects for the year?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, we had outlined, Mark, about – I think it was 100 megawatts of expansion in 2014.
And roughly what we're talking about is somewhere near half of that, but we've got other projects that we've got on our
list as well. So we feel very good about our plan, our expansion plan for this year and for next.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, every board meeting, Art updates the finance committee with essentially a red,
yellow, green list of potential projects. Looking at the health of those development activities, we have a lot of
confidence on Southern Power's ability to execute this year.

<Q - Mark Barnett>: Great. And just one sort of nitpicky detail on the quarterly results for Southern Power, despite
the top-line growth you had, kind of some lower profitability on the operating line. I'm just curious if there – if that's
sort of a one-time thing or was there anything in particular that was driving that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: We had some solar contracts or some energy margins I guess from contracts with solar plants
that were in service, say, mid-year last year, mid-to-late last year, that quarter-over-quarter increased revenues. But we
also had a one-time tax issue that occurred that was really a big help too, and had we not had the one-time tax issue we
may have been at or just below the – our target for the quarter.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay, makes a lot of sense. Thanks for that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Ali.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, good afternoon to you.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Hey, Tom, when do you think you're in a position on Kemper to really lock down these
costs and tell us, look, this is it and I think we don't expect any more overruns?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Ali. I wish I could've done that a year ago. Every time that we have given you an
estimate; it has been our best judgment. When things happen that we can't foresee, we have to make adjustments. I hate
that, but that is in fact the case. Every time we've given an estimate, it has been our best judgment at the time.
<Q - Ali Agha>: But is there anything in these remaining months to a year for completion where once you cross that
line, you can say, okay, it's pretty much done? Or will it go all the way till the end?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, I mean, except for the unknown unknowns, right? I mean, so what happens if, I
mean, heaven forbid, there's a tornado that comes across the site? Or what happens if there's a major hurricane? Or
what happens if as we integrate the system it's just more complex, and we're not able to track it effectively or
something? Everything I know right now, I have great confidence in our ability to execute. We really fought a lot with
each other over this latest adjustment. We would still effort our best to get this done in 2014, but I think given the [ph]
bow wave (54:10) of uncertainty that we were creating by the delay and productivity on the construction as a result of
polar vortex one, two, and some of the other issues, it just seemed to us to be a conservative, prudent judgment to push
the schedule out to [ph] May 31 (54:26). I wish I could give you certainty. That's not the nature of the beast when you
build something like this.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Right. And also...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Ali, this is Art. A couple additional elements there and we – and I think we kind of
mentioned them already. But you've got milestones out there, the first gasifier heat up. We get by that, we're producing
syngas. And then beyond that is making sure that the gas clean-up island is doing its job, and that we get reliable
syngas that we can burn in our combined cycle. So as we move through those elements, those are elements of
milestones that we have set for ourselves that will tell the tale about where we identify issues.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And separately, Tom, I think in the past you have told us for planning purposes for the next three
years or so, we should assume a relatively flat earnings profile for Southern Power, if I recall correctly. Anything
changed on that front as you're looking at opportunities today versus a few months ago?

Page 14 of 18
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So not significant change, but we continue to kick over every stone we can. We've
mentioned before that we're looking in some other regions of the United States in order to identify opportunities. It'll be
fun to see how the nation's so-called organized markets develop this year and next.
My sense is, when you look around at different regions of the United States, particularly in the so-called organized
markets where you see coal plant shutdowns, there may be need for more capital investment. I think our model of
long-term bilaterals, creditworthy counterparties, no fuel risk, no transmission risk, is the kind of economic commercial
model that will support the kind of CapEx that needs to be brought to bear to those markets. My sense is, particularly
with our focus on co-ops and municipal utilities, we have some potential to do more than we think we can do. And I
can assure you that – I guess we had our Southern Power meeting two weeks ago – I can assure you that we give them
a high goal every time we can.
The other thing that could have some play in that, you may be aware that Georgia Power is in I guess its second phase
of their Advanced Solar Initiative. They had one in I think it was 2010, it was called ASI, and this next one was called
ASI-Prime or something. But it accounts for 525 megawatts of new solar in Georgia, 425 megawatts of which is central
station and 100 megawatts of which is distributed generation. We have challenged both of our companies, Southern
Power and Georgia Power wholesale, separate from Southern Power, to compete in those businesses.
Especially with distributed generation around the United States, a lot of people have taken the posture of kind of
fighting it. Our view is let's do it right, let's create the right pricing mechanism for the energy and capacity, let's create
the right pricing mechanism, one that is fair to all customers for connections to the network, and let's create the right
mechanism for backup generation. Having done that, if customers want it, my view is we should provide it. And so I've
directed folks inside Southern, and in fact we're competing with ourselves, to play offense in that environment. I'm
looking forward to seeing how those bids turn out. That's another potential source of growth for us.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. Last question, Tom, you've also indicated to us in the past as you look at your earnings profile
being more back-end loaded in terms of growth, you would be looking at opportunities to fill that gap if you found
them out there.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And I'm wondering today are you seeing those opportunities? I mean we saw this "opportunistic
transaction" that was announced this morning. Are you seeing opportunities out there for yourselves?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Was that an M&A question?
<Q - Ali Agha>: Well, I think the way you had posed it to us, yes, I'm presuming it's M&A.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Okay. Because with us, we do asset acquisitions all the time. I mean that's one of our
ways. If you're talking about corporate M&A, it was interesting, I was – we were listening to the different shows this
morning, CNBC, and Bloomberg, and all that. A bullish signal in the economy is how much M&A is going on, and in
fact there seems to be a pretty good bit of it; Exelon and Pepco, the latest example in our industry. I've been on record
for this and I bet you guys on the call could give this speech as well as I can, but this is something that we have a
fiduciary obligation always to evaluate. We are always kind of – we have a group of people, our competitive
intelligence group here, focusing on those deals.
My sense is now as it has been forever that those deals are extraordinarily difficult to do, particularly in a regulated
environment where for the amount of the premium that you will spend in order to acquire the target, you're going to
have to earn a return on and return of capital that from an EVA standpoint is positive for shareholders. Add to that
regulatory complexity and a variety of other things, those are just hard to do. We work hard to try and make sense of

Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please proceed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Kit.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hi, Kit.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: So just to revisit the Mississippi settlement talks one last time, can I ask who initiated the talks
and what were the circumstances of their being settlement talks in the first place?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Kit. I believe the Commission in and around the prudency hearing had pushed the
dates of the hearing along with the staff and that we're able to push those hearings out until August. And in some of
their public remarks, they mentioned the fact that they were looking for discussions towards some kind of agreement
both on the prudency issue and on the seven-year rate plan. So that's kind of where it all started from, and we are
certainly a party to those as well.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Simply put the Commission directed the staff to engage the company with potential
settlement talks. So we'll see how it goes.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Right. Okay, got that. And would – I mean obviously we don't know until there is or is not a
settlement, but it sounds like you would hope that this could be a pretty comprehensive deal if you got there. Would
you envision it as kind of accounting for any future possible further overruns or delays in the timetable of Kemper?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think it's just too early to tell, Kit. There's – the prudency issue is important, the seven-year
rate plan is pretty important, but there could be other elements to the agreement as well.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The in-service treatment of the combined cycle units are important.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And there's a host of things, how you would weave together with [ph] PEP (1:02:50) is
important.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yup.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So we'll try and get as comprehensive as we can.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Okay. And, okay one last thing so I kind of understand this. So obviously given your prior
agreements there can't be any further rate increases for customers as a result of this. Are we looking at potentially some
change in the pattern of future rate increases? In other words, from a financial point of view for shareholders, what
could change as a result of a settlement here?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Kit, I'm a little reluctant to kind of dive into profiles and what ifs. Let the talks
happen, and let's get a good result for everybody here.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Okay, it sounds fair to me. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you, Kit.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hey. Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey. Good afternoon to you.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. So quick question here. Just following up a little bit on the same vein of
thought, can you walk through how you think about the in-service criteria for Kemper by chance? And how that
process works in Mississippi? I know you're talking about a settlement here, but I suppose that's technically a separate
process that we're going to be going through down the line. And then also perhaps a little bit of the key dates as far as
that goes? Particularly I'm thinking in contrast to some of the performance issues we've seen elsewhere?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Look, in-service has some connotations both for tax and for regulatory purposes. For tax
purposes, it's essentially that you're integrated into the grid, and you can demonstrate it. We've already demonstrated
we can run Kemper to help during peak periods. We did that during polar vortex. And it's fun. I actually have a live
shot of the constructions sites of both Vogtle and Kemper in my office, and it's fun to see the cooling towers at Kemper
blowing off steam, showing that they're generating electricity. We expect them to be fully integrated this summer. By
the same token, when we think about the gasifier island and everything else, I think the standards will kind of go to a
reliable supply of syngas to the combined cycling units. Those will be kind of the standards we'll be looking for.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And so that's – basically that's down the line here after May 15 to sort of...?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. Again, the combined cycles we expect to be in-service this summer, declared
in-service, both for tax and books. And for the gasifier and the gas clean-up system, it will come probably later.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Okay, excellent. And then kind of going back to the equity question, sorry to hit this
one more time; if you don't end up getting either of those two options with regards to making up the bonus D&A
benefits, does that push you through the contingency you put in there? Or did that – your comment before, contemplate
that as well?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: It contemplated that as well.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got you. And maybe could you quantify how much contingency you have left? Or
you don't want to do that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: We're pretty close to the edge. So – but again, it's a function of more than just Kemper.
There's lots of other CapEx that we spend, and so it would also impact how we're doing in that regard as well.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And I know you guys I've spoken about – just the last subject here on coal ash.
Obviously, some adjacent states are kind of picking up the speed of reform on that. What are you seeing right now on
your front as far as the need to spend and address both from a capital and expense perspective?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We've had a very constructive relationship with all of our environmental regulators. In all
of our states, we meet or exceed all of the environmental regulations that are currently in place. We are watching with
interest what happens elsewhere and what impact that may have. You know, it was funny. Funny. It was notable back
around the Kingston event, I remember I was COO at the time, and I can recall walking myself virtually every ash pond
we had, and we have this long track record of exceedingly safe, reliable operation in those facilities. The personnel
there were just surprised to see anybody was interested in how those were being run. I think with the events at Duke,
there will be more evaluation of our practice and closure practices and all sorts of things. I think this is something that
is probably inevitable. The question to me is to what degree and over what timeframe?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Excellent. Well, thank you all very much.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you. We appreciate you joining us.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Ashar.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Hi. How are you doing, Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Tom, I was trying to understand – just trying to look through, and I don't know if Art can help me
on this, if one thing which took a few people by surprise was when you came up with guidance in the January
presentation, you started off with $2.71, and then you subtracted $0.07 which was from dilution from the Kemper
write-off, 2014 and beyond.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Right.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: And you reset the base to $2.64, and then from there of course the growth came in for this year's
EPS impact. With these write-offs, additional write-offs, which have come in since the beginning of the year, should
we then be modeling a similar kind of – of course if they're not to that extent that they happened last year, but should I
be modeling something like for when you come out next year and all that, a slight decremented gain in the base EPS,
when you – if you were to go ahead and redo your EPS for next year from this dilution impact from the write-offs and
things like that? I just wanted to get a little bit better understanding?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. Yeah, Ashar, there's a pretty simple answer here and we think it's no, because we
don't think we'll require any new equity and therefore there's not a dilutive impact. We'll be able to manage this, we
think.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, that's correct.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. Okay, thank you so much.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Thank you, Ashar.

And I'm showing no further questions.
Thomas A. Fanning
Well, listen, thank you all for joining us today. I know it's a busy day for everybody, a lot of exciting things going on.
I'm really gratified. I don't like the fact that we had to write-off on Kemper again and change the schedule, but I'm
gratified with the sustaining excellence of the company. When you think about all the good work we had, and I know
we talked about that a lot last year, we really accomplished a whole lot in 2013 and I think our first quarter in 2014 is a
demonstration of that benefit.
We thank you for joining us today. We thank you for following Southern Company. We look forward to chatting with
you further. Take care.
