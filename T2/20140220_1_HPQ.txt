Meg Cushing Whitman
Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.
With the first quarter of fiscal 2014 closed, HP is in a stronger position than we have been in quite some time. Since
laying out our five-year strategic roadmap for turning the company around, we've made significant progress. We have
re-ignited innovation at HP, and the first quarter was no exception as we introduced industry-leading technologies
across our portfolio.
Our focus on rebuilding our balance sheet has resulted in an improvement of our operating company net cash position
by more than $6 billion since the first quarter of 2013. We've strengthened our relationship with customers and channel
partners, something I see every day in my interactions with them. And our global workforce is fully aligned behind a
common vision for the company, delivering solutions for the new style of IT.
And we are seeing acceleration in the industry's movement toward that new style of IT. These changes create
tremendous pressure in the marketplace as technologies and business models evolve, customer needs change, and
incumbents look to respond. Many of our competitors are now confronting these new realities by making major
strategic shifts and exiting significant parts of their business.
At the same time, HP is more than two years into its work to reposition the company to meet these challenges. We
believe this is a competitive advantage. With the steps we've taken, I think we're well-positioned to seize on
opportunities that will arise in the marketplace. We still have a long way to go, but I am more convinced than ever that
we are making the right moves to set HP up for the long term.
Rest assured, we are not taking our foot off the pedal. Over the next few quarters, we will introduce significant new
innovations that will build upon our offerings in cloud, security, big data, and converged infrastructure as well as some
remarkable new technologies in printing and personal systems.
In addition, at our Global Partner Conference next month, we will roll out updates to our partner programs that we
expect will further strengthen our channel relationships. We are doing all of this while we continue to optimize our cost
base and invest in our infrastructure to help create a more agile and more aggressive HP.
In the first quarter, HP delivered $0.90 in diluted non-GAAP net earnings per share compared to our financial outlook
of $0.82 to $0.86 per share. Total revenue for the company was down 1% for the quarter, but up slightly in constant

currency. And we once again delivered very strong cash flow, generating $3 billion in cash flow from operations.
As a result of our focus on driving cash flow, the company exited the quarter with an operating company net cash
position of $1.7 billion after returning $843 million to shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends and share
repurchases. We saw further encouraging signs in the quarter that our efforts to turn the company around are taking
hold. There was revenue growth in our Personal Systems and Enterprise Group segments, and at the total company
level on a constant currency basis, we achieved revenue growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2011.
As I've said in the past, turnarounds are not linear, and we have a lot of work ahead of us. While I would certainly not
declare victory based on these results, they represent real progress. Make no mistake, we are focused on consistently
and profitably growing revenue over the long term.
You've heard me say that revenue growth will ultimately be driven by great products, and in the first quarter we held
our Annual Innovation Showcase for our European customers at HP Discover in Barcelona. We used the event to
introduce some significant new technologies in key areas for the company.
We introduced our new converged system portfolio, a family of integrated IT systems using HP server, storage and
networking technology that is purpose-built for key workloads such as virtualization, big data and hosted desktops.
These new products deliver a total systems experience that dramatically simplifies IT, enabling [ph] points (6:53) to go
from order to operation in as little as 20 days.
We also introduced new solutions in our Converged Storage portfolio, including StoreOnce Backup, StoreAll Archive
and StoreServ Storage. Collectively, these innovations deliver industry-leading performance and efficiency, making it
possible for enterprises to manage their data in the new style of IT.
We announced the next generation of our flagship private cloud solution, CloudSystem 8. This solution integrates with
our open stack architecture and enables enterprises to build a private cloud and deploy cloud services in a matter of
hours rather than days or weeks.
HP was also recently recognized by Forrester Research as the clear leader in private cloud solutions.
We also launched our new Hybrid Cloud Management platform, a self-service portal with key management and
security tools that allow IT managers to more efficiently deliver applications and services to their users.
Also in the first quarter, our Personal Systems Group introduced two new mobile devices to the market in India, the HP
Slate 6 and Slate 7 voice tabs. These phablets demonstrate how we are clearly segmenting markets to target
opportunities with cost-effective products that play to our strengths.
Now let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter. Overall, results in Q1 were driven by the revenue
growth I noted earlier plus solid performance in printing and disciplined cost management. In Personal Systems, we
delivered strong revenue performance. Overall, the PC market contraction is slowing, and we see signs of stabilization,
particularly in the Commercial segment. Revenue grew 4% over the prior year, our first quarter of growth in seven
quarters. Growth was driven by strong performance in Commercial, particularly commercial notebooks.
Operating margins in the quarter were 3.3%, up over both the prior year and sequentially. The competitive pricing
environment remains aggressive, which puts pressure on our gross margins. We are being selective in where we play,
and as a result, we lost 0.7 points of market share of the prior year in a declining market in the calendar fourth quarter,
and 0.9 points sequentially. We believe our approach of being selective about where we play, coupled with good cost
discipline, will ensure we remain focused on profitable growth.
Our printing business delivered solid results with sustained profitability. Operating margins for the first quarter were
16.8%, up 0.5 points over the prior year. Printing revenue was down 2% or 1% in constant currency. And while total
supplies revenue declined, we did see growth in ink supplies over the prior year. We also saw our third successive
quarter of hardware unit placement growth, driven by very strong growth in laser units and ink in the office remains
strong. The focus on unit placement is an investment that we believe will pay future dividends for supplies.

The overall printing market saw hardware unit growth for the second successive quarter, driven by strength in laser. For
the third successive quarter, HP outperformed the market, gaining two points of share over the prior year in total and in
both ink and laser respectively.
In Enterprise Services, a soft revenue quarter pressured margins. As we laid out on our last call, the delayed revenue
runoff from fiscal year 2013 is impacting year-over-year compares for ES. In the first quarter, runoff occurred largely
as we expected, and resulted in a 1% operating margin, down 30 basis points over the prior year.
We're in the early innings of the transition we outlined in October the driver more proactive sales approach. In the first
quarter, we did see encouraging bookings growth in strategic enterprise services, there remains further opportunity for
us to improve our success in winning new large customers and securing add-on revenue from existing accounts. I'm
confident that we have the right plan in services and the team has made good progress in executing against our strategy.
But this is a ship to turn and we need to move faster, particularly on aligning our sales engine and improving our
service delivery for higher quality and lower cost.
In the Enterprise Group, we saw revenue growth of 1%, and expect calendar fourth quarter share gains across all the
hardware segments. Results in the first quarter were led by our revenue growth in ISS networking, partially offset by
revenue declined in PS. We saw stable performance in storage, where we continue to manage the transition from
traditional to converged storage. Finally, we continue to see revenue declines in business-critical systems.
Overall, we're still seeing a very competitive pricing environment in EG. Over time, we do expect to improve margins
in this business. There is more we can do, and as we look forward, we remain focused on better matching our product
mix to market segments, cost saving opportunities, and improving attach rates to drive increased operating margins.
In Industry Standard Server, we continued to make progress in stabilizing this business in the first quarter. We had
another strong hyperscale quarter, although this contributes to pressured margins. In addition, we continued to make
progress with Moonshot as we rolled out new workloads in the first quarter and introduce the first converged systems
for hosted desktop based on Moonshot technology. Customer interest remains high, and we're working with a number
of customers on proof of concept addressing a variety of different workloads.
In storage, overall revenue was flat. In converged storage, we saw 42% revenue growth over the prior year and 3PAR
continues to improve very well, particularly in the midrange segment.
In networking, we grew revenue 4% over the prior year. We saw good performance in switching, which grew revenue
5% over the prior year comparing very favorably against Cisco's results in the same period.
In technology services, revenue declined 4% over the prior year, but only down 2% in constant currency. We continue
to see good adoption of our new portfolio, including proactive care, where orders grew triple digits year-over-year, and
flexible capacity services, where we are seeing strong customer demand.
In software, I feel good about progress we're making. We have simplified product lines while rejuvenating our core
portfolio. We're investigating and key growth areas, and with the team is making great strides in the area of operational
improvement. Revenue was down 4% over the prior year but we grew in key areas of the portfolio including security,
cloud, and big data.
Weakness in our traditional IT management business, particularly in the U.S. and Asia, was partially offset by strength
in security offerings like ArcLight and Fortify, as well as in our Vertica business.
At Autonomy, the technology continues to resonate very well with customers as we launched IDOL 10 and Data
Protector 8.1. The industry's first adaptive and self-aware backup and recovery solution. In addition, Autonomy
announced a major win with China Mobile, selecting IDOL to power the search capability of its strategic Wireless City
platform. This platform allows users to access information on thousands of public services directly from their mobile
phones.
So overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made, but we still have a lot of work to do to drive consistent
execution and navigate a rapidly shifting marketplace.

Now let me to turn to our future outlook. The approach we outlined at our Security Analyst Meeting last fall remains
our compass to guide us in FY 2014. We will continue to focus on innovation, cash flow, our restructuring plan, and
executing on the areas of improvement in the turnaround while taking advantage of the realities of the new style of IT.
We are not expecting any significant change in the macro environment. There are definitely some encouraging signs
with improved performance in Western Europe, but headwinds remain in many emerging markets. Against that
backdrop, our Q2 outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share will be $0.85 to $0.89, and for the full year, the
outlook will be $3.60 to $3.75.
So now let me turn it over to Cathie for a closer look at our performance in the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine A. Lesjak
Thanks, Meg.
Overall, Q1 was a good start to fiscal 2014 as some of the fundamental improvements we've been driving are beginning
to take hold. But as Meg noted, we still are not satisfied with the consistency of our performance or the profitability
across some of our businesses. So we remain very focused on improving our go to market and cost structure.
Total revenue for the quarter was $28.2 billion, down 0.7% year-over-year and up 0.3% in constant currency. By
region, Americas revenue was $12.5 billion, down 2% year-over-year or down 1% in constant currency. The decline
was primarily due to key account runoffs in Enterprise Services in the U.S., partially offset by our previously
announced sale of IP.
EMEA revenue was $10.4 billion, up 1% year-over-year but down 1% in constant currency. While our EMEA outlook
remains cautious, we are seeing some signs of stabilization in more mature markets such as Germany and France.
APJ revenue was $5.2 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but up 5% in constant currency. We saw particular strength in
India again this quarter and China was flat. Relative to overall market challenges in the region, we are pleased with this
performance.
Gross margin for the quarter was 22.8%, up 0.5 points year-over-year and down 0.2 points sequentially. The
year-over-year improvement included some benefit from the IP sale. We continue to experience an aggressive pricing
environment across our hardware businesses which we are offsetting through productivity improvements and greater
service delivery efficiencies.
Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $4 billion, down 1.8% year-over-year and down 1.4%
sequentially. R&D expense was up over the prior-year period as we continue to invest in innovation in our strategic
focus areas, such as cloud, and across many of our business segments. SG&A was down over the prior-year period,
primarily due to gains from a real estate sale and expense benefits from our restructuring actions. These benefits were
partially offset by higher litigation reserves and investments in systems and tools.
As a result, non-GAAP operating profit was $2.4 billion, or 0.85% of revenue, up 0.6 points year-over-year. We
recorded $163 million of expense in the other income and expense line, a decrease from the prior-year period, driven
primarily by lower interest expense on reduced debt balances, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of currency
exchange rates.
With a 22% tax rate and a weighted average diluted share count of 1.935 billion shares, we delivered first quarter
non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.90. First quarter non-GAAP earnings primarily excludes pre-tax
charges of $283 million for amortization of intangible assets and $114 million for restructuring charges.
Turning to the business units. Printing continued to perform well with solid hardware unit growth for the third
consecutive quarter and good profitability as we continue to push our print strategies forward. Revenue was $5.8
billion, down 2.2% year-over-year and unit shipments grew 5%. Commercial hardware revenue was $1.3 billion, down

2% year-over-year, while consumer hardware revenue was $673 million, down just 1% year-over-year.
We are seeing contraction in average selling prices across ink and laser hardware, driven by the tough pricing
environment and the effect of currency exchange rates, but the underlying unit demand is improving.
For example, demand for our ink in the office products remained strong. The Officejet Pro X saw double-digit
sequential growth across all regions, and we continue to see double digit year-over-year revenue and unit growth in Ink
Advantage. In Laser, we gained share and are continuing to grow in Multifunction Printers and Managed Services, and
Graphics remains a bright spot with another solid performance in Indigo.
Supplies revenue was down 3% over the prior year period or down just 1% in constant currency, and made up 65% of
printing revenue. Supply softness was attributable to weakness in toner. Softer toner drove channel inventory levels
marginally up above our target range. We are actively managing this and the net impact to Q1 results was immaterial.
Overall Printing profitability remained solid with operating profit of $1 billion or 16.8% of revenue, up 0.5 points
year-over-year.
The performance in Personal Systems was better than expected with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 3.6% year-over-year,
driven by Commercial strength. There were signs of improved market conditions, especially in Commercial PCs, and
we are confident about our portfolio and focus. Although Consumer sales declined 3% year-over-year, Commercial
sales grew 8%. Commercial Notebooks grew double digits over the prior year period and Commercial Desktops were
up as well.
Total unit shipments grew 6% year-over-year with growth in both the Commercial and Consumer segments. Channel
inventory levels are down and well within acceptable ranges across all categories and regions. Personal Systems
operating profit was $279 million or 3.3% of revenue, up 0.5 points year-over-year. The results of our continued focus
on cost management and the IT sale were partially offset by increased DRAM costs as we indicated to you last quarter.
We remain focused on driving profitable growth in this business.
Enterprise Group revenue was $7 billion, up 0.6% year-over-year and up 1.5% in constant currency. Operating profit in
the quarter was $1 billion or 14.4% of revenue, down one point year-over-year. We believe these results show the
progress we are making on sales execution and the competitiveness of our portfolio as the market shifts towards the
new style of IT. However, we still have more work to do to improve profitability in the business. As Bill Veghte
discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting, we are focused on specific actions like optimizing our cost structure, more
closely aligning the business units in their regions, and better segmenting the market.
By business, Industry Standard Server revenue was $3.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year as we saw strong growth in
hyperscale again this quarter. Technology Services revenue declines have moderated somewhat with total revenue of
$2.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. The profitability expanded and customer
satisfaction improved. When you consider the significant headwind of the declining BCS business, the Technology
Services operating profit performance was strong.
In Storage and Networking, we're driving execution improvements to capture more market opportunities and we're
starting to see the results. Networking revenue growth started to accelerate in the first quarter. Revenue was $630
million in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Storage revenue was flat versus the prior year period at $834 million as
strong growth in Converged Storage offset declines in Traditional Storage. Converged Storage grew 42%
year-over-year and 3PAR plus EVA plus XP grew 13%, faster than the market again this quarter. This metric indicates
how well 3PAR is performing in disrupting the marketplace, taking into account the planned transition of our
traditional offerings.
Business Critical Systems continues to be impacted by a declining UNIX market. BCS revenue declined 25%
year-over-year to $228 million. We expect to gain two points of share in this market.
Enterprise Services revenue was $5.6 billion, down 7.3% year-over-year. The revenue decline was driven by the
delayed key account runoff, as we indicated to you previously. The revenue decline along with the investments we are
making in our sales force and increased litigation reserves on legacy accounts pressured our margins in the quarter.

Operating profit was $57 million or 1% of revenue, down 0.3 points year-over-year.
By business, IT Outsourcing revenue was $3.5 billion, down 9% year-over-year, and Applications and Business
Services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Both businesses were impacted by the key account
runoffs.
Overall signings were soft in Q1, but small and medium deals grew. Overall, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is still
within acceptable ranges. We've made some progress on improving productivity, but we have to move faster to drive
service delivery efficiencies, grow add-on business within existing accounts, and capture new logos.
Software revenue declined 3.7% over the prior-year period to $916 million, although we saw continued growth in key
areas such as SaaS, Vertica and security, and gained traction in our innovative big data platform, HAVEn. License
revenue declined 6% year-over-year, due to the continued market transition to SaaS, as well as some pressure in our IT
management business. However, we saw double-digit growth in cloud, Vertica, and Autonomy's IDOL license revenue.
Support sales declined 2% year-over-year as a result of historical license revenue declines. Professional services sales
declined 12% year-over-year, but the gross margin improved as we continue to prune our portfolio and focus on
profitability. SaaS revenue grew 6% over prior-year periods as we see continued momentum. Operating profit was
$145 million or 15.8% of revenue, down 0.5 points year-over-year. We continue to invest in strategic growth areas of
software and make progress on simplifying and enhancing our systems and processes to increase productivity.
HP Financial Services revenue was $870 million, down 9.1% year-over-year. Operating profit was $101 million or
11.6% of revenue, up one point from Q1 fiscal 2013. Pressure from volume declines in previous quarters impacted HP
financial services revenue, however new financing volume was up double digits, driven by strength in the direct
customer financing business. The health of our portfolio assets was strong and return on equity was 18% in the quarter.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, we had another strong quarter, generating $3 billion in operating cash flow,
up 17% year-over-year, which resulted in $2.4 billion in free cash flow. We continued our focus on working capital and
got our cash conversion cycle down to 16 days in the first quarter, down seven days from the prior-year period. We
improved across all metrics, but the largest improvement was in days payable outstanding.
We returned $565 million to shareholders by repurchasing 20.4 million shares in the quarter and paid $278 million in
the form of dividends. For the year, we are still committed to capital distributions and our plan to return at least 50% of
free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends as we outlined in the Security Analyst
Meeting.
During the quarter, we also completed a very successful $2 billion debt offering, our first term debt issuance in almost
two years. We ended the quarter with gross cash of $16.4 billion and operating company net cash of $1.7 billion, a $6.4
billion improvement over this period last year.
Looking forward to Q2, the market and competitive environment continues to be challenging. While there are signs of
recovery in some geographic regions, many areas across the globe are soft. Currency impacts are also affecting the
global business environment, and we expect currency to be about a one point headwind year-over-year to revenue in
Q2.
By business, in printing we will continue to invest in hardware unit placements where the lifetime return on the unit
makes economic sense, and we expect to drive continued momentum in key strategies across ink, laser, and graphics.
For personal systems, while we expect the commercial segment to continue to outpace the consumer segment, we
believe the overall market is likely to remain highly competitive.
In Enterprise Group, we remain focused on more successfully managing the margin profile, and we expect continued
traction in networking, converged infrastructure, and converged storage.
In Enterprise Services, we expect the delayed key account runoff to continue to pressure growth and profitability as we
drive forward the transitions from reactive to proactive sales.

Finally in Software, we expect to see continued traction in key growth areas like big data, while we invest in disruptive
technologies like HAVEn and security, and manage our portfolio's transition to SaaS.
As you build your models, please keep in mind there was a net benefit to Q1 results from the few items I've mentioned
earlier, including the IP and real estate sales as well as litigation and other expenses. Adjusting for these items, our Q1
non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share would've been around the midpoint of our previously provided Q1 outlook of
$0.82 to $0.86.
Also, in order to drive further operational improvements, we plan to increase our reinvestment in the business for the
full year by around $0.02 per share, up from the $0.12 we discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting.
With that context, we expect full-year fiscal 2014 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.60
to $3.75. For fiscal 2014 Q2, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share in the range of $0.85 to $0.89.
From a GAAP perspective, we expect a full-year GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.85 to
$3.00 and GAAP diluted net earnings per share for fiscal Q2 is expected to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.66.
For cash flow, based on the actions we're taking to drive working capital efficiencies, we now expect moderate
improvement in our cash conversion cycle from the low 20 day range we estimated previously. We expect this to
provide some upside to our original cash flow outlook for the year.
And with that, I'll open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Cathie, as you noted, you continue to beat the cash cycle target of
20 to 21 days. So can you just give us a little more detailed view as to what the right realistic near-term cash cycle
target is? And then assuming you still think that the company will drift back to the 20 to 21 day range, are there offsets
to that longer-term opportunity in CapEx or cash tax payments or other items such that you can offset an increase in
cash cycle longer term? Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Thanks, Katy. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do expect a moderate
improvement in the cash conversion cycle off of the guidance that we previously provided around the low-20s. And
we're very pleased with the progress that we've made in Q1 to drive 16 days cash conversion cycle, which is – just so
everyone thinks through this, is actually down a day sequentially and normal sequential performance is up anywhere
from a couple of days to three days. Now we did have some help in that in the sense that we had some nice favorable
revenue linearity, and we also benefited from the IP sale as well as the mix of PCs.
Because if you will recall, the PC cash conversion cycle is negative, and so as the PSG business increases its relative
mix, it puts and nice downward pressure on the cash conversion cycle. Over the longer-term, though, we do expect that
that mix from PSG will in fact decrease on a relative basis, and so that will put some upward pressure on the cash
conversion cycle.
So we do, as I say, overall, expect moderate improvement off of the low-20s that we provided before. We are also very
much focused on our capital expenditures and making sure that we are spending everything that we need to spend but
nothing more, and everything that we spend is driving the appropriate returns and we'll continue to be focused on that.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: And, Katy, I'd just add one more thing. It's Meg. The next chapter in improving our
cash generation capability is around SKUs and platform rationalization, because as you think about it, the more SKUs
and more platforms you have, the more inventory you have, the more parts you have and the chances you have the right
inventory in the right place at the right time decrease, so there's more leverage over the long-term, not necessarily in

Operator
We have Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein, please go ahead.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. I have a question and follow up, please. Cathie, I was hoping that you
could just provide a little bit more detail on the sale of the mobile computing IP that you alluded to as well as the real
estate sale? I think you also mentioned in your summary remarks that there had been some litigation as well, which was
a benefit, so perhaps you could just dimension the size of each of those and are they all captured in your corporate
investments reporting segment? Or are they somewhere else in your segment reporting? And then I have a follow-up,
please.
<A>: <A – [004RNG-E]Cathie Lesjak – Hewlett-Packard Co.>: Sure. Toni, thanks for the question. So I think what's
important to understand is that a number of these items are what I would consider normal operating transactions for the
business. Now what's different in this quarter, and the reason why we're calling them out, is that they're larger than they
typically are in a quarter, and so we think it's important to provide that kind of color. And what it is is that we've got
sales of IP that the vast majority of those sales do show up in the Corporate Investments segment, but there is a small
piece that shows up in PSG as well. And then we've got gains on sales of real estate, partially offset by increased
litigation expenses as well as some other smaller items.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So, Toni, the litigation expense was not a good thing. It was a negative.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: That's right. It offset the gains from the sale of IP and real estate.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Okay. And where are those occurring? Are those also being captured in the corporate
investments line or are they somewhere else in the reported segments?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Right. So the increase in litigation expenses shows up in the corporate other, corporate
investments segment to a large extent but there is a small piece that is also showing up in the Enterprise Services
Group.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: And the real estate gain?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Real estate gain shows up in the corporate investments or corporate other segment as
well.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Okay. Thank you. And then if I could just follow up on the services side, you talked about
some – it was largely in line with your expectations for Q1, but you expected the drag to continue. Are you still
confident in your full-year outlook of 3.5% to 4.5% operating margin for that business and a 4% to 6% decline in
revenues for that business for this year or are you recalibrating it in light of weak signings and other issues?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So we're not recalibrating. We still expect 3.5% to 4.5% from an operating margin
perspective and the 4% to 6% decline in revenue.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks, Toni. Next question, please?

<Q - Jim Suva>: Great. Thank you, and congratulations to your team at HP. You've done a lot of work and it's really
showing, which is fabulous. Of course, there's always areas for improvement, and one area for improvement is, I think,
the operating margins or profitability within the services segment. Can you talk a little bit about that? I mean,
year-over-year you definitely have some trailing off of revenues, which we understand, but given all the restructuring
HP's been doing, it's kind of a bit surprising to see the year-over-year operating margins in that segment actually
declined year-over-year. We understand the seasonal nature, but the year-over-year decline. And it sounds like you're
sticking to your goal, but is it just truly you're investing a lot more and at some point you foresee turning the corner to
positive sales growth in that area, and would that be this year? Or help us understand how to bridge the gap of the
restructuring with the year-over-year operating profit decline? Thank you.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So we're at the beginning of, as I said, a multi-year turnaround in our Enterprise
Services business and this is, has unlike our PC business or even our Industry Standard Servers business, this has
nothing to do with the transactional business. These are long-term contracts, and so it takes a little bit longer to turn the
ship around. And we've got work to do on labor. Not only the number of delivery centers, our labor pyramid, and we
have more work to do in terms of our labor force in Europe, and that is well underway.
We also are doing a lot of investments in our systems and technology. This business really didn't have the visibility and
the instrumentation that we needed to run a very labor-intensive business. We've made those investments and they're
starting to bear fruit, and I think you'll see those bear fruit through the rest of the year. And then ultimately we have to
turn the revenue corner here. We had, as we said for a couple of years now, key account runoffs, and we've got to turn
the revenue trajectory. And we've restructured our sales organization, we've got seven new practice areas that are
designed to meet the needs of very specifically of customers, what they want from our services business. So over the
long-term, we're optimistic.
This is playing out in 2014 almost exactly, I think, the way Cathie and I thought it would. Do you want to add anything
to that?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Yeah, maybe I can provide just a little bit more specifics on the decline year-over-year in
the operating margin. What we saw was progress on productivity initiatives as well as improvement in some of our
underperforming accounts on a year-over-year basis. Now this was offset by the fact that this key account runoff is
higher-margin runoff. We continue to have contractual price concessions that we have to make on certain contracts, and
then we did increase our investment in some of our OpEx items.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you, and congratulations again to you and your team at HP.

We have Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal, please go ahead.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, guys. I wanted to ask about Enterprise Group and PCs. On Enterprise Group, revenues
were up 1%, and ISS actually had another good quarter. And the question is, Meg or Cathie, as you look at 2014, is a
positive revenue number sustainable for this division? And the corollary question is on the PC side, you mentioned you
feel better about corporates. And what's your confidence level on that in terms of sustainability? Because it sounds like
there is some pull in for XP, but just when you talk about, you feel like corporate is better, corporate buying is better, is
that sustainable through the year? Or does that – does that fall off here as Microsoft goes through its transition? Thank
you.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Sure. Let me take a crack at that. It's Meg. And then I'll get Cathie to weight in. On the
Enterprise Group side, we do think revenue growth is possible through the remainder of the year. We saw good traction
in ISS. Listen, we still have a BCS drag on the portfolio and that's going to continue for the foreseeable future. We're

optimistic about storage, particularly 3PAR, and Networking got off to a good start. So we've got to continue to
execute, we've got to get our sales motion exactly right, and we have to get our innovation into the market and sold in a
way that customers can understand and appreciate. So I think I feel good about Enterprise Group.
PSG, I think what most people will be surprised about in this earnings call is how well PSG did, and I do a shout-out to
Dion Weisler and his team as they continue to execute. Our multi-OS, multi-architecture, multi-form factor strategy is
working well. Market segmentation and leveraging our strengths in Commercial and go-to-market capability is working
well. And there was a bit of a tailwind on the migration from XP to Windows, but I wouldn't say that was an
overwhelming factor. It was important but not overwhelming. I do think there's also some momentum in the long term,
a long-overdue PC refresh.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: And what I think Commercial customers are understanding from their employees is,
while employees may want a tablet, they actually also need more traditional compute devices to do their real work in
the everyday environment in their company. So that's helpful.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: So, Meg, could this be a positive number for the year too, as you think about PSG?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Hard to call it. This is a – this has been over the last two years a pretty volatile market.
My experience over many years in business is, you always underestimate on the way down or you over – you
underestimate on the way down about how bad it's going to be. And then you – on the way up, sometimes it's better
than you think it's going to be. But I think it's too early to call. I think we should be relatively cautious here, given the
volatile nature of the business.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: What's really important, with respect to the PC business, is that we've got to focus on
profitable growth. And if that means that there is less topline growth, that's okay because we're focused on profitable
growth.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right, right. Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Rob Binns>: Thanks, Keith. Next question, please?
Operator
We have Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan, please go ahead.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions if I could. With the Storage business
continuing to improve, are you starting to see some cross-pollination or cross-selling as a result of that pulling through
Networking or other parts of your business?
And then the second question is more philosophically, Meg, with the continued improvement in the balance sheet, just
to model cash flow, is there any change here in terms of organic versus inorganic investment? Could you start to maybe
look outside to make some acquisitions, maybe bolt-on acquisitions first, before you get a little more courageous?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Okay. Let me start with storage. Listen, we're making a big push towards converged
infrastructure. We rolled out new converged infrastructure offerings, which we call 'Sharks,' at Discover in Barcelona.
It's a perfect channel product, easy to sell, very specifically focused on certain workloads. And so we're bullish on
Storage and we think that as we embed storage into converged infrastructure, that there is some pull-through. At least
that's the bet we're making.
With regard to acquisitions, we stand by where we were at our industry or at our Security Analyst Meeting last
October, that we will return at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in terms of repurchase of shares and
dividends. But I do think we will be now considering acquisitions. As this market changes very dramatically, you can

see that we may need acquisitions in security, big data, mobility, and cloud. We will be very judicious, it'll be
returns-based, and I'd say it'd be small- to medium-sized acquisitions. So that's where we're headed, but the capital
allocation strategy that we laid out at SAM, exactly the same.

Operator
Ben Reitzes with Barclays, please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin A. Reitzes>: Hey. Thanks a lot. Can you talk about Services just a little more? The 1% operating
margin and you've got to get to 3.5% to 4.5% for the year, so how do you get there? It sounds like you kept all your
targets. So how do we improve as we go throughout each quarter, and what are you working on specifically to get
there? Thanks.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So, Ben, one of the things, if you go back to some of the commentary in the first half
of last year, you'll recall that we talked about the delayed key account runoff, but you might also recall that we talked
about the fact that we were selling more project-based business into those accounts to help them make the transitions
that they were focused on, and that increased profitability and revenue, but increased profitability in the first half of the
year.
And so we are now working through that because now the account runoff is in fact coming through and the project
up-sell is not happening in those accounts. And so we expected that the first half of the year would always be under
more pressure and that we would see more of an uptick. We'll see an uptick quarter-to-quarter, but more of an uptick in
the second half versus the first half. We're also making this pivot, we're making investments into our sales force to
move from less reactive renewal-based to more proactive sales, and that starts to have a bit more of a help in the second
half of the year.
<Q - Benjamin A. Reitzes>: Okay. And obviously more leverage from the restructuring, I assume?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Absolutely. We're continuing to restructure as well, and actually at the total company
level, we had another roughly 3,700 employees that left under the program, and so now we are running program to date
at 28,300.
<Q - Benjamin A. Reitzes>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Aaron Rakers with Stifel, please go ahead.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back and build on Keith's questions with
regard to the Enterprise Group. Understanding the revenue growth and possibly the expectation that that can be
sustained throughout this year, how are we thinking about particularly the hardware operating margin trend? It looks
like, given your commentary with technology services operating margin improving, it looks like we've still seen a bit of
a deceleration in the traditional hardware operating margin. So is that really product cycle driven? I think last quarter
you also had implemented some go-to-market strategies, so any update there would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Well, let me weigh in and then I'll let Cathie chime in as well. Listen, we are turning
the Enterprise Group around, and you can see it in the revenues and the success in ISS revenues as well as networking
and storage. We've still got more work to do on the margin, and the margin, Aaron, can improve in two ways. One is
within the product line because we decide what deals we're going to go after and with what product, we manage our
cost structure aggressively, but there's also a mix thing going on here as well. Because every time we sell storage and

networking, that is margin accretive to HP versus our classic ISS business.
So those are the two levers that we have to pull. And I think we have not demonstrated yet our best efforts in doing this.
These things take a while to turn, but we're on it. We've got the right people on it, and I think you'll see margin
improvement over the course of the year if the market holds up and we can continue to execute.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And I'd add maybe a couple of more points. First, it's not just storage and networking,
although that is a big piece of the mix, it's our also new products. Our new products have better margins as well. And
then just as you think about kind of the profitability of EG for the year and you go back to what we said at the Security
Analyst Meeting, where we said that EG's contribution to the year-over-year improvement in EPS at the company level
would be anywhere from one penny dilutive to a couple cents accretive, and this is before the basically $0.12 at that
time that we were investing back into the business, and now we're adding an additional $0.02. And so we still believe
that that's what the result will be in EG.

Brian Alexander with Raymond James, please go ahead.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: All right, thanks. If I could go back to the cash flow, Cathie, you mentioned that the cash
conversion cycle should be moderately better than you expected. I think every day of improvement is a few hundred
million dollars a quarter in cash flow, so is your operating cash flow target for the year rising by $1 billion to $2 billion
or are there offsets to that? I didn't hear a specific number relative to your original goal of $9 billion to $9.5 billion, so I
was just hoping you could be a little bit more specific. Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So I didn't provide a very specific number, because we don't typically update our cash
flow guidance on a quarterly basis. But you should read through that if the cash conversion cycle is moderately better
than the low-20s, we're not seeing the same level of degradation in the cash conversion cycle in 2014 as we had
originally expected that that would give us a bit of an uplift to the cash flow for the year.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: And I think if I heard you right, Brian, you said that the cash flow guidance had been
$9 billion to $9.5 billion. It's actually $6 billion to $6.5 billion.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: That's free cash flow.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Oh, okay.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: He was talking about cash flow from ops.

<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. Obviously your execution is much better, but Meg, you talked about better
repositioning of the company kind of relative to your competitors. And I was just going to challenge you a little bit on
that. IBM obviously is getting out of servers, you kind of alluded to that, out of x86 servers, but that's because they see
it as a very low margin business. Your software exposure is still quite low relative to your competitors. You've actually
become somewhat more dependent on printing over the last 12 to 18 months, so I know I'm picking on the negatives,
but could you talk about what you mean by improved repositioning, particularly from a competitive standpoint?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yes. Sure. So two-and-a-half years ago, we embarked on some pretty significant
changes to this company around the cost structure, around our pivot to the new style of IT, around investment in
innovation. We totally understood what was happening in this market two years ago, and we began to take actions. And
I think what you see is our competitors now having to take some of those same actions around cost-reduction. You're
starting to some weakness in their results, which we saw two and half years ago.
So my point is that I think we've been hard at work on doing a lot of things that are going to position us as this industry
continues to go through some very challenging changes. I mean, the pace of change and the magnitude of the change
here is as great as I've seen in my career, and I think we're reasonably well-positioned to take advantage of those
changes.
We have businesses that are declining businesses. We understand where they are, we understand what we need to do
with them. We've got businesses that are holding in terms of revenue, and then we've got growth businesses, we have
pivoted investment, we've pivoted people, we've pivoted go to market to those growth areas of the company and by the
way, it started two years ago.
So I just would say we have a running start. We never underestimate the competition, but I think because we were in
such a tough situation two and half years ago, we got head start.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: That's fair. And what are you hearing from your customers? Are they in fact making
architectural decisions that are deferring some of their purchases right now or not?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So I'd say I'm hearing two things from our customers. One is tremendous increase in
confidence in HP. We look like a paragon of stability right now, which is very different than it was two years ago. And
they have a lot of confidence in where we are headed from a product road map perspective.
They are making decisions, architectural decisions, we don't see them holding off on that. There's movement around
Cloud, there's movement around which are they going to make a bet on HP's hybrid cloud, are they going to make a bet
on someone else's cloud, so there is a battle going on for architectural control in the enterprise.
And we feel good about where we are in that. It's early stages, there's still a lot of proof of concept, there's still a lot of
trying to decide what workloads people want to move to the cloud, what kind of cloud they want to move those
workloads to, but I would say, particularly within cloud and then big data, we've got a very compelling offering.
This hybrid cloud offering that we crafted well over a year and a half ago is the right answer. I can tell you every single
day, customers say this is exactly what I want. And then in big data, the response to HAVEn is tremendous, because
everyone's looking for a big data analytics platform that is based on Hadoop, that can combine structured data plus
unstructured data with enterprise grade security with the ability for them to write apps, us to write apps, and the
ecosystem to write apps. And so the response to that is another really good thing in the marketplace.
So it's a battle. It's a knife fight every single day out there, but we feel like we've got the right ammunition.

Shannon Cross with Cross Research, please go ahead.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the toner business,
specifically talk about, I guess, year-over-year declines in terms of revenue in the quarter, how you think that plays out
through the year, and you noted, I think, that channel inventory is up a little bit, just any color you can give? And then I
have a follow-up.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. Thanks, Shannon. So what we're seeing on the toner side is definitely softness, just
to be clear, on the ink side, we saw growth in ink supplies, and it was really toner that took supplies down the 2.5% that
we saw, that was also – currency also contributed to that, I would say the toner softness was due two big things. One is
we are seeing incrementally much more aggressive price competition from some of the Japanese competitors who, of
course, have the benefit of the weaker yen, and then we are starting to see and increasing competition from clones and
re-manufacturers as well.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. And then can you -
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: I'm sorry, which is going to say, we've got to continue to place laser units with
positive lifetime value. And I think what we said, the third consecutive quarter of incremental placements in laser. Our
portfolio of multi-function color printers is actually now hitting its real stride.
We just introduced many of them at the end of last year or even the beginning of this year. We're gaining share in a
category that HP had been underrepresented. But if we were underrepresented in that market share, it means we didn't
have the toner trailing that market share year. Now we have a product, and so the units we are placing today pay
dividends next year and the year after. And so I think you should feel good about the share gains we're making.
And then lastly, is the managed print services. This is where the benefit of management services is we get 100% of the
aftermarket, so that's an important thing as well, and what 4 or 5 years ago, Cathie, we didn't even really have a
business there, and now that's a successful business for us, and we're growing it.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Yes, and the TCB in that business this quarter was up strong double digits, so continuing
to make good progress in managed print services.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. And then if you can just talk a little bit about the server business and
specifically I'm curious as to what you're seeing in terms of the IBM sale? Any opportunity to gain share there, and
how you're looking at targeting some of that business?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yes. So as everyone on the call knows, Lenovo announced they're buying IBM's x86
server business from top to bottom. The good news is that that does create, I think, an opportunity for us, because what
I've learned about this business is instability and questions about the future make it very difficult, because people want
to bet on a road map, and they're worried that as a change of ownership occurs is the road map the same? Is the
investment the same? Is the go-to-market going to be the same? Is the service going be the same?
So I think we have a near-term opportunity here to gain share in our enterprise services or in our server business. So we
are all over it. Were all over it with our channel partners, and I think there's a good near-term opportunity. In the
long-term, obviously, Lenovo's going to be a powerful competitor. We aim to be well set up by the time the deal is
done to compete really aggressively.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks a lot, Shannon. Next question, please? We have time for one or two more.

Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. Can you give us a bit more color on the traction you're seeing with the new
portfolio offerings for the technology services business and I guess over time how should we think about when an

increased attach rate here can fully counter some of the hardware install base erosion you mentioned given that's
somewhat of a moving target?
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yes. There's a couple of things going on here. First of all, part of the decrease is that
we have taken a grow only profitable revenue in Technology Services Consulting. This was a business a couple of
years ago that was actually not very profitable or maybe even losing money, so part of the decline is a conscious
decision to be in the consulting business only if it makes money.
But you're right, there was a very high attach rate to BCS, and as BCS declines you're going to see some natural
degradation. I think the TS team deserves a huge amount of credit for product innovation that has mitigated that
decline. Proactive Datacenter Care is – the bookings, Cathie, right, are in triple digits? Triple digits, I mean this is a
very well-received product in the marketplace.
And then flexible capacity services, which really capitalizes on the trend of infrastructure as a service, so what flexible
capacity services is, is we can roll in a unit of compute into a customer's data center, they control it. It's on premise, and
yet they can pay for it on a, if you will, as a service basis. There is a minimum that they have to consume. There is
obviously a maximum that that unit of compute can deliver, but they have the ability to flex up and down and it turns
out that actually works for us economically because of HP Financial Services. So we don't have a balance sheet
problem that you might imagine on an as a service infrastructure product.
So we're excited about both of those. There's a big pipeline, this product by the way, Flexible Capacity Services, was
pioneered in Europe, we have got a big pipeline there, and proactive Datacenter Care off to really strong start. And so
shout out to the team because they've really- they saw what was happening and they responded with product, which is
what HP has to do. We have to keep innovating because as some businesses start fall away, we have to have new
businesses that can take their place with higher margins.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: I think it's also important in the TS business to understand that roughly half of the decline
is as a result of currency.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Good point.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And if you actually had modeled what the decline in hardware over the last year would do
to support, it would be materially more than what we're seeing and that's the result of all of these new product
innovations that Meg was talking about. Specifically in terms of penetration rates, we are seeing growth in both storage
and non-networking penetration rates, and that is going to help offset some of the pressure that we're seeing from BCS
declines.
<A - Rob Binns>: Great. Thanks for the question, Bill. Time for one last one.

We have Maynard Um with Wells Fargo, please go ahead.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi. Thanks. Meg, so you've been in the CEO position now I think for three and half years.
Presumably you have a better feel and for areas that are non-core. So I'm wondering if we might see more divestitures
coming this year.
And then I was also hoping if you just elaborate on the account runoffs and in particular the Navy contract which was
extended from June to September? So I'm wondering what the dynamics there are and if that helps this fiscal year in
terms of the revenues and the profits for the services segment? Thanks.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Sure. So actually I've been here two and a half years, sometimes it feels like three and
a half, but I've been here two and a half. And obviously I have a much better feel of the product portfolio and the
capabilities of the organization. And now we're in the position of really looking at the portfolio within the portfolio
within the portfolio. Right now, I don't see a major move of the big four businesses, but this is a vast portfolio and there

are product lines and smaller businesses within these big operating divisions that could be candidates for divestiture.
We haven't made any decisions, but we are now getting to the natural course of okay, do we have the optimized
portfolio?
With regard to the Navy contract, this was actually not really a key account runoff because the Navy contract was
rebid, and we won for 10 years. So we're excited about that contract. It was a lower margin contract, as you might
imagine, but we are in a very good position with the Navy. But there was profit pressure from a decreased profitability
as we rebid that Navy contract, but it's not a runoff. It's just it's another 10 years at slightly lower margins.
Rob Binns
Super. All right. Thanks very much. And that concludes the questions. And with that, we'll wrap up the call. So thank
you, everybody, for participating, and we'll talk soon. Thanks very much.
