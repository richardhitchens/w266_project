MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings, and welcome to the Monsanto Company Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank
you, Mr. Hurley. You may now begin.
Bryan Hurley
Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter earnings update. I'm joined this
morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; as well
as Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann and Tim Boeker.
Because it reflects the first view on the North American season, the second quarter provides an important proof-point
of growth from our core seed and trait business, so our emphasis today will be on the confidence that provides in our
outlook and our continuing growth opportunity.

This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and replay at monsanto.com. We have
provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and on an ongoing business basis. Where we refer to
non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on
the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a
material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may
cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.
So we'll move quickly to the discussion of our Q2 results and the outlook. The key highlights are on slide four. At an
ongoing EPS level, we delivered 15% growth in the quarter. On the gross profit line, nearly 80% of the absolute growth
comes from our Seeds and Genomics segment, and within that, solid growth in both our soybean and corn portfolios.
That was further highlighted by record second quarter gross profit in our soybean business, reflecting contributions
from multiple elements of our soybean platform coming online.
The quarter also reflects strong progress on each of our full-year financial targets with improvement across our total
company GP, Seeds and Genomics GP, our corn and soybean margins, and our ongoing EBITDA growth. After delays
in the early part of the quarter from extended winter storms on North American logistics, we were able to largely
catch-up on our overall shipments by the end of the quarter. And as a result, there's no change to our quarterly flow
related to those early weather challenges. With our strong seed and trait performance in Q2, we also anticipate a strong
conclusion to the year with a significantly smaller loss in Q4 to punctuate the year, and a Q3 that we expect to be
somewhat lower than last year.
For the full-year, we've reconfirmed our guidance for fiscal year 2014 ongoing EPS in the range of $5 to $5.20, an
ongoing EBITDA growth in the mid-to-high teens. That outlook incorporates the reality that there are more headwinds
across the Ag industry this year, largely driven by currency effects, which create an estimated $0.15 to $0.20 full-year
EPS headwind relative to our projections, and that are built into our guidance.
So with that, let me hand it to Hugh for the strategic view at the second quarter.
Hugh Grant
Thanks, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line. With our largest quarter and the first proof-points for the
key Northern Hemisphere Ag season at hand, I'd emphasize that our business is on track to deliver the growth we
anticipated for fiscal year 2014. This is a quarter where the outlook is as important as the financials. So let me highlight
three key points.
Number one, despite the greater variability you see across the Ag sector this year, today, we've confirmed our full-year
guidance shown on slide five. This is a year where everyone in agriculture recognizes the market realities of softer
commodity prices, more volatile global currencies, and some decrease in corn acres in key markets like the Americas.
We're not immune to these trends, and Pierre will quantify some of those macro headwinds in our outlook, but it's
important that even in a year with such prominent headwinds, Monsanto has the right portfolio to deliver expected
strong growth for yet another year.
Next, the second quarter's actually the key proof-point that in a softer commodity environment, Monsanto is growing
our core seeds and traits business. Almost 80% of our gross profit growth in the quarter comes directly from seeds, and
in particular, corn and soybeans. That's key as it means our seed and trait business is delivering in the major areas and
across the milestones that are critical to our success this year.
Third; that growth delivery is a direct function of the diversity that we have in a broader global portfolio. And within
this balanced portfolio, we've a strong line of sight that reinforces our confidence in both the strong second half and the
punctuation on this year's total growth. This is the year where we wanted to see the seed business deliver as the prime
growth engine, and that's exactly what we see in the second quarter checkpoint.

That's important because the performance this year also unlocks a longer-term run-rate. There are two things that you
look for in that opportunity; the demand-driven macro environment, and the growth layers that are unique to us. On the
macro side, I think of 2014 as a transition year. With the effect of the severe drought in 2012 and the supply side
pressures over the past few years, we've come through an abnormal period of some extreme conditions and inflated
commodity prices.
But on slide six, expand the scope and look at demand in the context of the multi-year runway. As you do that, the
macro environment normalizes, and importantly, the long-term trends set the tone. And those trends are strong,
wide-reaching, and compelling. The hallmark of the next 10 years is that demand cannot be met by increasing acres, as
we have over the past. So we see no real alternative, other than boosting productivity. That's the concept of sustainable
intensification. We've built our business over the last decade to be ready for that generational opportunity.
That opportunity starts this year, and as we target that long-term demand-driven opportunity, Monsanto has more
company-specific catalysts across more platforms than we've ever had, and we show that on slide seven. Brett will
cover these in more detail, but the bottom line is that the factors that play out in the longer-term are more visible, more
proven, and more transformational than they've ever been.
The first of those comes with record second quarter growth for our soybean business, as we've the early validation on
the decade of the soybean as one of our most transformational opportunities. That's highlighted by Intacta. With the
launch this year, we've the data point to say that not only is Intacta out of the gate, but it started at a leapfrog pace at the
beginning of 100 million acre market that we expect will rewrite our soybean growth opportunity.
The second factor comes, as we layer on top of that, the steady expected growth as we use our breeding advantage to
upgrade our seed portfolio every year, particularly in corn. It's a powerful point of leverage when you think that what
we are doing is seeing a steady growth contribution from our biggest global business year-in and year-out.
And finally, this year, we're unlocking new platforms that have the potential to be some of the most significant business
drivers in our portfolio within the decade. These range from the Precision Ag platform that we've assembled under The
Climate Corporation to our new biologicals platform with Novozymes. These aren't significant financial growth factors
this year, but we've clearly taken the first step to establish these as platforms that we believe can be completely new
categories of opportunity.
Collectively, this is the broader global portfolio that we've consciously cultivated over the last several years. We've
passed milestones in each this year so the visibility that we have on these core company catalysts reinforces an
important level of confidence that we have, and why our continuing opportunity is so compelling.
And that brings me to my final point. There's no doubt that the Ag environment has been more variable this year than it
has been over the past several. And while there's still a lot to play out, I'm pleased that we've been able to demonstrate
that our seeds and traits business can grow against that backdrop. That speaks to the value of our technology and the
strength of our portfolio. That in turn means that we're in a good position to deliver growth today, while also building
the platforms that access the important longer-term opportunities in agriculture. So we're on track, we see real
opportunity in the demand trends, and we're focused on delivering.
So with that, let me hand it to Brett to take a deeper dive into the operational milestones that are embedded in our
results for this quarter.
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone on the line. Coming end of the year, we said that our seeds and traits
business would return as the biggest driver of our growth. Within that, I said our focus would be on margins, and
specifically that we anticipated seeing significant margin expansion. As we show on slide eight, that's on track. The
proof-point now shows on the financial statements in the quarter, as margins are moving up in the overall seed
business. Let me walk through these drivers and give you the proof-points, both for fiscal year 2014 and for our growth

from here.
Given the prominence of the North America season in Q2, I'll start with how the season's shaping up now that the order
book is translating to the early shipments ahead of planting on slide nine. With the market variability coming out of a
very atypical 2013, there's been a heavier-than-usual focus on commodity prices, acre projections and discounting
noise. I see 2014 clearly playing out as a normal year. And the growth we saw in our order book is carried through the
early shipments, putting us on track for the strong growth in our global portfolio that we see driving our full-year
margin increases.
With shipments underway, we're on track for the 5% to 10% mix lift in our global corn and seed portfolio. This year,
we'd expect to be towards the lower end of that range as we factor-in the global headwinds like currency. There's real
power in this significant steady engine across our business that translates to an expected greater-than-$1 billion of net
sales growth over the next five years, just from this corn germplasm upgrade; that's why this is such a powerful
business factor.
In the quarter, the proof-point is the margin expansion I mentioned. Corn margins are up approximately 2.5 points, and
a portion of that is the global mix benefit that comes from our portfolio upgrade. The first increment of our improved
cost position is also starting to flow through. And this COGS benefit in corn continues throughout the North America
season. This has us well positioned for the 3-point margin growth we expect for the full-year.
Among the key seasonal factors, the next step comes as planting gets underway, and the focus will be on the obvious
variables; the weather, and farmers' planting decisions. The winter weather slowed some of the pace of logistics on
early deliveries, but hasn't carried over, now that we're a step closer to planting.
As we saw last year, weather's more of an influence during planting, and the spring weather window will help
determine if incremental acres go to corn, soybeans, cotton or elsewhere. Given the balance in our portfolio, we're in a
good position to serve our farmer customers however these decisions shake out. So that may change the composition of
what we sell, but I don't think it changes the bottom line opportunity.
If I shift gears slightly to slide 10, one of the things that I think gets missed with all the focus on commodity prices and
acres is that we're on track for a record volume in our global corn portfolio. In the quarter, we have a couple of new
data points. Not surprisingly, with the second season largely planted in Brazil, it's clear that the overall corn acres were
down in Latin America this year. Against that, we now have the visibility on volume in the Northern Hemisphere, and
we're on track for volume growth for the year.
If we look at Latin America, it's an important area where we hit strategic milestones this year. In Argentina, we're on
track with the upgrade to the triple stack. Likewise, in Brazil, we're making progress on our next-generation traits. In
that regard, the corn opportunity has parallels to the Intacta in soybeans, as the tropical insect pressure means the value
and opportunity is really in the insect control traits. So products like our double stacked insect control traits are really
leading that upgrade trend.
As we move to the Northern Hemisphere, despite the obvious turmoil in the Ukraine, one of the most significant
opportunities this year comes from the broader Eastern European market. It's really one of the fastest-growing regions
in our portfolio today, because there's a trifecta of opportunity in germplasm mix upgrade, significant share growth, and
a growing overall market. Today, this is more than a 30 million acre market and one where we've effectively doubled
our footprint in the last several years.
Relative to the Ukraine, we see the same factors as others in the industry. There's been some disruption tied to the
political unrest, but we've been working through that and feel good about the full-year contribution to growth. This
global expansion is key in delivering our growth this year, but it's perhaps more important in the long-term opportunity.
We have a leading global position that spans markets and crops, so however the macro acres trend in any given year,
there's an increased geographic balance in our portfolio. So while the U.S. will still be the cornerstone for us, our
overall growth isn't tied to one market.

From there, the next driver, soybeans on slide 11; with Intacta, Roundup Ready 2 Yield, and the Roundup Ready 2
Xtend platforms, we've entered a new era of opportunity and acceleration that can drive overall growth for years to
come. That shows in the margin improvement for the quarter. The 7-point expansion is particularly strong in the
quarter, as we have all of the drivers showing up in the financials, ranging from Intacta sales to the next incremental
contribution from Roundup Ready 2 Yield from U.S. licensing. As all of those factors continue to grow, we expect
more than $1 billion in net sales growth across the soybean platform in the next five years.
There's no bigger 2014 milestone than the Intacta launch in Latin America on slide 12. With this quarter, reporting is
largely in for the season, and we've delivered the 3 million acres making the Latin America rollout of Intacta the largest
launch of a soybean trait in our history. Just as importantly, we've emphasized our focus on the first year experience,
and we reached more than 13,000 farmers with our commercial rollout, up from the 1,000 participants in our Ground
Breakers program last year. We had more than 35 varieties in the market this year, more than double the varieties we
had with our U.S. launch of Roundup Ready 2 Yield.
We're still harvesting our seed production for next year, but we'd expect to double the number of varieties for 2015,
reaching an even broader geographic area. That focus on the experience has us on track with some of the best first year
performance we've seen in any trait we've launched. The first feedback came with the heavy insect pressure that swept
Brazil this year. With the emergence of a new caterpillar pest, Intacta is actually providing a better performing
alternative that's giving farmers a new tool.
And on slide 13, with good progress in overall harvest, the new information we have today is the initial yield data from
the very first commercial experience. With almost 50% of the data in from our testing, we're matching the
better-than-four-bushel-an-acre advantage we saw in Ground Breakers and the commercial experience that comes in
trials comparing Intacta against soybeans typically using multiple insecticide treatments. So we're seeing both yield
benefits and better insect control.
With the productivity gains from less insecticide use, the visible differences in insect protection, and clear yield
benefits, this first year experience was a clear success. And that's the critical pace-setter we wanted to see as we start in
2015, what we expect is one of the fastest historical ramp ups as we target more than 100 million acres across Latin
America. Across the larger current portfolio, I'd just mention briefly that our Ag Productivity business continues to be
on track.
Our strategy and market outlook have been consistent with what we anticipated. We've seen some continued financial
benefit as our mix and market pricing have been in the range we expected through Q2. That trend likely puts us more
towards the stronger side of our full-year outlook for a steady to stronger contribution in this segment. On the roster of
what we needed to deliver this year, the last is establishing the foundation for one of the most transformational
long-term opportunities, the Precision Agriculture platform on slide 14.
Today, it's one of our most promising opportunities with 1 billion acre runway. So the foundation we set this year is
important. We've brought all of our Precision Agriculture technology under the banner our Climate Corporation
platform. We see this as a family of products, and that's a big advance as it takes Precision Ag from the piecemeal
offerings in the market today to a real unified platform. We've always viewed our strategic retail partners as a
significant advantage in the Precision Ag space.
This platform now touches more decisions on a grower's farm, and retailers play a key role in many of those key
decisions ranging from seed selection to fertility to pest and disease management, and we're making real progress. We
have business agreements in process with all of our major retail partners. Combined, these partners account for roughly
half of Monsanto's U.S. business today and represent more than $25 billion in total sales every year across seed and all
the key Ag inputs and services.
This year, we're beginning to take our overall platform to the commercial stage. As you look at this portfolio of
products, it starts to resemble the multi-stack approach you see with biotech traits, with hundreds of thousands of acres
in early trial within the precision farming family, and an expected 20 million acres with access to the Gateway tools of
Climate Basic. You can see that this can be a meaningful platform quickly. Since we made The Climate Corporation

acquisition, there's been a lot more talk about Precision Ag in the industry. But I think with our differentiated
technology and emphasis on industry collaboration, we're the best positioned with a true platform.
Let me bring all these data points together. When you look through the lens of fiscal year 2014, the drivers are on track.
We're seeing the growth engine in seeds and both of those things are allowing us to deliver the growth we anticipated.
And with what we accomplish in 2014, we set up an important runway that allows us to grow now, while we
simultaneously position ourselves for that important longer-term opportunity.
So with that, let me hand it over to Pierre.
Pierre Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. Having heard about the business milestones that back our confidence in
our performance and opportunity, let me now highlight the corresponding financial proof-points that reinforce this
confidence. As I do that, I'll focus on a couple of key points that tie our Q2 results to our full year financial outlook.
First, despite the greater variability in the overall Ag market this year that Hugh and Brett called out, we are on track
with our plans, and we have the visibility to confirm our growth and guidance today. It certainly helps to put some
financial context to some of the industry headwinds, and the two biggest of those are currency and lower corn acres in
some key markets.
Relative to our initial planning, I'd estimate the full-year headwind is largely driven by currency and would be in the
order of $0.15 to $0.20 in total. The ability to overcome those headwinds and deliver growth really speaks to the
strength of our underlying business in our core growth engine. Second, the strength of those business drivers actually
creates a very clear line of sight to a strong second half of the year. We have communicated earlier that we expect a
historically strong fourth quarter to punctuate the year, so we expect to build on the good growth we saw in the first
half, with an overall strong second half, and one of the strongest fourth quarters we've seen in recent years.
And finally, if I move beyond the P&L, we continue to make progress on our initiative to be more aggressive in our
cash deployment. A key point in that evolution is that after a couple of years of effectively returning our total free cash
to our shareowners, we are on track for fiscal year 2014 to use our balance sheet and return more than our generated
free cash for the first time in our recent history. I'll cover this cash use aspect in further detail, but let me first tie the
specific financials from the quarter to our full year growth metrics on slide 15.
As you work down those metrics on the financial statements, you'll see that we're on track on each and every measure,
and you will also see strong incremental progress towards each in the quarterly results. Start with our overall gross
profit outlook; within that, the biggest proof-point we set out to deliver was strong growth in our core seeds and traits
business. Now that we've gotten to the heart of our business, it's clear that the seeds and traits growth we are focused on
is being delivered. In the quarter, nearly 80% of our total gross profit increase comes from Seeds and Genomics, and if
you look at the full year view, we expect seeds and traits to continue to drive our underlying earnings growth.
If you take that down a level to Seeds and Genomics margins, you see very good progress in the quarter and the first
half toward our target of an increase of 3 margin points to 4 margin points for the full year. The biggest driver of that is
clearly the soybean business, where Q2 margins were up by more than 7 points, as we see the pronounced benefits from
our Intacta launch in Latin America, the strong soybean opportunity in our U.S. business, and the first increments of the
DuPont soybean royalty. We'd expect these to [indiscernible] (24:32) with the seasonal business flow in Q3 before
providing a significant lift again in Q4, keeping us on target for our full year expectation for a margin increase of 6
points to 8 points across our soybean business.
The progress on corn margins is equally strong. In the second quarter, we've see margin improve by about 2.5 points.
This improvement largely reflects our mix lift and the start of the expected cost benefits. Going into the second half, we
would anticipate an additional margin benefit from our cost of goods as we expect the cost improvements to be even
more prominent in Q3, and to carry into Q4, as we stay on track for our full year target of a 3-point margin lift.

From an operating expense perspective, we're running at a relatively higher year-over-year rate that reflects both the
dilution effect of The Climate Corp. acquisition and the additional investments we are making to support our record
number of product launches along with our new growth platforms. So while operating expenses will grow at a higher
rate this year, these are disciplined increases, and we continue to expect to see operating expense leverage from gross
profit for the full year. Taking all of those in consideration, we have already delivered a double-digit increase in
ongoing EBITDA for this quarter, and we expect to reach our mid-to-high teens EBITDA by the end of Q4.
Translating those metrics to our outlook for the rest of the year on slide 16, what you see is that we expect continued
strength in our second half, punctuated by a strong conclusion in Q4. That second half strength is mostly driven by
three core structural factors. None are now particularly variable, and we have a good read on the specific timing of
each. Number one; we'll book the second installment of the DuPont soybean royalty in Q4. In combination with some
of the incremental sales for the Latin America Intacta season, that's a big driver of the significant growth we'd forecast
for soybeans in our last quarter.
Number two; last year, the combination of the anticipation of a jump in corn acres and the subsequent late-season
effects on the [ph] weather (26:51) on U.S. plantings caused an abnormal amount of returns that were reflecting in our
corn numbers. Practically, that increased our Q3 corn performance last year, but created a significant negative in Q4.
As this unusual pattern normalizes, you'd logically expect the resulting shift this year could have the inverse effect;
reducing the Q3 comparator, while the absence of that drag creates a significant uptick in Q4 corn.
And number three; last year, we took an inventory write-off related to our vegetable business that was focused in our
fourth quarter. With a less pronounced effect this year, we'd expect a more typical contribution from vegetables in one
of its biggest seasonal quarters. If you bring those factors together, we expect Q4 to be a significantly smaller loss than
it was last year, near breakeven, or at a small loss. And as many of you remember, for the past couple of years, our Q4
has been a loss of more than $0.40. So these three factors aggregate to a significant benefit.
With a shift into Q4 I just described and some unique factors affecting the comparison, we'd expect Q3 to be lower than
last year. The biggest factor comes with a significant tax benefit that increased our Q3 last year and doesn't repeat this
year. That is combined with the Q3 effect of the corn comparison to last year that I just described, and with the
expected continuation of the trend on operating expenses that we have seen in the first half of fiscal 2014. In addition,
the practical reality is that we don't expect any incremental growth from our Ag productivity, following last year's
significant step-up in the quarter.
So as a result, the combination of the significantly stronger Q4 and the factors in Q3 translate to a strong second half
that punctuates many of the positive trends on factors like margin and growth drivers we've seen begin in Q2. From
there, I want to focus on our cash priorities on slide 17. During the second quarter, we officially entered the
Novozymes alliance. So in the first half of the year, we invested approximately $1.3 billion into our business growth,
primarily through Climate Corporation and Novozymes. Our $290 million first-half free cash flow reflects that
investment, and keeps us on track for our full-year free cash guidance of $600 million to $800 million, including
acquisitions.
Whether it's M&A, collaboration agreements in new platforms, or CapEx investments into our core business, direct
investment in growth opportunities is one of our priorities, and where we can use our cash to unlock further growth. At
the same time, we're combining this direct investment in the business with a more aggressive approach in returning
value to our owners. As I mentioned, we're on track this year for the first time in our recent history to return to our
owners significantly more than the free cash we generate in the form of dividends and share buybacks.
Coming off a record for buyback spending in Q1, we've continued to build on that with an additional $200 million in
buybacks in Q2, even with a $300 million outlay in the quarter for the Novozymes deal. In the last four quarters, we've
used more than $1.5 billion for share buybacks, moving us from an annual repurchase of less than 1% of our market
cap to nearly 3% in that short time. As we look at our cash deployment strategy, we're focused on the continued
aggressive program that reduces our share count with continued emphasis on dividend and looking to identify high
return means to invest in our business.

So let me emphasize again our confidence in our earnings growth this year. Our strong underlying business continues
to deliver the growth we expected. And even in the face of the variability in acres, commodity prices, and currency, we
today confirm our full-year guidance with confidence. That puts us in a good position for long-term growth, with strong
cash generation capability that in turn allows us to continue that growth while being aggressive in delivering value to
our owners.
Thanks. And I'll turn the time back to Bryan for the Q&A.

Operator
Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first
question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you. And good morning, everyone. I just wanted to see if we could drill a little bit
more into the third quarter guidance. I just did – the way I've been looking at it is last year, you had revenue pulled out
of 3Q into 2Q. You had sort of a cost step-up as your seed production costs seemed higher as you moved through the
year. So I would've thought that would've been a big tailwind in the quarter. I calculate the tax is $0.12. So it just seems
like you're calling for the SG&A and R&D expense to be up substantially in the quarter. Is that right? Is that exactly
what's going to happen?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, Vincent. Thanks for the question. I think the way I'd encourage you to look at it is more or
less the story of our really strong second half, but the third does look a bit softer and the fourth looks really strong. But
Pierre, maybe you can just do a little bit of dissection on how the comp looks versus last year?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Yeah. And – so there are a lot of variables playing when you do a year-to-year
comparison, I mean, especially when you look at corn. And as Hugh mentioned, I mean, I would focus on a
[indiscernible] (33:17) strong second half, and with very strong seeds and traits growth. If you get specifically to Q3, I
mean you pointed it out; I mean the tax, the $0.15 tax benefit we enjoyed in fiscal year would be the biggest driver of
the comp. And then, what we mentioned in our prepared remarks as well, the corn impact of the late planting, I mean
the conditions that didn't allow planting at the end of Q3 last year and impacted us fairly significantly in Q4 is also a
fairly significant driver that maybe Vincent, you didn't point out. And on top of that, as you just mentioned, I mean
obviously, the increase in OpEx is going to play a role there.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: I see. So you expect corn and soy, seeds and traits' gross profit to increase in Q3, or to be flat
or down?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So we'll see exactly how it plays out. But I would expect a flattish type of number.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: [indiscernible] (34:13)

Our next question is from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Thanks. Hugh, this is one of the few times you've actually reported the quarter after the
planting intention surveys come out, and I know obviously weather and price movements will drive planting, but just
wondering how you see the overall outlook, because while corn's down and you cite that as a reason for some of your
caution in Q3, got a big increase in soy in the U.S., increase in cotton. So how do you see the overall demand outlook
playing out in the U.S. planting season versus last year?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah. I mean – so the – I think the number that was published yesterday was 91 million acres, and
for the quarter it was 92 million acres. That would – I think that would be in line with our expectations, Don. It is
interesting you look a year ago and the question was why can't it be 100 million acres? So I think 92 million acres this
year is – I think is within the boundaries of realism. Yesterday, corn finished the day north of $5, so a $5 environment
and 92 million-ish acres of corn, I think, is – I think an reasonable planning assumptions going into the year. Beans
looks strong, and we've seen great performance in our bean franchise, not just in North America, but as Brett
mentioned, in Brazil as well. But I think in terms of your question, I think this is within the expected norms.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Let me rephrase the question then. With overall acreage of your three core crops up 2 million
acres year-over-year, presumably some market share gains with your strong performance in corn and soy last year;
would you expect your domestic volumes to be up this planting season versus last year?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Don, this is Brett. If you look at the – excuse me, the total acreage in our core crops; corn,
kind of where we expected; soybean's maybe a touch higher than what we were anticipating...
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Right.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: And the cotton acres, pretty close to what we've been anticipating for the cotton acres. So
there's still room for that to happen across the mix of all those crops, but recognize that while we're extremely
well-positioned in all three crops and the trade-offs don't bother us near as much as they do others that participate in
this space, the value creation per acre is slightly different across those three different crops.
So I feel really good about our second quarter playing out really strong, regardless of how those acres end up getting
planted across the crops. But it's the extra acres that we're seeing are coming, if they come, are going to come from the
soybeans as it's projected today, which would be the lower value of those three crops. But I feel like we're in a really
good position going into second half. Keep in mind that when you look at our corn business, we're looking at it
globally, and the clear global corn acres are down for the first half, and anticipated also in the second half. So I think
the mix, we're still in a good place.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Don, just to your rephrased question, I think on volume, it's early days, but based on our
performance in our order books, we would anticipate volume will be up.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks.

Our next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect. Thank you. You flagged $0.15 to $0.20 of agricultural headwinds
concerning some FX in the lower corn acreage. Can you parse out some of this for us a little bit further and just flag the
largest headwinds, potentially on your FX assumptions for the concerned geographies? And then also what your

expectations will be for these currencies for the balance of the year, or what's inherently embedded in your guidance?
Thank you.
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So definitely, those headwinds are embedded in the guidance. I mean that's one of the
points we wanted to make. And when you're looking at the $0.15 to $0.20 we've been quoting, this is for the full year.
So just to make things clear there, most of that is related to headwinds – to currency, sorry. And as far as currency, the
biggest factors there will be South America. I mean – and we've seen that in the first half of the year. South America, I
mean, especially Argentina, but also Brazil have been the key points in the currency headwinds we've been looking at.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Can you give any color on specifically what you're looking at for both Brazil and
Argentina? And also are you embedding anything for Eastern Europe as well or...?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So Brazil and Argentina, as I said, are the major drivers. And out of the two, Argentina
will be the largest one. I mean the currency depreciated by almost 25% during Q2, so that's been a major event. So
Brazil and Argentina will be the biggest drivers, but we've also some headwinds around the world, because actually
what we've seen in the second quarter, as you know is that the dollar has been actually really strong against emerging
market currencies, and some emerging market currencies also in Eastern Europe have been affected. This is how we
come to that $0.15 to $0.20 downside for the year versus our original thinking.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Morning.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Just wondering if I could ask Hugh about the U.S. corn market and how the mix of your
products has shifted. And specifically, I'm curious on what kind of penetration or percentage rates you're getting in
SmartStax and then across your products in a Refuge-in-a-Bag format?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Bob, thanks for the question. We continue to see – based on the order books, we continue to see
really nice growth on SmartStax and the RIB products. So they've really become flagship products. And as you look at
some of the talk across resistance and you see growers reaching more and more for that SmartStax product, and it's
from the early days, we've really built out the varieties there so we got our best germplasm and best varieties
represented in SmartStax.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: And if I might ask, you provided a nice historic trend on Roundup Ready 2 and the launch
year and a few years out. Is there any reason we shouldn't expect you could quadruple or better your Intacta year two
sales? I know you'd spoke to many more varieties being available.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah. We've never quantified it in that way, but we – I will say, Bob, is that the ramp on Intacta
will be faster than any of our previous ramps in soybeans. And that's for two or three reasons; one, really big growers in
Brazil; two, pent-up demand; and three, the extraordinary performance versus insects. So I think it's going to go really
fast. But there's every chance we'll sell the seed again in the next year.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Michael L. Piken>: Yeah. Good morning. I just wanted to delve a little bit deeper into your Precision Ag
platform. And I know it's not really going to be a near-term growth driver, but if you could give us some sort of a color
in terms of how you plan to grow that business and any maybe sort of updates in terms of how you're thinking about
pricing it, specifically if you bundle, let's say, some of the FieldScripts products with some of the Climate Pro
products? Thanks.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah. I'll – maybe I'll ask Brett to say a little bit about price and then – but I'd think about this
going forward as this is an integrated platform that brings a range of trade partners together and brings a range of
technologies and applications together. This year, we've really focused on good grower experiences. This is a little bit
like a Ground Breaker year for us. And Brett said that we're on 20 million plus acres with Climate Basic, and we're on
hundreds of thousands of acres with Climate Pro, which is the [indiscernible] (42:34) version of this technology. But
Brett, maybe – so we're really pleased with this starting year. I think it's gone really well. But maybe a little bit of what
Brett, and how you see it playing out?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, thanks. So I'd look at it as the 20 million plus acres of Climate Basic as a really
strong indicator that farmers are really, really interested in this space and looking for someone to help them improve
decision-making with better science. Granted it's – there's no charge for Climate Basic, but to get on the system, you
have to go online and enter your information to be a part of that. So interest is high.
Second piece of that is as we stated that the early days of the purchase of Climate; we're seeing the power of being able
to bring together their competencies around weather and hyper-Doppler radar et cetera, with the power we have of our
own genomics engines and breeding systems here to create better recommendations going into the marketplace. And I
think that's what you start to see to come together in the FieldScripts products that we put into the marketplace that are
paid acres, and then as well, the Climate Pro acres that are also paid acres.
And there is a synergistic effect. I mean if I was to suggest to a grower, the optimum process, it's to be utilizing the
FieldScript engine to make a choice on genetics, based on field history, et cetera, as well as Climate Pro to help the
farmer make the very best decisions on how to grow that crop throughout the year. So they definitely play off of each
other, and that's why we talk about them as a family of products. And for the farmer that wants to optimize as far as he
can go, it's using that suite of products all the way across the portfolio.
That being said, each one of the individual products will be able to be bought separately. They won't have to be
integrated. So the farmer will have significant choice. But as we see it, there'll be – there'll always be the basic products
out there just to help the farmer collect information and knowledge. But then the paid acres is where we'll be focused.
And this year, we'll have a really good test in the field with the Climate Pro, as well as the IFS acres to take a look at.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: Rob, I think we can go on to the next question.

Yes. The next question is from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On Intacta, I was wondering if you
could comment on whether you plan to renew or re-up the rebate or the discounts that you offered this past season. And
then secondarily, on Intacta, any potential risk or issue to getting farmers in Brazil to pay for the technology?
<A - Hugh Grant>: So thanks for the two questions. I'll let Brett talk about rebates and discount. But I – my
experience this year, the grower feedback has been phenomenal. Yields have been very, very strong from what we've –
we're about halfway through capturing yield data. The first half looks really strong, and I think, given our performance
and grower feedback, I'm optimistic in our ability to capture that premium performance. And growers so far have been
very encouraging, and have stepped up in terms of paying for that premium stuff. I don't have any worries there. Then
the other piece, Brett, on discounting?

<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. On the discounting, let's – to be really clear on that, the discounting was associated
with giving up on the Roundup Ready 1 lawsuits, et cetera. So farmers that haven't done that yet will still have the
opportunity to sign up for that and receive that discount on Intacta to make that happen. And we'll continue that next
year. But that's where the discounting was and – but on the getting paid, nothing better than having a great product
performance year to show the farmer the value is really there, and it changes that conversation quickly.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Yeah. Okay. And if I could ask one quick question on IFS, You've offered some money-back
guarantee offerings to spur adoption. I was wondering if you could just comment on the success of those types of
offerings, and how have they contributed to the receptivity?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. The money-back guarantee is on Climate Pro, so the farmer can buy Climate Pro
this year with a money-back guarantee in the fall. And it's exactly what you said. We want to encourage as many
farmers as possible to sign up for Climate Pro and try the tools. This is something really different. It's really new. And
the best way to show a farmer the value is have them use the product, not unlike some of our early trait products that
were new and different; same kind of thing.

Your next question is from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Hugh, just on U.S. market share, looks like in corn, given lower acres and your
forecast for higher volumes you can grow share maybe by 1%. But in soybeans, given the higher acreage, can you still
grow share in soybeans you think this year?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah. So we – I'd – call me traditional, but I'd kind of like to get the crop planted before we start
talking about share. So we're feeling good with the product performance both in our corn business, and in beans. And
as Brett made the point earlier, the bean story is North Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, and I think there's
opportunities for share growth in both. But before getting too granular, I'd like to get the spring done and get some crop
in the ground.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: I guess remind us of trade-off between corn and bean acres. It used to be about $0.02 or
$0.03 for every million acres [ph] shared (48:33). Is that still the good rule of thumb?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, it's a good rule of thumb. That's – that would be about right.

Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes. Hi. Good morning. In Seed and Genomics, your gross margins were up 230 basis points,
roughly. How much of the benefit came from lower seed costs, which I know was going to be a benefit in 2014? And
that we know that DuPont royalties was also a benefit. But can you specifically talk about low seed costs?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So the low seed cost, P.J., mostly impacts our corn business. And at this point in time, I
mean would be a slightly lower than the 2 points we are shooting for, for the full season. We'll see the second part of
that benefit from COGS in Q3 and Q4 as we mentioned. So we are still shooting for the 3 points total, of which 2 points
coming from COGS when you're looking at the corn business.

<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you. And Brett, did you say that you expect glyphosate gross profit to be flat in 2014
versus 2013? I think that was your previous prediction? Are you sticking to that?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. I think, P.J., what we've been saying is we expected glyphosate gross profit to be
steady to stronger. And today, I pointed to the stronger end of that. And that's kind of how we see it finishing for the
year.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Can you sort of care to quantify that? Thank you.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Quantify what? Stronger?
<A - Bryan Hurley>: If you – this is Bryan Hurley. If you kind of look at quantifying that from a relative perspective,
you obviously saw a big step-up in glyphosate last year in the Ag Productivity segment last year. You'd expect some
degree of step-up, but nothing on the magnitude of what you saw last year.

Yes. The next question is from the line of Mark Gulley with BGC Financial. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Morning.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: I wanted to ask you guys to elaborate a little bit on insect pressure in South America. Of
course, you alluded to the soy insect pressure, but then you talked a little about corn. Can you elaborate on how that
might affect adoption of insect traits in both Argentina and Brazil?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. I think what you see in South America's, already to this point in corn insect traits
have been adopted at a very fast rate, and you see that with the transition we're going through now to Triple PRO in
Argentina, and to the second-generation in Brazil. You have a longer growing season. You have more above-ground
pests, so you have a lot more insect pressure across South America than we experienced in North America. And that
drives the desire from the farmer standpoint to have more insect control in the field for the longer season.
<A - Hugh Grant>: And I think this year, or certainly in beans, it was particularly high.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: It was high in beans this year, and a new pest showing up in Brazil; that's another
caterpillar pest that's – that hasn't been that prevalent before, and it's showing up a lot stronger.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yep.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: And secondly, as my follow-up, a financial question. Congratulations on the 2% share count
shrinkage on the diluted line year-over-year in the second quarter. Can you give us an idea or update us perhaps on
your share repurchase goals in the second half of this year, and perhaps even looking ahead to this next year?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So we've not been specific about the magnitude and the details of our plans but what we
said is that this year we would be returning more to our shareowners than our free cash, and we indicated when we
made The Climate Corporate acquisition that I mean we were taking the opportunity of borrowing about $1 billion to
finance this acquisition to free up some money available for share buybacks. So we are very active, I think. We've been
very active over the last couple of quarters, I mean – and as you mentioned, we've been able to reduce our share count,
and that's a goal. I mean we'll try to be very thoughtful about how we do that, but that's definitely a goal of ours.

Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Morning.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: A quarter ago, you were conservative about glyphosate prices. You thought that Chinese
prices had come down, and maybe that would affect the North American market. Has that proven to be the case? That
is, has your glyphosate prices changed at all sequentially? And do you expect it to change at all for this fiscal year?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, I'll ask Brett to say a few words to that. I think, Jeff, the way I'd characterize is it's within
the bounds of what we forecasted and anticipated this year. And I think if you got – if you [inaudible] (53:43) the
glyphosate piece, then you run the risk of losing sight of the seeds and traits growth. And the thing I'm particularly
pleased on this year – first half behind us, looking at the second half is we demonstrate margin lift and we demonstrate
nice growth in our seeds and traits, but Brett, maybe a word on how the season's shaping out, and the visibility around
that?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. If you go back to last quarter, Chinese prices were fluctuating downward, and that's
why we pointed a little bit to the caution. I mentioned that we really don't focus on Chinese prices. We focus on generic
prices in the marketplace, which never did materialize at a lower level, based on the Chinese price. They held. We held.
Therefore, as I look at it today, you can see four months, five months out in advance of where we are; I expect flattish
prices for the rest of the year, which, to Hugh's point, is right in the range of what we were expecting. And that's what
puts us to the stronger end of flat to stronger GP from glyphosate.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Yup. Have you sold about 60% of all of the glyphosate you intend to sell this year in the
first two quarters?
<A - Bryan Hurley>: We don't break out the specific volume by quarter but the...
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: How about by half?
<A - Bryan Hurley>: No. We'd...

headed to zero and they're not willing to pay anything in the U.S. for corn and seed. On the other hand, you mentioned
that corn futures have hit $5. So I'm wondering, how do you think farmers are actually looking at the outlook here? Are
they really is bearish as people make them out to be?

to predicate that with caution. But I think there's still a tremendous opportunity out there. I think farmers are being
more careful and rightfully so. They're taking a little bit longer this year. The season is probably going to run a little bit
late. Our attitude here is we're trying to look through any given season, take the longer view. We've been careful in our
pricing. We've rebuilt our reputation with our grower community.
And I think, as we mentioned this morning, we feel good about the season at hand and we're getting good
encouragement from our grower customers. So maybe, I'm the optimistic Scotsman, but I think there's more
opportunity there and I think we're seeing the reward in the order book and how farmers are looking. But I think, as we
mentioned at the start, acres are at a little bit softer. $5 corn is still pretty good, but it's something to watch. So Mark, I
would say we're cautiously optimistic.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: And what about Brazil then? Certainly, the real is not helping. And as I look at your slide
13, I wonder whether weaker yields in Brazil are making this four bushel an acre as good a test as you would have
wanted. Is next year going to be a better comparison for Intacta if the weather is more normal?
<A - Hugh Grant>: No, I think this was a great test this year. So, A, it was across a wide usership. B, we had intense
insect pressure. And C, bean prices are pretty strong. So I would say that this was a really, really great test for the
technology this year.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Super. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. Two-part question on Intacta, first, would you expect to launch in
Argentina and other South American countries outside of Brazil next year? And then second part, I believe you have
second-generation insect protected beans in Phase 4. What are the chances that could come to market next year? Or
might it require more patience?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yes. So, Brett, launch next year in Argentina?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, so we have as we've mentioned before, there's a few trial acres in the northern part
of Argentina this year. And we've said that they're about a year behind Brazil. So we would intend to be commercial in
parts of Argentina next year. There'll also be some varieties that we'll be marketing in Paraguay and Uruguay. So next
year really puts us fully into the South American market. As we look at the second generation of Intacta, it's not quite
that close to the marketplace. We'd be looking to the latter end of the decade before we would have the second
generation out there. We're super excited about it. It's fantastic that we already got it in the portfolio as we're launching
the first product. But it'll be towards the latter part of the decade.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: And as a brief follow up on Ukraine, Brett, I think you mentioned some degree of
disruption there, it didn't sound terribly significant. But in your scenario analysis and planning, can you speak to direct
effects and possibly indirect benefits if tensions were to intensify in that country?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, it's difficult to speculate on what could happen over there because it can change
overnight. But I would tell you that there's – the two breakouts I'd make for you is, there's the larger farming operations
that are over there that are well capitalized and feel good about their business. Then you have the smaller farmers in the
country that rely more on credit from retailers, et cetera. The smaller ones are impacted more than the large ones. If the
disruption was to intensify, I would expect the disruption to intensify more for the smaller ones than the large one,
which gives us the cautious optimism that we can work our way through this for the year. I'd never suggest there's no
impact, it's just a manageable impact as we go through the year.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Fair enough. Thanks a lot.

Our next question is from the line of Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey. On your soybean business, obviously, you had record profits year-over-year, up $140
million plus on the gross profit line and I think you attributed it to three major categories, Intacta launch, the royalties
and general gains in the U.S. How would you apportion roughly that year-over-year increase among those three major
buckets?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So we've not quantified it in detail. I mean, we've given some indication. I think the key
points are – I mean, we were on track with what we said we would be doing. So Intacta we've been able to launch on
the 3 million acres we've been talking about. The DuPont royalty, I think you can get pretty easily to the number there.
And maybe the part that most people have been missing is actually the really, the very strong performance of our U.S.
business, our Roundup Ready 2 Yield business in the U.S., which would be very consistent actually with some of the
acreage shifts we have been talking about. So it wouldn't be exactly a third, a third, a third, but the three are significant
impacts into the performance of our soybeans business. And what you can see is definitely plays out a big role in the
GP but also the margin expansion.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: [indiscernible] (01:02:03)
<A - Hugh Grant>: And Frank, if you look out the next two years or three years, we're just on the very front-end of
very significant, very fast growth in Intacta. So you're right, it's a three-legged stool this year, but as you go out over
the next 24 months to 36 months, Intacta becomes a major driver in the soybean franchise.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right. Terrific. And then you'd anticipate with the gains in the RR2Y in the U.S. that Q3 is
shaping up nicely there as well in soybeans?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So once again, I mean, it will all depend on the planning and the shift in the final acres.
But I mean, we think we are extremely well positioned in terms of sellout regarding our soybeans business, absolutely.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah. You'll see really that the second big increment of all of those factors that you
mentioned show in the fourth quarter for soybean, you'll have that second DuPont royalty and you'll actually start
seeing Intacta sales for the next season showing up in the fourth quarter as well.
With that we probably recognized that we're running just a bit long on time. Why don't we take two more questions and
then Mr. Grant will wrap things up.

And our next question is from the line of John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Can you hear me?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, we can hear you, John.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Hugh, of the 9 billion in additional corn required over the next cycle here, how much would
you say is going to be international, how much would be U.S.? And would you hazard a guess of the split for
Monsanto?
<A - Hugh Grant>: I'm sorry, I missed the start of your question, John. The 9...
<Q - John E. Roberts>: 9 billion bushels of additional corn demand?

<A - Hugh Grant>: I'm sorry. I got you. The split, it's nearer about 6 billion. I'm looking around the table here.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: In slide 6 with the 9 billion bushels of growth in demand for corn.
<A - Hugh Grant>: I think we would say it's somewhere between 6 billion to 9 billion. Is that right?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: And then how much would be, would you guess is going to be North American yield growth?
And how much would be international growth both yield and acres, I guess.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I think, the way you look at it is the vast majority of the growth coming out of North
America to meet that 9 billion bushel demand is going to have to be intensification on the acres that are already there.
You know, as we have the acre discussion every year, is it 95 acres, is it 91 acres? Who knows? It's mostly
intensification. We have the opportunity to expand a little bit more in Eastern Europe and possibly Brazil with acres,
but the vast majority, as we look at the next 10 years, is going to have to come from intensification because we're also
getting demand pressure on soybeans and other crops, so we can't keep trading off the acres and still meet it.
And a lot of what's happened in the previous 10 years is weed acres becoming corn acres because the farmer can be
more profitable and you run out of that at some point. There's still some in Canada. There's still some in Northern
Eastern Europe, but we're running out of those. So we're going to have to see the intensification – sustainable
intensification on the acres that we're already growing corn. So most of it will come around the world. Every acre is
going to have to contribute.
<A - Hugh Grant>: So, John, the consensus here is 30% to 40% of that growth comes from North America.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Okay.
<A - Hugh Grant>: But to Brett's point, the last 10 years we've seen a huge piece of that growth come from brand new
acres. The next 10 years our guess is the lion's share of this comes through intensification. And that was my point on
sustainable intensification is how you make those acres work harder.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: And 60% to 70% would come from x-U.S.?
<A - Hugh Grant>: That's correct.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Would be it a higher increment for Monsanto?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Well, the yields, they've got further to go because the yields drag behind the U.S. today so there's
a greater opportunity in total production there because if you look at Brazil, India, Eastern Europe today those acres are
less productive than North American acres.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Okay. I'll take it off-line. Thank you.

Our next question is from Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Tim J. Tiberio>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my time. I guess just following up to the last question. We've
seen some reports out of India that indicates they may be softening their stance towards GMO Seeds for food crops.
Are you becoming more confident in that market than when we were over the last two years? Or do you think it's still,
you know, too premature to really start thinking about this as part of the component of the incremental volumes or yield
gains that people need to see?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, I think it's maybe a little premature. I mean, they made an early move and a very significant
move in cotton, but they haven't done a lot since then. There's a real opportunity there and if you look at India and
protein consumption in India, rice acres are decreasing and water is becoming scarce and corn, particularly corn growth

for poultry feed has increased significantly. So, I think, there's a real opportunity there going forward, but I think
probably premature I guess on it today.
<Q - Tim J. Tiberio>: Okay. So you don't put a lot of weight that the BJP, if they get into power may soften that
stance? It seem like some of the recent court rulings at least green lighting some of the [indiscernible] (01:08:09).
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah. Some of the signs are encouraging, but I would – you know, it's a dangerous game when
you start trying a second guess regularly about this. So I think there's a need – there's a lot of grower experience and
there's a real opportunity. But the encouraging piece is the continued rise in protein demand and it kind of ties to John
Roberts' question, this is going to come through intensification and producing bushels on an acre but when that occurs,
I wouldn't like to speculate.
Hugh Grant
I'm very conscious of your time, so I'll maybe transition. Thank you for your patience. Apologize for the 10 minutes
we're over. And I'd just wrap up the call this morning by thanking you for joining us. At this juncture, Q2, as I
mentioned at the beginning, we still have the North American and European seasons, west and east to play out.
There's a couple of critical proof points that I think are punctuated by our performance that we discussed this morning.
I'm very encouraged because we've been able to demonstrate solid growth in our seeds and traits against the backdrop
of a tougher Ag environment than we've seen probably over the past few years.
With that, we're on track to deliver the growth that we anticipated for the full year even given a more variable external
atmosphere. And with what we accomplished in 2014, I think we set up an important runway that allows us to grow
now while we simultaneously position ourselves for an important longer-term environment as well. So nice growth in
our core and in our new platforms.
So we're focused on delivering that opportunity and we look forward to continuing to share that with you and update
you on our progress. Thanks again for joining us this morning.
