Lamberto Andreotti
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. This is an important time for Bristol-Myers Squibb. The third quarter
marked our return to growth with respect to both sales and earnings, as we made our way through the Plavix loss of
exclusivity. And that, combined with our continued pipeline progress, positions us well for the future. Let me elaborate
on these points.
With respect to sales, not only was our growth strong, up 9%, but also it was diversified, cutting across our portfolio.
We drove double-digit growth in Yervoy, Orencia, Sprycel, and Onglyza, and the contribution to the top-line results
from Eliquis and Bydureon started to become meaningful. This is important. It demonstrates the breadth and quality of
our diversified portfolio.
Yervoy remains the cornerstone of our growth immuno-oncology platform. I'm excited – in fact, I'm very excited – by
the data presented at the European Cancer Congress in September, as it confirmed long-term survival with Yervoy in
metastatic melanoma and reinforced the overall value of this product. This quarter, Yervoy continued to deliver growth,
most notably in Europe in our international markets.
Yervoy results in the U.S. were also positive, notwithstanding the impact of a significant number of new clinical trials
targeting melanoma patients with other agents. In Europe, the CHMP recently recommended in that Yervoy be
approved as first-line therapy in advanced melanoma.
With respect to Eliquis, I'm encouraged. We are still very far from the sales level this product can achieve, but we are
seeing definite signs of progress, especially with cardiologists, a target audience for us. We continued to execute
against our strategy to clearly define the dedifferentiated and unique profile of Eliquis.
In all countries, we have increased our peer-to-peer medical education activities, and in the U.S., you may have seen
that we began our DTC advertising campaign in September for Eliquis in atrial fibrillation. We're also working to
expand our label, as we have filed an sNDA for VTE prevention in the U.S., which is already an approved indication in
Europe, and we plan to file our application in VTE treatment this year.
With respect to our diabetes portfolio, we continue to find our way through this very competitive space. In the third
quarter, Onglyza sales grew 19% year-over-year, and within our exenatide franchise, Bydureon sales showed
encouraging gains. And with dapagliflozin, we are looking forward to the FDA Advisory Committee meeting in
December and the PDUFA date in January.
Now, let me make a couple of comments about our pipeline. With respect to hepatitis C, we believe that we have an
interesting opportunity, and we are looking forward to the AASLD conference next month, when we will present new
data on the Phase III trial of our all all-oral dual regimen, and we are still on track for its important submission in Japan
this year.
And with respect to immuno-oncology, 2013 has been a year of exciting data for our immuno-oncology platform. Data
we have presented so far this year spoke to the various possibilities of paradigm-changing treatments for a range of
cancers, and next week, we will present additional immuno-oncology data at the World Conference on Lung Cancer.
Now, because there is much happening related to our work in immuno-oncology, I'd ask Francis to spend a few minutes
this morning to walk you through our thinking with respect to this increasingly important area for us. Francis?

Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. As you well know, we've been focused on expanding our efforts in
immuno-oncology as an area where we see a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with certain cancers.
We believe that immuno-oncology has the potential to be transformational in the treatment of patients suffering from
various types of cancer.
The durability of response and long-term survival in some patients are quite unlike anything we've seen in the past, and
is demonstrated by the long-term survival data for Yervoy recently presented at the European Cancer Congress.
Additionally, early data suggest that the immunotherapeutic approach has the potential to provide a benefit not only in
tumors traditionally considered immunogenic, but also in other tumor types that have not typically been thought to be
immune-mediated.
As the field continues to evolve and expand, we believe that there may be roles for monotherapy, combination therapy,
and biomarker-directed therapy, and we are therefore building our development programs to prepare for all
possibilities. Certainly, the approaches are likely to vary by tumor type as well as by line of therapy. Through our
experience with Yervoy and broad programs with nivolumab, we have a unique understanding in the field, which gives
us confidence that we are well-positioned to find the optimal way to utilize these innovative therapies.
As you know, we've made a very large commitment to immuno-oncology. Currently, for nivolumab alone, we have
over 25 ongoing clinical trials across more than eight tumor types. We continue to explore Yervoy monotherapy in
additional tumor types such as prostate and lung, as well as in combination with nivolumab. In addition, we have a
broad portfolio of exploratory immunotherapeutic agents with varying immune mechanisms of action that allows us to
explore multiple combinations.
Today I'd like to provide a brief update on the status of our major programs. Let me start with lung cancer. As a
follow-up to the data we presented at ASCO in June, we will be presenting updated two-year survival data from the
lung cohort of prior-treated patients in the nivolumab monotherapy study known as 003 at the World Conference on
Lung Cancer at the end of October.
Next up will be data from the Phase I combination study of nivolumab with Yervoy in non-small cell lung cancer,
which we expect to have in-house by the end of the year. Data from this study will provide important information on
the feasibility of combinations in this tumor type and potentially inform our plans for a Phase III trial starting in the
first half of 2014.
Following that, we expect to have data in the first part of 2014 from our Phase II study in third-line squamous
non-small cell lung cancer. If the results of the study demonstrate a favorable benefit/risk profile, we plan to discuss the
data with the FDA and other health authorities. Finally, we have two ongoing Phase III trials in second-line non-small
cell lung cancer, one in squamous and one in non-squamous, with both studies collecting information on PD-L1 tumor
expression. We expect to have data from these studies later in 2014.
In melanoma, we have a broad program ongoing with trials covering all lines of therapy, which includes monotherapy
as well as combination of nivolumab and Yervoy. In previously untreated patients, both monotherapy and combination
Phase III trials are underway, and a nivolumab monotherapy Phase III trial is ongoing in advanced patients who have
progressed post-Yervoy.
In renal cell cancer, our most advanced trial is focused on metastatic disease, comparing nivolumab with everolimus.
Early trials are exploring the combination of nivolumab and Yervoy in first-line renal cell cancer, and we expect the
data in-house by the end of this year. And also we expect early data on the potential role of biomarkers in this tumor
type. In all these three tumor types, we remain committed to establishing the benefit/risk profile of nivolumab as
quickly as possible and are closely collaborating with health authorities.
Now, regarding public data presentations, after the lung data at the World Conference on Lung Cancer, we expect the
next set of presentations to be at ASCO in 2014, which may include data on the Phase I combination study in non-small
cell lung cancer and potentially data from the third-line squamous non-small cell lung cancer which is ongoing.

In addition to the programs for nivolumab that I highlighted earlier, we're also exploring its use in additional solid
tumor types, including pancreatic, gastric, small cell lung cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer, as well as
hematological malignancies.
So, in closing, I think you can see that we have a significant commitment to advancing the field of immuno-oncology
through a broad program that is science-driven, diversified, and well-resourced. We believe that this commitment,
together with our expertise and experience, puts us in an excellent position in this tremendously exciting area.
So now, I'd like to turn it back to you, Lamberto.
Lamberto Andreotti
Thanks, Francis. Well, clearly we see immuno-oncology as an important and exciting opportunity for us, one in which
we will continue investing heavily, dedicating even more resources, time, people, and money, not only in R&D but also
commercially as we prepare for potential launches. We are also committing the right commercial resources to our key
growth drivers, most notably Eliquis, diabetes, and hepatitis C. These products and these therapeutic areas are our
future, and my management team and I are determined to set the stage for long-term sustainable growth, while at the
same time driving short-term performance.
Now, with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie to talk through some of our key numbers. Charlie?
Charles A. Bancroft
Thank you, Lamberto. Net sales were $4.1 billion in the quarter. We also had solid sales performance across our entire
portfolio, especially for Yervoy, Sprycel, Orencia, and Bydureon. Let me provide a few highlights.
Yervoy sales increased 33% year-over-year to $238 million. Yervoy continued to show strong performance in Europe.
We recently received a positive opinion from the CHMP for first-line use of Yervoy and hope to have marketing
authorization later this year. This is an important addition to our label in Europe and will allow a broader set of patients
to potentially benefit earlier in their treatment.
In the U.S., Yervoy sales softened somewhat from the second quarter. As Lamberto mentioned, we have seen an impact
from a significant increase in new clinical trials targeting melanoma. Patient enrollment in metastatic melanoma trials
has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, with some of that increase coming from our own clinical trials
with nivolumab.
While these clinical trials have affected the commercial opportunity at several large academic institutions, we continue
to focus on growing Yervoy in the community setting, which represents approximately 60% of our U.S. sales. Recent
weekly sales trends are encouraging. We believe having the first-line indication in Europe, along with the survival data
presented at the European Cancer Congress, will enable us to continue to deliver strong growth.
Sales of Eliquis were $41 million during the quarter. As Lamberto mentioned, we have several initiatives focused on
helping prescribers, patients, and payers understand Eliquis' differentiated profile. Recent prescription trends are
improving, as we have seen consistent weekly growth during Q3. As an important leading indicator, our overall
new-to-brand share has improved and is now nearly 20% with cardiologists.
Our diabetes portfolio had sales of $411 million in the quarter. After a period of transition in our diabetes organization,
we are beginning to see more positive trends in this business. Sales for the exenatide franchise were $193 million, up
nearly 14% from Q2, mostly due to renewed new-to-brand growth for Bydureon and GLP-1 market expansion. Byetta
sales were essentially flat versus Q2.
Sales for the Onglyza franchise grew 19% year-over-year to $211 million. We have stabilized our market share in the
U.S., where total prescription growth is slowing. We believe the data from the SAVOR Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial
provides important clarity regarding the safety profile of Onglyza. We continue to work through the pricing and

reimbursement process for Forxiga in Europe and look forward to a potential launch in the U.S. next year.
Orencia sales increased 22% to $375 million. Sub-Q sales have nearly doubled since Q3 2012, and now represent
nearly one-third of all Orencia sales. Sprycel sales rose 20% to $316 million. First-line use of Sprycel also is growing
as we reinforce Sprycel's broad indication to treat patients in all phases of CML.
Now, let me highlight two line items from the rest of our non-GAAP P&L. Advertising and promotion spending
increased 16% to $194 million. This is driven by our increased investment behind our key commercial opportunities
such as Eliquis and our diabetes portfolio. We expect to continue these investments as well as ensure we are prepared
for the expected hepatitis C launch in Japan and potential launches for nivolumab.
As I mentioned during our second quarter call, the decrease in other income and expense is largely due to the change in
the structure of our relationship with Sanofi whereby we now record royalty income in net sales. As you have seen, we
are confirming our full-year 2013 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS ranges.
Before we turn to your questions, I want to make a few comments about capital allocation. Business development
continues to be our top priority, and we remain committed to the dividend. Regarding share repurchases, you'll recall
that overall repurchases slowed significantly in Q2, and this trend continued in the third quarter. Moving forward, we
do not anticipate future share repurchases at this time.
We are now happy to answer your questions.
John E. Elicker
Thanks, Charlie. Leslie, we can go to Q&A now, and I would just remind everybody that in addition to Lamberto,
Charlie, and Francis, we have both Giovanni and Béatrice here to handle any questions you might have. Leslie?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thank you very much, just a couple of quick questions. First off, on the trajectory of the
Eliquis franchise, can you just give us your thoughts and expectations for – should we anticipate stronger performances
internationally than in the U.S., and why has it been so difficult? Can you just give us a little bit of the lay of the land of
the competitive landscape, and perhaps what competitors may have convinced physicians of early on and how you're
going to hopefully change their mindset?
And then separately, Francis, you mentioned – you made an interesting comment with regard to how the Phase I trial in
lung may inform a potential move into Phase III in 2014 for nivolumab plus Yervoy in lung cancer. Can you help us
better understand the thresholds as we think about it? There's been a lot of circulating concern around potential toxicity
there, but obviously the prospect of improved efficacy is something important. So just wondering how Bristol would be
thinking about the threshold, or at least how we should think about your move into Phase III with this potential
combination, should that be the decision that you make in 2014. Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Okay, Seamus, this is Lamberto. I will start, and then I will ask Giovanni and Béatrice to
add comments on Eliquis. First of all, we expect growth for Eliquis in both the U.S. and international markets. And in
some of the international markets we have just launched. In the U.S. we launched earlier; in other countries we launch
earlier, so we're at a different stage of launch, but the launch continues in both the U.S. and internationally.
We were third to the market, and we found two other agents that were entrenched in the market, especially one of them.
The good news is that I'm sure that our clinical data is very significant, very differentiated. Both the ARISTOTLE and
the other OS data is good. Nobody can make the same claim. And so we are dealing with especially one agent that is

basing their trend from having launched earlier and speaking about convenience, which we don't think it's really a great
claim. So we will continue to work and we are continuing to work, and Giovanni, why don't you start with the U.S.,
saying what we are doing.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yeah. Good morning. Just to follow up on what Lamberto said, so if you think about our
focus in 2013 in the U.S. market, consistent with what we discussed at the last call, we are focused in a number of
areas. At the beginning, we had a very heavy focus on access, and we made rapid progress there. Then we, in parallel,
shifted our focus on our presence in the hospital and the process of entering the hospitals from a formulistic
perspective. And stocking is a process that requires time. We discussed that at the last call. We've made significant
progress in the third quarter in that area. At this point, we are stocked and present in over 80% of our focus hospitals.
Our use in the hospitals has been increasing, and we're quite satisfied at this point that we are at the same level of
hospital presence where Xarelto, for example, was at the same time during their launch.
As we've discussed earlier, we have a very heavy focus on medical education and peer-to-peer programs, because we
really have the broadest and the deepest data set in atrial fibrillation of all agents, and understanding that profile
requires time and the right setting for physicians. So we have actually increased very significantly our investment in
that area. We are executing a very large number of programs, and we continue to see then, when physicians have the
time to understand the data, they really understand the differentiated profile of Eliquis. We also started DTC and the
TV ads, and that will have an impact over time.
As was mentioned before, although our uptake clearly has been slower than we had expected, we actually are making
good progress in the third quarter. Our growth over the last four weeks in TRx's is 23%. Our growth in NBRx's is close
to 20%. When you look at the cardiology setting, in a quarter during which the new-to-brand prescriptions of both
Pradaxa and Xarelto were flat, we experienced very, very good growth. Our NBRx share in cardiology now is close to
19%, which compares to 12% for Pradaxa. So we are continuing to make progress in the areas of focus going forward
at the same as I just described.
<A - Béatrice J. Cazala>: So, regarding international, first let me talk briefly about Europe. We have now launched
Eliquis in about 13 countries, and we saw significant growth, more than 100%, quarter-over-quarter. We are planning
to launch in another four countries across Europe, including Italy. So this target launch also accounts for possibly the
slower uptake that you can see. We are feeling positive now about access. We are focusing our launch effort mainly on
the cardiologists, and we are allocating resources strongly at the hospital, but also differentiating versus the level of
[indiscernible] (24:20) penetration in various markets.
What makes Europe also is very different penetration of the [ph] new orals (24:25), which gives us a lot of
opportunities, because you go from countries where [ph] new orals (24:29) are only at 2% penetration and others where
it's already 25%. So we're clearly differentiating our investment there, and we'll be very competitive in all those
segments of the market in all the various markets. We're continuing doing some medical education. Let's not forget that
atrial fibrilation starts with the hospital. Most of the patients go through the hospital in Europe. They move to the
cardiologists and the general practitioners. So we are trying to accelerate the hospital discharge, and the prescriptions at
the hospital level moving to cardiologists and general practitioners.
A lot of education needs to take place, and this is happening now. We have reinforced our resources there. And as we
see now more recent market data, we see that the differentiated profile starts being perceived by the cardiologists,
which are ultimately very important for the long-term growth of the products.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Seamus. It's Francis Cuss. As we were very encouraged with the melanoma data
with the combination, and we were pleasantly surprised at the tolerability where we saw there, but as you appreciate,
lung cancer is a different indication, and we will be looking clearly at the therapeutic index. We don't have the data yet,
and I can't speculate about what we will see. But just to remind you that, of course, what we believe is one of the most
valuable aspects of immunotherapy is the durable response, and that data set will be evolving over the next 6 to 12
months, and of course our hope will be, with the combination, that we will see an enhanced durable response. Thank
you.

<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks for your questions, Seamus. Leslie, next, please?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. I appreciate it. On diabetes, I
was wondering if you could – and if you already said this, I apologize for missing it, but could you tell us what you
were able to realize in price for the DPP-4 franchise, if possible, in the quarter – in the U.S., most importantly, if
possible? Number two, I'd love to get your perspective on the increased rates of hospitalizations for heart failure we're
seeing in the SAVOR trial, whether or not you think that's going to generate any kind of regulatory scrutiny. And then,
finally, on nivo, the upcoming potentially pivotal Phase II third-line refractory squamous trial, what level of response
would you define as success in that trial? Thank you very much.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Okay. So why don't, Giovanni – well, you want to take the – Francis, the question on
SAVOR? Yeah?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Yes. Thank you, Mark. So, as you noted, one component of our secondary endpoint,
hospitalization for heart failure, did occur statistically more than the untreated group, but it is important to note, I think,
that there was no increased risk of death due to heart failure overall, and in patients who entered the trial with a history
of heart failure, there was no statistical difference between the treatment and the primary endpoint. So we've been
discussing with consultants about what this may mean, and we we've had discussions with the regulators and we'll be
making a submission of this data to see whether any change to the labeling will come. That will be happening early
next year.
I think it's important to also mention that if you take the SAVOR trial overall, there was clearly some benefit there in
terms of diabetic control. While that wasn't the point of the trial, it was very reassuring from that perspective that
patients treated with Onglyza had better control. And I think it was reassuring data around pancreatitis, even though the
numbers were small in the end, and pancreatic cancer. So, overall, we felt the SAVOR trial did really inform quite
considerably on the use of DPP-4 inhibitors, specifically Onglyza.
As far as squamous is concerned, unfortunately, like all of these things, it will depend exactly on what the data we see.
We think – and I'll repeat – it's very important to consider that this is a patient population with no other options at all at
the present time, and that it's a very important aspect of this to see what the long-term durable response rate is, not just
the overall response rate, and we think that's important. Thank you.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Mark, I think your question was more related to the U.S. in regard to price. Overall, as we
think of the Onglyza franchise, we continue to be at roughly parity with Januvia, and we did take a 5% [ph] facial
(29:47) price increase in August of this year.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Mark. Leslie, can we go to the next questions, please?
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. I just have a couple of questions. Lamberto, first to you, I guess that, given the
significant commitment to immuno-oncology and the 25 trials ongoing with nivolumab and others, I'm just wondering
if, are you signaling to investors that we should assume a change in the rate of growth in R&D, different from what
we've seen the past couple of years? And my second question relates to the Hep C program. I'm not sure who will take
this, but if you could just help us to think about the commercial opportunity in Japan from your all-oral dual regimen.
The reason why I think this is tough for us to figure out is that telaprevir was a big disappointment in Japan, even
though it produced much higher cure rates from peg/riba. Your combination obviously excludes peg/riba. So how

should we think about the commercial uptake, pricing, et cetera? And then, secondly, how long do you expect to be on
that market without competitors which, as I understand, will be on your heels? Thanks very much.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Charlie, you will handle the Hep C Japan question, and, Jami, I will speak about
expenses. Well, thank you for this question because this allows me to expand on the subject of investments that both
Charlie and I mentioned in our remarks. Let me say that we will continue to invest to support this immuno-oncology
portfolio, and we will continue to invest behind Eliquis, Hep C, and diabetes. And they – all this – will get the
resources they deserve. And this will increase our expenses, mostly the commercial expenses, because within R&D, we
have a number of programs that are ending now, and therefore we will have resources coming from within R&D to
finance the additional expenses that immuno-oncology especially will require, and they are significant, by the way.
But, in commercial, we have already eliminated a lot of the expenses behind the old products, and therefore we'll speak
about increasing commercial expenses. We will just -we will be ready to launch nivo, and we will continue to support
Yervoy. And as we said, Yervoy will launch in first-line in Europe. So we will expand the commercial activities behind
Eliquis in the U.S. in the early launches, and we will launch outside the U.S. in the most recent countries. And then –
well, Charlie will speak about the investments that will be required by the launch of Hep C in Japan. And finally, we
have Forxiga hopefully approved next year, and so we will have launched Forxiga in the U.S.
Having said that, we are extremely aware – my management and I are extremely aware of how important it is to deliver
short-term results, and we will deliver them. But we consider equally, if not even more important, to build a solid
foundation for sustained long-term growth. So we will devote resources in some areas, as I said, to all the great
opportunities we have.
Charlie, do you want to talk about...?
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Yeah, thanks for your question, Jami. As Lamberto mentioned in his opening comments,
we are very excited about our opportunity to bring the first all-oral Hep C regimen to market in Japan with our
genotype 1b strategy. Our registrational Phase III study of daclatasvir and asunaprevir in Japanese genotype 1b patients
will be presented at AASLD in a couple of weeks, and we plan to file in Japan later this quarter. Remember that there
are about 1.2 million people infected with hepatitis C in Japan, and about 70% of them have genotype 1b. These
patients are largely elderly, and many either cannot tolerate the current interferon-based standard of care or are
ineligible to receive it. So that speaks to the real opportunity and why the current standard of care has not done as well,
to your earlier point. And finally, we believe we have up to an 18-month lead on both AbbVie and Gilead in Japan.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Jami, thanks for the questions. Leslie, can we go to the next one, please?

We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Great. Thanks for the questions, just had three here. I guess, first, we've seen your competitors
in the PD-1 space focusing a bit more on PD-L1 status, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer. Can you just
elaborate on your view on this dynamic and what implications it has either to the size of the market or the competitive
positioning of nivo? Second, on Eliquis, with this slower launch, I know things are accelerating a bit now, but have you
changed your internal peak sales assumptions on the product based on the experience thus far? And then finally,
switching to diabetes, in light of some of the moves by payers to narrow their formulary to one or two products in some
of these major categories, can you just talk about how formulary dynamics play out in this space over time, and are
things just becoming more challenging with payers on that portion of your business? Thanks very much.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: I have a very quick answer to your question on Eliquis. No, our peak sales have not
changed, and we are still very confident about Eliquis and what that product can achieve. Francis?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So I'll say a word about the PD-L1. Now, as you remember, Chris, we reported biomarker
data last year in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested PD-L1 might be a predictive marker for the

activity of nivolumab, and as a result, we've been studying this throughout our broad Phase III program. Now, it's
important to note that our clinical development plans are designed to explore both the potential predictive biomarker
and to ensure that the patients who may benefit are not excluded if they're biomarker-negative. So our objective to
conduct well-controlled Phase III studies will establish the validity of any biomarker based on overall survival. And,
again, it's an important element – not just overall response rate, overall survival.
And I think, finally, it's hard to predict exactly how this will come out, because, as you understand, the approach for
developing immunotherapies is rather different from what we would use in targeted medicines. So, in
immuno-oncology, we're really targeting the host and the interaction of the tumor and the host immune system, as
opposed to tumor mutations such as KRAS or BRAF. That being said, I think I would say, as far as we're concerned in
BMS, we have a lot of experience with KRAS in Erbitux. We do understand what's necessary to have a
pharmacodiagnostic properly validated and to develop the data that's going to be required for the regulator to make a
decision. So I think we're generating the data, we'll see what the data is, and we'll debate and collaborate with the
regulators to provide, perhaps, a biomarker or perhaps an accelerated submission if that's appropriate. Thank you.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, this is Giovanni. Let me make a comment on diabetes access. Clearly, as you know, this
is a very big market, very competitive and crowded, and obviously it's an area of focus for payers, and that will not
change going forward. From our perspective, this is the one area where, in fact, having a broad portfolio really creates a
good platform for us to negotiate with payers through the three classes. When we look at our competitive position, our
access with Bydureon is improving, and in DPP-4s, following the loss of Caremark at the end of last year, our access
position this year with Onglyza and Kombiglyze has been good and stable. Going into next year, as you probably
know, we had two very important wins with ESI, which is a very important customer, both with respect to our position
with Onglyza and DPP-4s, and most importantly with Bydureon as the preferred GLP-1. So it continues to be an area of
focus for us, but we're working very actively, we have a good portfolio, and we'll be able to continue to compete.

And we'll take our next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. First, for Francis, I realize it's a bit early,
but could you please comment on some of the other cancer immunotherapies that you have in the clinic and roughly
when we can expect data? And then, a follow-up on Forxiga – is the FDA AdCom later this year simply a follow-up to
earlier issues, because it doesn't seem like one is expected for Lilly's empagliflozin. Thank you.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Alex, let me just be very brief. We have ongoing trials with combinations of ipilimumab,
nivolumab with [ph] anti-kia (39:22) and IL-21. Those are ongoing exploratory trials, so it's very hard to say. They're
event-driven trials, so we'll see when those come out. And I think, excitingly, we're going to have, before the end of the
year, the LAG-3 entering the clinic, and again, those studies are yet to start, but again, very exciting.
<A - John E. Elicker>: The AdCom.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Sorry. The AdCom for Forxiga, we know we have an AdCom in December that the FDA, I
think it's important to note, has been working through despite the government shutdown. We feel we've answered all
the questions that came from the CRL, and we added additional data to the submission. Some of that was presented at
the EASD in September, and some more on hypertension will be presented at the AHA in November, and this will be
part of the AdCom.

We'll take our next question from Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. If I can go back to biomarkers, your positioning over – at least initially was
a little bit uncertain whether L1 expression would be highly predictive, but when I look at the data that has continued to
come out, it seems like that body of evidence does increasingly support that L1 expression predicts efficacy. And I
guess my question to you is, has your thinking changed over time? I know your development programs are set up to
look at it, but are you kind of warming up, the more data you see, to the idea of L1 being predictive? And then, related
to this, what other predictive biomarkers are you looking at – or is anyone in the industry looking at – that seem
promising?
And then the last question is, going back to your comment, you said the next public data downstream of World Lung
Conference would be ASCO, but I'm imagining you'll have top-line results of various sorts in between. If that's right,
maybe you could outline what some of these would include. I would imagine that would be the Phase II lung cancer
data and the combo data with ipi, for example.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Okay, thank you, Tim. So I think it's fair to say our data and others suggest that the PD-L1
biomarker will enrich full response. However, it's also very clear that there's a number of patients who are apparently
PD-L1-negative who also respond, and I think it's important that we don't exclude those patients from the potential
benefit. And I think it's particularly important to say also that the data that will evolve and we will get some sense of
the long-term response. But, that being said, we are leaving ourselves open to take the data we generate and, in
discussions with the regulators, to come up with the best approach.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Francis, can I make a comment that is not, obviously, very scientific, but aren't others
drawing conclusions a bit too early at this point? Don't we need more patients, more experiences, before we draw final
conclusions on these very important aspects?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Well, I think that is certainly our point of view. I think we're leaving ourselves open to go
with a biomarker if that's what the data shows, but we also want to make sure that we make sure this therapy is open to
the broadest number of patients.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Yep.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: I think as far as other predictive biomarkers are concerned, there's a lot of work ongoing in
terms of understanding that interaction between the host and the tumor. And I don't think at this point I want to share
any of that data, but it's certainly an area of considerable work, both internally within BMS and externally with our
collaborators. As far as the next public data, let me reiterate what I said. The two-year lung data will be presented from
003 at the World Lung Conference in Sydney in a couple of weeks – I think later this week, in fact. And then we will
be getting considerable amounts of data over the next six months within BMS, but the next time we're planning to
present publicly will be at ASCO. And there will be data sets, probably further data sets on 003 survival, 004, which is
the combination, and potentially the third-line Phase II study in non-small cell lung squamous cell.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks. And, Tim, you're right, we will also have the combo Phase I lung study in-house
hopefully by the end of the year, so...
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Yeah, both the non-small lung and renal cell.

function of patient selection and management, and in actual fact, when you do start looking at combination therapies,
the [indiscernible] (45:15) benefits of PD-L1 targeted agents may look somewhat better? And then, finally, how will
the GBA decision on Galvus reimbursements in Germany impact the pricing of the class in the rest of Europe? Many
thanks.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Andrew, let me start. So, urelumab, we have a couple of studies ongoing. They're exploratory
studies. They're event-based studies, so they will be probably reporting out sometime in 2015, perhaps a little sooner.
As far as the pneumonitis rates we are seeing, we are not seeing very high rates at all. We have seen them, as you
know, with both with PD-1 and our PD-L1. And it's very difficult with very small numbers, I think, to – it's an
important potential adverse event, but it doesn't happen very often. And we do expect, as the numbers grow, to have a
better sense of that. But I think it's very hard at this point to interpret at all about whether it'll be greater or lesser with
either PD-1 or PD-L1.
<A - Béatrice J. Cazala>: So, regarding the GBA, you've probably all heard that on October 1, the ruling was made
after a class review of all the DPP-4s and their combinations. So we are very pleased there to see that in a very difficult
context in Germany for diabetes, our products, both Onglyza and Kombiglyze, were given an added minor benefit over
the usage of metformin. So that happened with sitagliptin. Galvus, as you mentioned, did not get any benefit. So what
happens now in the process and to understand what could be the outcome is that negotiations on pricing are going to
start with the BfArM. So obviously, each company will negotiate their pricing, and we will see then the outcome. For
us, we feel that with an additional benefit, we will be able to conclude pricing negotiation relatively quickly, and we
cannot speculate what sitagliptin will be doing, but we will be ready to seize any opportunities in case [indiscernible]
(47:35).
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Andrew. Can we go to the next question, please, Leslie?

We'll take our next question from Steve Scala with Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you very much. I have two follow-ups from points made on the second quarter call. I
apologize if you've already given this piece of information, but what is the share of Eliquis among cardiologists? I think
on the second quarter call you said it was about 15%. And on nivolumab, on the second quarter call, you stated that
there was no more public disclosures this year, when indeed you do have this two-year update that you referenced a
couple of times on the call, coming this week or next week. So, three months ago, you probably didn't have the
two-year data, but now you do, the two-year update, so I'm wondering if receipt of the data changed your language or
characterization of the event. Thank you.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, this is Giovanni. Let me start with the cardiology NBRx share. The latest data point we
have is 18.9% share for Eliquis from a new patient share in cardiology.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Steve, it's Francis Cuss, just to say that we always planned to present the long-term data at the
World Lung Conference in Sydney. And you're right; that's not new. That was always the plan. But you're right about
the next [ph] data of that (49:03) is ASCO.
<A - John E. Elicker>: And I think part of that, Steve, was the view that this is data from an existing study that had
already been presented, so in terms of we weren't presenting data from any new studies the remainder of this year. Can
we go to the next question, please, Leslie?

<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. I've got one on the pipeline and one on the marketing
side. So, on the marketed side about Orencia, you mentioned the sub-Q formulation, and I think you said it's about a
third of the use now with that formulation. I think that's consistent with what we were hearing too. Just wondering if
you're sensing that that's helping physicians get more comfortable moving Orencia up earlier in the algorithm, and
maybe what else we can expect in terms of life cycle management. And then on nivo, I realize it's a bit early to be
asking this question, but we've been getting this question a lot ourselves, is around the pricing side, and seems to be a
lot of wide range of assumptions there in terms of how the combo could potentially be priced. Again, I realize it's early,
but if there's anything you could say just in terms of directionally how we should be thinking about that, what your
framework is in terms of thinking about pricing, just because it is such a key variable in our model and I think others as
well.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: You are right. The pricing on Nivo is a very important subject, but we are not willing to
discuss it today. We are devoting a lot of attention to that subject. We are discussing internally. We are collecting the
right data. And obviously we will make the decision over time, and we will announce it at the very last minute.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: So let me start with Orencia in the U.S. You're right. We had a very good quarter in the U.S.
The brand was up 17% versus previous year. The sub-Q formulation was up significantly both versus prior year and
sequentially over the previous quarter in the U.S. That is happening exactly as you mentioned, as a result of physicians
feeling more and more comfortable in using the sub-Q formulation earlier in the treatment paradigm, and in fact, even
our promotional strategy has shifted, really, to promoting the value of Orencia sub-Q as a first-line biologic. As you
may have seen and know, we're now the third most-prescribed sub-Q agent in the U.S., and the trends continue to be
positive.
<A - Béatrice J. Cazala>: Similarly, in the international and in Europe, things are going very well for Orencia. In
Europe, particularly, the market was 70%-plus in sub-Q, so having now the addition and the reimbursement
progressively again, but in most markets for sub-Q, it's very helpful to our growth. We were growing by more than
40% in the last quarter. So, similarly, we see more and more use – first-line biologic switch first, and more and more
now we're thinking about the first-line biologics. So this is good. This is our progression. What also we have noticed
last quarter is that our IV business seemed to be bottoming out and stabilizing and re-growing. So that's also good
because we have additional growth coming from new patients, not just cannibalization.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Okay. Thanks, Vamil. I think we have time, Leslie, for one more question.
Operator
And we'll take our final question from Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you. For Giovanni and Béatrice, I was curious, how much does your oncology
commercial effort need to expand if nivo is approved in lung cancer, and when would you begin that expansion? And
for Charlie, on tax rate, wondering what a good tax rate to use longer-term would be now that you've had some more
time post-Plavix LOE, and does that new rate give you adequate flexibility to raise the dividend, if you were to choose
so, and to buy back stock if you were to choose to do so again in the future? Just wondering how much flexibility is left
within your new tax structure. Thanks.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: So, very quickly on the U.S., as you know, we have a very good organization in the U.S.
with a strong and diversified portfolio. We are well-resourced for Yervoy in melanoma. Obviously, we are thinking
about lung. That's a bigger opportunity. It's a larger prescriber base. And we will be ready to launch that as well. So we
clearly will invest and grow the sales organization in the U.S.
<A - Béatrice J. Cazala>: And as you know, lung is really a global issue from China to Japan to the U.S., so the global
team are working with all our regional teams to assess in the next few years how much resources we need to be ready
and start early on. It's clear that with the competitive landscape, we want to be ready and not to have to reorganize
every year each time we have an additional indication or an additional labeling evolution. So we are working on that

very actively with all our regions.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Yeah, this is the new paradigm in oncology, where we have multiple indications
potentially coming very quickly, and therefore we are thinking in the U.S., as Giovanni said, and outside of the U.S., as
Béatrice said, of creating an infrastructure and a structure that doesn't need to be changed at every indication. And also
we need to start very early with these new prescribers, the education of the new prescribers. Remember the work we
had to do with the melanoma prescribers at the beginning to familiarize them with immuno-oncology. Well, the same
needs to be done now with a much broader base in the U.S. and internationally to you familiarize them with
immuno-oncology and the other lines of specialty for lung cancer prescribers.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Yeah, Gregg, let me address your questions. On the tax rate, you may recall that we
benefited in 2013 by having the double-up of the R&D tax credit from 2012. Going forward, our tax rate is very
dependent upon where our earnings mix comes from, and we've said, at least in the intermediate term, we view our tax
rate in the high teens, mid to high teens area. I can't give more than that. We're going to have to roll off the numbers
and see where all the different earnings come from. As far as the dividend, that's an annual board decision, and that's
not one I can talk about at this point. And in regard to share repurchases, I would just reinforce what I said in my
opening comments, is that we do not anticipate any share repurchases going forward at this time.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Okay. So thank you, Charlie. Even though this is a decision of the board, we are aware
that the board and we are committed to the dividend. So I know that this – every comment we make on dividends might
be misinterpreted. I didn't want your comment to be misinterpreted. We are committed to the dividend, and the board
will decide on it quarter by quarter and year by year.

Let me conclude this session by repeating this is an important time for Bristol-Myers Squibb – our return to growth, our
pipeline progress, and our balanced approach to delivering the results of today while laying the foundation for results of

the future. Thank you very much, and you have a great day.
