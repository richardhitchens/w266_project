noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of restructuring charges taken in the third quarter of
2013, and an insurance recovery, and a decrease to our reserve, taken during the third quarter of 2014, both of which
are related to the Macondo litigation.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?
David J. Lesar
Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. I can tell you I am really pleased with our third quarter results. Even
with all the noise out there this quarter, on things such as Russian sanctions, disruptions in Libya and Iraq, the supply
chain challenges we faced, and customer delays in the Gulf of Mexico, I believe we met these challenges head on,
fought through them, and were successful. And I'm really proud of our employees who made it happen.
So, here are the headlines. Record company revenue of $8.7 billion, we also delivered industry-leading revenue, and
operating income growth, both sequentially and year-over-year, once again outgrowing our peer group. New quarterly
revenue records for both North America and the Eastern Hemisphere, with double-digit sequential revenue growth in
Latin America. And one I know you're going to want to hear, is that the exit rate for this quarter for North American
margins was over the 20% margin mark, a major milestone in delivering our Analyst Day commitment to you, our
shareholders.
In addition, our job board in North America remains sold out, and we are delivering new stimulation equipment that
will allow us to add incremental work in the fourth quarter, with no negative impact on our margins. We believe the
Macondo case is essentially over for Halliburton, based on our settlement and the judge's ruling in the litigation. And
lastly, we continue to focus on delivering higher shareholder returns to you. This quarter, we repurchased an additional
$300 million in stock, and our Board of Directors has approved an additional 20% dividend increase. Meaning, we now
have doubled our quarterly dividend over the past two years.
Now, let's go through some of the geographies. Company operating income increased 21% sequentially. North America
grew 15%; Europe/Africa/CIS, 16%; and Latin America more than doubled, by growing 126% from the prior quarter.
In North America, activity levels continue to surge higher, month-over-month, due to an unprecedented level of service
intensity. As you will recall, I called the turn two quarters ago. This quarter, things are clearly accelerating out of that
turn, and we do not see momentum slowing any time soon.
We also made excellent progress on pricing on our stimulation contract renewals and on cost recovery for ongoing
contracts. Across key basins, we have negotiated higher prices that add a minimum, should recover current and
expected future cost inflation. And we should begin to see the full impact of new contract pricing as we move in to
2015.
Now a hot topic today, is obviously profit in sand logistics, and we did experience some disruptions early in the third
quarter, where work was delayed because we were waiting on sand deliveries. And we did in fact miss some jobs, as
did nearly every other service company. But I could tell you, we have great people who helped us manage through this
challenge each and every day, and we have now taken actions to get ahead of this issue going forward. And Jeff will
provide details on this in a few minutes.
Now moving to our international market, despite the geopolitical issues we faced, in areas like Russia, Libya, and Iraq,
our Eastern Hemisphere activity continues to expand at a steady rate. On the strength of markets like Saudi Arabia,
Southern Iraq, West Africa, and the Caspian, we are on track to deliver double-digit revenue growth for the full year
2014. In addition, we expect to be awarded $1 billion of new work in Iraq. And consistent with previous years, we
expect the fourth quarter in the Eastern Hemisphere to be our strongest quarter of the year, due to seasonal year-end
software and equipment sales.
So, over the last three years, we've delivered industry-leading double-digit revenue growth in the Eastern Hemisphere.
And as we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate the rate of growth may slightly moderate due to headwinds from ongoing
geopolitical issues, as well as customer spending adjustments, especially among the IOCs, as they seek to achieve

better returns for their company. And although double-digit growth may be a challenge for any service company next
year, we fully expect to continue to outpace our peers in revenue growth, whatever market is handed to us.
Now, let's move to Latin America. This has been an area that's had a tough year. Even with better revenue in the third
quarter, margins and overall activity levels still do not meet my expectations, due primarily to continued operational
delays in Mexico. But as we look ahead, I see several positive factors finally coming into play. First, we are up and
running on our integrated projects in Mexico, and expect to be at full operational capacity in early 2015. We're also
excited about the pace of Mexico energy reform and expect to see strong opportunities in Mexico shale, mature fields,
and deepwater markets in the coming years.
In Brazil, negotiations on the recently retendered directional drilling contract are progressing, and we expect to be
operating under the new and more profitable contract, as we transition into the first quarter. And last but not least, we
are very excited about our recent multibillion-dollar award in Ecuador, where we expect strong growth, as these
projects ramp up next year. So, for Latin America, I expect a much stronger 2015, and we are well-positioned for
tremendous growth potential in the coming years.
Now, before I close, I have to recognize that there is currently a concern about the recent decline in commodity prices.
I'm not going to predict what the oil price is going to be, but on a longer term, we believe industry fundamentals
suggest that these lower prices are not sustainable. While we might be in a slight oversupply situation right now,
remember, demand is still growing. Therefore, considering North America and OPEC production expectations, the
continued tightness in global spare production capacity and potential geopolitical impacts on non-OPEC production, we
believe that supply and demand will essentially be back in balance, in a relatively short period of time.
Nevertheless, we are keenly aware that there is a risk of a moderation in activity, if oil prices remain weak for an
extended period of time. What I can tell you, is that in recent conversations with our North America customers, we
have not received any indication of activity levels slowing as we transition into 2015. For example, last week the IEA
commented that approximately 98% of North America liquids projects have a breakeven price below $80 per barrel,
and over 80% work below $60 a barrel. On the international front, the majority of our NOC customers have not
indicated that their activity levels will slow down at all.
However, as I've mentioned before, we were already expecting our IOC customers to moderate their capital budgets in
2015, to improve their individual company returns. That being said, we can't be in denial about what is happening in
the market today. As you know, I've been around the block a few times, and I can tell you our management team is
well-equipped to handle this kind of uncertainty. We will control what we can control, in areas such as cost
management, contract price renewals, and managing customer relationships. We know that we can do these things very
well.
My experience has taught me, that if we keep the franchise strong and growing, and I can tell you we're going to do
that, aligned with the right customers, which we've already done, and take care of our employees, we will be fine in the
long run. Whether this uncertainty lasts for a few months or longer, we are ready for any market. I think, we are
well-positioned as a company to capture all of the market upside potential for you, while giving you protection to any
downside
Strategically, we are structured to deliver the lowest cost per barrel to our customers, which in turn positions them and
Halliburton to perform best in volatile markets. As such, we believe oil prices would have to remain at lower levels for
a sustained period, before the long-term economics would begin to impact our primary customers.
So, to sum it up, our overall strategy is working well, and we intend to stay the course. Whatever the market, we
believe we can outperform our peers, and we remain focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial
performance, and providing industry-leading shareholder returns. We have delivered this to you in the past, and I
believe we will continue to do so in the future.
Now, let me turn the call over to Mark to provide you some financial details. Mark?

Mark A. McCollum
Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Let me begin with an overview of our third quarter results. Starting with North
America, revenues were up 9% sequentially. This strong all-organic growth was relative to a 3% increase in the U.S.
land rig count. Operating income was up 15% over the same period. Margins for the quarter averaged 19.2%, with our
September exit rate coming in slightly higher than in the 20% mark.
Stronger activity levels in U.S. land and the rebound from the Canadian spring break-up drove the improvement for the
quarter, more than offsetting increased logistics cost and the impact of Loop Currents in the Gulf of Mexico. Margins
also benefited from modest pricing improvements on pressure pumping contract renewals, which were designed to
cover inflation on specific cost categories, such as transportation, fuel and labor.
In the Eastern Hemisphere, revenue and operating income increased sequentially by 4% and 6%, respectively. Growth
was led by Europe/Africa/CIS, where revenue and operating income increased 6% and 16%, respectively, compared to
the prior quarter. Seasonal increases in Russia and the Caspian, higher activity in Angola, along with increased well
construction activity in Continental Europe, led to sequential improvement. Partially offsetting these increases were
activity declines in Libya, Algeria and Norway.
The seasonal recovery in Russia was negatively affected by the recent sanctions, and growth in this market is expected
to be a challenge for the foreseeable future, since we'll be prohibited from tendering projects that fall under the
sanctions restrictions. We expect our Russia business will continue to face headwinds next year, including the
possibility of additional sanctions. But we're hopeful that full-year 2015 could come in at similar levels to this year.
Middle East Asia region revenue increased by 3% sequentially, and operating income was in line with the second
quarter. Activity improvements in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, India and Indonesia during the quarter were mostly
offset by sequential declines in stimulation work in Malaysia and Australia. On a year-over-year basis, we have seen
tremendous revenue growth across Middle East Asia. Saudi is leading with a 60% improvement and India, Iraq, and
Thailand have all delivered growth over 30%.
The conflict in Iraq resulted in a shutdown of the majority of activity in Kurdistan and Northern Iraq. However, the
majority of our operations have been in Southern Iraq, away from the fighting, where activity levels have remained
relatively stable. At this point, activity is gradually returning to Kurdistan, and overall we expect Iraq to be a growth
market for us in 2015.
In Latin America, revenue increased 16% sequentially, while operating income more than doubled compared to the
previous quarter. Mexico was the primary driver, where we saw the benefit of higher activity on our Humapa project
and recent contract approvals, which resulted in an increase in consulting and software revenue for the quarter. We also
experienced higher testing and directional drilling activity in Brazil as well as increased work-over and stimulation
activity in Venezuela.
Our corporate and other expense totaled $83 million for the quarter, a little lower than anticipated, driven by a
reduction in strategic initiative cost and lower level expenses. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the fourth
quarter will be approximately $90 million. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 25%,
primarily driven by an adjustment to reflect the recoverability of our net operating loss carry-forwards in Brazil. For the
fourth quarter, we're expecting the effective tax rate to return to our normalized rate of approximately 28% to 29%.
We now expect our 2014 capital expenditures will be approximately $3.2 billion and depreciation and amortization to
be approximately $2.1 billion for the year. During the third quarter, we recorded income of $66 million in discontinued
operations. This is primarily related to a settlement with KBR for amounts owed to us under our tax sharing agreement
with them.
We announced today that our board of directors approved a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.15 to $0.18
per share, resulting in a cumulative 100% increase to our quarterly dividend over the last two years. As previously
stated, our intention going forward is for our dividend payout to equal at least 15% to 20% of our net income.
Additionally, based on our continued confidence in our business prospects, we bought back an additional $300 million

in shares during the third quarter. We still have $5.7 billion remaining in repurchase authorization from our board of
directors available for future stock buybacks.
Now, moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook. In the fourth quarter, we're anticipating moderated growth resulting
in a mid-single digit percentage sequential improvement in revenue with margins in the upper teens. Middle East Asia
is expected to have a high single digit sequential improvement with margins approaching 20% for the quarter. We
expect our Europe, Africa, CIS region to be relatively flat as a result of geopolitical challenges in Russia and Libya and
reduced customer spending in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.
In Latin America, we expect mid-single digit sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter with margins improving
modestly from the third quarter. This improvement is expected to result from year-end software and product sales as
well as the continued ramp-up of our IPM and asset management projects in Mexico.
Concluding with North America, in the fourth quarter, we typically see a seasonal decline in both revenue and margins.
This year, however, based on the exit rates we saw in the third quarter as well as the incremental equipment we are
currently deploying and considering our forecast for minimal holiday downtime this year, we believe fourth quarter
revenue and margins will be flat to modestly higher than the third quarter.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff?
Jeffrey Allen Miller
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited about our results this quarter. The Halliburton team is dead
focused on strategy execution, and the results are clearly evident in the quarter's industry-leading growth, with both of
our divisions setting revenue records as well as revenue records for 11 of our 13 product lines.
As a reminder, our strategy is built around three key growth markets: unconventionals, deepwater, and mature fields.
Our unconventional strategy is designed to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent for our customers with
surface efficiency, custom chemistry, and subsurface insight. Our deepwater strategy is to increase reliability and
reduce uncertainty. And finally, our mature field strategy is to deliver additional hydrocarbons in declining fields by
identifying new reserves and optimizing the recovery of existing reserves. Clearly, these strategies are working.
In North America unconventional market, the topic on everyone's mind this quarter was logistics driven by big
increases in both horizontal activity and completions intensity, which is right in the sweet spot of surface efficiency.
Compared to the prior year, the U.S. horizontal rig count in the third quarter was up more than 20%. Over the same
timeframe, our stage count was up more than 30%, and our average sand per well increased by more than 50%. And
while the rising rig count was predominantly a Permian Basin phenomenon, our customers are experimenting with
larger completion volumes in almost every basin. This is a fundamental change in well design that we believe is part of
a continuing trend.
As Dave said, earlier in the quarter, we experienced issues related to logistical disruptions primarily around profit. Cash
in terms of surface efficiency, increasing intensity presents a terrific opportunity for us. We've addressed these rising
completion volumes by expanding our infrastructure and transport capability. This includes increasing our sand
terminal capacity by over 100%, and we're on a path to double our current rail fleet. In terms of the last mile, trucking
from the railhead out to the location, we've added over 30 new contract suppliers so far this year, giving us a better
footprint and the capacity to handle these intense volumes of work.
Additionally, we implemented a sand logistics command center in Houston where operations personnel monitor supply
levels in the basins, and they sit with transport and procurement specialists, who are tracking our rail and trucking fleets
all in real time. The combination of these steps resulted in a sharp increase in efficiency, and we're confident that this
integrated approach to logistics will continue to differentiate Halliburton.
A quick update on our CYPHER seismic-to-stimulation platform. We are now at over 60 projects running with more in
the pipeline. In addition to taking on new work, we're also seeing customers expand CYPHER engagements to multiple

basins in North America. Most recently, we started a multi-year CYPHER project in the Permian Basin, incorporating
the full breadth of our products and services. We're only a few months into the study, but early wells have already seen
more than a 20% increase in average production compared to offset wells.
And CYPHER continues to serve as an engine for commercializing new technologies, like RockPerm, our proprietary
chemistry service that enables better oil flow, and then [ph] Frac Insight (23:34), a Halliburton software package to
help customers optimize their perforation placement and deliver the most efficient wells. We're very pleased with the
client uptake on the CYPHER platform and typically see follow-on work in additional basins with those same clients.
Our execution of surface efficiency, custom chemistry and subsurface insight led to the more than 20% exit rate
margins for North America in the third quarter.
In deepwater, we remain focused on technology that reduces uncertainty and improves reliability for our customers. I'll
give you a couple examples of technology that are getting traction right now. The GeoTap IDS, which is a
sampling-while-drilling tool, allows clients to take multiple fluid samples which reduces uncertainty while at the same
time reducing costly rig time. Another is BaraECD, which is a drilling fluid that allows customers to stabilize
circulating density enabling them to reliably drill more complex wells. We've already seen success on a global basis
from the Gulf of Mexico, to the North Sea, to the offshore Asia. And most recently in deepwater Angola. But the real
point here is that we are executing a technology strategy that does exactly what we say, to help clients reduce
uncertainty and increase reliability in deepwater.
And now finally in mature fields, our customers continue to look for ways to enhance recovery rates, whether through
discrete product offerings such as our recently acquired Progressive Cavity Pump technology or through large-scale
asset management projects. Let me highlight just a couple of these large project opportunities. The first is the recently
awarded Igapo project in Ecuador. This is a project to provide asset management across nine mature fields. This is a
15-year project that we expect to provide a stable long-term revenue stream that could potentially double our business
in the country, representing a multi-billion dollar opportunity over the full term of the project. We're very excited about
this opportunity in Ecuador and expect work to begin late in the first quarter of 2015.
Secondly, we've recently extended an integrated drilling project in southern Iraq and are encouraged by progress on
several other significant IPM projects in the country. We believe these opportunities will provide a platform for
continued double-digit growth in the Middle East region throughout 2015. Beyond these recent awards, we're currently
evaluating a pipeline of well over $30 billion worth of IPM work, which gives us confidence that we're on the right
track with our mature field strategy.
In closing, we believe that our strategies continue to provide growth opportunities. Our technology, infrastructure and
processes are aligned, and we are relentlessly focused on superior growth, margins and returns.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?
David J. Lesar
All right. Thank you, Jeff. Before we go to questions, let me summarize what you heard today. North American exit
margins greater than 20%. Our new equipment will be going to work at least those exit margins. We are building our
North American logistics to get ahead of the curve. We made good progress this quarter negotiating price increases
with our customers. And in Latin America, headwinds are becoming tailwinds, and 2015 is shaping up to be a much
stronger year. In the Eastern Hemisphere, there are a few trouble spots, but we still see an opportunity for steady
growth in the coming year. And we continue to focus on delivering the highest shareholder returns as evidenced by our
20% dividend increase and additional $300 million in stock repurchases during the quarter.
Before I close, I want to make one final comment on the current environment. The strategic initiatives we've been
working on the last several years, Battle Red, Frac of the Future and others, make us what I believe is the most efficient
and adaptable organization in the industry. We are able to execute equally well in either a boom market or one that's
more challenged. Across the board, we are focused on making better wells for our customers and better returns for you,

our shareholders. So no matter what market is handed to us, our strategies give us confidence that we will continue to
outperform our peers.
So with that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West of ISI. Your line is now opened.
<Q - James West>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Hey, James.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Good morning, James
<Q - James West>: And first of all, just congrats on the substantial year-over-year growth in Eastern Hemisphere, well
above your peers. I suspect Joe Rainey is pretty proud of what he's been able to accomplish.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: He is, yeah.
<Q - James West>: Then, Dave, as you mentioned, you've been around the block a couple of times here and I wanted
to know kind of what's your gut telling you right now about the outlook for North America as we go into next year? I
know it's a tough question but it's one on everybody's mind. And given your history of the industry, I was curious about
kind of your feel for what you think is going to happen next year.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah. Let me let Jeff take the first crack at it, then I'll come in at the end if I feel I need to add
something
<Q - James West>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. Thanks, James. I mean, our outlook today is very positive. We're in the heavy part
of our renewal period now, and I would tell you that renewals are rolling up, not down. And as of last week, I talked to
a lot of customers and budgets are moving up, not down. So in terms of activity, everything I see looks like it's
increasing into 2015. And quite frankly, our strategy that we have in place around delivering the lowest cost of barrel –
cost per BOE in the market is more valuable than ever.
<A - David J. Lesar>: So I guess let me just add, I think if you want to summarize it, we're not feeling, hearing, seeing
anything that says this momentum is going to change that we had coming out of Q3.
<Q - James West>: Okay. Good. Good. And then on the international side, I think you gave a good outline of most of
the regions around the world, some obviously slowness from the IOCs. But the same type of commentary around the
NOCs in the international markets, no real – no commentary around them slowing down.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Not seeing any of that, James. This is Jeff. The capital is going to work. It's going to work
in mature fields. It's going to work in unconventional maybe more so than deepwater. But, again, where we're
positioned and what we are seeing around integrated asset management opportunities isn't just a traditional work.
Nothing leads us to believe that from an IOC perspective, there's any change – NOC perspective.

<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Jud.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Question on the fourth quarter. You had indicated North America margins are – you exited at
20%. I believe Mark indicated you thought only a slight increase in margins for – from 3Q to 4Q. Is that just allowing
for seasonality? Or how should we think about the fourth quarter with a seasonally stronger fourth quarter but your exit
rate was above kind of what you had indicated, I guess?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Hey, Jud. This is Mark. Yeah. That's exactly right. We always try to consider that fourth
quarter, you have some holiday downtimes. You're going to have some seasonality, particularly in the Rockies where
we had a dominant market position that will impact the operations as you close out the year. But what we're doing is
we're looking at everything on balance. First of all, very strong exit rates. Second of all, very strong activity levels that
month-over-month continue to increase when we are working – our equipment is working very hard.
We had already indicated earlier in the year that we've been building additional frac equipment and we'll have new
spreads that are already hitting the Street today that will be active during the fourth quarter that will be adding to our
complement equipment that will be generating revenues.
And so when you take all of that on balance, we're just saying that this fourth quarter uniquely looks like one that we
could have a slightly better earnings and profits in this fourth quarter North America than you might see in a traditional
fourth quarter. Now, that's assuming a very sort of standard weather pattern, standard holiday downtimes. I mean, that's
– but from our base outlook, it looks like it's going to be a very good Q4.
<Q - Judson E. Bailey>: Okay. Thank you. And then if I could maybe stretch the margin outlook into 2015.
Understanding that your customers aren't really indicating a slowdown at this point, if we were to see some operators
scale back activity or just flatten out their budgets, can you help us think about Halliburton is going to have a lot of
moving parts, you're negotiating new contracts at higher pricing?
It sounds like now – if you see a softness in utilization, how should we – and you've obviously recovering some of your
recent cost increases as well. How should we think about your margins in 2015 if we were to see a slowdown? Is it a
situation where you think you can hold the line on margins? Would they decline potentially or could they still go up
because of the net pricing you're already starting to see in your contracts?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, Jud. This is Jeff. Our entire strategy is built around delivering Frac of the Future
and HALvantage. And if we roll back to our Analyst Day, we had always said that we would continue to put more
efficient equipment in the market and more efficient work practices so that we would be able to improve work margins
on the back of the way that we're working. So as I look out into 2015, we see those fundamental pieces of our business
continuing to deliver which clearly means that we continue to see positive impact on margin.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, I think – let me just add one thing. If you go – again, go back to Analyst Day, the impact
of things like Battle Red, Frac of the Future and other things that we are doing at that point in time we thought could
add five points in margin without any price increases and we're not backing off that view. A lot of the push-up in
margins right now are just those things being implemented and us being more efficient as an organization. So I think to
answer the question specifically, if you did have a flattening out, I would expect that our margins would be at least
where they are today.

amazing, and I know Jeff touched on it a little bit, but could you give us additional color there on what you're seeing on

the oil service intensity side? And I know you indicated that was not basin-specific but can you go into that a little bit?
And then thoughts on 2015. What kind of – any insight at this point on the degree of service intensity growth that we
could see this year? And clearly, it's worth noting that even if the rig count is flat and the well count is flat, you're still
driving higher revenues and margins.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah. Thanks, Angie. The service intensity continues to increase on the basis of the types of
jobs that are being designed. And so we've seen a consistent increase in the amount of proppant and the amount of
stages. So I refer specifically to 30% increase in stage count, 50% increase in sand consumption. I would say that you
see the bigger ramp in the more mature basins because that's where we're really getting into what I call sort of
hyper-efficiency and increasing the production of existing wells as opposed to maybe where it's a little bit more – I'll
use it with quotes around it "exploratory" in a few basins.
But as I look into 2015, I don't see anything that changes the pace of increase necessarily across the piece, simply
because we're making better wells. And that's what takes us back to the importance of sand logistics and the ability to
deliver. I'll give you one quick anecdote. For us, sand transload, we can unload an entire unit train in nine hours and we
can load a truck in seven minutes. So that's kind of where we're focusing our attention.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I mean, thinking about this oil service intensity growth and I
mean, reported out there we're going to add 1.5 million to 2 million in horsepower next year, how much do you think of
that is being added with stand-alone crews and they're actually full-frac fleets? And how much of that horsepower do
you think is reinforcement for existing fleets? Would that be as much as a third or even more?
<A - David J. Lesar>: No. I mean, when we look at that, expectation that's probably less than 10% coming into the
market. And the fact is the equipment is working harder than it has ever worked before given the size of the stages and
the amount of the sand. So my expectation is most of that equipment will either be backup equipment for big jobs now,
but our Q10 pumps, we are more effective. We're typically 20% less horsepower on location and quite frankly less
backup. In fact, we put very little backup equipment to work in the market. So that's kind of the takeaway is not that
concerned – really not concerned about additional horsepower.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Great. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now opened
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Hello. Thank you very much.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hi, Ole.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Sorry to harp on the sand this year, but some pretty staggering numbers of 50% up higher than
kind of what we've heard from other players. Do you think that's something that deals with Halliburton's customer base
and your position in the market? Or do you think this is sort of an industry trend?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Well, I think it's a little bit of both, Ole. We're working with fairway players. We've always said
that we make it a point to work with the most efficient operators in the marketplace so that we get the maximum
utilization of the technology we're putting in the market. So that we are pumping more sand maybe than competitors
would not surprise me at all. But I do think longer term, there will be a continued move towards better frac design,
thinking about our CYPHER technology, how we design the best fracs to get the most production out of the wells. And
I do believe that will lead us to a continuation of larger buy-ins.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: So how are you scaling your infrastructure over the next, say, two years? What are you planning
for as far as your experience in, say – for 2015, 2016, volume growth per well?

<A - David J. Lesar>: Well, let me think about it this way and in terms of what we're doing to address that. I think the
volumes will continue to increase across the piece. It may not stay at the same rate of increase, but from our standpoint,
we'll continue to invest in logistics to control the supply chain really from mine to the last well – from the mine to the
last mile that gets us to location, which looks like sand transloading and investment in rail cars. And these are the
things that overcome the logistics problems that seem to occur.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Which we're certainly – Ole, this is Mark. Just to add to that, I mean, from a contracting
standpoint, we're working very hard to make sure that we've got all of the sand needs that we're forecasting under
contract. We'll probably have 80% of our sand needs contracted this year. It may go up to 90% this year. By
contracting our sand looking forward, that allows us to shave off anywhere from 15% to 20% off of a spot sand pricing.
Doing the same on rail cars, making sure that we've got plenty of capacity to run full unit trains, making sure that our
transloading facilities are designed – each one are designed to offload complete unit trains. We're the only one so far I
think who've managed to be able to really offload complete unit trains on site in some of our locations.
And we're just going to look forward to where our customers are saying they're going to be running these volumes and
make sure that the infrastructures on site to be able to run as lean and efficient as we possibly can.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now opened.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thank you. Good morning. Dave and Jeff, to tackle the international question just a little
bit differently, I mean, you guys have been consistent and you've been correct here with regard to just the pace of
international expansion in general over the past several years. And when I look at your numbers for 2014 and juxtapose
them against the preceding couple of years, you will likely end up somewhere kind of high-single digits year-over-year
in 2014 versus kind of a low-teens rate of expansion in 2013 and a 20% rate of expansion in 2012. So when we
contemplate 2015 and against the slate of opportunities and threats, at this juncture, do you think you will do well to
match your international rate of growth of this year? Or should we expect something less?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: I guess the answer to that is we expect to outgrow the market or outgrow our competitors
in that space. There clearly are some headwinds when we look around the world right now. So the North Sea, Russia
and Libya are clearly going to present headwinds. So quite encouraged around tailwinds in the Middle East and Asia
Pacific, so – and I think about growth more specifically. It may be more where capital gets put to work maybe than it
has been in the past. We've talked a lot about deepwater, potential moderation as IOCs look at their capital budgets. But
that said, the barrels come from somewhere, and our expectation is that we may see more of that capital going into
development and mature field-type opportunities. And so, for that reason, I'm still very encouraged about our ability to
sustain growth into 2015, that would be sort of similar to where we are now.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And the $1 billion project in Iraq, can you elaborate on that? And also, I guess to
play devil's advocate for a second, why would we even want that, given the travails that the industry has witnessed over
the past several years there?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, let me answer that, two ways. The first question is relative, in reverse order, why
would we want that work? The fact is we're a lot smarter in that market than we've ever been. I think, we were early
into that market and underestimated the risk around logistics and a few other things. We really like the contract, the
way this one looks, in terms of terms and conditions. So, we feel good about that. The project itself, I won't name the
project, but it's a solid, it's a great project, it's four rigs to drill 120 wells over the next, probably, three years. And we
have invested heavily in putting our IPM team together, and they are really executing. And so, if I think about how we
execute on mature fields longer term, these are the kind of projects that we're going to do.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Brad
<Q - Brad Handler>: Maybe just a quick one. Your CapEx commentary, I guess, just a little bit lighter than the
second quarter commentary. What are you reflecting in that? Is that a difficulty in spending some capital, and you'll
spend it in 2015? Or are you actually shaving it relative to some of the commentary you've given us this morning?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: No. There's not been any kind of concerted effort to shave capital. I think, it's probably a
little bit tighter forecast, particularly as we look forward in some of the projects in the Eastern Hemisphere. It just takes
some time oftentimes to get things approved, and so, it's just a timing. So, you'll see some of that coming into, probably
the early part of 2015.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Okay. Very good. Thanks. And then, maybe an unrelated follow-up, and that maybe it's a bit
broader, if I look at your North America D&E revenues, it's over the nine months it's sort of tracking the rig count, but I
think it's up 6%, again nine months versus nine months, and that's relative to horizontal rig count up 13% in U.S. land
anyway, or in the U.S., so I know there's some other factors, and maybe you'll fold that into the answer. But how does
that – what's the prognosis for how that is moving forward? Are there some things that might move in place that can
accelerate D&E and make it align better with the horizontal rig count or there's some factors that continue to suggest it
will be somewhat less than that?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah, and I think what you're seeing in the current quarter is a bit of impact in the Gulf of
Mexico, so [ph] we've experienced (46:44) Loop Currents like everybody else, and so we had a quite a bit slower
activity in the Gulf of Mexico in the current quarter. But the well construction-type activity is going to track, generally
speaking, the rig count, so – but we're really encouraged as we look Q4 and beyond, get the Loop Currents behind us,
we really like our share in the Gulf of Mexico right now, and it's a growing share in the Gulf of Mexico.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Good morning, guys
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Jim.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Good morning.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: The Eastern Hemisphere production really hasn't grown much in the last couple of years, and
you guys are setting records in terms of operating income and revenues. Is this – and it's the U.S., of course, has been
growing. Is the level of activity in the Eastern Hemisphere somewhat inelastic, considering that we at least have to
maintain production?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yes, Jim. I mean, that's the right answer. We're working harder and harder to produce,
arguably the same number of barrels, but those barrels are critical to a number of economies around the world. And so,
when we look at sort of outlook, two things: One, the projects that are started have to continue, these are long duration
type projects. They don't turn on and off. And then secondly, there are a lot of mature field type activity that we know,
with lower exploration risk, almost nil exploration risk. Those are projects that create terrific returns for our customers.
So, I think those two conspire to give you an inelastic sort of outlook.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Okay. And my follow-up, if I could, is somewhat the same for North America. If the U.S.
unconventional production starts to decline on an unconventional hyperbolic, the amount of effort it takes to reverse
that is huge. So, how much activity in the U.S. is needed to maintain, not grow, but just maintain existing U.S.
production? Did you all done that work?

<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: It's quite a bit of the work that's going on now, and I guess, Jim, the way I'd answer that is
rather than give you a percentage, I would say that, we know the decline rates on existing wells fairly dramatic. We
know what it takes in order to continue to improve that. So, I would expect that sustaining activity or sustaining
production in North America takes a quite a big chunk of the work that's going on now.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, Jim. This is Dave. I would just add one thing, and I think that we've referred to it as sort
of a treadmill effect. What you want to do is get your customers in a basin, where they've got sufficient amount of
production that they have to get on the treadmill, if you will, to keep that production going. Because that's a great place
for a service company to be and a great place for the lowest cost, most efficient service company to be, because helping
the customer stay on that treadmill, as it gets faster, and the incline goes up, is part of the whole hyper-efficiency model
that we try to offer up to our customers.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hi. Good morning. Good morning, guys. I just had a follow-up question regarding the frac
dynamics in U.S., and you guys have discussed for many quarters now, cost recovery processes, and it seems like that
is now beginning to take hold. Just wondering, what your perspective is in terms of the incremental capacity that's been
added recently, and whether or not some of that cost recovery can turn into net pricing gains from an industry
standpoint, going forward?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, I can't speak for the industry. But I will speak for Halliburton. And this is right in
our wheelhouse. As you said, recovering inflation has really been the order of the day. But as we go through the
renewals and we sort of establish inflationary increases that keep us whole, very quickly, we drop back into our ability
to manage cost and drive efficiency, which should allow us or it does allow us to convert that inflation into net pricing,
the extent to which we outcompete at the market. And this is precisely why we implemented HALvantage and the
logistics advantages we have, Battle Red, Frac of the Future. And that's what conspires to deliver our exit rates in
excess of 20%.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Great. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Thanks. Mark, you mentioned Europe/Africa/CIS would be relatively flat in the fourth
quarter, wanted to confirm that this is for revenues as well as margins. And then, just give a little additional color on
the growth or just how that region grows revenues and margins next year, given that North Sea revenues are likely
down and would be the challenge just to keep Russian revenues flat.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: The answer is, it does relate to both. Yes, revenues and margins. I mean, typically, you
might see margins climb up a bit on the back of a some level of direct sales, completion tool sales, things like that. But
I think this quarter, given where we're seeing some of the softness, particularly the Norwegian sector in the North Sea
in Q4, we're expecting it to be more flat to Q3 on both the revenue and the margin side.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: And for next year?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: It's a little early to know for next year where it's going to go. I mean, obviously,
everything that we're trying to do across the board is to improve margins, by cutting cost and things like that. As we
look forward to next year, I mean, I think we do see some continued softness in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.
Russia, as I said on the call, will likely be, hopefully, we're working to be flat year-over-year on an overall basis. And

we'll have – Libya's down for the count right now. It's difficult to forecast when that will be.
But when you look at other markets across Europe, Africa and CIS, the Caspian continues to do very well. When you
look at Sub-Saharan Africa itself, we had a very good year. Expect that will continue to grow on the back of mature
field projects there. And Continental Europe for us, is doing exceedingly well right now, and we expect that, that will
go up as well.
So, as we go into the year, while it's still a little bit early in the planning cycle, I would say, we're still expecting it to be
up. And with that, we're continuing to leverage incremental margins that are higher than current margins, and so we're
expecting margins to continue to climb in that area as well, even though it might be a little bit less than the Middle
East/Asia.

Thank you. And our final question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Thank you, taking my question. Mark, you've promised us 500 basis points, kind of, margin
improvement through the course of the years from [ph] internal mid-years, (54:16) Frac of the Future and/or
HALvantage. How much of that has already been realized, and what is left for the coming years?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: So, I would tell you that our goal was to get a 200-basis point improvement in 2014. As of
today, we have accomplished that objective. While we had hoped that it would be for the entirety of Q3, we didn't quite
get there, but we were very close. And if it hadn't been for some of the logistics challenges that we had in the month of
July, we would have indeed had hit that target.
So, as we look forward, we're comfortable with where we're at, but I can tell you that really, on the face of Battle Red,
we still got a long way to go. I mean, all of our – all of the systems are in place. We've been working out a lot of the
kinks in that process, but a lot of the upside from that project are still in front of us. On the Frac of the Future side,
we're only still a quarter deployed. We've got a long way to go in terms of achieving that, so we're going to continue to
work very, very focused and determinedly to make sure that we capture all that upside. So, as we sit today, we feel very
good about our progression, and where's no, from our standpoint, no retreat from our objective of getting 500 basis
points over the next couple of years.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Okay. And then, I may have missed that before, but could you quantify the impact of Gulf of
Mexico on the D&E margins and revenues for the quarter?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: I don't know if we could quantify it overall for D&E, but I'd say that Gulf of Mexico, the
Loop Current issue, probably cost us about $0.01 in the quarter.
