Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Katie, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our second quarter 2014 earnings
conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief
Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta
Stewart.
I am very pleased to report that Norfolk Southern's second quarter financial results set all-time records across the board.
Earnings for the quarter were $1.79 per share, up 23% compared with the $1.46 we earned in the second quarter of last
year. These very strong results reflect a substantial increase in demand, coupled with our continuing effective cost
control.
Overall, traffic was up 8%, reflecting a double-digit rise in intermodal, along with increases in both merchandise and
coal. These strong volumes resulted in record revenues, which topped $3 billion, a $240 million or 9% increase versus
last year. Don will fill you in on all of the details of these gains in a few minutes. At the same time, our expenses were
up only 3% despite the volume surge and some continuing slowdown in our network velocity. Our resulting 66.5%
operating ratio set an all-time quarterly record.
To put the volume growth in perspective, our weekly volumes averaged about 153,000 loads in the second quarter of
this year, compared with only 141,000 loads on average in last year's second quarter. In fact, we only saw volumes
exceed 150,000 loads in two weeks of all of 2013, and in contrast, we have seen only three weeks of less than 150,000
loads since the last week in March of this year.
Now, going immediately from the severe winter weather that we experienced to this kind of volume growth has
obviously created some challenges for us, but our operating team has clearly risen to the occasion. Our network
continues to be fluid and stable, although our service metrics are not yet back to last year's levels. Mark will give you
the numbers as well as describe our initiatives to improve network velocity.
While the network slowdown and our recovery efforts did give rise to some added costs, our overall expense control
was strong, and Marta will go over all of the financials with you in more detail. To sum it up, it was a great quarter for
our company, and while we don't necessarily see the same kind of volume growth being sustained for the balance of
2014, our results show the strength of our franchise and our potential for ongoing improvement.
In recognition of this potential, I'm also very pleased that our board increased our dividend yesterday by $0.03 per
share, or 6%. And on that note, I'll turn the program over to Don, Mark, and Marta, and then I'll return with some
closing remarks before we take your questions. Don?
Donald W. Seale
Thank you, Wick, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter of 2014, as Wick stated, was Norfolk Southern's
first $3 billion quarter, with revenue growth of $240 million, or 9%, compared to second quarter of last year. Revenue
in all three primary business units increased, with intermodal up 11%, followed by merchandise at 8% and coal up 7%.

With respect to the quarterly revenue variance, our volume increase of almost 145,000 units generated $221 million in
additional revenue, while improved pricing and positive fuel surcharge revenue largely offset the negative mix effect of
having higher volumes of intermodal traffic.
Turning to the next slide, despite higher intermodal volumes, our overall revenue per unit increased by 1% in the
quarter, with steady price increases among most business units. Coal revenue per unit was up 5%, due primarily to
longer lengths of haul for utility coal, which offset the negative mix effect of lower volumes of export coal.
In our merchandise segment, RPU was up 2% in spite of negative mix effects from higher short-haul movements in the
metals and construction and agricultural products segments. Lastly, our intermodal sector experienced positive pricing,
which was offset by the negative mix effects of increased international volumes, which have lower revenue-per-unit
characteristics compared to domestic shipments.
Now, turning to the details of our volume for the quarter, total shipments increased 8%, due primarily to increases in
metals and construction, intermodal, coal, crude oil, natural gas liquids, and housing-related commodities. Intermodal
volume was up 11%, driven by organic growth and new business in international, coupled with continued strength in
our domestic market and highway conversion programs.
Our merchandise market also experienced strong growth, led by our metals and construction franchise, which was up
13%, followed by chemicals, up 7%, and agriculture at 5%. Volume growth of 9,000 units in coal was primarily from
increases in the utility sector, which were offset by decreases in our export traffic.
Turning to the next slide, focusing on our individual market segments, starting with coal, coal revenue was up $46
million, or 7%, which was our first quarterly revenue increase in coal since 2011. This gain was led by our Southern
utility business, which grew by 23%, partially offset by a 3% decline in Northern utility volume. Utility coal demand
has improved as a result of higher natural gas prices and stockpile replenishment coming out of the harsh winter.
Eastern utility stockpiles remain down by 18% compared to December 2013 levels.
In the export market segment, volumes were down 13%, as thermal supply competition remains very strong in Europe.
The API 2 index to Western Europe is currently in the $70 range, pushing U.S. thermal coals out of the market. Export
metallurgical coal is also being impacted by weak seaborne pricing and strong Australian competition.
In our domestic metallurgical coal market, we saw a 7% decline in volume compared to the second quarter of last year,
as the steel market remains over-supplied and we experienced the impact of two plant closures in Canada. Finally,
industrial coal volumes increased by a strong 24%, due primarily to new business gains.
Now let's turn to intermodal. Intermodal revenue in the quarter increased by $62 million, or 11%, to $650 million,
which is an all-time high record for this high-growth business segment. International shipments grew by 16% due to
strong general market expansion, new projects, and advanced shipments ahead of the ILWU labor contract negotiations
at West Coast ports.
The increase in our domestic volumes continues to be driven by highway conversions across all of our business
segments. We are seeing organic growth in our large key accounts as well as increased use of intermodal by recently
acquired premium and truckload customers.
Our targeted corridor initiatives, which we've discussed with you in the past, coupled with associated infrastructure
improvements made over the past 10 years, are providing the necessary tools to grow our business efficiently and
profitably, and we're continuing to work on increased velocity and performance across this best-in-class intermodal
network.
On slide seven, we focus on our merchandise markets, which in the quarter increased by $132 million, or 8%, to $1.7
billion. Metals and construction led this growth, with 13% more volume generated by higher volumes of frac sand
shipments to the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions, growth in imported slabs through our East Coast ports, and also
increased coil steel due to continued strength in the automotive sector.

The 5% gain we saw in agriculture was driven by year-over-year improvement in shipments of corn due to increased
demand in processing, primarily for ethanol production. Additionally, expanded export activity led to higher volumes
of soybeans and wheat.
In our chemical franchise, we continue to see increases in crude by rail, natural gas liquids, and other chemical
commodities used in the growing automotive and housing markets. Automotive car supply constraints across the North
American network moderated automotive volumes in the quarter, but as shown on the chart, our automotive volumes
increased by 3% in the quarter despite these challenges.
Lastly, volume within our paper, clay, and forest products group was down 1% for the quarter, due primarily to the
impact of the recent closure of an International Paper mill in northern Alabama. On a positive note, these declines were
largely offset by continued strength in the wood products markets for both lumber and woodchips.
Now let's conclude with our outlook for the balance of 2014. We remain optimistic that we will continue to generate
growth across most of our business units. Utility coal shipments are expected to be up throughout the rest of the year,
as gas prices remain elevated and stockpiles are replenished, but overall coal volumes will be tempered by weaker
export met and thermal coal market conditions, along with lower domestic met coal shipments.
Turning to intermodal, as truck capacity tightens, we anticipate continued volume growth and pricing opportunity in
our domestic network. For example, in our rail-owned domestic container segment, we successfully increased transcon
rates 4% on June 1, and we'll be taking a 3% increase on our local EMP freight effective September 1.
These two business segments together represent 17% of our total domestic intermodal book. We also expect continued
volume increases in our international intermodal business, but we expect the pace of growth in this sector to moderate
somewhat in the second half.
In our merchandise businesses, we expect growth across most market segments. In chemicals, crude by rail continues to
be strong. Last year, as you'll recall, we handled approximately 75,000 carloads of crude oil, and we expect our
full-year 2014 volume to be well in excess of 100,000 carloads, with substantial opportunity for continued growth in
2015. And natural gas-related commodities such as frac sand and liquid petroleum gasses are expected to continue to
increase as well.
In metals, U.S. steel production is projected to increase 3% for this year, and we continue to see growth across most of
these markets. In automotive, our automotive volume should continue to improve as car supply becomes more fluid and
production increases by over 4% this year. In our agricultural markets, favorable growing conditions for another robust
soybean and corn crop should lead to strong year-over-year gains ahead.
Lastly, with housing starts expected to grow by 15% this year, we expect continuing volume increases in
housing-related commodities, such as plastics for carpet, soda ash going into the manufacturing of glass, steel for
appliances, synthetic gypsum for wallboard, and in asphalt and aggregates for paving.
In summary, to wrap it up, we expect continued volume and revenue growth ahead across most of our intermodal and
merchandise market segments and in utility coal in the second half. With respect to our yield management plan, as
we've shared with you in the past, we remain committed to providing improved service to our customers that supports
our ability to price to market at levels that equal or exceed rail inflation and which supports further investments in our
network.
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the mic over to Mark for his comments on our operations. Mark?
Mark D. Manion
Okay. Thank you, Don. Well, the second quarter operations were definitely affected by the very positive traffic growth.
On the heels of a difficult operating environment in the first quarter, the higher volumes presented a new set of
challenges for our operations and slowed our progress in returning the network to targeted service levels and network
velocity.

However, it did demonstrate that we have a physical capacity in the network for further growth. It also pointed out that,
going forward, we need to find ways to respond more quickly to changing market forces, particularly with respect to
train and engine employees.
Turning to slide two for a review of safety performance, we saw solid improvement in the second quarter. Reportable
personal injuries dropped to 0.88. For the first six months, the injury ratio stands at 1.19. Furthermore, our serious
injury rate has not increased. We also saw improvement in the rate of train incidents in the second quarter, down to two
incidents per million train miles. For the first six months, the train incident rate is 2.3 per million train miles. Crossing
accident rates were up slightly, to 3.8 per million train miles, for both the second quarter and the first half of the year.
As illustrated on slide three, our composite service metric improved modestly, from 73.4% in the first quarter to 74.5%
in the second quarter, but remains well below the high service levels of 2012 and 2013. For the first six months, the
service composite was 74%.
Our network has remained very fluid, with no significant bottlenecks due to physical constraints. However, service
performance and network velocity remain below targeted levels due to a crew base that was planned for lower traffic
volumes. Based on recent business growth trends and an updated business outlook, we've stepped up hiring and training
in order to align T&E forces with expected volumes.
Looking at employment for the total company during the second quarter, we had about 900 fewer employees versus the
full-year 2013 average. With the additional T&E hiring, we expect that we will ramp back up to the 2013 employment
level by the end of 2014. Train speed showed similar trends, and for the very same reasons. In the second quarter, train
speed fell to 21.8 miles an hour. For the first six months of 2014, train speed was 22.1 miles per hour.
In addition to the efforts in crew hiring, we also pressed on locomotive availability. Not only did we have all of our
surge fleet deployed, but we also stepped up repair activity to increase the total number of available locomotives. As
Marta will discuss with you, this resulted in higher costs, but it was well worth it to assist in the recovery.
This point is illustrated by our next slide of our dwell times. As you know, terminal dwell is the second major
component of network velocity, and it improved by 6%, from 25 hours in the first quarter to 23.4 hours in the second
quarter. Terminal dwell remains above the high performance levels of the last couple of years and will also improve
over coming months with improved crew availability.
Moving to the next slide, with a volume increase of 8% in the second quarter, crew starts actually declined by 1%. This
margin of difference is, in part, due to conserving crews through train combinations and train annulments. However, we
would still see a very positive margin even with a more robust crew base. Our current crew base is clearly stretched,
which is reflected in higher overtime hours and increased re-crews, up 20% and 23%, respectively, for the second
quarter compared to the same period last year.
With the hiring plans I outlined, network velocity will improve over the coming months, and we'll see that
improvement reflected in further improvements in operating efficiencies, particularly reductions in overtime and
re-crews. Higher volumes were largely absorbed with the existing train operation, resulting in a 4% improvement in
carloads per locomotive. Our fuel utilization was also favorable, as gallons per 1,000 gross ton-miles declined by 4%
compared to the same period last year.
Thank you. And I'd like to take just a minute to recognize all of our operating department employees. The first and
second quarters presented very different but very difficult operating challenges. As always, our people rise to meet
every challenge. That's the Norfolk Southern spirit.
And, Marta, now I'll turn it over to you.

Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at how all of that strong volume translated into
second quarter financial results. As shown on slide two, and as Wick and Don already mentioned, our operating results
were strong. Railway operating revenues of over $3 billion rose $240 million, or 9%, versus 2013, while operating
expenses increased only $57 million, or 3%. This improved leverage resulted in a best-ever quarterly operating ratio of
66.5%.
The next slide shows the major components of the $57 million net increase in railway operating expenses, which, as
you can see, was largely concentrated in materials and other and in fuel. Now let's take a closer look at each of these
variances.
The materials and other category increased by $35 million, or 16%. About $20 million of this was due to higher
casualties and other claims, as the prior year had a large favorable personal injury adjustment. In addition, about $10
million of the increase is related to higher material usage, primarily for locomotive repairs. As Mark discussed, our
surge fleet is fully deployed. As you would imagine, those locomotives typically require more maintenance.
In addition we had some spill-over of locomotive work related to weather issues from the first quarter. With the
anticipated demand that Don described, we plan to continue to use those older locomotives in the second half of the
year. Therefore, you can expect a similarly elevated level of material spending. As displayed on the following slide, the
$17 million or 4% increase in fuel expense was almost entirely due to higher consumption. Gallons used were up 4%
on the 8% increase in traffic volume.
Next, depreciation expense rose by $12 million, or 5%, reflective of our larger capital base. As shown on the left-hand
side of the slide, our fixed assets before depreciation are $1.3 billion higher than this time last year. Slide seven
addresses the $4 million or 1% rise in purchased services and rent. Most of this increase was due to higher
volume-related costs – in particular, equipment rents, joint facilities, and intermodal terminal costs. Somewhat
offsetting these volumetric increases were lower professional service fees as well as lower expenses associated with the
shared assets areas.
Slide eight details the $11 million or 2% decrease in compensation and benefit costs. As we previously discussed, the
first quarter amendment to our retiree medical plan, along with strong equity returns in 2013 and a lower discount rate,
resulted in a decline of about $40 million in post-retirement medical and pension accruals. In addition, health and
welfare benefit costs were slightly lower for the quarter.
Partly offsetting these declines were higher incentive compensation, increased pay rates, and increased overtime. The
higher incentive comp was due to bonus accruals related to the strong operating results as well as to higher stock-based
compensation. Overtime increased by $9 million and was mostly incurred in two areas of our workforce: employees
who operate our trains and employees who repair equipment, principally locomotives.
We expect a somewhat elevated level of overtime for the remainder of the year. As Mark described, we have already
hired and will be continuing to hire train and engine employees, so the overtime in that area should gradually moderate
as the employees become qualified.
Slide nine depicts our second quarter income from operations. With revenues up 9% and expenses up just 3%, the
operating margin expanded by 22%, and exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the company's history.
Turning to our non-operating items, both categories were $11 million unfavorable for the quarter. Other income net
declined by 38%, due primarily to reduced coal royalties associated with lower coal production. And interest expense
on debt was up 9% due to last year's debt issuance. Slide 11 shows our bottom-line results, with record quarterly net
income of $562 million, up 21% compared with 2013, and diluted earnings per share of $1.79, up 23% versus last year.
Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 12, cash from operations for the first six months was $1.4 billion,
covering capital spending and producing $628 million in free cash flow. Although capital spending year-to-date is
somewhat behind last year's pace, we still continue to project full-year CapEx of $2.2 billion. Within this total amount,
we have reallocated resources to acquire some used locomotives and to enhance capacity.

With respect to stockholder returns, we repurchased $100 million of our shares and paid $335 million in dividends.
These dividends reflect the $0.54-per-share amount paid in the first and second quarters. As Wick mentioned, our board
yesterday raised the dividend rate to $0.57 per share, a 6% increase, which will begin with our September dividend
payment.
Thank you. And I'll now turn the program back to Wick.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thanks very much, Marta. Well, as you've heard, we were obviously very pleased with our second quarter results.
Clearly, there is still work to be done in terms of improving our network velocity and service levels, and we have a
solid plan in place along with a great operating team to do just that. But even with that slower velocity, I am very proud
of the way that our team kept our costs in check, even in the face of a volume surge the magnitude of which, quite
frankly, none of us saw coming.
Looking ahead, as you heard from Don, while we still have some questions around coal, and particularly export coal,
we continue to see strong fundamentals in most of our businesses. Looking even more broadly, we believe that the U.S.
economy will continue to recover at a reasonable although not robust level for the balance of this year and next, which
should also help us to continue our upward momentum.
There are some question marks on the regulatory front, most immediately concerning the transportation of crude oil,
but I remain convinced that the U.S. rail system can transport crude oil safely and that the regulators understand and
believe that as well, and that they will not issue rules which will seriously diminish our ability to do so.
I'll close by repeating again our core strategy at Norfolk Southern, which is to focus on delivering superior
transportation service to our customers in the most efficient and effective way possible at prices which reflect the value
of that service in the marketplace, and thereby deliver superior returns to our shareholders. We have the franchise and
the team to execute this strategy, and our second quarter results offer proof that we're on the right track.
Thanks, and I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wick, I wanted to follow up on the last
comment that you made with respect to crude-by-rail regulation. We've recently been hearing some chatter, actually,
that the DOT and PHMSA [Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration] might put out, potentially even as
soon as today or tomorrow, rules not only concerning the tank cars but also the speed limits, and some of the numbers
that we've heard are a limit of 25 miles per hour. I know that the industry has talked about 40 being the lowest that you
could do, but let's just say that the scenario is 25, what happens? And how would the industry respond? Would you stop
moving crude altogether or substantially decrease what you're moving?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Allison, it's a good question, and we obviously do expect to see very shortly the
regulators put out a notice of a proposed rule. There's a lot of speculation about what might be in that proposal, but
there will then be the opportunity for all of us to discuss it before they come up with a final regulation. And obviously,
speeds in the range that you mentioned, 25 or 30 miles an hour, would be extraordinarily disruptive to our rail network,
not only to trying to ship crude, in which the exposure, quite frankly, would go up significantly because it would take a
lot more trains and cars to move the same amount of oil, but it would be incredibly detrimental to the service in all of
the rest of our business, including Amtrak, including our auto business, our intermodal business, you name it. And the

resulting capacity loss, I think, is something that the rail network, quite frankly, could not manage.
So we have done a lot of modeling, we have had a lot of discussion with the regulators, and I believe that we'll be able
to make our case that a minimum speed in the 40- to 45-mile-an-hour range is not only safe, which it is, but also is the
range in which it will not be extraordinarily disruptive to the North American rail network.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay, so potentially we could see the proposed rule come out with something more onerous
than you guys would like, but there is an opportunity to go back and revisit that.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: There is clearly in the process – it will be a proposal, and there will be, as I said, a
comment period and a period for the rail industry to present evidence, and we will have compelling evidence that any
significant speed restriction would be, in fact, disruptive to the point of almost shutting down the North American rail
network.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay, that's great color. And just a follow-up question, I guess, turning to coal. Is it safe to
say that the rate concessions on the export side are largely behind us, or should we expect further rate cuts just as prices
continue to be weak globally? And at what point does it become uneconomical to continue making these downward
adjustments, and maybe instead you start reallocating some resources elsewhere since you're seeing growth across the
business?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Allison. This is Don. We believe, as long as metallurgical coal prices in the
world market remain in the $120 level – and they've been stable at the $120 level now for a couple of quarters – our
export pricing is at the bottom, and it's going to remain flat in the third quarter based on that. I will tell you, thermal
API 2 pricing into Western Europe has deteriorated further. We do not plan to try to follow that coal or incent the coal
with transportation pricing because, frankly, the delta is too wide for us to make much of a difference in that market.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay, great. Thank you so much for the time.

Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Good morning. Thank you. Can you elaborate on what your core pricing growth was in the
second quarter?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We don't comment on what our core pricing results were. I will tell you that we're pleased to
advise that it was in excess of our rail inflation rate. And as we pointed out in the revenue-per-unit review in my
remarks, we were pleased to see the results in our coal business with revenue per unit being up 5%, our merchandise
business up 2%, and our intermodal business, even with last year – or even though our international business volume
was up 16%, double the domestic rate of growth. And as you know, our domestic intermodal has about a third higher
revenue per unit than our international business, based on international containers moving. So we were very pleased
with our pricing results in the quarter.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Okay. That's great, thank you. And then to what extent could you comment a little bit more about
the coal pricing, on the domestic utility coal versus the export side? Would you be able to elaborate in terms of the
trends we've seen in the second quarter, and particularly for the export coal?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Our trend in export coal in the second quarter was essentially flat with the first quarter. As I
mentioned in the previous question, we don't see that moving now. We're pretty much at the bottom of the market, and
we don't have plans for any appreciable movement downward in our export market rates at this point. In the utility
market, I will tell you that most of our gain in RPU, revenue per unit, was attributed to longer-haul coal that's
originating in the Illinois Basin and the Northern Appalachia and Pittsburgh 8 seam, moving to our Southern utilities.
That business was up 23% in the quarter, and our business in the north was down 3%. So we had a very favorable

Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks, morning, guys. So, Don, just to follow up on that last point about the coal yields,
do you expect that mix of much better growth to Southern utilities relative to north – do you think that mix continues?
Is that a long-term trend, or is this something that's choppy and maybe not so sustainable?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Scott. It's a good question, and we're seeing a continued conversion of utility
coal from Central Appalachia, with higher cost of production, to the Illinois Basin and to Northern Appalachia. And I
will share with you, in the second quarter, our origination percentages. We were 34% Central App, 31% Northern App.
We're within three percentage points of Northern App now equaling Central App, which has been our traditional source
of thermal coal. But the notable change was that the Illinois Basin in the second quarter was now 19% of our thermal
originations, which is three percentage points higher than the PRB originations coming to our network now, at 16%. So
we're seeing Illinois Basin growth take place, and we're certainly seeing Northern Appalachia growth take place, both
into the Southeast. We expect that trend to continue.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: And is there something about why it's more going to the Southeast than the Northeast, and that
should continue?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, the Southeastern stockpiles are at a level that they're being replenished coming off of
winter. We expect that replenishment to continue in the second half of 2014. And also, higher natural gas prices have
created a situation where thermal coal is dispatching at a higher rate in the South than it did this time last year.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay, great. And then just second question, when we were hearing about adding more people,
but hopefully overtime and things like that come down and service gets better, net-net, should that mix change – should
that be good for operating margins and incremental margins in the back half of the year? You typically see earnings
improve in the back half, and just want to understand, should that continue this year.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: This is Marta, Scott. The overtime was about half and half occurred in the T&E and
non-T&E area. So the effect of the hirings that Mark described will reduce and moderate as the year goes on and these
folks get qualified, will reduce the T&E overtime. We expect the non-T&E overtime to continue right about this level
through the end of the year.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yes, Scott, this is Wick. I would say too that, overall, we know and we've done a lot
of analysis that tells us that as network velocity improves, our costs come out. And our expectation is that over some
period of time through the second half and into next year, as that network velocity increases, even with the additional
employees in T&E, our overall cost structure should benefit from it.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay, so ultimately a good thing. Okay. All right, thanks a lot for the time, guys.

Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi, there. Good morning. Don, can I ask you to comment a little bit on some of the things you

higher pricing for the rails simply to handle this demand, to try to create, if you will, some elasticity, of which I know
there's very little? And along those lines, how much is service a limiter on what you can do on price?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Bill. I'll take the first part first, first part of the question first. We are seeing
truckload capacity tighten. We've seen that trend take place now over the past 15 to 18 months, and it certainly is
continuing to open up opportunities for us to improve our pricing for intermodal, where you know we still have a
differential of 12% to 15% generally between intermodal prices and truckload prices.
A good example of that is what I mentioned in my remarks, looking ahead, of us taking a 4% increase on our originated
business going west on transcontinental, and a 3% increase effective September 1 on our local EMP business as well.
And that's 17% of our domestic book of intermodal, which I think is indicative, it illustrates the movement that's
beginning to take place on pricing in intermodal. We don't see any change or reversal in truckload capacity as long as
the economic trends continue to move upward, and so we expect a more favorable pricing environment ahead. And you
will see us take more selective increases ahead with that.
Now, with respect to the second part on service, as Wick mentioned and as Mark mentioned, none of us are satisfied
with our service levels at this point. We are working very closely with all of our customers to work through any
concerns and issues until we can get our service back to where we expect it and where our customers expect it. But I
will tell you that, with double-digit growth in most of our corridors – including Crescent Corridor and Heartland – in
the quarter, service has not been an impediment to us handling our international business or continuing to have a
successful track record of converting highway freight to rail.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay, very good. Wick, can I ask you one other question, and that is, you probably saw the BN
agreement with SMART on possibly moving to one-man crews, if ratified, on areas where they have PTC in place. Do
you think that this is a possible game-changer for the industry? I know PTC is far from operable, but as we get there, is
this something we need to keep in the back of our minds?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We certainly have seen that agreement. We're trying right now internally to work
through all of the economics of that agreement to see what kind of impact something like that would have at Norfolk
Southern. It's clearly a sea-change agreement, but I think we're a long way from understanding how the economics play
out. And as you say, it's PTC-contingent, and our best guess right now on when PTC is actually operational across the
entire North American rail network is approaching 2020. So, is it interesting? Yes. Could it be significant? Yes. Does it
have any immediate impact? I don't see that.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay, that's great. Thank you for the time.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe question for you, Mark, on the velocity side, just
looking as you move through the second quarter and clearly there was – well, volume growth, I should say, coming out
of the winter – but as you saw the quarter progress, it seemed like some of those metrics maybe deteriorated a little bit
towards the end of the quarter. We've seen a recent bounce back here, but just want to get a rough sense of when we
think we can start to see some more material improvement there. And should we be focused on that? Is that something
we need to be considering as we look for those metrics to improve and ultimately continue to drive what were very,
very strong incremental margins in the quarter?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah, Chris, realistically, as we go through the third quarter, there's going to continue to be a
lot of pressure on the operation. We see a lot of volume. Third quarter is always a robust quarter anyway, and it looks
like this one certainly is going to be. So we are going to stay up against it, we're not going to see additional crews that
are coming into the operation in the third quarter. We will put some additional locomotive power against it as we go

into the third quarter. We are continuing – as we have been, we continue to march forward with improvements from
additional infrastructure projects, and they are very helpful; they have made a world of difference, and we're certainly
seeing that play out now. So we're going to hold our own, but we're not going to see a tremendous amount of
improvement during the course of the third quarter.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate the color. And then, Don, just a follow-up on the question
before, as you talked about the changing mix in Southern utilities, taking coal from different originations, and
ultimately have it playing out through the business, can you just give us an update on where Southern and Northern
utility stockpiles rest relative to historical or multiyear averages? I just want to get a rough sense of have we played this
catch-up, or how much is left to go into the second half of the year.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Chris, you may recall that back in the first quarter, after we came through the so-called polar
vortex winter at the end of our first quarter, we shared a number that the stockpiles in our network had come down by
about one-third. We estimate now that we've worked off a portion of that reduction, but they're still down about 18%
compared to December when we went into the weather. And gas prices are still trending in an area of – they're about
$3.80, $3.90, Illinois Basin coal, PRB coal, and Northern App coal will dispatch at those prices. So stockpiles have not
been replenished, there's still some work to be done, and as long as gas prices are in the range that they're at today or
higher, we'll see utility coal demand in the South and hopefully in the North pick up as well.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. And those stockpiles are relatively balanced between Northern and Southern utilities?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We see a little more opportunity right now in the South than we do the North. But I will tell
you that it's not much difference, and as you know, our utility volume is about 50/50 split between the North and the
South.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.

Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Good morning, gentlemen. The first question is going focus on the intermodal side of things.
Obviously, we've seen you take some of the prices up on some of your book of business, but I think you mentioned it
was 17% of your domestic book. Can you talk to us about what percentage is more of your domestic book that you
might be taking up in the near future? Like, can you just do an across-the-board tariff increase on some other segments
of your business? Are there any larger contracts that are rolling over this year?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No, we have contracts in place with intermodal, and we cannot do an across-the-board
increase. What we will have to do is time those increases when the contracts make available the opportunity to do that.
Quite a bit of our business is priced year-to-year, so as we get through this calendar year that will open up additional
opportunities for our partners in the intermodal market to take up pricing as well. So this is a good start with our
rail-controlled containers, our EMP containers, taking the 4% westbound on transcon, the 3% coming September 1
within local. You will see us take more, but it will be incrementally as contracts open up and give us the opportunity to
do that...
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: So this seems like more of a 2015 event then.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah, in those contracts, I would point out that we do have escalators that apply until we get
to the point where we can take a market-based increase.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. And a follow-up is related to crude by rail. When you're looking at the safety statistics,
and I know that part of the focus on this release is going to be on some of the train speeds, but of the accidents that
we've seen across the rail networks that have been highly publicized, how many were actually due to excessive train

Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Congrats on pretty solid results and record operating ratio, great to
see that it continues. Just a thought, Mark, on the capacity here, you're almost running at 2006 peak levels on a carload
basis. You mentioned how much you're up – or Wick did, I guess, year-over-year. So you mentioned your thoughts on
your ability to recover velocity with employees and adding the crews on. What about CapEx? Do you need to increase
that? Is this a physical capacity that you're starting to bump up against? Or I guess can you talk about what your
thoughts are, and maybe, Don, your thoughts on throwing in there on the Crescent and Heartland if you're starting to
see the ramp-up on the capacity there as well?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: It has been very interesting to see how well we have digested the additional freight volume
from an infrastructure standpoint. And we just have not had bottleneck situations. And like I've commented some in the
past on these calls, it is the more than ten years' worth now of continual infrastructure improvement that just – it takes
place on an ongoing basis, and there are a variety of projects that are loaded up in the pipeline, and they keep coming
out. We've got more that will be completed and more that will be started this half.
So we're trying to stay ahead of it, and so far, we are staying ahead of it. We've got our modeling and our capability,
based on traffic forecasts, to see where the next tight spots will be, and that's when we put the infrastructure projects up
against them, and that process has been working well. And so we're going to keep doing what we're doing. And we've
got a major project I think you're aware of, coming out later this year. It'll be in the fourth quarter, when we have our
Bellevue expansion that opens up, and that is going to be very helpful as far as lightening any capacity constraints up in
our Northern areas. So that's the way we're looking at it.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Ken, I would add – this is Don – I would add, too, that when you look at the composition of
our growth in the quarter, for example, out of our 145,000 loads, 95,000 units were intermodal. And we've done a lot of
work to densify our double-stack operations, get the right box on the right car, and that helps us manage capacity much
more effectively. We're not adding trains in intermodal to handle the 95,000 additional units that we handled in the
quarter. So that de facto is additional capacity.
And with respect to the corridors, the Crescent Corridor, I mentioned double-digit growth earlier – Crescent was up
11% in the quarter, Heartland was up 10%, Meridian was up 15% – and because of what I just mentioned, we are not
running into capacity issues at all in those corridors. As I also mentioned in my remarks, we've made the investments
over a multiyear period in those corridors, with speed enhancements and terminal operations, new terminals, and
frankly, we're positioned for growth and we're planning for growth.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Appreciate the insight. And then, secondly, on your strong free cash flow, I guess
two parts to that: one, we saw the dividend increase, why not more engaging on the share buyback given your large
authorization, and maybe, Marta, your thoughts on that? And then also I think, Marta, you mentioned you're buying
used locomotives. Are there any available out there, given everybody's using surge capacity, and does that mean
maintenance could go up even higher, I guess, given that these are the bottom-of-the-barrel ones that are left in the
market if they're not already being on the network?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, with respect to the locomotives, yes, what I mentioned was that we'd reallocated
within the capital budget some of the funds towards used locomotives this year, and our mechanical folks have
inspected those, and luckily, we have the Juniata shop and they can refurbish those. And so we feel that we're in a very

good position to be able to acquire those. And those are small pockets of locomotives here and there that our
purchasing folks can find and our mechanical folks inspect and know that we can repair adequately at Juniata. Before
this reallocation, we already had 75 new locomotives that we're buying this year; 25 have come in, and 50 will come in
the back half of the year. And that's one of the reasons why our capital spending is back-end-loaded this year, because
those 50 will be coming in in the last six months.
So, with respect to your free cash flow question, you are correct, we're having very strong free cash flow. Wick talked
about the increased dividend. We have the strong capital spending this year. We have been forecasting for the next two
or three years we're going to have heavy capital spending, as we have some freight car purchases that are going to be
timed in the next couple of years. And so we feel that the share repurchase level that we have is appropriate, given the
free cash flow, given the capital that we feel is needed to reinvest in the system and which has good returns. And really,
overlaying it all too is that the entire stock market is high, and so we have in the past moderated our share repurchases
when the stock market is high.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Well, good morning, everyone, and congrats as well. Wick, can I just ask you –
we've seen several quarters now of pretty robust margin expansion, I think driven by some pretty good cost outcomes.
You're getting the growth outside of coal. And I realize we still have some questions going forward in your coal
markets, but I think the big issue for investors in your stock is can this company sustainably grow earnings even with a
segment like coal down, let's say, in 2015, if that were the case? Do you feel like you have the confidence that you're at
a point where it doesn't necessarily matter what one commodity segment is doing on your network; you have a robust
enough franchise now that you can maintain earnings momentum and margin expansion as long as the macro-economy
is cooperating?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I think the overall answer to that is, certainly, yes. We have some work to do, as
we've discussed extensively, in terms of continuing to improve productivity and efficiency from the levels we're
currently at. We're going to do that. I think that that's going to give us the ability to continue to drive more volume
through the network in a very cost-effective manner and give us strong operating margins, operating leverage on that
growth. I think that the only caveat – and you mentioned it as well – is that we're going to have growth – we see
strength in a lot of our businesses, as we've all discussed, and Don has really worked through the details with you.
I think the only question mark about coal is it's still a significant amount of our business, and I know, Brandon, you're
aware and everyone on the phone is, of how much coal revenue we have lost over the past two to three years, I guess in
excess or at least close to $1 billion over a two-year period. If we see stability in that market – and there're certainly
lots of signs, particularly in the utility world, that we are seeing stability now – I think we're poised to do very well. If
something unforeseen comes along in the coal world, or in the overall macro-economy, then clearly we'll have
challenges too. But given the conditions that we're seeing today, we continue to see have a very positive outlook for our
company in the next – certainly in the second half, and I think in 2015 as well.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Well, I appreciate that, Wick. And, Don, maybe as a follow-up, beyond intermodal,
because I know you talked about rate increases this summer, but because of the constraints that we're seeing across the
system – not just at Norfolk, but it seems like some other carriers are at capacity as well on the rail side – are we
moving into a higher rate of price inflation for this industry?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Brandon, we always try to price to market, and we think the truckload market will continue to
tighten, and that will support pricing with anything that's related to the truckload activity. The rest of the business, we'll
just have to stay tuned and see how the market moves. We're going to stay close to that market, and we will price to

that and ensure that our yields meet our target of equaling or exceeding rail inflation going forward.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Brandon, let me – and to everyone – let me say one other thing. I think that we talk
about capacity in the transportation marketplace, but Don always points out that there's truckload capacity, and that's
one marketplace. But we have a very different set of dynamics in utility coal, where the competition's not with the
highway; it's more and more with the gas and different coal sourcing. You look at the energy markets; the competition
there has a very different set of factors, which aren't necessarily all driven just by what we see in the transportation
marketplace. So every marketplace that we're in is different, has different dynamics, and as Don always says, we take
that into account and try to price effectively in that particular marketplace.

Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Just following up on that last question, we've heard some of your
competitors up north talking about more about yield management programs, and in fact coming up with tight capacity
in the rail system, and in effect looking at kind of pruning some of the lower-returned customers. Is that something that
you foresee that, perhaps without really rate increases per se, but rather reallocating capacity to higher-returning
customers, is that something that is new to your organization – is it an opportunity that is emerging for Norfolk
Southern? Is it something that you see playing out in the next year or two?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Walter. This is Don. We plan to continue to improve our service product to
serve all of our customers. We do not have plans to segment business that would deviate from that overall objective. So
I would say that our commitment to our customers is very strong, and that's to provide a good, reliable service at a fair
price.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. And second question, here, Wick, you mentioned in your opening remarks that the
second quarter saw some volume that perhaps unsustainable for the rest of the year, and I think a lot of the questions
today were zeroing in on the fact that you typically do better in the third quarter than you do in the second, and you had
a very good quarter this second quarter. So I guess what I'm trying to understand is, was there any carryover volume
from first quarter to second quarter that really helped you drive some good operating productivity that probably won't
carry into third, as Mark had indicated with some of the higher employee count? Or is the incremental margin here that
you're getting on this volume steady through third quarter mean that the seasonal pattern of you doing better in the third
quarter than the second quarter can hold again here again this year?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, first of all, in terms of first quarter carryover, we've looked really hard at that
question, and quite frankly, as the second quarter went on, we became more and more convinced that there was very
little of that. There has been some pent-up demand in the automotive network, with vehicles stored at assembly plants
because of the slowdown of the North American rail network and the car supply problems for the automotive industry.
We've had a big push on in the past three or four weeks, and Mark and his team have done a great job on our network
of bringing those numbers down significantly.
I think the tenor of my remarks begin with is that we certainly didn't forecast an 8% year-over-year volume growth.
And we saw a lot of strength across a lot of businesses. We continue to see that strength. I was just, I guess, trying to
temper my own enthusiasm and say I'm not sure we're going to see the third quarter up 8% year-over-year or the fourth
quarter. We had a good second half last year. But we do expect to see continuing strength in these businesses.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. Well, it was very much a good quarter. Congratulations. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long of Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to first follow up on an earlier question in
intermodal. So, intermodal growth has really started to accelerate. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit
more about how much runway you still have to add to train lengths. How long can the high-single-digit or-low
double-digit intermodal volume growth continue without adding additional train starts?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Mark, do you want to...?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah, let me just lead off with a comment about that, Don. Our intermodal train length is in
the neighborhood of 6,000 feet. And so when we look at our high-density corridors as far as where we handle
intermodal, we can handle significantly more than 6,000 feet; 8,000 at a minimum, and in a lot of cases we run over
10,000 feet. So there's still a lot of room to grow in that area.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay, great. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, I was wondering, in coal, do you have any major
contracts in that business that are coming up for renewal over the next couple of quarters or so?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Justin, I will tell you that we have some opportunities that will be coming over the next three
quarters, and we're optimistic that those opportunities will bear fruit, but we're not there yet.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Hey, good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Mark, I think you mentioned that
you were planning on adding roughly 900 new folks throughout the remainder of 2014 to bring the manpower level up
to roughly where it was in 2013. Are all those people coming off furlough? Do they need complete training, partial
training? How long does it take to bring them up to speed and how expensive is that process?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: We have earlier this year – we began bringing people out of furlough. We were pretty
successful in getting more people than usual to actually make some transfers from the location they were furloughed to
other locations where they were needed. That process is complete, and going forward, the additional people we bring
on are new hires that go through our training program, and we'll essentially see the first of those people coming out
qualified in the fourth quarter.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Okay. Thank you. Perhaps another question on the reallocation that occurred in the capital
budget, maybe for Marta, it sounded as if some money was reallocated towards the purchase of used locomotives that
could be remanufactured at Juniata, and there were some bottleneck elimination projects perhaps in there as well. What
projects did you draw that capital from, and what was the thought process behind perhaps paring back the spending in
that area?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, some of those areas were naturally delayed, frankly, because of the weather in the first
quarter. Our engineering forces were busy with the weather, and so there was a little bit of – when you schedule out
their work for the rest of the year, a little bit flopped over into 2015. So some of it occurred naturally, both in
engineering, and some of it also in the mechanical area, there was some car work that is going to flop over into 2015.
So the total amount that we reallocated is about $40 million; about two-thirds of it to used locomotives and about a
third of it to very targeted, very specific locations that came out of that model Mark described, about very small pinch

Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Don, when I'm thinking about the
intermodal pricing opportunity – you'd highlighted the 17% – if I'm thinking about that remaining 83%, I know you
said basically over a full year the majority of that comes up, whether it's a rebid or it's just an escalator embedded in the
contract. Can you give us a sense what percentage is going to be repricing in the back half of this year with a new
contract as opposed to an escalator?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Rob, I will tell you that the EMP fleet, the rail-owned or rail-controlled containers that I
referenced with respect to the increases we're taking locally and westbound, that will be most of the increases we're
taking in intermodal for the second half, unless we're taking an increase in an existing contract with an escalator that
triggers quarterly or triggers annually within the second quarter.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then with regard to the Ag outlook, I think your words
were either strong or robust in terms of the back half of the year. How should we be thinking about that in terms of the
third quarter/fourth quarter? Because I realize they're puts and takes with your network.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah, with respect to the third quarter, we'll see the new crops start to come in late August,
early September. So it will be into that timeframe before you see it. We still see a lot of volume activity associated with
the 2013 crop, which was strong as well. So we see opportunities ahead in corn and soybeans, predominantly with this
new crop. There's over 90 million acres of corn planted and over 80 million acres of soybeans planted, and growing
conditions are very good because they're getting the proper rainfall. So we expect export activity to be there and some
other domestic opportunities as well.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: And we should think about that rippling through your ethanol franchise as well, I would
imagine.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, the ethanol production – ethanol prices and ethanol demand continues to trend upward.
So we see opportunity ahead for greater activity in ethanol and inbound corn for processing to make the ethanol.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Thanks so much for the time.

The next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. Good morning. If I'm reading the data correctly, it appears you improved RTM
per fuel gallon pretty nicely over the prior-year period, almost 5%. As we think about the sustainability of the quarter's
low operating ratio and the importance of fuel in the cost structure, maybe you could comment, is this an idiosyncratic
period as far as fuel economy, or this this just another data point on the overall improvement trend line?

Page 17 of 21
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I think the way we would look at it, and the way we do look at it, is that it is just a
data point on a trend line, but it's trend line that we expect to continue to get better over time. We have a lot of
technology out there that we're employing to reduce fuel usage. That's ramping up nicely. We still have a ways to go
with that, the LEADER technology, but it's employed across more and more of the railroad. And our goal is to drive, on
an average, the fuel usage per ton-mile down. We're always going to see seasonal variations. We certainly saw that in
the first quarter. Particularly with the very cold weather, you have to leave diesel locomotives idling, you run shorter
trains, and you do a lot of things. But we think it's – obviously, this quarter is a good productivity improvement, and we
expect overall to see our fuel usage go down in the future as our technology gets better and better.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. And for a second question, I'd like to ask a little bit about the intermodal volume
increase. I know it's a phenomenon that probably occurred later in the quarter, but could you comment on what portion
of the volume increase you believe resulted from customers concerned with West Coast disruption risk? And sort of
related to that, does the summer's intermodal volume trend give any insight into your expectations concerning volume
that may result from the completion of the Panama Canal project? Thanks.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We have difficulty identifying the portion of the 16% increase in international that was
directly attributable to the ILWU contract negotiation. We know it was present. We've been told by customers that they
were making some secondary arrangements, some contingency plans. So part of our increase, of that 16%, we know
came from that. But, frankly, we've also been seeing an ongoing trend of conversion of international shipments in our
network from the West Coast ports to East Coast ports of entry with all-water services. So we know that's a part of it.
Plus, I have to remind you too that the inland port that we opened in partnership with the Port of Charleston had a very
good quarter. That's in that higher number, plus we had a couple of new accounts in that quarter as well. So it's a
combination of all of those things.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Okay, any insight on Panama yet, or too early?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: On the Panama Canal, our view – and of course our view is going to be basically predicated
by what our customers decide to do. And our customers are the steamship lines and the beneficial cargo owners that are
working with the steamship lines. But they're telling us that they don't see, at this point in time, a pronounced impact
when the canal opens, most likely now in 2016, because of so much activity that's already beginning to take place
through the Suez Canal with larger vessels coming to the East Coast ports and as the freight originations in Asia
continue to shift away from China and go southward toward Malaysia and Vietnam, et cetera. So we're being told at
this point not to expect a significant shift in business when the canal opens. We just have to wait and see. And of course
we're staying close to our customers, who will make the ultimate decision of how they want to move their cargos.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Great. Thank you for the comments.

Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much, and thank you for taking my question. Congratulations. The quarter
looked fantastic.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Marta, I want to come back to the question Ken Hoexter asked on cash flow. I heard what
you said: you have the debt coming up in September; I think it's about $430 million, give or take. I guess the question I
have is your cash balances are up almost $1 billion from where they were a year ago. Working capital, the whole
increase has been cash. Even with the higher level of cap spend and some of the projects coming on and the debt
payout, you still look to be cash flow-neutral. I hear you that the stock's up a lot with the market, but is there a better
use ultimately – or reason to have $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion of cash sitting on the books?

<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, we do have that now, you are correct. We don't believe we're going to end the year at
that. As you had pointed out, we have that $430 million debt maturity in September, and we now currently plan to pay
that off, so that's going to be a use of the cash. And also, as I explained earlier, we have higher CapEx in the second
half of the year. So we do not expect to end the year at this high of a cash level.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. But even with all that, it still looks like you're going to finish close to $1.2 billion,
$1.3 billion. That is above the normal amount of cash you hold. Is there a 2015 project that you're thinking about?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, you are correct that that's above what our historical norm where we run cash. 2015
will have the heavy CapEx. We also hope that it's going to have the very strong free cash flow which will support that.
And so I think what we're trying to do is just maintain our discipline, keep an eye on the market, and be ready to take
advantage of any volatility that arises.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. Enough said. Thank you very much.

Our next question is from the line of Don Broughton of Avondale Partners. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Thank you for taking my question. I just want to strategically get your outlook on this.
Both you and CSX have certainly seen strong demand. At least in your system, in the short term, you've proven to be
much more resilient than they have. After reporting a multi-quarter performance with high volumes, lower head count,
I'm hearing a prediction of higher overtime in this second half. But you also had a strong safety performance. So when
you're looking at this, do you look at as this is an opportunity to further leverage your assets in infrastructure with the
existing head count or just slightly higher, or do you think there's a greater opportunity in just materially growing head
count and using the service disparity to gain real volume, real market share?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, Don, that's an excellent question. The one clarification I'd make is what I think
we expect in terms of overtime is just to see overtime rates year-over-year – certainly in the third quarter – dollars
continue to be higher. But that, I will also point out, is in contrast to in 2012 and 2013, we drove overtime way down
compared to prior years. So we think we have the capability and we'll do that again. I think it goes back to what Don
talked about, is that we have done a lot of analysis across our railroad which has really proved to us that maintaining a
high network velocity, albeit it may take more resources in some way – it's certainly going to require some more crews,
as Mark pointed out – ultimately gives us a lower total cost structure and a more efficient operation, and in addition, it
gives customers the service that we want to give them.
So when we see our network running at the levels that it is today, we know it's still efficient – and you've seen the
numbers – and we think that we need to still bring on the resources, drive the velocity up, give the customers that
service. That's going to give Don and his folks more ability to go out and get more business. It's going to allow them to
go out and charge fair prices in the marketplace for that. And it's going to give us a better cost structure.
And Mark reminds me that we said at the beginning of the year that we had a number of productivity improvements
underway, and that we estimated at the time that that would take about $100 million out of our cost structure, and we
still think we're going to achieve that number this year. So we think we've got a good strategy, but it's a service- and
velocity-based strategy, and it's paid off for us in the past, and it'll continue to pay off for us.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: So your comments about overtime are really more of a reflex back towards what's more
normal after making the kind of significant productivity and velocity gains you've posted recently, is what you're trying
to say, if I hear you right.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yeah, go ahead, Marta.

<A - Marta R. Stewart>: The overtime that we think we're going to have for the rest of the year is very targeted where
we think it's going to occur. So let's split it into the two pieces.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Right.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: On the T&E side, which is about half of it, we think, because of the need to train these
people, as one of the other people asked about, that those are not going to be qualified until the fourth quarter, many of
those new people. And so we don't expect the T&E overtime to decline until the fourth quarter, but we do expect it to
decline. On the other side is our shop employees, generally speaking, and most of that is being incurred on taking care
of the older and now the used locomotives. So on that side, we are not projecting to significantly ramp up the number
of employees because that is more of a shorter term in nature.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Temporal.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Exactly.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: That makes much more sense. Thank you.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: So that portion of the workforce will stay on overtime, but the T&E will work its way back
to straight time as the people get qualified.
<Q - Donald A. Broughton>: Thank you. And I'll look forward to seeing you next week.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you. Look forward to it.

Our next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein Investment Research. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Thanks for taking the question. Marta, just to step back from the short-term use of the
cash and think more about the longer term, you mentioned a step-up in equipment car replacement. Is that something
that you think could push the capital spending above that 18% to 19% of sales that we've been seeing the last couple
years?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: For that, that 18% to 19% of revenue is an elevated level for us. I think we've signaled
within the last year that we think we're going to stay at that elevated level for at least two more years, largely because
of the car replacement needs. And longer-term – and, of course, PTC is elevating that too. So, right now, trailing 12
months, our $2.2 billion is at 19%, 2% of that is PTC. So when you back that out and get to 17%, and when you get
past the next two years, we are targeting after that to get back more in the historical range of 16%, 17% of revenue.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: And given Wick's comments around PTC maybe extending into 2020, would that 2%
continue to linger, or is this going to be more front-end-loaded?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Yeah, we'll have to see how that plays out.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right. Thanks. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up on intermodal, Don, you
mentioned the escalators that are in the contracts. Would you have expected them to maybe deliver a little bit more on
the wholesale contracts from a pricing perspective, given the spike in truck rates? Or could you talk a little bit about
how that ladder mechanism should work so that we can try to gauge the opportunity going forward?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The escalators in our intermodal contracts would be more correlated to the rail cost
adjustment factors, all-inclusive less fuel, which is an independent factor from motor carrier cost. So those escalators
are not tied to truckload pricing in general.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: So you haven't tied the intermodal pricing to your retailers to the truck rate?

Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Cleo Zagrean of Macquarie. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Good morning and thank you. In the opening remarks, you mentioned that you're looking to
price equal or above rail inflation. Can you help us understand how you think about pricing a portfolio – how you
manage a portfolio on pricing versus margins? Are these areas where you're only able to price in line with inflation
benefiting from more slack capacity such that margins and returns across the portfolio are even? I would appreciate any
insight into that.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Cleo, good morning. With respect to our pricing philosophy, again, we look at the market
segments, and we try to maintain a direct correlation with our yield management plan and the various market segments
that we're participating in, and that runs the range of conditions, from truckload capacity to barge capacity, conditions
in barges, the availability of barges to a lesser degree than truckload, and then rail-to-rail competition. And then of
course we always have an ongoing change in the mix of our business, so when you're looking at revenue per unit of our
book, it will be an ongoing change in that book based on things like the longer haul of coal that's taking place today in
utility coal, the fact that, for example, in this quarter we had no liquidated damages on coal, so the revenue of coal has
no LDs in that. So does that get at the essence of your question?
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: I guess I was trying to make sure that we keep our eyes on the right metric in terms of the bottom
line and do not get overly concerned if some mix issues at the top line could point to a deterioration. Is there any reason
of concern for you that in some pockets you're only pricing in line with inflation versus, say, maybe other roads are
trying to price consistently above?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You're making a very good point, and we look at the overall margin and incremental margin
of the business, the book, taking into account the price and mix. And we don't become concerned with mix changes.
They are what they are. And we manage through that, and that doesn't impact or alter the yield management or pricing
plan.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you. And my follow-up is also in regards to a comment you made in the opening remarks
that from the experience so far this year, you have learned about new ways to adjust your resources to respond to
changes in demand. Can you help us understand whether some of the changes that you are making should help with the
long-term progression in margins once we're out of this congestion, any sustainable benefit from the changes in the
network and investments that you are making spurred by this experience that maybe would lift your long-term
efficiency goals or bring them sooner? Thank you.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Obviously, anytime we not only experience a high-volume-growth quarter like this
one, but certainly the quarter like the first quarter with the network disruptions across the North American rail network
that we've seen, we try to go back and see what learnings we can take from them. I think to Mark's point about we have
to think, again, about our train and engine service resources and how we are able to respond to unanticipated growth,
we're going to go back and, I think, learn some lessons from that.
And I think what you will see as a result is that over some period of time, we will become more efficient, because when
we see something like the situation we've had in the second quarter, we'll be able to react more effectively to it and
hopefully not lose network velocity or see increased overtime because we'll have responded with the resources in a
more flexible way. But there's a lot of learning to be had out of all of these experiences, and we're always looking at
