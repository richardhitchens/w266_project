MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Caterpillar First Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] We will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation.
It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.
Michael L. DeWalt
Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's
Vice President of Strategic Services. On the call today I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman;
and our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.
This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without
our express written consent is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the
Investor section of our caterpillar.com website, and it will be in the section labeled Results Webcast.
This morning we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that
could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of those
factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can
be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, which is risk factors, of our Form 10-K that we filed with the
SEC in February of 2014. And it's also in the forward-looking statements language in today's release.

In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can also be found in today's release, which has also been posted on
our website at caterpillar.com.
Now before I get into the details, I should also mention that we made organizational changes that went into effect at the
start of 2014. Responsibility for paving, forestry, industrial and waste, and tunnel boring products moved from
Resource Industries and you'll find it in the financial release today in our All Other Operating Segment line.
In addition, responsibility for some work tools was moved from Resource Industries to Construction Industries and the
responsibility for administration of three wholly-owned dealers in Japan moved from Construction Industries and it's
also in the All Other Operating Segments in today's release.
We also reclassified restructuring costs for 2013. We moved it from segment profit to corporate items and we did that
to be consistent with how we're presenting 2014.
The most significant impact of these changes on our reportable segments was for Resource Industries, and to put that in
context, for the full year of 2013, that reorganization moved about $1.5 billion of sales from Resource Industries but it
had very little impact on profit for Resource Industries; in fact, only about $10 million for the full year. Now after these
changes, the vast majority of Resource Industries sales are related to mining and coring aggregates.
We put a Q&A on this morning's release on the re-org. It's Q&A number seven on Page 17 and it includes a quarterly
breakdown of the impact for Resource Industries.
Now we also changed the name of our Power Systems segment to Energy & Transportation. We did that to better
reflect what the segment actually does and we made the changes before our Analyst Meeting at CONEXPO last March,
but if you missed it, Power Systems is now Energy & Transportation.
Okay. Let's get into first quarter results. At $13.2 billion, sales and revenues were flat with the first quarter of 2013 and
were pretty close to what we expected. Profit was $1.61 a share excluding restructuring costs and $1.44 including
restructuring costs. The restructuring costs were $149 million or about $0.17 a share. Most of the $149 million was
related to the previously announced restructuring of our Gosselies, Belgium manufacturing facility.
Now to better compare results to the first quarter of 2013, the remainder of my discussion on the quarter will be
excluding restructuring charges. The profit of $1.61 excluding restructuring was $0.29 a share higher than the first
quarter of 2013. While in the aggregate, sales were unchanged from last year, if you look at our three large segments,
there were very different stories and I'll cover each one.
The most positive was Construction Industries and it was up 20% from the first quarter of last year, and in fact, this
quarter it was our largest segment by sales, which were over $5 billion and up more than $800 million from first quarter
of last year. They were up about 36% in North America, 20% in Europe-Africa-Middle East, up about 10% in
Asia-Pacific, and were almost flat in Latin America.
Now to understand what happened in Construction Industries sales you do need to consider dealer inventory. It was a
big part of why sales were relatively weak last year. Normally, during the first quarter of each year, dealers buy more
from us than they deliver to customers, and they build inventory for the second quarter – we call it the selling season.
And that means that for dealer deliveries to end users, the second quarter is usually the highest quarter of the year.
Now that inventory build didn't happen for Construction last year and that's because dealers ended 2012 with sufficient
inventory of construction equipment and their inventories during the first quarter remained pretty flat a year ago. This
year that wasn't the case, and dealers reverted to the more usual seasonal pattern and built inventory in the first quarter
for sales in the second-quarter selling season.
Now, in addition to the dealer inventory impact, end user demand also increased versus the first quarter of last year,
and you may have seen that in our release of dealer statistics yesterday where dealer deliveries for the first three months
of 2014 were up 9% for Construction Industries. Bottom line for Construction Industries: demand is better for
construction and we believe dealer inventories are in pretty good shape relative to seasonal needs. Okay. That's
construction.

For Energy & Transportation, sales were up about 8% in the quarter. Remember, Energy & Transportation is made up
and serves several industries: oil and gas, power generation, transportation and industrial, and oil and gas, power gen
and industrial were all up a bit more than the 8% average that Energy & Transportation was up as a whole.
Transportation-related sales were about flat versus the first quarter of last year. Energy & Transportation has been a
stable performer over the past year and that certainly continued in the first quarter.
Moving on to Resource Industries, which again is principally Mining. That's a different story. Sales were down 37%
from the first quarter of 2013 and most of the decline was end user demand, which again, you can see in the retail
statistics that we released yesterday, where deliveries of new equipment were down 46% in the first quarter versus the
same period a year ago.
The decline we're seeing in the mining industry began in mid-2012 and it's continued, and the business declined
throughout last year. And because of that, the first quarter of 2013 was last year's highest sales for Resource Industries
and it came down from there. So that's making it a particularly tough sales comparison for us Q1 to Q1.
For Resource Industries, order rates for new equipment have remained weak in the first quarter and substantially below
the peaks of 2012. That's the bad news. The good news is that we were close to an equilibrium of order rates and sales
in the first quarter and as a result, the order backlog for Resource Industries was fairly close to being flat with year-end
2013.
So in summary on sales, Construction Industries up, Energy & Transportation up and Resource Industries down quite a
bit, sales overall as a result, flat. But while sales were flat, profit was up. In general, it was a pretty good story across
each of our three large segments and I think because of that it makes sense to talk about profit this quarter by segment.
And I'll start with Construction Industries which had a great quarter, with operating profit up $460 million on a sales
increase of $845 million.
I think there are three things to cover with Construction Industries. One, you have to go back to last year. Think about
the first quarter of last year. Our sales and production were relatively low, and partly that's because we and our dealers
started 2013 with probably too much inventory. And in the first quarter of last year, most of the factories that we have
that make construction equipment were at least partially idle. This year we were producing more and with our factories
producing more, we were doing it more efficiently. Related to that, inventory reductions from last year resulted in
negative inventory absorption impacts on profit, and this year, that was much, much less.
Second thing about Construction Industries profit, we've continued to focus on managing costs and we were able to
hold our period costs – those are costs that are relatively fixed. We've held them flat with last year despite a pretty
significant increase in production volume.
And the third thing about Construction profit was currency, and currency impact versus a year ago was positive for us
and mostly related to the yen. And remember, we are a net yen exporter. We're a Japanese manufacturer. So all-in-all,
profit for Construction Industries in the first quarter was the best since the second quarter of 2012.
Let's move on to Energy & Transportation, which had another good quarter, with operating profit rising $236 million
on a sales increase of $371 million. And that resulted in operating profit as a percent of sales being up from the first
quarter of last year. Now, the increase in our profit dollars was primarily due to higher sales volume, lower
manufacturing costs and price realization for Energy & Transportation was slightly favorable.
Now when you think about Energy & Transportation and profit over the course of 2013, it's probably worth noting that
the first quarter last year was the weakest profit quarter of 2013 and Energy & Transportation margins improved over
the last three quarters of the year. And the operating margin rate in the first quarter of 2014, this quarter, was
reasonably in line with the last three quarters of 2013. Thankfully, it's a diverse business. It's been a consistent
performer over the past year and that includes this quarter.
Let's turn to our Resource Industries. Operating profit for Resource Industries, and again that's predominantly Mining,
was down substantially versus the first quarter. Operating profit declined $310 million on a sales decline of $1.2
billion. That's the bad news.

The good news is the decremental margin rate, that's the change in margin divided by the change in sales, was a mere
25%. And that's a demonstration, in our view, of good cost management in a business with variable margin rates that
are much higher than 25%. Resource Industries has made substantial progress on reducing costs as demand has
declined. Operating margin as a percent of sales is now mid-single digits, but for a capital-intensive business where
demand has been hit this hard, we think that's pretty good performance.
It's a business where sales of its most significant product, mining trucks, are expected to be down this year about 80%
from the peak year of 2012. To be even profitable in an environment like this demonstrates the success they've had in
managing costs.
That's operating profit. Let's turn to the outlook for 2014. Now, in our year-end financial release from January, we
provided an outlook for 2014 sales and profit. We said we expect sales and revenues to be similar to 2013 at about $56
billion and we put that in the range of plus or minus 5%. We said then that there were encouraging signs in the world
economy and that we were expecting sales improvements in Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation. And
that's still the case.
Our outlook in January expected Construction and Energy & Transportation to be up about 5%. And that's still the case
for Energy & Transportation. However, we increased our view of Construction from up 5% to up 10%. However, in
our original outlook, we expected sales to be down in our Resource Industries segment by about 10%. In this outlook,
we've reduced that forecast and now expect it to be down about 20% from 2013.
Despite the prospects for a better year in the world economy and continued strong production at mines, mining orders
for new equipment haven't really improved and remain at pretty low levels. Order rates are a fraction of where they
were in 2011 and during the first half of 2012 and are substantially below where we believe the long-term sustainable
level is.
Our outlook from January expected mining orders for 2014 to remain low but be modestly better than the second half
of 2013. So far this year, that hasn't happened. And based on where we are today, even if we started to see some
improvement in orders, it likely wouldn't be soon enough to have much impact on 2014 and that's why we lowered the
Resource Industries outlook today. That's the bad news.
The good news is new mining equipment sales in our outlook are low enough that we believe the downside risk for
2014 in our outlook related to Resource Industries is reasonably limited. That doesn't mean that it couldn't go down
further, it just means that the sales of new equipment for mining are so low in the outlook that even if there's no
improvement in order rates at all, the downside in the scheme of things is limited.
So overall our outlook for sales and revenues remains $56 billion in a range of plus or minus 5%. There's certainly
potential it could be higher than $56 billion if the economic activity around the world accelerates or if mining orders
increase meaningfully in the short term. But there's also plenty of downside risk that could cause it to be below $56
billion.
A couple of examples include geopolitical. While we're hopeful that the situation in Russia and the Ukraine will be
resolved, if it does get worse and has an impact on business confidence, world trade and world growth, it could
certainly be a negative for us. And we're closely watching growth rates in China. We had a good first quarter in China.
In fact, company sales were up 30%. But we're concerned that if economic growth in China slows enough, it could
have an impact on our business. Those are two good reasons why we have a 5% plus/minus range around our $56
billion sales outlook.
Now in terms of the profit outlook, on the strength of our great first quarter results we raised our full-year operating
profit by $0.25 a share. Excluding restructuring costs, our profit outlook moved from $5.85 to $6.10. And with
restructuring charges or costs, it moved from $5.30 to $5.55 a share. Now, our overall expectations for restructuring
costs in 2014 remains at about $400 million to $500 million with a mid-point impact on profit-per-share of about $0.17.
To help you think about the rest of the year, there's one more thing I'd like to cover in the outlook and that's how we
think the rest of the year could shake out by quarter. Of the three remaining quarters of 2014, of course that's Q2, Q3,

Q4, we would expect of those three, the fourth quarter will be the highest for sales and profit. We think the third quarter
will likely be the weakest and that the second quarter will be slightly below the average of Q2, Q3 and Q4 in terms of
sales and profit. I hope that helps you calibrate your expectations for 2014.
One last point before we move to the Q&A. We had a good quarter for operating cash flow. We were up from $1.1
billion in the first quarter of last year to $1.9 billion in the first quarter of this year. Our balance sheet remains strong,
with a debt-to-capital ratio for Machinery and Energy & Transportation of near 30%.
And during the first quarter we repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of stock, and over the last four quarters, we've
repurchased about $3.7 billion. In January, the board authorized a new five-year program to repurchase an additional
$10 billion of stock. And while we've not announced additional repurchase for this year, as we move through 2014
we'll certainly continue to review our options for cash deployment.
So that's a rundown of the quarter and the outlook. With that, we're ready to move on to Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ted Grace. Please announce your affiliation and pose
your question.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Hi. Susquehanna. Hey, guys. Congratulations on the quarter.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Thank you.
<Q - Ted Grace>: I was hoping, Mike, maybe you could walk through, specific to Construction Industries, how
production kind of progressed through 1Q and how you would encourage us to think about production in Construction
Industries in the second quarter. I realize you gave that quarterly guidance, and that in itself is helpful on a consolidated
basis, but could you maybe just help us understand how production and cost absorption work through 1Q and how you
would encourage us to think about 2Q?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, we actually stretched it a little farther than we normally do on guidance for the rest
of the year, so I'm going to be a little hesitant on breaking it out even further. But what I can tell you is this. If you just
think about how it's changed over the course of the past year, as we came into 2013 a year ago, we were cutting our
inventory, our PDC finished inventory, and dealers would normally add inventory in the first quarter and they didn't do
that.
So our production a year ago was pretty low for Construction. And if you look at the first quarter of this year, dealers
built inventory as is kind of the normal pattern. And as a result of that and us not making as substantial reductions to
PDC inventory, our production went up a lot. Our production was up more in the first quarter than sales.
I think if you look forward for the rest of the year, you can kind of do the math on this a little bit based on us saying
sales up 10% for Construction over the course of the year. The rest of the year, for Construction Industries' sales, will
be probably not massively different from the first quarter. So probably not wide variations in production because of the
sales numbers, the first quarter was not far off of being a fourth of the year.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Okay. That's helpful. The second thing I was hoping to ask is, on the restructuring side, just an
update on where things stand in Europe specific to Belgium and then in the press release it seemed like you may have
cited more potential restructuring benefits in the year. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: We certainly weren't trying to signal more restructuring benefits in the year. I think
Gosselies restructuring is coming along about as we expected. We got approval in the first quarter from the local
officials. I was expecting maybe a question on why the entire $300 million that we were expecting for the year wasn't
in the first quarter and that's because we'll be recognizing the expense related to that as we get specifics on the

individuals that have accepted the offer, so that'll probably come in through the course of the year.
Now I would say if you look at all the restructuring activity that we have done over the course of the past year, one of
the places you can see it is actually in employment. If you think about this, our sales in the first quarter of this year
were about the same as the first quarter of last year and if you look at the employment schedule in our quarterly release
today on flat sales, our employment levels are down, I think, 8,000 to 9,000 people. And I think that's where you can
see the impact of not just lower volume but also some of the restructuring activities we've taken.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Okay. That's really helpful. Best of luck this quarter, guys.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Please announce your affiliation and pose
your question.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Hi. Good morning. It's Jefferies. And I had a question about the revision in your outlook
and I guess I'm wondering maybe two parts. On the Construction business, what and where are you seeing the
improvement that gives you the visibility on the 5% improvement on the top line you talked about, Mike? And then on
the resource side I'm curious. You talked about the OE being pretty limited at this point but can you just discuss a little
bit about what you're seeing on the aftermarket side and whether that's still declining? It sounds like it is but what's the
outlook there?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: So a couple of things. One, with Construction, I think the one area, geographic area that I
would say has had the most upside for us is actually North America and you can kind of see that in the retail statistics
that we've provided. It's doing pretty good. I'd say North America is the reason for the upside.
On Resource Industries, on your comment, specifically aftermarket, in our release today, we did say that versus the first
quarter of last year within Resource Industries, parts sales were lower than a year ago and that's true. But they came
down over the course of last year. If you look at parts sales within Resource Industries over the last few quarters it's
been stable. It's not down like it was from Q1. So it fell during last year, it's held pretty stable over the last couple of
quarters and we're hopeful that at some point in time it'll start to pick up. It seems like it should.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Okay. And then just a quick follow up. I guess pricing in both of those segments was a
little bit weak, a little bit negative. Should we worry about that? What's the outlook there?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: We're not really expecting much price at all this year. When we came into the year we said
I think less than half 0.5%, if memory serves me, which is, in the scheme of things for us, pretty small. I think that if
you look at the four quarters of last year, actually pricing levels were probably, in those businesses, a little better in the
first quarter than they were for the rest of the year. So it was a little bit of a tougher comp for us. There's certainly
pricing pressure out in the marketplace and that's why we're not expecting much for the year. But overall, our view on
pricing by and large hasn't changed much from when we came into the year.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Thank you very much.

<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Can we talk little bit – when you talked about Construction Industries you sort of, in your
commentary you basically said that the rest of the year, volume went up radically, off of – from the first quarter. Can
you talk about the profitability of the sector for the rest of the year? You had a very impressive first quarter for lots of
reasons. I assume you're expecting double-digit operating margin in the sector but not quite up to the first quarter level.
Is that a fair representation of what to expect the rest of the year?
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yeah, Eli. This is Brad Halverson. It's a good question. What I would say is that we're
extremely happy with the profitability of the Construction Industries. We had an operating margin of around 5% in our
core product line. If you look back a year, we finished the fourth quarter at 9.9%. We like this business to be double
digits. We did have good mix, some positive things happened in the first quarter they gave us a record return for the
Construction business at 13.6%. I would say an expectation for the rest of the year, slightly above a double digit
number would be a good estimate and we think that's good profitability for where this business is at right now.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Yeah, Eli. It's Doug Oberhelman here. I would just add, comment on the pull-through
objectives we've had going back a number of years of 25% on the additional $1 of revenue. And while we did much
better than that in Construction and Energy & Transport this quarter, I would expect that over time, 25% is our
objective.
So we'll have some quarters that are juicy like this one and maybe some that aren't so juicy, I guess. But overall, we're
after that, and as Mike said in his comments, even our Resource business on the way down held with 25%. So I'm
pretty happy with that but I'd steer it that way an answer to your question, and if it comes up better than that, great, but
there'll be quarters when we'll be talking about the other side of that.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Yeah, and along the same lines, when you look at Energy & Transportation with the first
quarter volume up 8% and the year up 5%, we're talking maybe slower top line growth but I assume that we're
expecting better product mix for the rest of the year that will enhance the profitability to match last year's numbers. Is
that the expectation that we should look at in that sector?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, Eli. That segment serves a bunch of different industries that have different profitably
characteristics. So in any quarter that you get into you're subject to a little up and down on margin. Based on whether
the increase is oil and gas or industrial engines, they have a different margin profile.
If you look at what Energy & Transportation has done over the last four quarters, the margin rate has been within a
relatively tight band and I don't think our view for the rest of the year would have it being dramatically at one side or
the other of that. So it's been a consistent performer and I think our view of the rest of the year is that it will continue to
be a consistent performer.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Yeah, and one final question. Talk a bit about what we should expect out of the finance
company this year given the changes in the first quarter, versus the first quarter.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yeah, Eli. This is Brad Halverson. The financial products division has continued to
perform very well. Their profit was down compared to the first quarter of last year; but in the first quarter of 2013 we
had a positive adjustment to due to improved warranty, improved quality, and we have a Cat Insurance business in Cat
Financial so we had, I think it was roughly $40 million positive adjustment in the first quarter. So their results
quarter-over-quarter are slightly up. Their portfolio is growing slightly. Their past dues at the end of the first quarter
were, I think, the record in the last 10 years or so and so their portfolio is performing well. I think you can expect,
similar to Energy & Transportation, pretty good stable performance out of them the rest of the year.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation then pose your
question.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Hey. Good morning. It's RBC. I'm just trying to reconcile the comment about Construction on
the aftermarket sales being flattish in the quarter. If demand is really improving, wouldn't you expect to see an increase
in aftermarket sales for the Construction business?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: I think aftermarket for the Construction business, for any business, is usually related to
activity. And it was pretty flat for the first quarter versus a year ago. Aftermarket is not quite as, maybe relative to the
total, as significant as it might be in industries like mining. As activity goes up, as construction spending goes up, as
housing starts go up, you would think that would as well. It might have something to do a little bit, Seth, with a
particularly bad winter. That might have put a little damper on actually work being done. Other than that, I don't know
of any big reasons why it should be off that pattern.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Okay, thanks. And then I guess a similar question on the resource business. Are customers still
idling equipment or bleeding off of parts inventory? We are starting to get the sense that some commodity production
volumes are rising, like U.S. coal. So can you give us a sense for where you think your customers stand on their parts
inventory levels and how soon do you think we could see a pick-up in that business?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: I don't know about the inventory levels. But, again, if you look sequentially what's gone on
over the last three months, it's not continued to go down. It's remained pretty stable over the last three quarters,
actually. I think as activity goes up, we would fully expect parts sales to go up. There's a pretty strong relationship.
Customers can only put off maintenance or cannibalize idle equipment or idle the oldest equipment for so long before
that begins to catch up with you and the dynamics of a business that's pretty tough on equipment starts to come
through. So I think at some point here we would think that it would pick up.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Okay. But do you get the sense that the idling is still occurring then?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, I think there's definitely still some parked fleets. It's not the same everywhere in the
world. I think I won't quote a number, but, yeah, there's definitely still parked fleets.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jerry Revich. Please announce your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Good morning. It's Goldman Sachs.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Good morning, Jerry.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Mike, you had nearly a 10% SG&A and R&D reduction on flat sales this quarter. Can you talk
about is there something in the comparable period, or is that consistent with your expectations for the year? And then
the restructuring actions in resources on the manufacturing side came over the course of last year. And I'm just
wondering how far along in harvesting those savings are we at the first quarter compared to the ultimate run rate?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Jerry, this is Mike. I'll start this. We had a very good first quarter. Costs were lower than a
year ago. But I think we also were very cautious coming into the year. We purposefully tried to slow – even what we
have in the hopper for program spending over the course of the year, we tried as much as we could to be very cautious
on spending even what we'd planned to do for the first quarter. And so I think that's helped.
And as some of those programs that we want to do because they're the right thing for the long-term but we've been
cautious on in the first quarter, I think there will be some increase in spending over the remainder of the year for
programs like that. That's why if you look at the profitability in our outlook for the next three quarters, that's one of the

reasons why it's down a little bit relative to Q1.
But, again, I'll go back to a comment that I made earlier, this was actually a total company question, that we've taken a
lot of costs out since the first quarter of last year. And I think if you look at the employment numbers and particularly
because this quarter was a quarter that had almost dead flat sales, I think it really brings home the magnitude of the
actions that we've taken to adjust the cost base to the current volume situation.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: And I might add – this is Brad Halverson, we're really happy with the quality of our
earnings. We're focused on the business model, we're growing share, a little price, and we're really focused on lean
deployments across the enterprise, both in our factories and in the office. And so we had increased short-term incentive
pay expense in the first quarter, which we're happy about, going to our employees based on our performance. It was
roughly $140 million. So we had roughly $500 million of period cost reduction for us. And so with a Mining businesses
that's contributing just a little over $100 million that used to contribute $1 billion, that will come back, and where cost
structure is, we're going to continue to focus on this but we're happy with where we're at.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Thank you. And then could you talk about what you're seeing in Western Europe for
Construction and Energy & Transportation? I know you're concerned about Eastern Europe, but it sounds like cement
volumes are finally starting to pick up and maybe operating hours are starting to improve. I'm wondering if you could
just touch on if you're seeing a pick-up in demand off of low levels in Western Europe across your businesses?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Well, I was just looking at the Construction numbers this morning. And if you look at our
first quarter, actually Construction in Europe was positive, it wasn't negative. So, yeah, I think it's not as robust as what
we're seeing in North America. But I think it's probably a little bit of a case where the economic situation there doesn't
seem quite so dire and I think the environment for customers to do some machine replacements is probably a little bit
better and we're seeing some positives in our Construction numbers in Europe in general.
<Q - Jerry D. Revich>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steven Fisher. Please announce your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Great, thanks. Good morning. It's UBS.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Just trying to get a sense of the growth rate of the segments that you moved to the All Other
category as it compares to the Core Mining business. If you didn't do the re-class, would Mining still have been down
20% or for the year would it have been more or less than that? Because I guess if the stuff you moved into All Other is
not quite as bad, then the reduction in guidance might not be as severe.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: So what we moved last year was – for the full year anyway, it was $1.5 billion. It's the kind
of product that would more closely – in most cases, more closely follow Construction, Paving for example. Forestry
has a relationship, say, with Housing Construction. So it would have been a year-over-year – at least year-over-year,
first quarter-to-first quarter, it would have been a little bit positive. So it was – it's a different profile than Mining. I
haven't – honestly, I haven't looked at that level of detail in the outlook, but it wouldn't surprise me what you say is to
some small degree true. The difference though, is that it's a smaller portion. It was a relatively small portion of
Resource Industries, so I don't think the impact would've been that on the percent change, the 10% to 20%. I don't think
it would have been massively significant to that. But it certainly wouldn't have been down 20%, it would've been likely
up.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Okay. And then to get to that minus-20% from minus-37% in Q1 in Resources, are you
assuming any year-over-year growth at all, or just kind of significant moderation to the decline?

<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: When you say year-over-year growth, explain a little bit more, Steve.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Just because you have to do better than the minus 37% in the balance [indiscernible] (41:29)
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Oh, yes. Sorry about that.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: That's just a rate that's well below the 20%, or can you actually see something that's up
year-over-year?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, I think as we go through the year you'll see that gap narrow. I wouldn't want to be so
specific as to say that fourth quarter it's up or down. But if you just think about the trajectory of last year, it started out
stronger. I mean, there were orders that were being produced and shipped and sales were higher, and it declined as you
went through the year. I think the fourth quarter, if memory serves me right, for Resource Industries was about 20%
below the first quarter. So I think if we get any kind of a modest improvement going through this year, it'll narrow that
gap. So I would think that year-over-year gap would come down probably in every quarter.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question today is from Andrew Casey. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: Good morning. Wells Fargo.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Morning, Andy.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: I just wanted to go back to the profitability for the rest of 2014 and make sure I understand
the puts and takes. Should I think about the slower margin improvement relative to what you posted at Q1 as driven
really by three things, more difficult Energy & Transport comps, fairly good-sized headwind from higher incentive
comp, and then fading head count benefit? Are those the three main things?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: No, I wouldn't say – no, I don't think so. I don't think Energy & Transportation is going to
be materially different probably than the first quarter. So what we're thinking about here, Andy, is the second or the last
nine months of the year versus the first quarter. I think the way to think about it is, we usually have seasonally low
costs in the first quarter. We would approve programs that our units can spend money on during the year, but it usually
takes a little time for that to ramp up so first quarter is usually light on cost, fourth quarter is usually a little heavy. So
we would see program-related costs going up.
Incentive comp that you mentioned is up year-over-year, but we have that in the first quarter too so I don't think there's
– there's not a material – there's no difference really between the first quarter and the rest of the year for that.
Depreciation usually kind of ramps up as we go through the year. As we put capital in place it goes up. We have things
like our annual merit plan is effective April 1, so we get a bit of a bump up in labor costs, usually from Q2 on. I think
another point, and Brad mentioned this earlier, and that's margins in Construction Industries. I think relative to the first
quarter, Construction Industry mix is going to probably get a little bit worse. More of the rest of the year we would
have smaller product. We expect some rental reload to occur kind of over the course of the year, more than we had the
first quarter. First quarter was a little more excavation-focused, particularly in China, so probably a little bit of a
declining mix in Construction as we go through the year.
Then for Resource Industries there are programs that we cut last year, things that we really want to do for the long term.
Engineering around getting our components and what was Bucyrus product, getting all the hundreds of thousands of
part numbers into our system for aftermarket. That all requires some spending. We delayed it last year, and as we go
through the course of this year, those are programs that we want to spend money on, they're the right thing to do for the
long term, the rest of our business is pretty stable and we kind of need to get to it.

So I think those are the kinds of things that caused profit over the course of the last three months of the year to be
maybe a bit below the first quarter.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: Okay. Thanks for that, Mike. And then if we go back – thanks for the clarity but it makes
me a little more cloudy in my thinking about how to get to the Q4 being the highest of the last three quarters. Is there
anything unusual that you're building into that quarterly comment? I'm wondering if there's any...
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: No. No. The fourth quarter for us usually is a big sales quarter. It's usually right up there
with – sometimes the second quarter can be higher than it but in general, the fourth quarter is usually seasonally a
pretty high quarter. The third quarter and the first quarter are usually the weakest, so of the last three, the third quarter
would be the weakest, and we think the second quarter is probably close to but a little bit below the average of the
three.
We don't really have anything unique, any big, strange expenses. When I talk about these numbers, by the way, I'm
excluding restructuring costs because the timing of that could have a different effect and of course that's why we've
pulled it out. But no, we don't have anything that off the top of my head that I can think of that is going to be odd about
any quarter. It might turn out to be that way but certainly we're not planning it that way.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: Okay. Thanks. I'll follow up offline.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Hi. JPMorgan. Actually, my first question is for Doug, if he's still in the room. Doug, it was
interesting to me that you mentioned Ukraine, Russia and also China as potentially headwinds, but you didn't mention
Latin America and in particular, Brazil. Are you not concerned about the macro environment in Brazil or is that
something you've been planning for all year and so incrementally, it's not getting any worse than you might have
anticipated?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I would put Brazil's macro situation as one of those we would be watching. I would
not put it in the same category as the others that I talked about, China, Ukraine, and maybe a couple of others in the
Middle East, at all. We've got a pretty stable business across Latin America. Brazil has got some projects that are
coming in that will be doing some things around infrastructure this year, next year and the year after that ought to help
that but the overall macro situation there is one to watch, frankly.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Okay. That's helpful, the color. And then can one of you talk about, where does Tier 4 pricing
show up your numbers? Is that in the pricing bucket? Or is that not included because it's separate pricing? I'm just
trying to get a sense of net pricing. Are you giving away the Tier 4 costs and is that impacting margins or are Tier 4
prices being passed through but not incorporated into pricing? If you could just give us some color on what's going on
with Tier 4 pricing and whether you're actually getting pricing.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, so it's not included in our price realization bucket in our kind of waterfall chart in the
release and that's because the content is different. If you're going to add, for example, say after-treatment and you're
going to raise the price for that, there are kind of two ways that you could deal with that. You could say hey I have a
price increase and I have a cost increase. We think that kind of distorts what's really going on. The content of the
machine is changing. It's a different machine.
So the way we deal with it is we net the content cost changes with the specific, in this case Tier 4 related price changes,
and we would just show the net of the two in the price realization number. I think there's a generic comment I would
say where we're not giving away Tier 4. I think it's been a pretty successful introduction. The price increases that have
gone in for Tier 4 generically were meant to cover the additional costs and a reasonable margin, and I think by and
large that's happening.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Gilardi. Please announce your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Good morning. Thank you. Bank of America. I just had a couple questions. From your backlog
commentary, it sounds like Power Systems backlog is up fairly sharply due to locomotives, in the other part of your
press release you mentioned that well service activity is picking up. You don't sound worried about oil and gas CapEx.
Natural gas prices have rebounded. Why aren't you raising your Power Systems outlook today?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Well, a lot of those things we had in our original outlook. I think we were probably, maybe
in January, what we were seeing in terms of quoting activity, deals in place with customers, our expectations haven't
really changed all that much as result of this. So I think we were reasonably positive on that sector all along.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Got you, Mike. And then could you comment a little bit more about recent order activity in oil
and gas and maybe give some color on what your exposure is to subsea drilling which seems to be sort of the weaker
spot for a lot of your peers?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yes, I guess I would – let me be careful how I say this. For our oil and gas business,
particularly for recips, order activity has been pretty strong. It looks like the well servicing is starting to pick back up
little bit, and that's a good thing. In terms of deep-sea drilling, I would say in the scheme of our overall oil and gas
business, that's pretty minor.
<Q - Ross P. Gilardi>: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mig Dobre. Please announce your affiliation and pose your
question.
<Q - Mig Dobre>: Good morning. Robert W. Baird & Company. If we can guys, going back to Brazil in Construction,
Latin America revenue was slightly down this quarter. Can you maybe talk a little bit about dealer inventory levels in
Latin America, maybe also your view on fundamental demand for the year excluding this large government order that
you got from Brazil?
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, dealer inventory, I think most places in the world, with a few minor product
exceptions, is in pretty good shape. I mean dealers worked on adjusting s current demand really over the past year and a
half. And so I can't see any reason it looks out of line. Now you might be able to get to a country or a dealer and maybe
draw a different conclusion. But I think by overall and by region, it's not out of whack with selling needs.
Your comment on demand in Brazil is a little bit hard to answer because last year, related to these large orders that we
had that Doug mentioned a minute ago, because we had them last year, this year the amount that we're going to sell
related to those big orders I think is going to be a bit less than last year. So far this year, Brazil has actually been
reasonably good for us. Most of the other countries in Latin America have been down a little, but Brazil has kind of
held up for us. And I think these large orders that we're getting from the government certainly helped that. But we've
had them in both years, last year and this year.
<Q - Mig Dobre>: Okay. Thanks for the color there. And then maybe a quick modeling question on the corporate
expense line. There's a lot of moving pieces there with incentive comp, LIFO, legal settlements last year. Can you give
us some color or guidance as to how you expect this line item to move through the year?

<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, that's a tough one, because I think the big variable for that will be the timing of the
restructuring costs. That's probably the biggest variable. And then as you go forward, if there happens to be changes, if
the outlook from here goes up or goes down, that can have an impact on some of the corporate incentive comp. Based
on the outlook where it's at now, we would think that to be pretty stable. So probably the biggest variation going
forward there is likely to be restructuring costs.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Kaplowitz. Please announce your affiliation and then pose
your question.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: It's Barclays. Nice quarter, guys.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Thanks, Andy.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: So, Mike, your cash flow generation in the quarter was strong, as you said. Some of it
was obviously net income growth. But can you talk about the increased focus it seems that you have on keeping
working capital down or any other changes you've made to generate more cash? And is this level of cash sustainable,
this pace sustainable, going forward? And then how should we think about buybacks in the subsequent quarters? I
know you'll tell me you'll be opportunistic, but it seems like you've shifted your focus that way at least a little bit.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yeah, Andy, this is Brad Halverson. I can start. I think on the cash flow side, it's
another positive story for us that we're extremely happy with. We finished the end of 2013 I think with a debt to cap at
29.7%. We did complete the buyback of the $1.7 billion and we had some incentive pay expense. Even with all that,
we're going to finish debt to cap at 30.2% at the end of the first quarter with $5 billion in cash. And we have been
steadily working on our working capital management. We've made great progress I think in all areas. The one that I
think remains the biggest opportunity for us would remain in the inventory turn area, where we talked about a little bit
in CONEXPO. If you look out a few years, we see still continued improvement there. And so our cash flow situation is
very good.
Our priorities remain the same. And the credit rating today is in good shape with our position. We're continuing to fund
growth and push for organic growth. We don't see anything big. Pension plan is well funded; we only have $200
million of required contributions for the rest of the year. We will make our normal dividend decision in June through
the board and announce that at that time. But our history of dividends will remain kind of consistent with our approach
there.
And you're right, stock repurchase will be opportunistic. But I can tell you what we will do is when we get to that
decision time, we look out a couple of years and we'll model a couple of years of trough and look at what our balance
sheet strength would be. But at this point in time, Andy, yes, I would say we continue to be positive about our ability to
generate cash out in the rest of the year and in the next three years to four years. And we're in great shape.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: That's helpful, Brad. And then if I could ask you guys to step back and maybe talk about
U.S. and European nonresidential construction. I mean, we've heard a lot of mixed feedback this quarter. I think a lot of
people were positive at CONEXPO. Your results look good. But maybe just comment on how you see that market
unfolding here this year and beyond.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Sorry, I missed that question. I was saying something to Doug here.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: No worries. So just on U.S. and European non-res or commercial construction, a lot of
mixed feedback we get on that topic. People were pretty positive on it at CONEXPO, your numbers look good, but
maybe just commentary on the overall market.

<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, I mean, it seems like you get mixed messages almost every day on housing. One day
prices are up and it's a hot market and then the day after that you get sales of existing homes down. But if you look at
the fine print of that, it's because one of the comments is there's not enough supply. So I think our view of housing is
that it will continue, particularly for starts, kind of continue to get better. We think this year is going to be over a
million. So I think we're pretty constructive on at least for the U.S. housing. But, again, you got to put that in
perspective. It's still way below where it was six years ago, seven years ago. So getting better, but not great.
Europe has been – I don't think I can give you a separate comment on res versus non-res there, but it has been a steady
positive for us over the course of the quarter. Whether that'll keep up, I think depends a lot on confidence there and is
this economic growth starting to get little bit better, does it continue.
Because one thing you've got to remember about our business and that is most of what we sell in any given quarter is to
replace something that's worn out. And what customers are -certainly at this point in those markets, it's not about
increasing the capacity of the installed base. It's about replacing things that need to be replaced. And what you need is
business confidence, reasonable results for construction activity, interest rates that are supportive, and we kind of have
those things. So I'd say we're we remain reasonably constructive on Construction for the developed world. And you're
right, the numbers for first quarter kind of panned that out.
<Q - Andy Alec Kaplowitz>: Thanks, Mike.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Okay. I think we have time, we're a little over but we'll take one more question and then
we'll wrap up.

Thank you. Our final question today is from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Yeah, ISI. Thanks for getting me in. I just want to figure out the EPS progression for the rest of
the year. It seems like you're implying second quarter EPS is below 1Q and I realize it's only happened once in the last
20 years and that's the quarter when you were trying to absorb Bucyrus initially. I'm just trying to figure out are you
being conservative or maybe I need to figure out more about the sales mix health in the first quarter for Construction so
I can more understand why the margins need to come down in Construction, and/or do you feel the Resource Industry
margins of bottomed yet? I'm just not understanding why we're down sequentially in 2Q.
<A - Michael L. DeWalt>: Yeah, I think a couple of things. One, even in Resource Industries it's our intention to
increase spending on programs that we really need to do for the long-term. I kind of talked about those a little bit. So I
think if you look at our level of spending on programs in the first quarter, it's usually seasonally light and it was
probably even more so in the first quarter this year.
We had a rough year last year, and I'll tell you, we came into the year with the management team with a lot of caution.
We were purposely trying to push as much of the program spending out that we had allowed in the plan and was in our
outlook beyond the first quarter. We wanted to get part of the year under our belt to see how it was actually going to
turn out before we started up some of the programs. So we have been – we have been cautious with the management
team early on the timing of expense for this year. I think we benefited by that in the first quarter and we'll see some cost
increase on things, again, that we need to do that will come later in the year.
For Construction, I think there will be some margin decline. The first quarter was heavier on excavation and
earthmoving, the rest of the year proportionately will be a bit more of the smaller BCP product. I think we expect some
more rental loading as we go through the year, and that'll be a little bit negative to mix so we think that will be the case
as well.
So it would be great if it was better than that. We would certainly like that, but I think our outlook for the year is kind
of our reasonable and prudent view today of how it looks.
<Q - David M. Raso>: All right. An interesting comment. I appreciate it. That's it for me.
