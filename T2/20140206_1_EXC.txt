Christopher M. Crane
Thank you, Ravi, and good morning to everybody. Before I talk about 2013, I'll give everybody a little bit of update on
the systems status. This year, this winter, has been -- has provided us with a lot of opportunities to perform storm
recovery. In the last 36 hours, we were hit pretty hard with snow in the ComEd zone. The recovery went fairly well and
fast, and we're back up and running at normal levels.
BGE was hit by freezing rain and ice yesterday morning, knocking out, at the peak, 175,000 customers. As of early this
morning, there with 45,000 customers left to recover. We have adequate resources on the system now. PECO was the
one that was most slammed by any of the utilities by this storm. Over 700,000 customers have been affected thus far,
making it the second worst storm in PECO's history, only beat out by Superstorm Sandy. We had, yesterday, 35,000
resources on the ground in the recovery phase, and that is ramping up even more today. ComEd is dispatching over 300
of their resources and will continue to support in the recovery.
As of this morning, there were still 430,000 – approximately 430,000 customers out, but we expect to make some solid
results in the next couple of days. This could last for a few more days, and we're really focused on this health and safety
of our customers with another storm coming in. So, the company's doing everything possible to expedite the recovery
there.
So, I'll switch now to 2013. It was a strong year for operations. Each utility – PECO, BGE and ComEd – achieved top
quartile, and best-ever outage frequency and customer satisfaction numbers.
Nuclear delivered a capacity factor of 94% and an all-time high of generation output. Gas and hydro availability upon
demand was over 99%. And renewable energy capture was 93%.
We have been confronted by low power and gas prices, impacts of subsidized generation and sluggish load growth; but
that said we delivered on our financial plan. We achieved $2.50 a share, which was right in line with our guidance, and
Jack will be providing more color on that in a minute.
We continue to manage costs. O&M was better than planned, realizing $360 million in merger synergies and on track
to $550 million promised by year end. Previous actions have ensured solid credit metrics and balance sheet strength
that allows us to continue investing in growth. You know about the $15 billion in utility investment we've talked of.
Jack is going to provide more color on that also in a minute.
We added more than 1.3 million smart meters during 2013, and did other infrastructure upgrades and system hardening
and transmission projects. We will add 158 – or we added 158 megawatts of clean generation – primarily at our
Antelope Valley Solar facility. And we have a substantial generation growth in our development pipeline for the next
two to three years, approximately 500 megawatts in contracted wind, solar, and the completion of our nuclear power
upgrades.
Public policy remains a critical focus for us. At the utilities, we saw meaningful improvement in the fair return on our
investments in Illinois and Maryland. Senate Bill 9 in Illinois allowed us to achieve our grid modernization programs,
which is driving customer reliability. And we are having constructive results on rate cases in Illinois and in Maryland.
It is clear that Exelon and other competitive generators are not fairly compensated for their reliable generation. We
have been active in the PJM stakeholder process since the auction results of last May to improve the rules. We continue
to be a leading voice against subsidized generation and have had some successes. We will continue the advocacy

process going forward.
Looking forward, we see some challenges, but we also do see some light at the end. Continued pressure from subsidies
and lower commodity prices are present, but the recent weather events have resulted in price volatility that we haven't
seen in a long time. This should result in supplier-side risk premium adjustments, which will assist in the market
recovery, and give this and other fundamental shifts we – given this and other fundamental shifts – we remain positive.
Today, we are providing guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 a share for the adjusted period earnings for 2014.
And now I'll turn it over to Jack to provide more details.
Jonathan W. Thayer
Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. I'm on slide two. I'll first discuss the fourth quarter and 2013 financial
results, and then turn to 2014 earnings guidance, cash outlook, and other insights on 2014, including our gross margin
update. We achieved operating earnings of $0.50 for the quarter and $2.50 per share for the year, in line with the
midpoint of our guidance expectations of $2.40 to $2.60.
Turning to slide three and the quarter results for the utilities. 2013 was a banner year for our three utilities. Our utility
customers are realizing the operating and cost benefits of the merger. Each – BGE, ComEd, and PECO – had its best
operating year ever, tangible proof of the value of scale, and the ability to leverage experience across utility best
practices and resources.
Operating performance in each utility improved over 2012 in all key metrics, including safety, reliability, customer
service, and customer satisfaction. For all three, reliability, customer satisfaction, and outage frequency, are in the top
quartile of similar utilities in the United States. We continue to make capital investments to make our system even
stronger and more reliable.
For the fourth quarter, ComEd delivered earnings of $0.13 per share and full-year earnings of $0.49 per share, at the top
of our guidance range. Fourth-quarter earnings decreased $0.06 per share compared to the same period in 2012, related
to the impacts of the October 12 distribution rate order, partially offset by favorable weather, volumes and customer
mix.
PECO delivered earnings of $0.12 per share for the quarter and $0.46 per share for the year, exceeding our guidance
range. Fourth-quarter earnings increased $0.02 per share over the same period last year. This is largely related to
decreased storm costs and favorable weather.
BGE's earnings were $0.06 per share for the fourth quarter and $0.23 per share for the full year, in the middle of our
guidance range. Fourth-quarter earnings increased by $0.04 per share from the same quarter in 2012. Higher electric
and gas distribution rates and lower storm costs drove the higher earnings.
In December, both ComEd and BGE received constructive results in their rate cases. The Illinois Commerce
Commission approved an increase of $341 million for ComEd's delivery service revenue, nearly 95% of the original
request, a testament to the success of the formula rate mechanism. And the Maryland Public Service Commission
approved an increase of $34 million for electric-based rates and $12 million for gas-based rates.
The 2014 outlook for load growth remains modest. We expect less than 1% load growth at both PECO and BGE, and
load growth to be flat to negative at ComEd. At each utility, load growth is influenced by ongoing energy efficiency
programs. PECO's modest growth of 0.3% reflects growth in manufacturing employment in the region. Strong growth
in the residential sector is driving BGE's 0.6% expected load growth in 2014. There's more detail on load for the
utilities that can be found on page 27 of the appendix.
Turning to ExGen's results on slide four, ExGen delivered earnings of $0.21 per share in the fourth quarter and $1.40
per share for the full year. For the quarter, ExGen's earnings decreased by $0.12 per share compared to the same quarter
in 2012. The majority of the decrease was driven by lower realized energy prices across all regions. This was offset in
part by higher capacity prices and lower O&M expense.

Looking ahead to 2014 on slide five, we expect adjusted operating earnings in the $2.25 per share to $2.55 per share
range, and $0.60 per share to $0.70 per share range for the first quarter.
Lower total gross margin of ExGen, driven by lower energy prices, is the main driver of the year-over-year decrease.
This is partially offset by higher returns at ComEd, driven by higher allowed ROE and the recovery of capital
investments in the formula rate, as well as higher revenue at BGE.
In addition, higher O&M costs, driven by inflation and the anticipation of average storm costs, offset in part by
merger-related synergies and lower pension costs, contribute to the year-over-year earnings differences. More detail on
the individual operating company drivers can be found in the appendix.
Slide six provides our projected sources and uses of cash for 2014 compared to 2013 actuals. Cash from operations is
expected to be $6.1 billion, which is an increase from 2013 of $75 million, due in part to higher distribution rates at
ComEd, and favorable income taxes and other settlements, offset by lower gross margin at Exelon Generation.
2014 CapEx plans are largely consistent with our estimates provided at EEI [Edison Electric Institute Financial
Conference]. I will discuss our O&M outlook on the next slide, but will first touch upon our financing plans for 2014.
We're projecting $1.2 billion of long-term debt issuances at ComEd and PECO, with the proceeds to be used for
refinancings and incremental capital investment at ComEd. In early January, we completed more than half of our 2014
financing plan with a $650 million ComEd first mortgage bond issuance. The transaction consisted of $300 million of
five-year bonds with a coupon of 2.15%, and $350 million of 30-year bonds with a coupon of 4.7%. The proceeds
served to retire $617 million of debt maturities in addition to general corporate purposes.
In addition to the maturity at ComEd, we had $525 million in maturities at ExGen, which we retired with cash on hand,
improving our credit metrics as a non-regulated business. As we mentioned on the third quarter call, we think we have
an opportunity to redeploy capital for growth opportunities through project financing of certain assets in our existing
portfolio.
To that end, I'm pleased to announce the closing of a $300 million L [Libor] plus 425 term loan of ExGen Renewables
1. ExGen Renewables 1 is the indirect holding company of Continental Wind, a 667 megawatt wind portfolio of 13
projects located in six states. We financed in September of last year. This transaction had an order book that was well
over-subscribed consisting of high quality investors, resulting in us bringing in pricing by 25 to 50 basis points from
our initial guidance. We think this serves as evidence that we have a strong portfolio of assets that can generate
additional proceeds to deploy for the right growth opportunities.
Slide 7 shows our 2014 O&M forecast and our 2013 actual O&M. We project O&M for 2014 to be $6.575 billion, an
increase of $100 million over last year. The O&M CAGR for the entire company from 2014 to 2016 is a negative 0.6%
with ExGen O&M remaining roughly flat during that time period. This year-over-year variance is mostly driven by
inflation and the anticipation of average storm cost of the utilities offset by merger synergies and favorable pension and
OPEB costs. We expect to hit our run rate merger synergy target of $550 million in 2014.
On Slide 8, as we told you at EEI, we are investing $15 billion in our three utilities over the planning period, resulting
in a consolidated rate base growth of between 5% and 7%. We're targeting a minimum 10% ROE at each utility by
2017. Our utilities provide stable earnings growth for the company and could fully fund the dividend in 2016. We
expect consolidated utility earnings will grow 6% annually from 2013 to 2016. Slide 8 shows our projected utility
earnings range from $1.10 to $1.40 in 2014 from $1.25 to $1.55 in 2016.
Slide 9 provides our fourth quarter gross margin update. As outlined we have changed the format of our disclosures to
include cost of sales and gross margin as opposed to O&M and depreciation and amortization. We disclosed the
implications to the format change in an 8-K in December and have included that disclosure in the appendix of this
presentation. During the fourth quarter, 2014 power prices slightly increased in PJM East and the Midwest while
decreasing in 2015 and 2016 across most regions.

In 2014, total gross margin decreased by $50 million from our last disclosure. As you know, we are highly hedged in
2014 and this rounded variance is due to a few minor adjustments during finalization of our 2014 through 2018 long
range plan. As a result of the pricing decrease, total gross margin is down $100 million in both 2015 and 2016 since the
third quarter call. In January we experienced severe winter weather in our load serving regions as well as significant
power and gas price volatility. Our balanced generation to load strategy as well as our geographic and commodity
diversity served us well in this challenging environment.
On the generation front, our oil peaking fleet and other displaceable generation allowed us to manage the higher loads
due to the cold weather. However we did experience some issues similar to other operators, including an outage at
Calvert Cliffs that will have an offsetting impact on the portfolio management results. We'll provide more details about
the financial impacts during our first quarter earnings call.
Yesterday, ISO New England announced the preliminary results of their forward capacity auction for the planning year
of 2017 and 2018. The clearing prices are $15 per kilowatt month in NEMA [National Energy Marketers Association]
and $7.025 per kilowatt month in the Rest of Pool. These results are pending FERC approval. The clearing prices
reflect the tightening supply and demand balance in New England after the announcements to retire baseload
generation. Our New England capacity position, 2100 megawatts in NEMA, and 735 megawatts in the Rest of Pool
benefit from prior year-over-year prices.
As you'll see in the appendix, our forecasted generation has decreased by roughly 50% in New England. Exelon
worked with the supplier to restructure certain terms of the fuel supply contracts, resulting in a more flexible and
reliable supply contract. Despite the fact that our forecasted generation is lower, the changes to the fuel supply contract
result in favorable gross margin variances in the portfolio that are included in the open gross margin forecasts.
On slide 10, we believe that PJM prices will improve due to coal plant retirements and increased costs for some
generators to comply with impending environmental regulations. Our current forecast has approximately 52 gigawatts
of coal retiring in the Eastern interconnect through 2016, which includes approximately 24 gigawatts in the PJM
footprint.
While near-term, forward power markets have shown some improvement in recent weeks, we still see forward heat
rates trading lower than our fundamentals would suggest, given the natural gas prices, expected retirements, a change in
the supply – PJM supply stack – and load assumptions. Our hedging strategy continues to reflect this view. Our overall
hedge percentage has increased due to two factors: the restructuring of the New England fuel supply contract and
shifting to a larger heat rate strategy in PJM. As of year-end 2013, we were 2% to 3% behind ratable and PJM, relying
on an even larger amount of cost commodity hedges to capture our view that heat rates will expand. At year-end,
natural gas sales represent 12% to 15% of our hedges in 2015 and 2016.
The changing fundamental drivers of the gas and power markets have already led to a significant amount of volatility
so far in 2014 spot prices. The forward markets have modestly responded. We will continue to evaluate the amount of
upside we see in the market, based on our fundamental views, and carry positions that will allow us to benefit as much
as possible from the realization of these views, while meeting the other goals of our hedging policy.
On slide 11, ExGen has shown strong financial metrics and cash flows to maintain its investment-grade rating, and
pursue opportunistic growth investments as they arise. For 2013, ExGen had an FFO-to-debt ratio of more than 37%,
and we expect this ratio to improve in 2014 to approximately 40%. ExGen's investment-grade credit rating and robust
balance sheet allows us to pursue growth projects.
As we showed you at EEI, we have declining base CapEx at ExGen from 2013 to 2016. Our priority is the safety and
reliability of these plants, and these cost reductions will not compromise our ability to achieve those priorities.
Our base CapEx in prior years was higher to prepare for license extensions and mitigate asset management issues. We
were also able to implement cost management programs, including reverse engineering, which contributed to the
reductions. These CapEx reductions helped to mitigate the reduction in rev net fuel.

Pension improvements are also contributing to our strong financial strength when looking at cash relative to earnings.
The rising interest rate environment results in lower pension costs and contributions. For 2015, we're forecasting a $100
million decline in pension contributions versus expense.
Further, ExGen has a favorable cash tax position. We have substantial near-term cash tax favorability compared to
book taxes, due to bonus depreciation, use of NOLs, and other tax credits.
Our longer-term tax position has increased tax capacity for growth opportunities in renewable generation. All of these
factors contribute to our financial flexibility and robust cash metrics, including EBITDA minus base CapEx of $1.5
billion to $1.8 billion, and free cash flow of $1.25 billion in 2014.
We have the financial strength not only to see us through this period of low commodity prices but also to grow. Our
healthy balance sheet, sustainable dividend, and our discipline, constitute a solid platform for sustained growth. As a
reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts.
Now I'll turn the call back to Chris for his concluding remarks before we open the call for question and answer.
Christopher M. Crane
Thanks, Jack. We continue to act aggressively on things we can control, and really work on things that we can
influence. We believe in the power market recovery, as we've repetitively said, and we're managing our portfolio
accordingly to maximize its profitability.
Our investments in the utilities is a very high priority. The stable earnings and the cash flow provided will support a
sustainable dividend going forward. We continue to focus on cost cutting and driving emergent synergies, as we have
discussed.
We talked about asset rationalization in the past. And despite our best-ever year in generation, some of our nuclear
units are unprofitable at this point in the current environment, due to the low prices and the bad energy policy that we're
living with. Assessing the market, operations, and commercial policy solutions is the focus right now. A better tax
policy and energy policy would be the clear answer, but if we do not see a path to sustainable profits, we will be
obligated to shut units down to avoid the long term losses. And that decision path or process should bring us to some
conclusion by year end.
Our balance sheet strength enables us to invest in diversification. We will continue to provide – add assets to the
portfolio that are earnings and free cash flow accretive. We'll mitigate the market effects by pursuing aggressive cost
cuts, asset rationalization, and deploying capital to drive growth.
With that, we'll open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Hey Dan.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: I was wondering maybe if Ken or somebody could just give some thoughts or some color on
what's going on in the forward curves right now. And obviously, we've seen a lot of movement in the 2014 curve, but
2015 and 2016 has been pretty benign so far. Is there a liquidity issue out there? Is it a fundamental issue? And when
do you guys expect that to start to move?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Let me have Joe Nigro address that.

<A - Joseph Nigro>: Hey, Dan. Good morning. I think there's a couple issues that we're dealing with. First, it's the end
of the year. The West Hub power, if we use that as the first proxy, is up across the board. And really, that's being driven
by the change in gas basis that we've seen in the mid-Atlantic. And we really haven't seen any heat rate expansion. We
have price depreciation, if you look at the balance of 2014, and then 2015 and beyond, across the board at the West up
on the back of the gas basis change.
The bigger issue is really in NiHub, because the gas basis really hasn't moved. If you look at 2015 through 2018 since
the end of the year, we really haven't seen a change in gas basis, nor have we seen much of a change in the Henry Hub
NYMEX price for natural gas. We've seen the calendar 2015 price at NiHub go up slightly, about $0.50 or so, I think it
was as of last night, on an ATC basis, but we're actually down from 2016 to 2018.
And I think your question about liquidity is spot-on. There's absolutely no natural buyers on the forward curve in
NiHub. And then on top of that, there is very little speculation being done in NiHub from a trading perspective. So
when you marry those two things together, you just don't see it.
And the last thing I would add is, as you remember, as we walked into the year, we saw the calendar 2014 ATC prices
rise some and the heat rates expand slightly. And I think it was the back of some retailers and others coming to market
to cover, but we haven't seen any change on the backend. And I wouldn't expect to see that until we see liquidity
improve.
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: And Dan, I would just add, given the January cold weather issues and severe price
volatility, we've actually seen liquidity really back off just in a recent week. So, the NiHub liquidity is probably about
as bad as we've ever seen it. And really, even in 2015, there is not a – there's almost no activity at this point.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: And Ken, I guess kind of on that point we've seen multiple retailers drop out of the business in
January already. What kind of landscape are you guys seeing today as far as competitors and maybe more departures in
the business, I guess, A? And then, B, are you having more conversations with customers looking to maybe reconfigure
how their buying power to get into more firm contracts and things like that?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Dan, there's a couple of data points to that. The first is there were a couple of wholesale polar
procurements done in January. And I would tell you versus what we had seen in the previous year, you saw some
increased risk premiums and in some cases higher margins. I think that's the first data point.
The BGS auction will take place next week – the fixed price portion next week – and I think we'll get another insight as
to how people are thinking about it. From a retail perspective, it's really too early to tell. But I think you're right on in
that we have seen a number of folks announce either getting out of the business or they're going to scale down their
business. We have seen small defaults, which aren't unexpected in this kind of environment.
I would fully expect that folks are going to take a pause here to reassess the risk/reward of selling these load-following
products. And when you think about the impending retirements that we've been talking about, if you use PJM as a
proxy with some of the changes come in as it relates to like demand response bidding, and just the GAAP basis issues
we've seen this winter, pretty much all over the Eastern interconnect, I think it's safe to say that we're going to expect
people here to reassess what they think the value of a load-following contract is. And we would expect to see the
volatility in annual margins increase through time, both retail and wholesale load-following contracts.
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: And Dan, I would just reiterate what Jack said. Our matched load to gen strategy really
has played out well here in January. While others are concerned about uncontrolled costs to serve load, with our robust
asset base, our portfolio management capability on the wholesale side has allowed us to take those issues off the table,
and let our retail team focus on what the customers need, whether they are concerned about prices if they're indexed or
exposed at all, and how we can help them get through this. I think that's our advantage in our mass gen-to-load strategy,
and I think it puts us well ahead of a lot of our competitors.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: So Ken, I just take that to mean in the first quarter, that even with this volatility in January and
into February on retail, the generation has offset that? So there has been kind of a net neutral, so it hasn't hurt or helped
appreciably?

Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Fleischman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Hi, guys. A couple questions. First, and I'm not sure you can answer this, but on the nuclear
plants that are losing money in this environment, is there a way to give us a sense of how much lost earnings there is,
let's say, in 2014 from plants that are not economic right now?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yeah, we're not putting that out yet. If we have to make a decision at the end, we will
tell you the upside. But we don't have that number to publish yet.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then you mentioned – I guess you didn't mention this in your remarks – but on
the bottom of slide 12, you talk about that you believe you are going to have positive earnings CAGR off of this 2014
guidance over the long term? Should we assume that assumes your kind of $2 to $4 power price recovery thought? Or
is that something where, even without all of that, given potential savings on new shutdowns and other things you're
doing, that that might be possible even without that?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Let me ask Jack to go through the logic there.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Steve, so it incorporates a number of things. It incorporates our fundamental views both
around power prices as well as capacity. And that provides – that would provide an important part of that positive
earnings growth offsetting the declines that the forwards would suggest in the business.
We also have a continued focus on costs that we're pursuing and building on top of the $550 million of savings from
the merger and we expect that to also be additive. And then we've factored in the available capital of balance sheet
space that we have and the opportunity to use that for further investment in organic growth or potential acquisitions or
other means of growing our EPS base.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Good morning.
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: One sort of strategic question – this might be for Jack. But Jack, if volatility and the recent
volatility we've seen is kind of what's going to ultimately inform the forwards, why not use some of that financial
flexibility to be substantially less hedged?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Let's have Joe Nigro talk about that.
<A - Joseph Nigro>: At this point in the cycle, if we talked about 2015 and 2016, which are really the two primary
forward years that we're hedging, we've never had a larger open power position at this point in the forward hedging
cycle. So we talked a lot, and Jack's script mentioned some of the things that we did in the fourth quarter, in terms of
selling gas and rotating out of a very long position.

As we – and we took advantage of the price rise we saw in natural gas from about mid-October through the end of the
year. In early January, the gas market actually came off some, and we took the opportunity to buy back a lot of those
hedgings that we had put on. So we're still carrying a very long open power position.
The second thing I would add to that is, there has been some movement in prices when we talk about West Hub and
NiHub in 2015, in certain seasons like summer and winter. And we compare that to where we think ultimately they
should settle, given the soft fuel price environment we're in. And there may be an opportunity to rotate the positions
and make power sales where we think it's appropriate on a seasonal basis. But sitting here today, we've never had a
larger open power position at this point in the forward commodity cycle.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Great. And on just one – you mentioned this restructuring of the gas, or I guess it's
gas, the fuel supply on New England, which, but if you're going to generate a lot less, presumably that was a low price
contract that's going to not be as low price anymore? So, I'm curious is there a gain associated with that? And when –
did it show up in 2013? Is it something that will be in 2014? Or am I not thinking about that right?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: No. It's – as we look at this – the way it's flowing through our financial figures, you see it in the
hedge disclosure. We restructured a long-dated fuel supply contract that was positive margin overall. And you're right –
we had a substantial decrease in the output of our generation up in New England that you see in the disclosure – to the
tune of about 50%. The way the mechanics work in the disclosure is such that we reduced our power new business to
go, and we added the value of that contract that we monetized into our estimated open gross margin. So the net change
to the bottom line is zero, but it's just more locked in cash flows.
<A - Kenneth W. Cornew>: So, Jonathan, a big driver of this is around making sure we have fuel reliability and
flexibility, and can run the plants when they're most needed on the system. That was a huge driver in doing that.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So was there – is there a financial impact from the restructuring?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: The financial impact is you see, if you look at our hedge disclosures quarter-over-quarter, for
example in 2014, you'll see – you'll notice – we reduced our power new business to go by $150 million. We reduced it
by $100 million in 2015. A portion – a good portion of that is the benefit of this contract and the locked in cash flows.
So we reduced the power new business to go, and we've grossed up the open gross margin for that value.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay, well sorry to kind of keep on this, but does that mean there's not a sort of upfront
gain associated with it?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Well, what they're trying to tell you -- it's built into the numbers you're looking at.
There was an optimization that needed to be done for reliability on the system that drove the contract restructuring. We
were compensated for that and it's in the numbers. And it is positive, but it's in the numbers you're seeing.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Can you quantify it?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: No. There's terms under the deal – no.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. And then just finally, Chris, on your last comment around assets and everything, at
EEI, you were -- you talked a little about PPAs [power purchase agreements]. And then there was a sort of potential
path to addressing economic situation of some of the nukes. And then there was a story about something being
negotiated in Illinois around Quad Cities. Can you comment at all about that?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yes. Somebody ran with a story that was not true. We're not negotiating with the State
of Illinois on PPAs. What my statement was, BGI, and it's still a path forward; we would like to get longer term
contracts on especially the MISO [Midwest Independent System Operator] asset. It is not being compensated for the
reliability. And we have origination folks out working on that, but it's not with a state entity; it's through multiple paths
to other parties that are securing long term needs. We'll continue to work on that. As you know, there's not many of
those deals out there. But MISO and now MISO South would be our target to try to find those opportunities.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you very much, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Hi. Chris, you'd talked a couple times about your efforts to achieve changes in
energy policy that might benefit the company. And I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit, in
particular, what you're hoping to see done on renewables and on Co2 regulation? And perhaps what you think may play
out on those two fronts?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Sure. Our biggest push right now is, at the federal and the state levels, is to stop
subsidizing generation. That's renewables and other sources of generation. It skews the market; it doesn't give any of us
the right signal. Should we be investing? Should we be shutting down? And we think that good policy for the
competitive market is let the assets compete. So, we have done a lot of work the last couple of years trying to tell that
story and we hope that it's continuing or will start to resonate with more of the stakeholders as we go forward.
The other thing that we're continuing to push on and explore – we do not get compensated, as others, for reliable base
load generation. When we load a core in a nuclear reactor, we can run for up to two years with very reliable generation.
We're not depending on the wind, the sun or the flow of any fuel through a pipe. It's there. So we think the capacity
markets, if not the energy markets, should reflect the reliability and the dependability of those. And Joe Dominguez and
our regulatory folks continue to work in market space to try to find opportunities to improve the rules around that and
we'll continue to push it.
As far as greenhouse gases, we're not advocating for a carbon bill. We've spent a lot of time working on that in the past.
And Washington, I don't think, is the place to try to resolve that issue right now. We continue to watch what the EPA's
doing and what they have under their jurisdiction right now, as it's been pointed out to regulate going forward. We'll
monitor that. We'll inform how we make our investments around that, or how we would make our disclosures around
that. But we're not in the advocacy spot right now in that area.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Okay. Understood. Could you maybe just elaborate a little bit on what type of
compensation you think would be appropriate for the reliable base load, as opposed to what you're receiving already in
capacity markets?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Yeah, I'll let Joe Dominguez touch on that.
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Sure. So when we're talking about reliability, it's often described as fuel diversity or not
allowing the RTO's to get too long gas because of these volatility risks. The way I think that is being translated in
stakeholder space is, you increase the requirements for firm fuel. And so, obviously, a nuclear unit has firm fuel. We
load up 18 months of fuel in the core.
And the thought is that, especially coming out of these winter events, the gas units will be required to have something
that looks like firm fuel. And that may involve firm transport requirements, it may ultimately involve a winter peaking
season, where there's an examination of whether sufficient gas can be provided to cover all the megawatts that are bid
in the auction. But those are the discussions that are occurring. We think that will put upward pressure in the capacity
market, and allow nuclear units to benefit from the firm fuel they have and the reliability they provide in the system.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Great. So you're basically hoping that the requirement for firm fuel supply and
transmission on the gas plants will drive capacity prices higher and you will benefit accordingly? Is that fair?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Yes, but I don't want to be limited to that. I think what we need to figure out for the
abilities on the system is whether the gas units can perform fully during peak season. And now we're going to see a
peak in the winter, and that's really what comes out of this. And I think the ISOs are going to examine a number of
tasks. Requiring firm transport is one of them, but the other way to do it is to just whittle down the number of
megawatts that are participating in the capacity auction. Either way, we will see some uplift in the current capacity
market as a result of those efforts.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Hi, guys. On that same topic, could you talk about the PJM parameters that were released?
And what do you think about capacity imports into PJM and how that might be changing?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Joe, you want to...?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Sure, I'll cover that. Well, I think the most significant ruling was limiting the sub-annual
BR. And so we see the effect of that already. That was approved by FERC. FERC has not approved PJM's request on
the import limits as yet. As you know, they issued a deficiency letter. Our review of the deficiency letter suggests that
they could answer the questions relatively quickly, refile, and be in time for a decision by FERC in advance of the
auction.
In terms of the planning parameters, I think they would modestly reduce the number of imports, the number of
megawatts of imported generation in this next capacity auction. That's my read, based on what I've seen so far.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Modest reduction. A couple of technical questions, concerning the interest on – in ExGen –
it just looks like, in the guidance, it went down to $325 million. And the run rate on the fourth quarter would seem to
imply about $400 million, and net debt, it looks like it actually increased. So I'm just wondering what's the cause of the
decline in interest going forward?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Michael, I think we can – I would say, broadly, that it's related to lower balance. And
we have been refinancing at lower levels. But why don't we take the more specific modeling questions off-line?
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: No problem. And one last question is -- have you baked into guidance any of the uplift
from January, like, any of the risk, increased risk premiums or anything like that, that might have happened or might be
occurring, in your 2014 guidance?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: No, we haven't. Whether you talk about it from a retail margin perspective or
performance in January, none of that has been baked in.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: We do think it should be and eventually will be. As we looked at these auctions or the
muni aggregation process, we never could understand the numbers in some of the suppliers that were able to make.
And so we didn't win a lot of those. We've pushed – as we looked at our own models – the place that jumped out was
the volume variability, the VLR, that can be directly seen in a weather event like that. So we've previously priced that
into our offerings that would – that and portfolio management would protect us from events like we just went through –
so that's why we're saying right now we're on plan.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. Thank you very much.

<A - Christopher M. Crane>: So right now, we are not in a position where we would want to trade our equity for
anything other than something that was a relative value deal. So if you look at – we believe we're undervalued at this
point and there is market upside – between the market upside and the current valuations we're being given, we think
there's upside to that. So, we would hold the use of our equity only to something that would be a relative value deal that
we could see the upside accretion in earnings and profitability.
Other things that would be looked at would just be balance sheet type growth activities, as Jack has pointed out
previously. So, off the balance sheet, we're willing to engage in anything that we can see on the near term as a positive
accretion in earnings, but not create a dilution on the equity utilization – just because we think most are trading at a
premium.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay, got it. Also to clarify, you pointed out earlier, also in Slide 12, when you look at your planning
period and think about ultimately ending up with a positive CAGR in earnings, are we looking at 2013 through 2018, or
through 2016? What's the planning period? Can you just define that?

Your next question comes from the line of Jon Cohen with ISI Group.
<Q - Jon A. Cohen>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Good morning, Jon.
<Q - Jon A. Cohen>: Just a question on – when you say you have balance sheet capacity – is that also looking out long
term through 2018? Or is that more over the next few years?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: That's looking out throughout 2018. Clearly, we have more balance sheet capacity in the
front years based on where the power curve is currently trending. To the extent that our fundamental view comes to
fruition, then clearly, we'll have a similar level of FFO relative to debt. And that would create incremental capacity. But
consistent with prior comments, we think we have between $1 billion and $2 billion of balance sheet capacity to invest
in growth.
<Q - Jon A. Cohen>: Okay. And if your fundamental view on the power markets does not come to fruition, does that
kind of eat away at that $1 billion to $2 billion?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: That's how we arrive at the $1 billion to $2 billion; to the extent that our fundamental
view comes to fruition, then it's meaningfully higher.
<Q - Jon A. Cohen>: Okay, great. And then just one other question on the planning parameters. I noticed that PJM
broke out ComEd and BGE as separate LDAs, even though it looks like there's plenty of import capacity. Can you just
talk about what their thinking was around that? And does that help you at all?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Joe Dominguez will [ph] answer that (50:23).
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Sure. PJM has the right under the tariff to separately model the zones when there are
concerns that the megawatts of supply needed within the zone won't receive adequate compensation through the RTO
pricing into the reliability criteria. As you indicated, the comment zone transmission, the CTO/CTL ratio looks like it's
pretty robust. BGE is a little bit tighter. But I think what this ultimately tells us is that, as we get into the auction period,
bidding practice within those zones is going to be very critical. And what the cost of supply within the zones is, is
going to be very critical. PJM, we think wisely, has taken steps to protect reliability in those zones by separately
modeling the LDAs.

<Q - Jon A. Cohen>: Okay. And can you just clear up one thing? As a nuclear generator, what is your flexibility for
bidding in an avoided cost? I mean, it looks like they don't specify an avoided cost rate for nuclear; it's mostly for coal
and other fossil units. Can you bid something other than just being a price taker?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: The answer is yes, you can. There are default rates, which is what you're pointing out, but
there's nothing that prohibits a nuclear unit from bidding an ACR.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Hi, thank you very much. It looks like for the year 2014, the effective tax rate came in at
33.8%, which is well below your guidance of 37.4%. I guess my question is what caused the tax rate to be significantly
better? And also, I don't see sort of a consolidated effective tax rate that you're assuming for 2014, in your guidance.
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: We'll have our tax VP address that – Tom Terry.
<A - Thomas D. Terry, Jr.>: The guidance you've been given is just a core effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in
the financials, and what you'll actually see realized, reflects utilization of renewables credits, which drives that down
substantially below what you'd get just as an ongoing core tax rate.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: So what is the consolidated tax guidance for 2014?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Do we give that guidance?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: No. We don't provide that, Paul.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Oh, okay. And then can you – is it, again, the renewable credits that's getting you to the much
lower effective tax rate this year versus what you were originally guiding to?
<A - Jonathan W. Thayer>: Yes. Paul, you're seeing the continued build-out of AVSR; you're seeing a build-out of
wind-generating assets through our renewables business. You should expect us to be a regular beneficiary of tax credits
and lowering our overall tax liability on a cash basis, as well as the...
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Even though you can't give sort of a consolidated effective tax rate, directionally, should we
assume something similar to 2013 and 2014?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: Let us step back and look at how we want to discuss that. We've got more renewables
coming on. We've got a pipeline. It hasn't been something that we've talked about in the past and I'd hate to do it on the
fly right now, so let us regroup and we'll put something out or we'll address it on the next call.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Okay. And then just real quick, on the – on your discussion of the supply disruptions and
what you're going to talk about in the first quarter of 2014 – will that discussion essentially only impact your 2014
number or could it also have an effect on sort of future periods that you include in your disclosures?
<A - Christopher M. Crane>: So, our disclosures are based off of the forward strip. Where we see the market on our
short term view doesn't come into our disclosures. Joe, do you want to cover that?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: And, Paul, a couple of things. One thing is there's – none of our January activity is in this
disclosure we give today. As you know, and you see in the disclosure, we have new business targets to go both on the
power side and the non-power side. So any value created, whether it's in January or the balance of the first quarter, or
changes we see in value for the balance of the year would go towards meeting those new business targets for the year.
In addition, I think the question you're raising is, what is the value on the forward curve of some of the activity and
disruptions we've seen in January? As we've talked about, it's been much more significant in the front end of the curve

and very muted on the back end of the curve. And we haven't seen anything in the two weeks since that has happened
that led us to believe that retail is changing appreciably yet.
But I do think as we get to the end of the first quarter, we'll have better insight as to what the impact is on the forward
curve as we move through time, and what it means. But as of right now, our plan includes retail margins that we've
previously talked about, when you think about like CNI power that don't get back to the middle of that $2 to $4 range.
If we see that expand, we would take that into account and recognize it to see how it helps meet our new business
targets or possibly expand them.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Okay. And last question for me. We've seen announcements of new gas plant construction in
PJM. Do you expect this to be limited to sort of a Pennsylvania Marcellus region, or do you expect to see more activity
in other parts of PJM?
<A - Joseph Nigro>: Paul, I think that there's a – I think the general consensus is that you're going to see it more in the
mid-Atlantic region. Prior to January 1, as you know, we saw substantial degradation in gas basis as it related to the
mid-Atlantic and the Marcellus area. It's not unreasonable to think you could see this in Ohio as well, as the Utica Shale
starts to build out as quickly as people expect. I do think, though, since we've seen an uptick in the gas basis since the
first of the year, you have to take a step back and pause, and reassess what the economic side of the economy on these
plants are, because there's going to be some very seasonal differences when you look at the curve being up. If you use
M3 basis as a proxy, $0.30 to $0.35 on an annualized basis, there's a big winter component to that, whereas the summer
and the shoulder months are still weak. But, in general, I think you would see it in that Marcellus and Utica region.
