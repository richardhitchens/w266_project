MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Release
Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 26,
2014.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gregg Steinhafel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer. Please go ahead.
Gregg W. Steinhafel
Good morning, and welcome to our 2013 fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the line with me today are Kathee
Tesija, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and John Mulligan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer.
This morning, I will provide a high-level summary of our fourth quarter results and the strategic priorities for the year
ahead. Then Kathee will discuss category results, guest insights and the holiday season. And finally, John will provide
more detail on our financial performance along with our financial outlook for 2014. Following John's remarks, we'll
open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via
webcast. Following this conference call, John Hulbert and John Mulligan will be available throughout the day to
answer any follow-up questions you may have. Also, as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this
morning are subject to risks and uncertainties, the most important of which are described in the 8-K we filed this
morning. Finally, in these remarks, we refer to adjusted earnings per share which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A
reconciliation to our GAAP results is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relation website.
Target's fourth quarter financial results reflect better than expected U.S. segments performance to the first three weeks
of the holiday season followed by meaningfully softer results, following our December 19 announcement that criminals

had gained access to guest payment card data in our U.S. stores.
In total, fourth quarter comparable sales decreased 2.5%, consistent with our updated guidance in January. Throughout
the quarter, our team managed the business extremely well, adjusting both inventory and expenses to match the rapidly
changing pace of sales. As a result, our U.S. operations generated fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 at
the high-end of the updated guidance we provided in January.
In Canada, we worked diligently to leverage holiday traffic in an effort to clear excess inventory. Markdowns resulting
from this effort drove a very low gross margin rate, but allowed us to reduce average inventory per store in Canada by
approximately 30% between the beginning and the end of the fourth quarter. Canadian segment EPS dilution was $0.40
in the quarter, $0.05 better than the updated guidance we provided in January. We're pleased that our early-cycle
Canadian stores have seen the most improvement, giving us confidence that we'll continue to see continued
improvement across all our Canadian stores in 2014.
Fourth quarter GAAP EPS of $0.81 reflects U.S. and Canadian segment performance along with costs related to our
recent restructuring and data breach along with small accounting and tax matters. As we work to address the impact of
the mid-December data breach, we have put the welfare of our guests at the center of every decision we've made.
We've communicated early and often, providing the best information we had about new facts on the ongoing
investigation.
We consistently assured our guests that they would have zero liability for any unauthorized charges on their card
accounts resulting from the breach. We increased fraud detection for REDcard holders and extended free credit
monitoring and identity theft protection for any guest who has ever shopped one of our U.S. stores. We are truly sorry
for the impact this breach has had on our guests, team members and other stakeholders, and I want to reiterate that we
are committed to making things right.
Yet we know these initial steps are part of a longer process. We continue to listen to our guests, and we know that this
incident and recent security breaches at other companies have shaken their confidence in both Target and the U.S.
payment system more broadly. To rebuild guest confidence, we are committed to an end-to-end review in cooperation
with third-party experts to understand how the breach occurred, the identification and acceleration of solutions to
provide enhanced protection in the future, and engagement with third-party experts to protect the industry and
consumer from future threats.
Accordingly, we are taking the following steps. We are conducting an end-to-end forensic investigation of our
processes, systems and personnel to make informed decisions on potential security enhancements. We are accelerating
the adoption of advanced chip-enabled technology, investing more than $100 million to equip our stores and to issue
Target branded smart-chip credit and debit cards. We have long supported this more secure technology, but broad
adoption in the U.S. market has been elusive. We believe that recent events will help the industry to reach a tipping
point toward accelerated adoption in the U.S., and we are investing to ensure that Target is a clear leader in driving this
change.
We're working collaboratively with a broad set of stakeholders in the payment card space, including banks, retailers,
trade associations, payment processors and networks to share and advance best practices and foster future innovation.
We helped launch and will be an active leader in a retail industry cybersecurity and data privacy initiative. In addition,
we are investing $5 million in a new coalition with the Better Business Bureau, the National Cyber Security Alliance
and the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance to advance public education around cybersecurity and the
dangers of consumer scams.
While we can't yet assess the full impact of this crime against Target and our guests, we are pleased that sales have
started to recover from the trends we observed following breach-related announcements in December and January.
Importantly, because we are in a strong financial position, we expect to absorb any near-term financial impacts, while
continuing to invest in projects that are key to our long-term success.
Our company has a long history of innovation, disciplined management and a strong long-term financial performance,
and we are committed to upholding the principles, which have sustained this company's success for many decades.

And, while 2013 was a disappointing year financially, we have entered the new year with the right plans in place to
grow profitably and generate meaningfully improved financial performance in 2014 and beyond.
In the U.S., we've demonstrated our ability to manage the business with discipline and generate strong financial
performance even in a challenging environment. In fact, Kathee will outline in more detail, we were very pleased with
our holiday season results prior to the announcement of the data breach. In preparation for fourth quarter, we made
changes to our holiday promotions and marketing, and we were pleased that our in-stocks were running at all-time
highs. As a result, U.S. segment fourth quarter sales were running ahead of plan prior to December 19. Looking ahead,
we will apply the insights we gained in the holiday season to connect with our guests by delivering merchandise and
promotions thoughtfully designed to appeal to them based on what's on their mind at each point in the year, moving
Target beyond compelling to becoming irresistible for our guests.
We made enormous progress in our multi-channel efforts throughout 2013, as we meaningfully increased conversion
both on our website and on our mobile apps. We acquired CHEFS Catalog, Cooking.com and DermStore, extending
our online assortment by providing our guests access to additional high-end brands in key Home and Beauty categories.
We launched Cartwheel, our unique mobile savings tool, which has far exceeded expectations in both adoption and
engagement. And we accelerated our investments in flexible fulfillment. As a result, throughout the year, growth in our
digital traffic and sales outpaced industry averages. We launched in-store Pickup chain-wide at the beginning of
November. And with very little marketing, this new offering became a meaningful driver of digital traffic and sales.
Our stores teams did an outstanding job delivering great service when guests arrived to pickup these orders, and this is
particularly impressive since we launched the service during the busiest time of the year.
We will continue to invest in systems, data, and processes to enhance our flexible fulfillment capabilities in 2014 and
beyond. In our stores, we are committed to enhancing the guest experience by adding dedicated service to key
categories like Beauty, Baby, and Electronics and by providing training and technology that allows our stores team to
go beyond providing basic service to solving problems for our guests. And we're continuing to pilot innovation to our
store formats. Based on the initial rollout of the CityTarget format and the high single-digit comparable sales we're
seeing in our second year CityTarget stores, we're analyzing opportunities to reduce the size and enhance the flexibility
of this format, opening up a wider universe of potential sites in dense urban areas.
While the work on CityTarget continues, we've also developed a separate smaller format called TargetExpress. At
about 15% of the size of one of our general merchandise stores, we believe this design provides us with a fantastic
opportunity to expand into new trade areas, providing a convenient solution to guests, who can easily visit one of our
other formats. While we expect to offer a carefully curated assortment in frequency categories like Food, Healthcare,
Beauty and other household essentials, TargetExpress will also offer discretionary categories including Home,
Electronics and Seasonal. Throughout the store, we will feature our own brands, which offer guests an unbeatable
combination of quality and price. We plan to open our first pilot location of this format here in our home market in
July, so we can carefully study both operational and financial results before we determine our plans to expand this
format to other markets.
Throughout the organization, we continue to find new opportunities to optimize expenses, freeing up resources we can
apply to new initiatives. In 2013, our teams saved approximately $200 million by reprioritizing their activities and
finding more efficient ways to get things done. Our expense optimization efforts are not a short-term project, but a
complete overhaul of the way we work, and the team continues to find new opportunities. As a result, we expect the
benefit of our expense optimization efforts to reach $1 billion in annualized savings by 2015. I'm proud that our entire
team has embraced this effort to transform how we work.
In Canada, the team has moved from a year focused on opening a record number of stores to optimizing the business
and run state. As we enter 2014 with a much cleaner inventory position, the team's number one operational focus is on
in-stocks, ensuring we have the right quantity of each item in the right place at the right time. In addition, we continue
to invest in technology and training to enhance both the tools our team uses, and their ability to deploy them most
effectively. We're also continuing to implement innovative marketing and merchandising programs in Canada to raise
awareness for our frequency categories, like Grocery, Household Essentials, Beauty and Healthcare.

Throughout 2014, we will focus on conveying the depth and breadth of our assortment in those categories and the
unbeatable value we provide through our everyday pricing, 5% rewards, price match and our flyer. With enhanced
guest awareness of our unbeatable prices combined with the benefit of improved operations, we expect guest shopping
frequency to build throughout 2014, driving improvement in sales and profitability.
While 2013 will clearly be remembered as a challenging year, I am proud of the team's efforts to transform our
business and position the company for long-term success, and I want to sincerely thank the Target team for their tireless
effort to help our guests recover from the data breach. While there is much more work to be done, I'm inspired by their
singular focus on our guests and making things right. As a result, I'm confident we will look back on this incident and
see that we emerged from it even stronger than before.
Now, Kathee will provide more detail on our fourth quarter results and key initiatives as we enter 2014. Kathee?
Kathryn A. Tesija
Thanks, Gregg. At our last conference call we outlined our plans for the holiday season and mentioned that fourth
quarter sales were on track through the first half of November. As we progressed through Black Friday week and the
first two weeks of December, guests continued to respond to our promotions and sales ran ahead of our plan.
Following the data breach announcement and the rapid change in the pace of our sales, the team reacted quickly,
making nimble adjustments to minimize excess inventory. This quick response allowed us to end the year with a clean
inventory position, and while our fourth quarter gross margin rate reflected the additional clearance activity resulting
from the sales slowdown, our team did a great job minimizing the impact.
As we built our holiday plans, our goal was to cut through the clutter and reach our guests with compelling offers on
exciting merchandise. Specifically, we aligned our weekly deals and events so guests were receiving a clearer message
across all channels. And because our guests are budget-conscious and love to find deals, we intentionally layered
promotions across our circular, Cartwheel, and our Catalogs to provide unbeatable value. We used our direct channels
to drive urgency at key points through the season, and we offered more broad attention-getting promotions like 40% off
sweaters. Consistent with past years, we featured hot deals on key items but attracted more attention by offering deeper
discounts on fewer items, and we were very pleased with the guest response.
For the quarter overall, our non-discretionary categories generally saw the strongest sales performance. However
among our more discretionary categories, Electronics saw an increase in fourth quarter comparable sales, led by mobile
phones, tablets, and videogame hardware and software. We also saw relative strength in our sporting goods and house
wares categories. Our digital channels had a very strong holiday season. Thanksgiving was our biggest digital sales day
ever with mobile devices accounting for a full 25% of those sales.
We were recently recognized as having the most browsed app by a smartphone and tablet in 2013 and Mobile
Commerce Daily just named Target, Mobile Retailer and Commerce Website of the Year. This is the second time
we've been named Mobile Retailer of the Year, and we are pleased to be the only retailer to be honored with the award
twice.
An important factor in our digital success was the fourth quarter rollout of the opportunity to buy online and pickup
in-store. In-store pickup requests represented about 10% of fourth quarter digital orders, but they peaked at a much
higher rate before Christmas, as guests relied on the service as a great solution for last-minute gift shopping. About
30% of store visits to pickup an online order resulted in store shopping on that same trip. And the size of that store
transaction was much larger than an average store trip.
While we rolled out this capability with an external commitment to have orders ready in four hours or less, our team
quickly attained our internal goal to have most orders ready in one hour or better. Our survey showed consistently-high
levels of guest satisfaction with this service, and this capability has accelerated our mobile conversion rates.

We're also pleased with the continued growth of Cartwheel, our digital social savings app, which ended 2013 with over
5 million users who've already saved more than $43 million. Younger guests are particularly engaged by Cartwheel as
more than half of its users are millennials, a much higher percentage than they represent in our overall guess base.
Redemption rates on Cartwheel are more than 10 times higher than we see in other direct channels, like receipt
marketing and email, and our analysis indicates that it's driving incremental trips and sales.
Our pre-Black Friday deals resulted in one of the biggest days ever for Cartwheel, as they drove one-third of our active
users into Target stores on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. We continue to work to enhance the Cartwheel
experience. We recently added the ability to scan barcodes to find out if there's a Cartwheel deal on an item and added
the capability to sign up for Cartwheel directly through a Target account and email, while continuing to provide access
to the app through Facebook.
As Gregg mentioned, we continue to listen to our guests to understand how we can help them move beyond the data
breach and feel confident in shopping at Target. While sales have started to recover in recent weeks and sentiment
metrics have begun to improve, most notably among our best guests, we continue to invest to ensure this recovery
continues. Beyond our efforts in data security and chip-enabled technology, we're applying insights from the holiday
season to make our merchandise, stores and digital channels even more irresistible to our guests. We continue to
innovate in ways that differentiate both our product assortment and the guest experience, and we're investing in pricing
and promotions to make our value proposition even stronger.
We're very pleased with the response to PETER PILOTTO for Target, our most recent designer partnership, which
launched earlier this month. This collection, which features a limited-edition assortment of women's apparel,
accessories and swimwear, is available at most of our U.S. and Canadian stores and on Target.com. We've also
partnered with NET-A-PORTER.COM to offer a curated assortment of the collection to fans across the globe. With
lots of social media buzz, we saw long lines outside many of our urban stores on the morning of the launch. And the
collection quickly became NET-A-PORTER's fastest-selling collaboration in history.
Based on last year's results, Target and Sports Illustrated are once again partnering in support of the magazine's annual
swimsuit issue, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Target is the exclusive mass retail advertiser and
official marketing partner for the issue. This year's partnership includes a new 20-page flip cover that celebrates
swimsuit style over the past 50 years and features Target's limited-edition swimwear collection. The collection
launched at Target stores and on Target.com February 17 in advance of the issue's on-stand date, and includes 10 black,
gold and ivory swimsuits priced from $15 to $30.
Earlier this month, we began offering Ámbar, a new apparel collection designed with the Latina guest in mind. Ámbar
is set in 50 U.S. stores this month and is also available on Target.com. The line of apparel and accessories features
vibrant prints and flattering custom silhouettes. This stylish and affordable collection has items ranging from $17 to
$40. This spring, Target will introduce an assortment of premium skincare featuring seven notable brands, four of
which will be exclusively sold at Target: 29 by Lydia Mondavi, Borghese, Laneige and MD Complete by Dr. Zelickson
alongside industry favorites Vichy, La Roche Posay and Own Skin Health. These brands will be merchandised in two
distinct sections: Dermatological Skincare and Specialty Skincare. And they've already launched on Target.com. We'll
begin rolling out the assortment to 749 U.S. Target stores beginning in March.
So what's likely to be the biggest Blu-ray and DVD release of the year, Target will offer an exclusive edition of
Catching Fire, the second film in The Hunger Games trilogy in stores and on Target.com next month. The Target
exclusive Blu-ray edition includes 45 minutes of exclusive content from never-before-seen footage and cast interviews
to a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film.
This spring, award-winning singer Shakira is teaming up with Target for her 10th studio album, and our exclusive
Deluxe Edition featuring three bonus tracks hits stores on March 25. We announced the partnership and kicked off
album pre-ordering with a special spot during the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in January. Last month, we became the
exclusive retailer to feature Beats Music playlist. Beats Music is a curated digital music streaming service that allows
its users to [ph] peek (22:41) into the personal music libraries of their favorite artists and brands and have them create
playlists just for them. By subscribing to Target's playlist, guests can expect a varied mix of songs inspired by Target's

rich heritage of music and the taste of the millions who shop for albums at Target each year.
In December, we launched the Awesome Shop, a beta site that features the top Target products recently pinned on
Pinterest. The site lets guests explore, get inspired, and see what other guests love just like they do in stores. Awesome
Shop highlighted the best of the best by only featuring items at the Target.com review of four stars or better. We are
also leveraging Pinterest in another unique way to collaborate with three of the site's most influential pinners on a series
of party planning collections that will make it easy to throw a Pinterest worthy event. Joy Cho of Oh Joy!, Jan
Halvarson of Poppytalk and Kate Arends of Wit & Delight will each create limited-time-only collections launched over
the course of 2014 including party décor, paper products and serving pieces designed in their signature aesthetic.
Beyond differentiated merchandise, we continue to provide enhanced service in key areas of the store. Based on guest
response to last year's launch, we've expanded the Target Beauty Concierge program to more than 300 stores across the
country, with new markets including New York, New Jersey, San Francisco, and Dallas-Fort Worth. These beauty
consultants are brand agnostic and provide guests with detailed, unbiased information and a friendly face in what can
often be an intimidating category.
We also continue to see great results from the pilot of our new baby layout, a completely redesigned shopping
experience that offers guests inspiring, insightful solutions combined with the great value they've come to expect from
Target. This new layout features a dedicated service desk with a knowledgeable Baby Advisor to help guests navigate
the area and provide unbiased product information. Digital screens and iPads future inspiration and interactive
comparison tools, and baby centered content such as buying guides and product reviews. We've also incorporated an
in-department registry kiosk for expecting moms or guests looking to give a gift. Merchandise displays have been
lowered so guests can more easily interact with large products like travel systems and strollers. We've removed barriers
to enhance navigation between apparel, gear, and baby essentials, and we've highlighted the availability of additional
online only items in key categories.
This summer we plan to grow from 30 stores to more than 200 locations featuring this enhanced baby experience. And,
based on encouraging initial results, in 2014 we'll expand our test of using mannequins and apparel in our larger format
U.S. stores to elevate the store experience, create an enhanced sense of discovery, and bring our unique designs to life.
We also continue to augment our digital capabilities, driving traffic and sales to all of our channels.
Online our top priority in 2014 is continuing to improve the guest experience. All of our efforts will be designed to
make things simple, seamless and enjoyable for our guests. To support this priority, we continue to hire external talent
with deep functional expertise in online merchandising, site merchandising, mobile, and analytics. We've recently made
enhancements focused on search, product information, and checkout, making it easier for guests to browse and
purchase. In addition, now nearly all store products are viewable online, making this the only place that guests can view
Target's full assortment.
Importantly, we are making enhancements while continuing to focus on stability and speed. As a result, Target.com
consistently ranks in the Top 10 for retailer site availability and performance. Given the profile of our guests, mobile is
more important at Target than for many of our peers. For example, Target's guest traffic from tablets and mobile
phones is greater than our traffic from traditional computers. And the shift towards mobile shows no signs of slowing
down. In fact, usage of the Target app doubled in the short period between last summer and the end of the year. To
maintain our strong momentum in mobile, we are testing and learning from new features, including List Building,
Mapping, and Cartwheel capabilities launched during the holiday season. We are improving conversion by streamlining
checkout and enhancing product information and dynamic content, and we're investing to amplify the in-store mobile
experience by rolling out guided maps, in-store search, and expanded assortment chain-wide later this year.
We also continue to invest in our flexible fulfillment capabilities, which combine the strengths of our digital, store and
distribution assets to provide speed and convenience for our guests. These capabilities allow our stores to add value in
new ways, serve our guest as both showrooms and fulfillment centers. Following the holiday season success of in-store
pickup, we are moving quickly to rollout the capability to ship online orders from our stores this fall. This new
capability will create multiple benefits for both Target and our guests, including shorter shipping times, reduced
expenses, lower markdown rates and improved in-stocks. And because our investments in flexible fulfillment drive

greater utilization of our existing stores and distribution center assets, we expect to earn an outstanding return on these
investments over time.
And finally, we're pleased with the initial performance of Target Ticket, our streaming video service, and we continue
to invest in features to better serve guests' changing needs and behaviors, both inside and outside their home. In 2014,
we will coordinate our promotions across channels to provide irresistible video offers across our stores, Target.com,
and Target Ticket.
While our fourth quarter results softened following the December 19 announcement of the data breach, we are pleased
with the guest response to our holiday season merchandising and marketing efforts, and we're confident in our plans for
2014. As always, our focus remains on our guests, helping them regain their confidence in Target while delivering
irresistible content and experiences in every channel. We believe that our efforts will drive a continued recovery in the
pace of our sales and position Target for profitable growth in 2014 and beyond.
Now, John will share his insights on our fourth quarter financial performance and our plans for the coming year. John?
John J. Mulligan
Thanks, Kathee. Our fourth quarter financial results reflect strong efforts by our team to handle separate challenges in
both our U.S. and Canadian segments. In the U.S., comparable sales declined 2.5%, consistent with the updated
guidance we provided in our January press release. This sales performance reflects a 5.5% decline in transactions,
partially offset by an increase in average ticket. Prior to the announcement of the data breach, fourth quarter
comparable sales were running positive, reflecting the success of our holiday merchandising and marketing plan.
Immediately following news of the breach, sales turned meaningfully negatively but began to recover in January. And
while it's impossible to measure precisely, we believe we would have seen even more improvement had there not been
extreme weather across much of the country.
Fourth quarter sales penetration on our REDcards was 28.9%, up 5.4 percentage points from a year ago. While the rate
of increase slowed down following the breach, year-over-year penetration continued to grow hundreds of basis points
through the end of the quarter. Fourth quarter U.S. EBITDA and EBIT margin rates were down more than a percentage
point from last year's rates, which were revised to reflect combined results from our former U.S. retail and credit card
segments. These profit margins were below our expectations going into the quarter, driven almost entirely by gross
margin rate, which declined about 20 basis points from a year ago.
This performance reflects about 20 basis points of benefit from this year's change in vendor payments, offset by higher
than expected markdowns related to the 10% off weekend we offered prior to Christmas, as well as the impact of
clearance markdowns at the end of the holiday season. Margin mix was somewhat less favorable than in recent
quarters, driven by strong sales in electronics. While below our expectations, fourth quarter U.S. segment gross margin
rate was remarkably strong, considering the team had to rapidly manage excess inventory in the middle of the quarter
when we experienced a sudden change in the pace of sales following the data breach announcement.
Our fourth quarter U.S. segment SG&A rate was 18.4%, about 110 basis points above last year's revised rate. About 50
basis points of this headwind was related to the credit card portfolio, reflecting a smaller asset base, last year's reserve
release, and this year's profit sharing arrangement with TD Bank. Another 20 basis points of headwind was driven by
this year's change in vendor payments. The remaining unfavorability reflects the deleveraging effect of negative comp
sales. The fact that we experienced only 40 basis points of deleverage reflects strong control of variable expenses,
given the magnitude of our comparable sales decline.
In the Canadian segment, sales came in just below expectations. Importantly, as Gregg mentioned, we took advantage
of holiday traffic to clear through a significant amount of excess inventory in the quarter. And while we expect some
small lingering issues with long lead receipts this year, the Canadian segment ended 2013 in a much cleaner inventory
position, paving the way for smoother operations in 2014. In all, the segment drove $0.40 of EPS dilution in the fourth
quarter, better than the expectations we provided in our January press release.

Turning now to our consolidated metrics, fourth quarter interest expense was 21% lower than last year, reflecting the
continued benefit of debt retirement, funded by the proceeds from the sale of the credit card portfolio. We paid
dividends of $0.43 per share in the quarter, an increase of more than 19% from fourth quarter 2012. This was the 185th
consecutive quarter in which our company has paid a dividend, and 2013 marked the 42nd year of annual dividend
increases, a track record few companies can match.
Consistent with last quarter, we didn't purchase any shares in the fourth quarter, reflecting current performance and our
desire to maintain our debt rating in the middle-A range. This approach aligned with our long-standing point of view on
capital deployment, first, we invest what we believe is appropriate in our core business. Second, we support the
dividend, which we've grown annually for more than four decades. And third, we use share repurchase to return cash
within the limits of our middle-A debt rating. We believe a middle-A rating is strategically important, as it supports our
ability to reliably deliver on our unbeatable pricing strategy over time. In addition, our balance sheet provides the
flexibility to maintain our long-term focus in the face of unexpected events like the data breach, enabling investment
and strategic initiatives like flexible fulfillment while we deal with the temporary setback in traffic and sales along with
other costs related to the breach.
In addition to operating results in the U.S. and Canada, our fourth quarter GAAP earnings reflect several items that
reduced EPS by approximately $0.09. These items include charges related to our January restructuring, data
breach-related costs, net of an insurance receivable, and continued reduction in the beneficial interest asset partially
offset by a small benefit from the resolution of income tax matters. Combining fourth quarter results with performance
in the first nine months of 2013 yields full year results that reflect the impact of clear successes and certain challenges.
In our U.S. segment, full year comparable sales declined 0.4%, well below our expectations going into the year. This
reflects a tougher-than-expected consumer environment, including the impact of the payroll tax increase which just
annualized last month, the fourth quarter impact of the data breach, and recent headwinds from unfavorable weather, as
you've heard from many other retailers. On our U.S. sales, we earned a gross margin rate of 29.8% in 2013, up about 10
basis points from 2012. This rate reflects about 20 basis points of benefit from this year's change in vendor payments,
combined with very strong underlying margin performance in the face of softer-than-expected sales. Throughout the
year, Kathee's team did a great job managing inventory, resulting in outstanding in-stock levels, while avoiding
unnecessary clearance markdowns.
Our full year SG&A expense rate in the U.S. was 20%, up about 90 basis points from last year's revised rate. Contrary
to what you might initially think, this reflects outstanding performance in light of softer-than-expected sales and some
notable challenges representing more than $600 million of incremental pressure. Including credit card portfolio income,
which as you know, reduces our SG&A rate, about $400 million lower than 2012, reflecting profit sharing with TD,
prior-year reserve reductions, and a smaller asset base this year. And more than $200 million of expense pressure from
incremental investments in technology and supply chain to support our multi-channel efforts.
Without these impacts, our SG&A expense rate would've been slightly higher than 2012, but would've been neutral
without this year's change in vendor payments. This is better expense performance than we'd expect on decline in
comparable sales, and was driven primarily by two factors; outstanding performance by our stores organization which
continues to provide outstanding guest service while delivering productivity increases; and our company-wide expense
optimization efforts through which our teams are finding better ways to work while de-prioritizing less productive
activities.
As Gregg mentioned, the team continues to find new opportunities to optimize expenses and we expect to reach $1
billion in annualized savings by 2015, helping to fund our drive – helping to fund our efforts to drive profitable growth
over the next several years.
For full year 2013, U.S. REDcard penetration grew nearly six percentage points to 19.3% of sales as more and more
guests increased their level of engagement and their spending with Target. Penetration in Kansas City, where we began
offering REDcard Rewards a year ahead of the rest of the country, continues to run well ahead of the U.S. overall.
Importantly, as part of our broader effort to rebuild traffic and sales in 2014, we will work to reaccelerate REDcard
growth in light of the recent slowdown in growth we've seen following the data breach.

In Canada in 2013, we generated just over $1.3 billion in sales on 124 stores, which were open on average for a little
more than half the year. These sales were well below our plan going into the year leading to greater-than-expected
markdowns on a meaningful amount of excess inventory. Expense rates were unusually high as well as a result of
opening early cycle stores with too many payroll hours, incurring incremental expense related to clearing inventory,
and experiencing less leverage on fixed expenses. In the face of these challenges, the team worked tirelessly to improve
operations and work through excess inventory throughout the year clearing the way for an acceleration of sales and
profitability beginning this year.
Our early cycle stores continue to outperform later cycle stores, giving us confidence that our operations will continue
to become more efficient as our business matures. And having dramatically reduced the congestion on our Canadian
supply chain, we will increase the intensity of our marketing message in 2014 regarding value and assortment in our
frequency categories. Over time, we expect this will lead our Canadian guest to choose Target more often in these
categories, driving meaningful increases in traffic and sales.
Turning to capital deployment, our total capital investment was about $3.5 billion in 2013, somewhat lower than
expected as U.S. CapEx of about $1.9 billion was approximately $300 million lower than anticipated. This outcome
doesn't reflect a change in strategy but is simply the result of a lower-than-expected cost for certain projects and
re-timing of the spending in 2014. Having sold our credit card portfolio for about $5.7 billion in March, we've
significantly reduced our net debt position in 2013, including the early retirement of high coupon debt. And
importantly, even in a year of peak CapEx and dilution related to the Canadian segment, combined with the impact of
softer-than-expected U.S. sales, we still had the capacity to return about $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of
dividends and share repurchase.
With that as context, let's turn now to our outlook for 2014. But before we get to the numbers, I want to discuss a
change in our reporting and guidance practices in 2014. Giving that our Canadian segment is now fully operating,
beginning with the first quarter of 2014, we will no longer exclude Canadian segment performance from adjusted EPS.
To allow for appropriate comparison, last year's adjusted EPS will also reflect Canadian segment performance as well.
With that, let's turn to our full year outlook, beginning with sales. While trends have improved in recent weeks, severe
winter weather has been a headwind, and we continue to see the impact of the data breach on guest sentiment and
traffic. We believe that we'll continue to see muted trends in the next few months, but the breach impact will diminish
throughout the year as we engaged in a vigorous effort to address our guest concerns and provide irresistible content
and offers, driving visits to our stores and digital channels. In addition, while economic trends are improving, we
continue to expect our lower and middle income guests to shop very cautiously in 2014. With that backdrop, our
current view is that U.S. comparable sales will grow in the range of 0% to 2% in 2014.
On those sales, we expect a U.S. segment EBITDA rate of 10.1% to 10.3%, meaning EBITDA dollars should grow
between 5% and 8% this year. Among the drivers of EBITDA margin, we expect gross margin will improve 30 to 40
basis points from our 2013 rate of 29.8%, reflecting improved clearance markdown rates and more significantly the
gross margin benefit of our expense optimization efforts. These benefits will be partially offset by the impact of
additional promotional activities and continued investment in 5% REDcard Rewards. We expect a U.S. segment SG&A
expense rate slightly better than last year's 20% rate, reflecting continued discipline expense control and the benefit of
our expense optimization efforts offset by our continued investments in distribution and technology in support of our
multi-channel efforts. We expect these [ph] express (42:21) investments to be worth $0.05 to $0.10 of incremental EPS
pressure in 2014.
In Canada, we expect total sales will be approximately double our 2013 experience as we annualize last year's 124
openings and begin generating comparable sales growth in mature stores. On those sales, we expect to earn a much
higher gross margin rate in the range approaching 30%, but clearly we'll continue to see some near-term volatility until
the Canadian business matures.
While we expect to see better fixed expense leverage in 2014, the SG&A rate will likely remain well above our
long-term outlook in a range approaching 40%. Altogether, this would lead to a Canadian segment EBITDA margin

rate of minus 8% to minus 10%, representing more than $400 million of expected EBITDA improvement from 2013.
We expect U.S. capital expenditures of $2.3 billion, up slightly from actual 2013 spending. The mix of U.S. CapEx will
continue to tilt from investments in new stores toward supply chain and technology, as we accelerate our multi-channel
efforts and continue to find a limited number of new store sites that meet our strategic and financial criteria. I should
also note that U.S. CapEx reflects incremental investment related to our recent decision to accelerate deployment of
chip-enabled card readers to all of our U.S. stores before the end of the year.
In Canada, we expect 2014 capital expenditures in the $300 million to $400 million range, down more than $1 billion
from peak spending in 2013. We expect, once again, to raise our annual dividend in the neighborhood of 20% this year,
which will mark our 43rd consecutive annual increase. And even with the tempered outlook for near-term traffic and
sales, and understanding there will be further cost related to the data breach, our current outlook envision share
repurchase capacity of $1 billion to $2 billion in 2014, beginning later in the year as our business stabilizes and we
have more clarity on potential breach-related costs.
Altogether, these expectations would lead to full year adjusted EPS, representing results from operations in the U.S.
and Canada, of $3.85 to $4.15. This estimate excludes approximately $0.07 of dilution related to the continued
reduction in the beneficial interest asset. These 2014 expectations represent an improvement of more than 20% from
combined U.S. and Canadian segment results in 2013.
Please note that our full year outlook does not include potential additional costs related to the data breach beyond what
we already recorded in the fourth quarter, as they are not estimable at this time. While I realize this may result in a wide
range of speculation on the magnitude of these costs, given that our investigation of the breach is ongoing, it would not
be appropriate to say anything more about it than we already have this morning. Regardless of the ultimate dollar
amounts, as Gregg mentioned, we have the financial strength to move beyond these near-term impacts while we
continue to invest in the future. And as always, we're focused on what's most important, addressing the concerns of our
guests and helping them to feel confident shopping with us.
Now let's briefly turn to our first quarter outlook. In the U.S., we expect first quarter comparable sales in the range of
flat to down 2%. So far in February, comparable sales have been running within that range, ahead of our forecasts and
nearly flat to last year. And I should note, while growth isn't running where it had been earlier in 2013, REDcard
penetration so far in February has been running hundreds of basis points ahead of last year. On our first quarter U.S.
sales, we expect an EBITDA margin rate of 9.7% to 9.9%. In Canada, we expect to generate first quarter sales in a
range of $400 million to $450 million with EBITDA of minus $150 million to minus $170 million. In light of this
near-term operating outlook, we don't expect to have the capacity to repurchase shares in the first quarter, but we
expect to resume this activity later in the year.
Altogether, our expectations would lead to first quarter adjusted EPS reflecting operating results in the U.S. and Canada
in the range of $0.60 to $0.75, excluding $0.02 related to the reduction in the beneficial interest asset and any potential
costs related to the data breach. While this has been a challenging year, we are proud of the work of our team, and we
believe we have the right plans in place to generate meaningfully improved performance in 2014. As we focus on
making Target irresistible for our guests both today and over time, we believe we will grow profitably for many years
to come.
With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks. Now Gregg, Kathee, and I will be happy to respond to your
questions.

<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, on the same-store sales trends
for February being down in that 0% to 2% range, probably a little bit better than people expected, I guess just over
time, Target has been on an aggressive campaign to drive frequency with REDcard and remodeling more stores
towards Food, but given that PFresh is maturing here and the credit breach could curb some of the willingness to sign
up for REDcards and online taking a bigger portion of the overall retail landscape, how should we think about some of
the big initiatives or the big picture initiatives to drive same-store sales trends in 2014 and beyond?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: You know, Sean, I think a lot of the things that I talked about today with product, as well as
with in-store experience and our mobile experience, those are really the key things for us to help drive people to shop at
Target beyond the food that you talked about and of course, the REDcard.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: And then just on the food, I guess, aspect of things, how are you on the in-stocks in that
particular category and are you happy with the product that you have out there on the shelf today?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Yeah. In-stocks have been rock solid for quite some time and in terms of product, I would
tell you that we're always making adjustments to what we carry in store. We learn what's selling and what trends are
picking up steam, things like organics and better-for-you products, so that's a never-ending thing that we work on.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. Great. And then just one last thing, you mentioned the online and the flexible
fulfillment, I think that all of those can now be viewed online, which is great for the consumer, but when do you think
or is it going to be possible for all of those products for buying online and picking up in store?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: We are expanding the assortment right now. I don't have a date for you in terms of when
we'll get our whole assortment up online, and right now we're focusing on the most popular items and categories, so we
recently added Pets, for example, and we'll just continue to expand as we learn more and more about that program.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot, and good morning. I've got two questions, and the first relates to inventory. I
know you cleared a lot of inventory in Canada. Your year-on-year numbers still across the corporation, across the
enterprise is still up quite substantially relative to sales, so if you could comment on sort of the composition of that
inventory and your thought process for its impact on margin going forward?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Sure. Inventory up about 10% year-over-year, and you can roughly think about that split
about equally between Canada and the U.S. Canada, obviously, we're just in a different place than we were a year ago.
We built inventories all year as we opened stores. I will tell you, in Canada we feel much, much better, we feel very
good about the progress we made in the fourth quarter clearing excess inventory. The average inventory per store in
Canada from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter went down about 30%, so we still have some
lingering issues in Q1 with some long lead receipts but feel very good about the inventory there.
In the U.S., I would tell you the merchant team did an outstanding job reacting to the change in sales, and our
inventories are in excellent shape. This is the time of year, we're in February, we are changing lots of things in the store
and frankly, depending on where you snap the line for year-end relative to our receipts, we see inventory move around
a little bit. If you go back over the past couple of years, our inventory per store in the U.S. is up about 3% versus two
years ago, So this is really more timing than anything else, and we feel very good about the inventory position.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up relates to capital allocation and
specifically the buyback. I know that you alluded to the company's desire to maintain its current credit rating and that
you spoke about resuming buybacks as the year progressed presuming that you are on plan. I just want to talk about
what your thought process is for contingencies, and that based on the numbers we've looked at, it seems like you're a
long way from coming close to the edge on your current credit rating. So what would it take for you not to do that $1

billion to $2 billion? It seems like that should be well within your financial capacity even if, frankly, the numbers are a
bit light of your current guide.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Well, we should go offline and review where you think we are versus our credit rating
and where we think we are versus our credit rating. We've actually run pretty close to our credit rating not just last year,
which was even higher, but for the past several years. So our view is that we think we can do, given our plans, between
$1 billion and $2 billion. We need to see our business results improve over the next couple of quarters. We're starting to
see that in February, as we alluded to. And then also, get a little bit of a view into what the potential costs are that may
be coming our way as a result of the breach. But given all of that, we still think somewhere in $1 billion to $2 billion
beginning probably in the back half of the year for the year makes sense.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: And just finally, I know you're not going to quantify the cost of the breach, but it sounds
like in thinking about the capacity to buy back stock you have somewhere internally a sense of that number that would
enable you to pursue that course?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: As we said, it's not estimable at this time, what the potential cost of the breach is. And
given where we are in the process, it'd be inappropriate for me to speculate.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Fair enough. Thank you so much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks. I had a couple of questions. Just a quick follow-up on the breach costs. You
showed a net. You got some insurance payments from the breach, costs that you had. Should we expect that you have
any insurance for these potential costs, whatever they may be, or is that sort of a one-off in the quarter? And a
follow-up.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Just to be clear, that was insurance receivable, so we haven't actually received payment,
but we feel very likely to receive payment for a portion of the expenses we incurred in the fourth quarter. What we can
say about insurance right now is at this point, we think there's $44 million of insurance that we'll receive, and to the
extent that number changes, we'll be back to you to provide more information.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. Great. Bigger picture on REDcard and traffic. I mean, if traffic was down 5.5% in the
quarter, presumably post the breach it was down, pick a number like 7% or 8%. Is it fair to say that traffic has
recovered back to what it was in January and February or where we are now? And how is REDcard seasoning? Those
people have now had it for three or four years. How are those people behaving following the breach? Thanks.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Yeah, on traffic, your view of what happened post the breach is pretty accurate. And we
have seen traffic continue to improve and firm up, and definitely throughout February, we've seen traffic firm up. And
as we said, sales have improved and a big part of that has been traffic. On the REDcard, what we've seen is, and Kathee
talked about this a little bit, in our core guests, REDcard guests, they've continued to shop with us and we see very
strong sales from that. REDcard penetration continues to grow meaningfully, hundreds of basis points year-over-year.
And to the extent we're not growing where we used to, that's driven by new accounts. So the guests who have
REDcards continue to shop our stores.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: So it's more of the penetration growth from new people signing up or from people that signed
up shopping more?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: As has been the case over the past couple of years, the penetration growth comes from
new accounts.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. Thanks a lot. Good luck.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Nemer with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little
more color on the comp spreads that you're seeing between states that have been severely impacted by weather and
some of your warmer-weather states?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Great question, Matt. Analyzing weather isn't a perfect science. I would say when we see
in the Midwest and the Northeast, when we're seeing these weather patterns go across the country, the spread is
significant between the two. But ultimately, as that passes, we see them restabilize and everything come back to
normal. But the difference while it is going on is pretty dramatic. It's in single digits difference, but it'll be high single
digits.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Okay. Thanks. And then secondly, you gave some great detail on your investments in digital
and eCommerce this year. As you enable Click and Collect and fulfillment from store, are there any significant
investments you need to make in terms of inventory accuracy in the store, and could you just give us maybe a bit of
color on how that's running in terms of being able to pickup in-store?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: We're always working on inventory accuracy, and that is a combination of how we use our
systems as well as processes in-store. And so it's been less of an issue to-date. As we get into some of the additional
categories, things like Beauty, where there's a lot of SKUs, we've got to make sure that the accuracy is there. I will tell
you Apparel, while we've had good results there, it's a little bit harder. Partly accuracy, but partly being able to find the
exact size when it's not in a planogrammed environment. So there are a few challenges for us to figure out, but overall,
I would tell you that our guests' response has been very positive and the survey comments that they have back to us,
they really love the service. So yes, we will keep working on accuracy to make sure that we can fulfill as many orders
as possible. But so far, we're very pleased.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Okay. And then lastly, your SG&A per foot in the U.S. was down pretty substantially in the
fourth quarter versus the last few years. How should we think about SG&A per foot on a full-year basis for 2014 in the
U.S.? Is that a number that you can keep relatively flat? Or is there just some inherent inflation there that we should
expect?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: First, the comparison to the last year, we have to be a little bit careful, there is a 53rd week in
there that's a relatively low volume week, which creates a little bit of distortion year-over-year. But I think as I said, we
continue to work very hard on store productivity, ensuring that we're driving great guest experience and in-stocks but
also improving our productivity, and all of the expense optimization efforts continue to go on, and some portion of that
will fall to the bottom line, some portion of that goes to gross margin, and some portion of that gets reinvested in the
business as we invest in multi-channel technologies supply chain. But I think flat to up slightly is probably about the
best way to think about it.

above 20%.

<Q - Robert Drbul>: Okay. And then when you look at the full year, [indiscernible] (59:49) you gave a lot of details,
in terms of like the sales recovery that you have, what are the key factors that give you the comfort and confidence in
the recovery over this year as you plan your earnings and sales trajectory?

great content, great in-stocks, our team is more engaged than ever from a service standpoint, both on the sales floor and
at the lanes. And we're going to deliver, as Kathee said, just some eye-popping irresistible deals. So we're going to
really up the ante as it relates to making a statement on our unbeatable pricing proposition, which we have. I mean, we
price match the competition, and we run our circulars, and with our 5% REDcard Rewards program, our pricing, our
value proposition is unbeatable. So we're just going to call greater attention to that and selectively we're going to go out
and be more aggressive in that regard. So it's a combination of all of those elements.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: And then on the gross margin outlook for Canada, can you just talk about the mix assumptions in
there and sort of also like the ramp from where you finished fourth quarter to get to that 30% number for the year?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Sure. Mix in Canada continues to be stronger in Apparel and Home. And we expect that to
moderate through time. We ultimately think the mix there will be stronger than what we see in the U.S. but a lot like
our high volume stores in the U.S, our urban stores in the U.S., we see a higher mix of Home and Apparel sales. That
will moderate through time because we want to drive the frequency categories. That's what we're working on the team
in Canada, ultimately if they're successful in driving conversion and commodities, grocery, food, all those categories
will see that mix moderate. I think we'll see margin, we expect to see some volatility. Q1, for instance, the margin rate
won't be at 30%, but it will be significantly improved from the 4.4% we recorded in the fourth quarter. So we'll make
progress and you should expect to see that throughout the year, and of course, back in fourth quarter next year, we will
be down a little bit from that 30%, as is typical in our U.S. business given that time of year.
<Q - Robert Drbul>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Okay. We have time for one more question, please.
Operator
Okay. Your final question comes from line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks and good morning. A couple of random questions. So could you perhaps
breakout how much was the explicit impact of the 10% off deal that you did after the breach and right ahead of
Christmas?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Chris, we don't breakout promotions individually. It was a big time of year and the number
was relatively large, but in the big scheme of the fourth quarter, I would tell you it's not material.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Okay. And then on the cost savings side, how much of the $1 billion is done so far, and
what has been the big drivers this year that have taken those costs out?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: You know there's $200 million that we recorded in 2013, we'll annualize on that next year,
and the savings came from all over the corporation. There were savings in gross margin around transportation
expenses. That will grow again in 2014. There were savings, really it's hard to pin it down. It was literally across the
entire organization where we looked at things. We looked at how we sourced product and aligning our non-retail
product that we sourced in services and making that look more like we do in merchandising. And we saw significant
savings there from our sourcing. There's more to do there, and we'll see that grow in 2014 as well. But as Gregg said, it
was literally across the entire organization where we were focused on stopping things that we didn't need to do. And if
we did need to do them, improving productivity.

<Q - Christopher Horvers>: And then one last one. If you had chip technology in your stores this past year, how
would the breach outcomes change? Would it have stopped the actual theft of the credit card data? Or would it have
stopped the personal information disclosure?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: The chip technology makes it such that using the account numbers without the card becomes
much more difficult. And so the desire to obtain those card numbers goes down significantly. What we've seen in other
countries that have adopted chip technology is, fraud rates go down dramatically for in-store transactions. And, I think
in the U.K. or Europe, I can't remember exactly, down like 60% once chip technology was enabled. And so those
account numbers just become less desirable.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: But didn't the breach actually come from systems internally, not necessarily coming
from the card readers?
<A - Gregg W. Steinhafel>: Chris, we're the middle of an investigation, and we can't talk about the specifics. We
continue to learn. There'll be learnings that come out of that investigation, and from those learnings we'll take action.
And that's about what we can say today.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Fair enough. Thanks very much.
