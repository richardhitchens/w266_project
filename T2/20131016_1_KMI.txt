MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be in a listen-only mode until the
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections,
you may disconnect at this time.
Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Kelly, and welcome everybody to the third quarter earnings call of Kinder Morgan. As usual, we'll
be making statements within the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
I'll give an overview of the quarter and 2013. Steve Kean, our Chief Operating Officer will go into more details of
segment performance and talk about our project backlog. And then Kim Dang our Chief Financial Officer will review
the details of the financial results for the quarter and year-to-date and then we'll take your questions.
The Kinder Morgan companies had a good third quarter and I think we're on track for a very good year. At KMI, we
raised the dividend to $0.41. That's an increase of 14% from the third quarter of 2012. In terms of cash available for
dividends in the quarter, it was up 17% from the comparable quarter a year ago. We're on track for 14% growth in
declared dividends for the full year of 2013 and we expect to declare at least $1.60 versus $1.40 for the full year of
2012 and versus the 2013 original budget at KMI of $1.57.
KMI continues to benefit from strong growth and performance at KMP and from solid cash flow generation at EPB. At
KMP, we raised the distribution to a $1.35. That's up 7% from the third quarter of 2012. Our DCF before certain items

was up 22% for the quarter. For the full year 2013, we expect to declare dividends of $5.33, that's up 7% from the full
year 2012 and is $0.06 above the $5.27 target in our budget for 2013. At EPB, we raised the distribution to $0.65.
That's an increase of 12% from the third quarter of 2012. For the full year 2013, we still expect to distribute $2.55 per
unit, and that's up 13% from full year 2012 and consistent with EPB's budget for the full year 2013.
I believe the long-term opportunities for the Kinder Morgan companies look very positive. Our project backlog, which
Steve will talk about in more detail, grew again this quarter to about $14.4 billion versus $14 billion last quarter and
$12.6 billion at the time of our Investor Conference in January of 2013. These projects in the backlog are spread across
all five of our business segments. And in addition to that backlog, there are numerous other projects that we're working
on that have great potential and are likely to occur, but they're not sufficiently definite to put in our backlog at this time.
We remain very bullish on the future of natural gas as the fuel of choice in the U.S. for decades to come. We see
increased demand coming from increased use for electric generation, downstream industrial use particularly along the
Gulf Coast, LNG liquefaction for export and exports to Mexico. All in all, we expect demand for natural gas in the
U.S., including the exports of LNG and to Mexico, to increase from a level of about 70 Bcf a day today to something
approaching 90 Bcf per day over the next 10 years. And we think with our 70,000-plus miles of natural gas pipelines,
we expect to benefit enormously from this growth.
We also expect to benefit substantially from additional production of and demand for NGLs, condensate and crude,
driven by the shale plays, particularly the Eagle Ford where we have committed almost $900 million to our crude and
condensate facilities and also production from the Marcellus and Utica.
We also expect continued strong demand for CO2 in the Permian Basin, which we are attacking by expanding the
source and transportation part of our CO2 segment. And we see continued demand for additional liquid storage
facilities in our Terminals group. And finally, we continue to progress on our major expansion of the Trans Mountain
system in Canada.
Let me conclude my part by talking briefly about our ability to reduce O&M expenses along the El Paso pipelines we
acquired back in May of 2012. In an earlier call, we itemized in some detail the changes in sustaining CapEx between
2011, which was prior to our acquisition in 2013 and we showed we were actually spending more on pipeline integrity
on these pipes when you total both sustaining CapEx and expenses related to that area.
Since that call, we've gotten a couple of questions regarding reduction in O&M between 2011 and 2013. And we
thought the simplest way to explain this is to compare the GAAP O&M expenses for 2011 were the major El Paso
pipelines, that's Tennessee Gas Pipeline, El Paso Natural Gas, Colorado Interstate, and Southern Natural Gas to
compare the 2011 GAAP O&M expenses for those four pipelines with the budgeted expenses on those same categories
for the same pipelines in 2013.
This is as close to apples-to-apples as I think you can get and obviously all these figures are public record and you can
verify them. In 2011, these expenditures were $865 million and the budget number for 2013 is $674 million or a
difference of $191 million. The budget for 2013 is obviously the budget, the year's not yet finished, but just as a sanity
check, we went back and looked at the trailing 12 months as of 6/30/2013 and that's $670 million. So we're very much
on track with where the budget is.
So you subtract $674 million from $865 million and you get a difference of $191 million. Of that $191 million
difference, we reconciled about $182 million of it for you or 95% of that reduction, and let me give you a brief
overview of those changes.
Payroll benefits and associated employee expenses resulted in a decrease of $161 million. Now that's not surprising
because as a result of the merger, we eliminated 803 positions in the combined entity. Out of that $161 million
reduction, $121 million of it was as a result of personnel reductions in G&A and at the gas group level. Only
approximately $40 million resulted from field reductions.
The next item is actually an increase and that's the pipeline integrity expenses. We spent $63 million more in 2013 than
was spent under prior management in 2011. That is completely consistent with the increase we talked about in the

earlier call relating to sustaining CapEx. We had lower, non-pipeline integrity maintenance expenses of $33 million.
Our cost of gas across these pipeline systems was $28 million less in 2013 than it was in 2011. Vehicle and aviation
expenses were reduced by $12 million and we had maintenance savings in the O&M categories related to divested
offshore assets primarily at the Tennessee Gas Pipeline of $11 million. If you put all those up that I've just mentioned,
that's an explanation for a reduction of $182 million. And if you want more detail on that, [ph] David Michaels (8:25),
our Vice President of Investor Relations can give you more detail on all these items.
But I think, in my judgment, what all this shows once again is that while at Kinder Morgan, we try to operate our
pipelines in the most efficient manner possible, when we acquire assets, we reduce fat not muscle or bone and I think
our EHS record supports that conclusion.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve for a review of the segments and talking about our project backlog. Steve?
Steven J. Kean
All right. I'm going to go through the segments focusing on performance third quarter to third quarter last year versus
this, our expectations versus plan for the full year, and then some of the business drivers and the backlog.
Starting with Gas, the Gas segment at KMP is up 59% on an earnings before DD&A basis to $608 million versus $383
million in the same quarter last year. The increase is the result of the dropdown transactions, TGP and EPNG and also
the acquisition of the other 50% of El Paso Midstream from a third-party owner, and the closing of the Copano
transaction in May of this year. So these acquisitions more than offset the year-over-year negative of the divested
Rockies assets that we had to sell pursuant to the FTC order to close the El Paso transaction.
With respect to the performance versus plan, this segment is expected to exceed its plan for the year, but entirely as a
result of the Copano acquisition.
From a volume standpoint, higher Eagle Ford volumes drove improved year-over-year performance of the Texas
intrastates. But we had lower overall transport volumes across the segment versus the third quarter of last year as a
result of lower gas demand for electric generation versus that record year that we experienced in 2012. If you focus in
on EPB, that lower demand in electric generation on the SNG system and the impact of rate case settlements on SNG
and WIC caused EPB's asset earnings before DD&A to be down slightly in the quarter versus third quarter last year,
$286 million versus $299 million last year.
But looking ahead, we added to our project backlog in this segment primarily in EPB, and overall we continue to
identify and capture opportunities for expansion, driven by export opportunities in LNG, Mexico and even Canada and
on the need to transport gas out of the shale plays, primarily Eagle Ford and Marcellus. And turning to Mexico, in
particular, we believe that U.S. gas exports are the best way to meet growing Mexican demand, and we believe that our
assets are perhaps the best positioned to serve that demand.
Turning to CO2, segment earnings before DD&A in this segment were $349 million for the quarter, up 5% from last
year and on track to slightly exceed its budgeted growth of 5% for the full year. The growth here was driven by higher
oil and NGL volumes and higher prices. The growth in oil volumes was due to Katz and to the recently acquired
Goldsmith unit, and that more than offset slight year-over-year declines at SACROC and Yates. Katz oil production in
particular was about 2,700 barrels per day average for the quarter versus 1,800 barrels a day a year earlier, so up 50%,
and Katz has been around running 3,250 barrels a day in the current month, so moving in the right direction. We
continued to see strong demand for CO2 and are actively pursuing several large development projects to bring more
CO2 to our fields and also to the market.
Products segment earnings before DD&A for the quarter was $202 million, up 9% versus last year, and expected to be
slightly below its budgeted growth of 12% on a full year basis. The shortfall to full year plan is primarily due to the
impact of the California Court of Appeals rate decision on SFPP that we talked about last quarter and due to lower
volumes on KMCC versus the volumes we had in the plan. Now with respect to KMCC, we have contract minimums
on that asset and we receive revenues even when shippers aren't using their full entitlement. But we don't recognize

those revenues until makeup rights are fully taken into account. So, there's a little bit of an uplift associated with that
business going from 2013 into 2014.
Those two negatives are offsetting above plan performance that we experienced at Cochin transmix and the Products
segment terminal facilities. And again this segment is up nicely from last year. It has a number of very good projects
under construction and in the backlog. Also of note in this segment is the strong increase in refined products volumes
year-over-year with volumes up 6.6% on a quarter-to-quarter basis when you include Plantation and 4.1% without
Plantation. That's the biggest upward move we've seen for quite a while. We saw increases in gasoline, biofuels, and
NGL volumes versus the third quarter last year. Now some of that was probably some short-haul volumes that may not
recur, but it was an uptick certainly in what appears to be the base business.
Terminals, segment earnings before DD&A for the third quarter was $199 million, up 7% from last year but we expect
this segment to be slightly below its budgeted 12% growth on a full year basis. Year-over-year growth was driven by
increased throughput and higher renewal rates at Pasadena and Galena Park Liquids facilities here in Ship Channel as
well as additional petcoke volumes and revenues versus the same quarter last year. Our bulk volumes were essentially
flat year-over-year looking at third quarter. We had decreasing coal volumes but we had increases in petcoke and steel
volumes versus third quarter last year.
We also started bringing online our BOSTCO Terminal project in the Ship Channel. That project is already being
expanded and will under the current contracts be expanded to a total of 7.1 million barrels of capacity with associated
barge and ship dock space. And this is one of several projects that we've had where we've gotten expansions under
contract before we've even gotten the first project done. That's true of BOSTCO, it's true of our Edmonton facility and
also true of our splitter facility in the Houston Ship Channel. Phase 1 of our IMT coal terminal expansion was
completed during the quarter, and we continued to identify and capture a lot of new opportunities for expansion in this
business too.
Kinder Morgan Canada segment earnings before DD&A were $44 million versus $56 million in the same quarter last
year and that decline was due almost exclusively to the sale of our Express-Platte pipeline system and a weaker
Canadian dollar year-over-year. But the main story for this segment is, as it has been, our progress on the $5.4 billion
expansion of our Trans Mountain pipeline which we're expanding from 3,000 barrels a day to 890,000 barrels a day.
That expansion is under long-term contracts which have been approved by the NEB. Still to come there is the filing of
our facilities application with the NEB which we expect to file in December of this year and still expecting service by
the end of 2017.
Now, turning to other elements of our project backlog, starting with our January Investor Conference and several times
since then we've updated that backlog and it's been growing with every update. And this includes our high probability
projects. Projects that are under construction but aren't yet producing revenue, under contract that don't have permits
perhaps or very close to having contracts but anyway projects that we have a high degree of confidence are going to get
done. So that this quarter the backlog increased from $14 billion to $14.4 billion.
Also during the quarter, we had almost $300 million of capital projects come online and when they come online, we
roll them off the backlog. So what we're seeing is additions to that backlog that increase the overall backlog while
offsetting the projects that came into service. Of the larger projects that came into service, Parkway in our refined
products pipeline project came online. That's our facility in Louisiana and Mississippi and our petcoke handling facility
for BP at its Whiting, Indiana refinery.
Now, a few facts about the composition of the backlog across the business units and across the years. The Gas group is
up from last time from $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Most of that increase is associated with additional pipeline capacity
in LNG, liquefaction investment on the SNG and Elba Island assets. So, these are primarily in our EPB project area or
EPB MLP. We do not have in the backlog our joint venture projects with MarkWest to process gas in the Marcellus and
Utica and ship Y-grade to the Gulf Coast. We believe we have a very attractive solution for producers presented in both
of those projects, but we won't add them to the backlog until we see commitments come through and we're still working
on those commitments.

The Products group backlog is up slightly, but still rounding to $1 billion same as last time, and new projects in the
Eagle Ford and on Cochin are more than replacing the now in service Parkway project.
Terminals is also up slightly but still rounding to $2.1 billion, same as last time. The new projects there, primarily
liquids facilities including some crude by rail projects and expansions of those projects are offsetting projects going
into service during the quarter, which included the BP petcoke facility as well as fertilizer terminals expansion and
IMT.
CO2 is up to a little over $2.9 billion from what had been just under $2.8 billion previously. And there is some shifting
there from EOR, Enhanced Oil Recovery, projects into more CO2 source and transportation projects. And in this
segment, our backlog is a little bit more based on development plans, our development plans as opposed to
commitments to specific customers. And as a consequence, as those development plans change, these numbers move a
little bit more than our other business segments do, but up in CO2 since our last update. And again, the biggest project
is KM Canada, the $5.4 billion expansion and a reminder on this project too that we're in development and we'll be in
development for quite a while and our development costs are recovered through demand charges that we receive on
firm capacity that we sold across our dock. And so this is a project where we're getting our development costs
recovered.
You also recall at the recent investor presentations, we showed you the backlog, as we were showing it to you, it was
kind of back-end loaded as a consequence of the TMX project coming on toward the end of the backlog and also the
liquefaction projects. And then it was a bit front-end loaded with projects that were in the near-term and the middle
years were a little more hollowed out, 2014 to 2015 were a little bit lower. We also told you that we expected as we
went on that we'd fill those years. Most of our projects were contracting for 12 to 24 months out and that's happened.
So, in the revised backlog, we've increased 2014 and 2015 by almost $600 million and almost $300 million
respectively.
So, the bottom line is that we're continuing to find new opportunities that are more than offsetting projects that are
going into service. We have a large number of projects coming into service in the fourth quarter which is a good thing
and we've got a lot of good prospects and so we'll update this once we get through the fourth quarter.
And so, that's it for the backlog and with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay. And I'll go through the numbers starting with KMP and you should have four pages of numbers. I'm going to go
and focus on the second page of numbers which is our distributable cash flow and that's how we look at performance.
Let me point out that that distributable cash flow is reconciled to our GAAP numbers and we provide details for you on
all the certain items and adjustments.
But in the quarter, as Rich mentioned, DCF was $1.27 per unit. That's down slightly from the third quarter of last year.
But on a year-to-date basis $3.94, up $0.22 or 6% on a year-to-date basis and for the full year we expect DCF per unit
to be up about 6.7%.
The $1.27 based on a $1.35 declared distribution results in about $34 million of negative coverage in the quarter and as
we told you, and we've told you all year, we expect coverage to be negative in the second and third quarter, positive in
the first and fourth and positive for the full year.
On a year-to-date basis, the $3.94 compares to the distribution of $3.97 and so we're about $14 million short, but again
for the full year, expect to cover. The $1.27 translates into DCF of $554 million. That's up $99 million or 22% versus
the third quarter in 2012. And so let me just reconcile that $99 million for you, what's driving that growth.
If you look at the top of the page, our segments are up $262 million. And of that $262 million, $225 million is coming
from the Gas group. So about 86% of the segment growth and earnings before DD&A is coming from natural gas. And
as Steve said, that's driven by the dropdowns from KMI and from the Copano acquisition offset by the FTC sale.

The other segments are also up nicely with the exception of Kinder Morgan Canada that is down slightly because of the
Express sale.
G&A is an increase of $22 million quarter-to-quarter and that's largely about $18 million of that $22 million is
associated with the El Paso and Copano acquisitions offset by the benefit of the FTC sales.
Interest is up $49 million in the quarter, almost all associated with incremental debt balance as a result of the
acquisitions and expansion capital.
Sustaining CapEx is up $14 million in the quarter versus last year. We expect expansion capital to be up in 2013 versus
2012. And then you have a small amount of other items that are up $6 million or an increase of $6 million in expense,
so that gets you to $171 million increase in distributable cash flow. You look at the GP interest and the increase in
non-controlling interest of $72 million, and that takes you to $99 million of growth in distributable cash flow in the
quarter.
For year-to-date, as I've said, $326 million in growth and distributable cash flow. Look at what's driving that, if you
look up at the segments, the segments are up $887 million year-to-date. $771 million is coming from the Gas group
based on the same factors that drove the quarter. And then you have $51 million coming from CO2, $54 million from
Products, $23 million from Terminals, a nice growth in those segments. And that's offset by $12 million decline in the
Kinder Morgan Canada segment as a result of the Express sale.
G&A, we have increased G&A of $70 million year-to-date, about a little over $60 million of that is associated with the
acquisitions net of the divestitures. Interest is up $173 million year-to-date versus 2012 and that's a result both of the
increase in debt balance and a higher average rate. The higher average rate is driven by the interest rate on the
dropdown debt, which KMP assumed in conjunction with the dropdowns, which was at a slightly higher rate than the
existing average rate at KMP. Sustaining CapEx is up $36 million in the quarter, and then we have other items that are
about $46 million that you see in the adjustments to DCF.
The biggest impact there is the sale of REX, and part of the impact of the sale of REX comes back when we add back
the JV DD&A, which is in our adjustments between net income to get to DCF. So that's a $46 million impact. That gets
you to $562 million of increase in cash coming from these assets.
Then the GP interest and non-controlling interest, there's an increase of about $236 million. So take the $236 million
from the $562 million and that gets you to $326 million increase in distributable cash flow for the quarter.
Now looking at the segments versus our budget. As Steve mentioned, natural gas is above its budget on a year-to-date
basis and we're expected to exceed this budget for the full year by approximately 11%. If you look at it without
Copano, the natural gas segment would be slightly below its budget.
On CO2, we expect it to be approximately $30 million above its budget. Now, if you look at the price of WTI relative
to the price of – the prices in our budget for WTI and you look at our metric and our sensitivity to oil prices of about $6
million in DCF for every dollar change in price, you would expect that segment to be up about $45 million and then
you would expect it also to be up a little bit incrementally for the Goldsmith acquisition.
And so, horseshoes and hand grenades, you would expect that segment to be up about $50 million versus the $30
million I mentioned. And so what's offsetting the price impact on crude is that we're realizing a lower NGL price than
we had in our budget. We have slightly lower oil volumes, and then we have some higher expenses in some of our oil
fields.
Products, we expect to be slightly below our budget, and terminals we expect to be below its budget, about 4%, largely
as a result of lower coal volumes, lower steel volumes than what we budgeted, lower ethanol volumes versus what
we've budgeted in a contract that we lost with CSX.
KMC, we expect to be about 7% below its budget as a result of the Express sale, but overall, the Express sale is
accretive to KMP's DCF. But the positive benefits show up in the interest line, and due to reduced debt issuance and
reduced issuance unit shows up in our shares outstanding.

G&A for the full year, we expect to be up about $16 million, and that is largely associated with Copano. Interest is
going to be up about $13 million, and that's largely also as a result of the Copano acquisition. But the increase in
interest expense associated with the Copano acquisition is being somewhat offset by higher capitalized interest as a
result of increased expansion capital spending versus our budget.
Sustaining CapEx, we expect to be slightly over our budget. On a year-to-date basis, we have a large positive in
sustaining CapEx, but that's timing. For the full year, we expect to be about $5 million negative versus our budget. And
all of that and more is Copano, and then it's being slightly offset by some positives in capitalized overhead. And so,
that's KMP's distributable cash flow.
Turning to KMP's balance sheet. If you look, we ended the quarter at 3.9 times debt-to-EBITDA which is consistent
with where we ended the second quarter. We expect in the year approximately about 3.8 times, and our budget was to
end the year about 3.7 times, but realize that we don't have a full year benefit of the Copano acquisition in the EBITDA
numbers.
Year-to-date, our debt balance is up $3.7 billion, and in the quarter, it is up about $500 million. Looking at the factors
driving that, the $500 million change in debt for the quarter, we spent about a little over $800 million in expansion
CapEx. We contributed about $70 million in contributions to equity investments. So we had uses of capital of
approximately $875 million. That was offset by – we issued equity that accounted for about $481 million and then we
had a little bit over $100 million of other uses of capital, which is largely accrued interest which was $144 million use
of capital during the quarter and then that's being offset by contributions that we get from JV partners for consolidated
investments. And we received about $30 million in proceeds from the sale of the TGP offshore assets.
On a year-to-date basis, we have capital used for expansions and acquisitions and contributions to equity investments,
about $9.6 billion. That's $6.9 billion in acquisitions which are primarily the drops, Copano acquisition and the
Goldsmith acquisition; there's $558 million of debt that comes on to our balance sheet as a result of acquiring the
second half of EPNG; we spent about $1.9 billion in expansion CapEx; and a little over $200 million in contributions to
equity investments.
We have raised equity of about $5.6 billion, offsetting that $9.6 billion of capital uses. And so you've got about $300
million in other items which are – we received $400 million in Express proceeds; we received a little under $100
million in swap unwinds; we received a little over $100 million in contributions from JV partners; we had the sale of
the TGP offshore, and then we had a little over $300 million in working capital uses primarily associated with accrued
interest. There were some taxes that we had to pay in conjunction with the Express proceeds. We have Copano
acquisition expenses and also some inventory timing. And so that's KMP.
Turning to EPB, again, here I will focus on the second page which is our calculation of distributable cash flow, but we
have reconciled this to our GAAP income numbers for you and provided you a lot of detail on any other reconciling
items. On EPB, the distribution for the quarter is $0.65. That is 12% growth quarter-over-quarter and that translates into
$1.90 on a year-to-date basis, which is up 16%.
Based on the distributable cash flow per unit of $0.58, our coverage were about $14 million negative in the quarter and
consistent with what I said about KMP and what I said about EPB last quarter. We expect that it will have negative
coverage in the second and the third quarter, positive coverage in the first and the fourth, and that we will have positive
coverage in the full year. Year-to-date coverage is positive, about $13 million.
The $0.58 of distributable cash flow per unit translated to distributable cash flow in total of $127 million; that's down
about $22 million versus the third quarter of last year. And so let me just take you through that. The assets are down
about – and you can see this at the top of the page, earnings before DD&A down about $13 million. The biggest piece
of that is Southern Natural Gas, which was impacted by the rate case and also lower volumes as a result of higher gas
prices and cooler weather; the WIC rate case and then those are being somewhat offset by an increase in the Elba
Express Pipeline as a result of an expansion that came on in April 1 of this year.

G&A is a benefit quarter-to-quarter of $4 million. Interest, a small change; it is an increase of $1 million and then
sustaining CapEx is a benefit. We spent less sustaining CapEx in the third quarter of this year than we did in the third
quarter of 2012 of about $4 million. So, that gets you to about a $6 million decrease in cash flow generated by the
assets net of interest cost.
The GP is an increase and the GP incentive about $16 million and that's a result of the higher distribution and more
units outstanding. And so when you combine that with the $6 million coming from the assets that's about $22 million
decrease quarter-to-quarter.
For the nine-months, the $425 million of DCF before certain items is relatively flat versus the nine months in 2012. The
assets are up $39 million; $31 million of that you can see on the line earnings before DD&A of $888 million versus
$857 million in 2012. And then about $8 million of it shows up in reduced minority interest or non-controlling interest
expense further down the page, and we've talked about the reason for that in prior quarters. G&A is lower in the nine
months of 2013 versus 2012 by $23 million and that's the cost savings that we are realizing as a result of the merger.
Interest is an increase of $12 million and that's primarily based on rate where we termed out some debt that was on
EPB's revolver in the fourth quarter of last year associated with the May drop downs. Then sustaining CapEx is a
benefit of about $5 million year-to-date versus the three quarters in 2012 and then other items are about $2 million. So
that takes you to about $57 million increase coming from the assets net of interest cost. And then the GP interest is up
about $59 million on the higher distributions and more units so that you're about flat on a year-to-date basis.
Now, for the full-year versus our budget, if you look at it, we will hit the $2.55 in distribution. We will come in slightly
below on coverage and that's just a result of moving the Gulf LNG drop out of this year. There are some other moving
parts. We had the WIC rate case which we did not anticipate in our budget and some lower contract renewals on WIC,
but that's been offset by lower G&A and some better performance out of the other assets, so that the entire variance for
the year is largely due to the Gulf LNG drop moving out.
Looking at EPB's balance sheet, they ended the quarter at 3.6 times debt to EBITDA. That's down from the end of last
year and flat to the second quarter. We expect to end the year at about 3.8 times debt to EBITDA and that's just some
timing on equity issuance and interest payments between now and the end of the fourth quarter.
Reconciling their debt, the change in debt at EPB for the quarter was a reduction of $14 million. For the year-to-date, it
was a reduction of $122 million. In the quarter we spent $25 million on expansion CapEx. Coverage, as I mentioned
earlier, was a negative $14 million, and then we had positive working capital and other items of a little over $50
million, which primarily relates to accrued interest and accrued taxes.
Year-to-date expansion capital was $68 million. We've raised equity of $87 million. Coverage was a positive $13
million. And then we have working capital and other items of about $90 million; again which is largely associated with
accrued interest and accrued taxes.
Turning to KMI, the declared dividend for the quarter of $0.41 compares to cash available per share of $0.41, so
basically flat on coverage. Cash available to pay dividends $424 million; that's up $62 million or 17% versus the third
quarter in 2012. So let me just take you through what's driving that growth.
The increases coming from the MLPs and the distributions coming from the MLPs is $102 million increase. We have
lower interest expense of approximately $62 million. Now, some of that's timing because we used the accrual method
in 2012 because we only had a partial year on the El Paso acquisition and so cash distorted the numbers on a partial
year. So you have a little bit of difference in timing just accrual versus cash, but most of it is driven by the debt
paydown as a result of the dropdowns. You've got about $95 million reduction in the quarter as a result of reduced cash
generated from the assets that we've dropped. We have about a $15 million increase in cash taxes and then we have
about $8 million in lower G&A to get you to the $62 million.
Year-to-date, cash available to pay dividends of $1.231 billion, that's an increase of $259 million or 27%. Let me just
walk you through that increase. The interest in the MLPs, EPB and KMP is an increase of $422 million. We actually
have higher interest year-to-date of $39 million. What you see there is a full year of – year-to-date we have of – in all

periods, we have the El Paso debt versus we only had it in a partial period last year. But that's being somewhat offset by
the decreased interest associated with debt pay down on the drops. We've got $33 million reduction in cash generated
from our other assets as a result of the drops. We've got a $76 million increase in cash taxes as a result of the higher
income. And then we've got a $15 million in higher G&A largely as a result of having a full year of El Paso. And so
that gets you to the $259 million increase in cash available to pay dividends.
Now, for the full year, as Rich said, we expect to distribute at least $1.60. That $1.60 is above our original budget of
$1.57 per share because we raised the distribution or the dividend by $0.03 as a result primarily of the Copano
acquisition. But the reason we say at least $1.60 is because we expect that we will generate our cash available, both
$1.57 and $1.60 were based on distributing everything that we had. We expect at this point that we will have some
excess cash available largely as a result of delaying the Gulf LNG drop and that asset staying at KMI for four
additional months and better performance on other retained assets.
Looking at KMI's balance sheet, KMI ended the quarter with $9.78 billion of debt. That is down about $1.6 billion
from the end of the year. Now, what you see on this page is $10.23 billion of debt at the end of last year, but that's a
recast number; where we actually ended the year was $11.4 billion and then in the quarter, debt is actually up about
$300 million.
So quick reconciliation for you on the quarter, we repurchased warrants about $330 million. We spent some money on
some legacy environmental issues and the and the legacy marketing book at El Paso of about $28 million. And then we
actually generated cash in excess of what we reflect in the metrics largely as a result of lower taxes that we're paying
versus what's in the metric because in actuality, we are using all of the NOL that we can possibly use and so we're
paying lower cash taxes versus in the metric, we only reflect about a $300 million use of the NOLs. So you have lower
cash taxes in reality than what we reflect in the metric.
Year-to-date, $1.6 billion decrease in debt, $2.2 billion in proceeds that we've got from the drops and the sale of B2B
and then also debt that was assumed by KMP in the dropdown transactions. We've repurchased $463 million of
warrants. We've made a $50 million contribution to the pension. We've made about $60 million of investments in the
two MLPs to maintain KMI's 2% interest. We've contributed about $50 million to equity investments and then we've
got about $50 million in other items, the largest of which is the difference between the book and cash taxes.
At KMI, on a fully consolidated basis, we expect that we'll end the year maybe a shade higher than what I said last
quarter. Last quarter, I said about 5 times, maybe end at about 5.1 times, and that's a result of the warrant repurchase
occurring faster than we originally anticipated.
So with that, Rich, I'll turn it back to you.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Darren. How are you doing?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: I'm fine. Thanks, Rich. I appreciate you taking my question. I realized the Marcellus and
Utica liquids project isn't in the budget and that it was announced as a letter of intent contingent upon sufficient shipper
commitments and various approvals. But since the JV announcement, the competitive landscape has changed a little
bit. You've got an additional proposal for a big LPG dock in Lake Charles and another large player moving forward

with a second big marine terminal expansion. So, I'm curious how that changes the playing field as you view the
project and more importantly the odds of it getting done.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, again, as we said all along, Darren, we'll only do this if we have the commitments. So
far, we're seeing a lot of customer interest. Steve, what do you want to add to that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. I think one of the things that is still to be completed, particularly – you really have to
look at this project in two parts, all right. The first part is the processing part. There appears to be a lot of demand for
additional processing capacity and we expect there'll be even more as the producers get a handle on the composition of
their Utica volumes as it starts coming out of the ground. And so, that's kind of one aspect of the project.
The other is the Y-grade line, and that's what you're mainly focused on. And there, I mean, I think that having more
outlets potentially for this product as it moves south, the way we've proposed it is, we could build either into Southwest
Louisiana or into Mont Belvieu. And what we're talking to shippers about or producers about right now is what they
would prefer and what we've also put on the table. When I say, we, I mean us and MarkWest is the interest that we
have in potentially building some fractionation capacity for them.
So, the fact that there might be some additional destinations, it certainly complicates the picture, but it's still something
that we're willing to invest in and willing to hear what our producers think in terms of where they want to go. But that's
the thing we've got to still get straightened out and be able to present to our producers, but we're really kind of looking
in part for them to tell us where it is that they want to go.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. And then, Steve, my last question, shifting gears a little bit over to the BOSTCO
terminal, I appreciate the color there, but beyond the remaining 30 tanks that should arrive online over the next six
months and hitting that aggregate capacity threshold that you outlined, how do you guys think about land adjacent to
that or the ability to leverage that footprint possibly to add more splitting capacity for the export of a complementary
product like gas, oil, or like naphtha to Latin America? I mean ultimately how does this refined product push to the
Gulf Coast whether or not it's there at Galena Park or Corpus? How does that work into your downstream plan to add
more capability?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, I mean it's a good thing for our asset set on the Houston Ship Channel. So we have the
largest independent terminaling facility at Pasadena and Galena Park. Over the years, we've been adding cross channel
lines to improve the connectivity. KMCC has that as a destination. We're looking for ways to interconnect that big
operation which is also expanding with the BOSTCO facility.
And so, overall, the push to move more product into storage and then out either by pipeline or on ship or barge is a
positive thing. And John Schlosser is here. Do you want to add anything?
<A - John W. Schlosser>: Yeah. I mean, we've seen a groundswell of products that's trying to get to the water there.
You have the opportunity for two additional docks at BOSTCO. We're building a new dock at the Greens Port facility
at our partner Watco's facility. And we announced the AES facility which will have an additional dock as well. With
that will come additional tanks and additional ability to move product to the water.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Thank you.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Brian.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think there's interest in both. I don't know if there's a preponderance. I guess we've heard
more talk about the Ship Channel than anything else when you say...
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Belvieu, yeah.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Probably Belvieu on the margin.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Just because Mont Belvieu is still viewed and I think correctly as the most liquid point in
the whole infrastructure play. So I'd say we've had a little more interest there.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: In terms of – if that's the market, would you lean towards third parties, or would you
look at adding your own fracs and then if you're going to build your own where would it be, in Belvieu or outside
Belvieu?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, I think we're working with a number of parties now on both ends of the transaction,
in other words with some of potential shippers and also present owners of frac capacity and together with MarkWest
and we're just looking at what all our alternatives are. I think we haven't made a decision on that yet.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Okay. Any type of ballpark range of potential cost without the fracs for the project?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, what we've said, and look, we're in a very competitive situation here as you know, Brian.
So, we have not really broken the components out. We've just pointed to north of $2 billion as the kind of all-in
investment here.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Okay. And then any update on the hedges for 2014 and 2015 production in the CO2
business?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Kim, you have those?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure, I can tell you what they are. If you look at the – you want 2014, we are 66%
hedged at about $94 a barrel; 2015, we're about 43% hedged and depending on the way you look at our collars ,
between $90 or $92. If you have the market price, then it's $92; if you have it in at the put price or the floor, it's $90.

Our next question comes from Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, how are you doing?
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Hi, I'm well. Thank you. A question on the CapEx budget overall and you've talked about how
you had this sort of hollow part in the 2014 and 2015 that you're now filling and I'm just wondering if you can give a
sense of where the budget's looking like for 2014 at least, is it up or down versus this year and then how that might then
translate into your goals for distribution growth of say 5% to 6%?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, if you look at 2014, Steve's right, we're filling in those holes and right now in this
project backlog we have about $3.4 billion, a little north of that for 2014. We're just starting the budget process and I'm
sure there will be additional projects added to that when we go through the budget with all of our business segments
over the next three weeks starting next week. But that's what we currently have in this backlog and again I would look
at that as a pretty conservative number compared to where I think we will end up.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: And then...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, that's right. And that – go ahead.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: No. Does that include dropdowns as well, I'm assuming?

<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay, that is just...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, that is just capital projects.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Got it. And then if I can just shift over to the Gulf LNG, and you mentioned it a little bit in the
prepared remarks, kind of waiting on it as at the dropdown to EPB, I guess I'm just wondering if you can give us a little
bit more detail on where you are in terms of contract? And it sounds like you said you're going to wait maybe four
months, is that a reasonable timeframe to think about when you might have a sense of what the contracts are or is that
just you are sort of pushing that out and then may get pushed a little bit further, can you just talk a bit through Gulf
LNG for us?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think we will have detailed information on the drops of the remaining assets by the end of
this year. We'll be able to disclose that once we get through the budget process, I think we'll be able to tell you what we
expect to be able to do.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Got it. And then just coming back to the Marcellus and actually on the natural gas side, you
obviously got a lot of growth there and a lot of producers that are concerned about where basis differentials were and
some of the discounting that you saw this summer, I'm wondering if there are some bigger things that you're thinking
about around takeaway there because of the big growth in the basin around your assets?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. There are a number of things we're thinking about and for competitive reasons, I
really wouldn't want to go into all of them. But obviously, we believe that in the long term, there needs to be significant
additional capacity built into New England. And we obviously, on Tennessee, have the pipe to do that or the base to do
that. That depends again on shipper commitments and we'll just see where that comes out.
But we think there is additional volumes to go into Canada. And, as I've said before, our belief is that, eventually,
virtually all of Eastern Canada will be served out of the Marcellus and Utica. Again, our pipeline network lends itself
very well to that, and I think we'll have some announcements pretty shortly on that.
And then, of course, there's the takeaway for the Y-grade to get the NGLs out, and we think that there's a lot of
opportunities for us there. So, we're very happy with the kind of footprint we have in the Marcellus and Utica, and we
think we're going to be able to use that to our advantage and to help our customers over the next several years.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Is the demand for takeaway – are you sensing that the producers are willing to sign up for
capacity more or is this more going to be a demand pull from the utilities or power generators?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think on the New England expansion it's going to be primarily demand pull.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. That's it for me. I'll leave it there. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Craig.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Looks like SACROC was off second quarter in a row, Yates was down sequentially and the
Katz ramp is still a little under budget. Do you all still feel comfortable production will grow over the next couple of
years and is permitting for new field injections becoming an issue?

<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yes, I think SACROC is always a little up and down, so I might mention that as of right now
through October running close to 32,000 barrels a day. So, a lot of it just depends on how quick we're able to get
patterns ready, get injection permits and monitor the flood, so it's going to be up and down. But I expect SACROC to
continue to be relatively flat for several years to come. Yates is a big field that is on a slow decline and we'll work it as
well as we can, but there will be a slight decline there each year. And Katz is running, as Steve mentioned, about 3,250
barrels a day right now for the month, so it's getting real close to the budget numbers, and I think what we're going to
see at Goldsmith is we got great opportunities. There continues to be a lot of opportunities I think out there for CO2
flooding. The demand is still real high for CO2 and that bodes well for us.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: And is contract – not contracting, permitting becoming an issue as far as being able to move
forward on some of these opportunities?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Right now, we're having a little problem with the Railroad Commission, just lack of staff
there, but nothing that we aren't able to look around I think.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. And while I'm on the subject of EOR, a simple question for you, if all of EOR's CO2
needs were acquired from third parties, do you believe that you would, in fact, capitalize more CO2 purchases and book
higher DCF than you're reporting now?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: We would have recorded higher capitalized CO2, that's correct.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. So...
<A - James P. Wuerth>: If we were selling the CO2 to third parties, yes, on our S&T side, we would have higher
DCF.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: I got you. So the intercompany sales results in more conservative accounting?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: I believe that's a good way to say it.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. And last question, given some of the recent headwinds kind of affecting KMI share price
from some market perceptions, how do you think about the alternatives of repurchasing warrants versus existing shares
and how much capacity do we have to keep renewing these equity repurchases every quarter?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, we look at that based on growth projections and based on what we believe the return
is on purchasing warrants versus shares. And as you see today, the board authorized an additional $250 million to be
used for either shares or warrants at our discretion and we just continue to look at what makes the most sense, to buy
back shares or buy back warrants.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: I got you. And speaking with some clients, Rich, the comment was made that your own
repurchases were not a large percentage of your annual distributions that you get. And I just wonder if you'd like to
opine on the value of the equity right now.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: That's, of course, you guys' expertise, not mine. But I believe obviously the equity is
undervalued at KMI. You have a stock that is yielding 4.5% now and has growth of 14% this year in declared
dividends. We've said we believe long term it's 9% to 10%. And at KMP, you have a security that's yielding 6.5% with
growth of 7% this year. We've said long term we believe 5% to 6% there. So, to me that's a very good investment, but
that's again, not mine to opine. I'm obviously prejudiced. I think the stock and units are tremendously underpriced in
my view. But again, that's for the market to determine.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. Thank you very much.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, John. How are you?
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Doing well, Rich. Just if I could follow up on your Y-grade pipeline from the Marcellus,
with the production there, it seems to be continuing to ramp faster than most expect. At least in the past people have
said that there's room for one of these pipeline projects to come at the Gulf. Do you think if things continue in that
direction there might be room for two projects, yours and the competitor?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes. I would say, John, that's possible, but we can't look at it that way and we won't look at it
that way. We're going to get out there and compete and see if we can get the first project. The thing that you have to
keep in mind is it's not just the first pipe that goes in the ground; there's expansion capabilities and things like that. And
so there's definitely an advantage to being the first one that gets built of these two.
And so we're just looking at it as it's one of the other is going to win the day. And the other thing to take into account, I
know you are very familiar with this, but production targets or expectations and actual production on the one hand
versus willingness and ability to commit contractually for a long term on the other are two different things. And so
what it comes down to is whether people will put ink on paper to sign up for the capacity.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. Fair enough. That's all I have. Thank you.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Okay. Thank you, John.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kevin Kaiser from Hedgeye Risk Management. Your line is
open.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Hey, good afternoon. Question on CapEx for gathering and processing, what is CapEx budget
for gathering and processing on a quarterly basis, including Copano?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I don't know if we have that number broken down.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: We don't break it out separately. It's just part of our natural gas CapEx.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We have CapEx on Copano and Altamont, and some in Texas, some other in Texas as well. We
don't have a breakout of that.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Okay. So no breakout for G&P by sustaining CapEx versus expansion CapEx either?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No. I think that's just aggregated in our total gas group...
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yes, correct. Total natural gas segment aggregates all of the – whether it's sustaining
CapEx or expansion CapEx is all aggregated.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Okay. And then on the company-wide – so the budget for this year for sustaining CapEx will
be $339 million. That's before Copano. If KMP only spent that on an annual basis, so no organic expansion CapEx,
how would the segments perform over the long-term? Will the company be able to keep cash flow flat?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I'm sorry. I don't...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yes, well, I think that we have growth – I mean are you asking if there is growth absent
spending CapEx in KMP?
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: The question is really if the budget was only limited to the sustaining CapEx, would the
additional asset base be able to – would it be maintained? Would the cash flows be maintained over the long-term $339
million?

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I see your question. Yes, and we've said this several times and these are ballpark numbers,
of course, but generally speaking that 5% or 6% this year happened to be 7% growth in distributions. We think
probably 1.5% to 2% is organic growth; in other words if you didn't spend any capital, you would get that. At KMP that
comes from a number things. One is, of course, the inflation escalator that we have on our FERC regulated products
pipelines; second is on automatic escalators that we have on some of our terminal assets. So you probably have, we
estimate, 1.5% to 2% growth if you didn't spend any capital. And then the rest of that growth comes primarily from
new projects that come on line.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Okay.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Subject to market conditions. Market conditions determine the growth on just the existing asset
base on a standalone basis.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Right, and how would 1% to 2% organic growth be possible with just $339 million, if you
spend about $400 million in the E&P alone and that's not in the sustaining CapEx budget?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: As I just said – I'm not following your question I guess. You ask how much organic growth
you had without expansion CapEx and that's the kind of number that we use about 1.5% to 2%, Kim?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Kevin, is your question if CO2 production would stay flat if we weren't spending
expansion capital?
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: No. The question is really if you – yes, no, the question is on the business, the entire KMP
business, how would cash flows trend over the long term if we only spend $339 million a year in capital expenditures?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: I think Rich just answered it.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yes.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Okay. And then the last question I have is, do you consider distributable cash flow to be
synonymous with free cash flow?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Well, Kevin, I mean, look, what we're looking at is how much cash flow the MLP
generates before expansion capital, because our partnership agreement requires us to finance expansion capital to
distribute everything that we generate and to finance our expansion capital. And so what we are comparing
distributable cash flow is to the cash flow that we have available for distribution to our unit holders before we factor in
expansion CapEx.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Okay. So you would say it's not – you would not say that free cash flow and distributable cash
flow are the same thing?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: If you're defining free cash flow as cash flow after expansion CapEx, then I would say
that distributable cash flow and free cash flow are not the same thing, but it depends on how you're defining free cash
flow.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: I would define free cash flow as cash flow from operations minus the capital expenditures
needed on an annual basis to maintain those cash flows from operations.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Well, that is not – unfortunately, that is nice that you would interpret it that way, but
that's not the way that our partnership agreement defines it, and therefore that's not the way we are allowed to segregate
it.
<Q - Kevin F. Kaiser>: Okay. All right. Thanks for the color and thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you, Kevin.

Our next question comes from Becca Followill from U.S. Capital Advisors.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Becca. How are you?
<Q - Becca Followill>: Can you talk a little bit about the interim outlook for EPB post 2013 but before the Elba export
facility comes online, given the roughly $80 million in rate reductions with these two rate settlements at WIC and SNG
and then a step down in rates at SLNG at year-end?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yes, there's no question and we've been very clear about this that, of course, the rate case
on SNG and the rate case on WIC will be a negative impact. We settled both of those and they had some negative
impact, as Kim said, in 2013. But that will increase because we'll have a full year in 2014. We, of course, longer-term
obviously the Elba Island LNG project is a huge positive, and we have some other smaller growth opportunities coming
online in EPB. And then we anticipate we will have drop downs into EPB that will help in terms of distributable cash
flow.
<Q - Becca Followill>: So there'll be drops in the interim that will help bridge that gap.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: That's true, Becca. Yes.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay, thank you. And then what is the timing for filing for abandonment at Tennessee of the
portion of the line that you're looking to convert?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Tom, do you have a timeframe?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yes. I mean, I think we'd be looking at that into early next year.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Early next year would be the probable answer.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Thank you. And then the last question on the CO2 business. Just by my quick
back-of-the-envelope kind of numbers, looks like operating expense was up pretty materially during the quarter. Was
there something unusual there? Is that just a function of maybe adding Goldsmith or is there something else going on
that's maybe short term in nature?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Jim?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: I would guess it's probably Goldsmith. We haven't' seen anything unusual that has popped up
on us at all.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Did they have materially higher per unit O&M cost?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Depends on what you're comparing it to. If you're comparing it to Yates, the answer would be
yes; if you're comparing it to SACROC, probably comparable.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. Just on the overall average basis...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes.
<Q - Becca Followill>: It just looks like it's up meaningfully. Okay, that's all I have. Thank you, guys.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you, Becca.
