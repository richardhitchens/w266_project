Ursula M. Burns
Good morning and thanks for joining our call. Today we're reporting second quarter 2014 earnings that continue to
reflect the benefits of our diversified portfolio and strong cash flow. We remain focused on our priorities and we're
making progress. This quarter we saw a return to growth in Services and the business is well-positioned for sustained
improvement. Services is now 57% of revenue and we are on track to reach our target of two thirds by 2017. This

important shift will drive overall revenue growth.
Our Document Technology business drove strong profits again this quarter and continues to be an important business
for us, generating cash and profits above expectations. And we continue our initiative to improve Services' profitability.
We are seeing good profitability improvement, especially within areas like Document Outsourcing, our commercial
BPO business and ITO business, including healthcare and international services. We know that more needs to be done,
especially in government healthcare where we continue to stand up a new Medicaid platform and deal with a couple of
challenging contracts. So this remains a top priority. And across both segments, Services and Technology, we remain
focused on our important stakeholders with a keen attention on supporting our customers, delivering value for our
investors and making Xerox a great place to work for our people.
In the quarter, we invested $227 million in acquisitions, welcoming into Xerox the employees and customers of Smart
Data Consulting and ISG Holdings. ISG is a leading provider of workers' compensation software in the U.S. This
acquisition will expand our significant presence in the healthcare payer and insurance BPO markets.
And we continue to against organically in areas where we see good market opportunities. Such as in private healthcare
exchanges, where we have a differentiated offering for large employers through Buck Consultants at Xerox. We have a
business the delivers strong cash flow. This gives us flexibility to not only invest for growth, but also build short and
long-term shareholder value through a balanced approach to capital allocation that includes share repurchases and
dividends.
To execute on our direction, we have a strong team. Jeff Jacobson was recently named the President of our Document
Technology business, taking over from Armando Zagalo de Lima, who is retiring after 31 years at Xerox. I want to
thank Armando for everything that he's done for Xerox. He has put our Document Technology business on a solid
foundation by transforming the organization to be more customer-focused, profitable and well-positioned to adapt to
changes in the market.
And here's a look at our results and my perspective. As I mentioned earlier, there are bright spots and positive trends,
but we still have more work to do. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.27, which is at the high end of the range that we set.
In the quarter, we saw improvement in Services revenue growth. Services revenue was up 2%. That's up from flat
growth last quarter and the business is trending well. Document Technology revenue had higher declines in the quarter
as expected, given timing of last year's product launches. It is in the range of expectations for the first half and we're
very excited about upcoming product launches.
Our operating margin is up year-over-year, driven by strong margins in Document Technology, the result of continued
good operational discipline and focus on productivity. As anticipated though, we did see margin decline in Services due
to the pressures that we're experiencing in government healthcare. We took a non-cash charge in the quarter and are
making progress transitioning out of some challenging contracts. Kathy will provide you with more details in a few
minutes.
We're continuing our activities to create shareholder value using our strong cash flow, which is up over $150 million
for the first half, to repurchase shares at a steady pace, supporting a growing dividend and acquiring companies that
enhance our Services capabilities. We have a talented and dedicated team and we are keeping our stakeholders at the
center of all that we do. Our goal is to provide excellent products and services and deliver the operational results that
are expected of us.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kathy then I'll wrap up and will open the call to your questions. Kathy?
Kathryn A. Mikells
Thanks, Ursula and good morning, everyone. Overall, we feel good about our sequential progress with a number of the
themes from quarter one carrying through to quarter two. We continue to show operating profit growth, driven by
strong margin expansion in Document Technology and we had good operational performance in the majority of our
Services businesses. As expected, the government healthcare business continues to pressure Services margin as we

invest in rolling out our new Medicaid platform. Additionally, we took incremental non-cash impairment charges,
driven by the transition out of the Nevada health insurance exchange. I will cover all of these dynamics in much greater
detail when I review segment performance.
First, though, I'd like to begin by walking through our earnings. Revenue in the quarter was down 2% at actual currency
and down 2.5% in constant currency. Segment revenue trends were as expected, with Services revenue growth
improving and Document Technology weaker, as we faced a challenging year-over-year compare due to last year's
product launch timing.
Gross margin of 30.8% was down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by the Services margin decline as well as the
greater mix of Services. We again saw significant improvement in both SAG and RD&E as we benefit from
productivity initiatives, as well as lower pension expense. These improvements more than offset the lower gross margin
and resulted in operating margin expansion of 30 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially, and
enabled higher operating profit year-over-year.
Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net was $14 million higher year-over-year. The increase was split
between OID, which was $9 million higher year-over-year, reflecting a real estate gain in the prior-year. And
restructuring which is $38 million was $5 million higher year-over-year and in line with our guidance.
Adjusted tax rate of 27.7% was 360 basis points higher year-over-year and just above our guidance range of 25% to
27%. So overall, there was a modest year-over-year headwind below operating profit. Adjusted EPS of $0.27 was flat
year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27. Looking at the first half, adjusted EPS of
$0.54 was also flat year-over-year. Operating profit grew 6% in the first half, despite the pressure we're seeing in our
government healthcare business. And when combined with lower share count, more than offset higher restructuring
costs, OID and a higher tax rate. So all in all, I believe we're making progress, obviously, with more work yet to do.
With that, I'll move to the Services segment slide to review those results in a little bit more detail. Services revenue
growth once again improved sequentially and was up year-over-year 2% or 1% in constant currency, driven by a
pickup in BPO, which went from down 2% in Q1 to up 1% in Q2. Good growth in commercial healthcare and
internationally and better inorganic contribution was partially offset by a negative one point impact from the continued
student loan runoff, as well as headwinds from lower customer care volumes. Trends in Document Outsourcing up 3%
and IPO up 1%, were largely consistent with prior periods.
Turning to signings, signings were lower year-over-year, especially renewals. The combination of a low renewal rate
that was below target due to the Texas Medicaid law and a lower overall renewal opportunity resulted in renewal
signings contract value down more than 35% in the quarter. New business sings were a better story, up double-digits
sequentially, but down 4% year-over-year and flat on a trailing 12-month basis. It should be noted that we did see some
contracts shift to the second half and we had a couple of large contract awards that won't be closed until later this year.
New York Medicaid, for instance, is not in these numbers. Our new business pipeline remains healthy up 4%
year-over-year and we expect better signings results in the second half.
Shifting to profitability, segment margin was 8.6% in the second quarter, which was flat sequentially and down 160
basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was expected, but we were below our guidance of sequential
margin improvement. The miss was due solely to the impairment charges we took in the quarter associated with our
health insurance exchange platform, including non-cash charges related to the Nevada contract. We didn't formally
adjust out the $20 million net impairment charges, but if we excluded our segment margin would be 9.2%, which is in
line with our expectations for continued sequential improvement. So we're beginning to get closure on our Nevada HIX
contract and will be working with the state to continue to support their 2014 enrollees and comply with their decision to
transition to the federal exchange for the next year's open enrollment.
Turning to our Medicaid business, the second quarter performance was largely in line with our expectations, as we
continue to incur higher costs associated with launching our new Medicaid platform and getting it to operational
maturity. We are making progress. We have positive references and we're winning new business in the market. This is
an area where we expect lower margins in the intermediate term as we drive improvements in our other

implementation.
Within the rest of services, we're seeing improved performance. I was very pleased with our margin performance in
areas like commercial healthcare, Document Outsourcing and ITO. So our five-plank strategy and cost initiatives are
driving improvements in many parts of the business and should continue to ramp as we move through the second half
of the year.
Turning to Services guidance, on revenue, second half growth will be negatively impacted by the loss of the Texas
Medicaid contract, which is worth roughly 1.5 points of revenue growth. The rest of BPO improved and will also
benefit by greater inorganic contributions. We now expect to exit the year with a low single-digit growth rate. On
margin, our expectations are largely intact. We expect sequential improvement through the year, putting aside the
non-cash impairment charges. The third quarter should come in above 9.2% and we expect to exit the year comfortably
above 10%. In terms of full-year Services margin, we expect to come in at the lower end of the 9.4% to 9.8% range,
reflecting the non-cash charges that we took in the second quarter.
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 6% at actual currency and 7% in
constant currency. This was higher than last quarter's rate of decline and as we highlighted during our first quarter
earnings call, this was anticipated given the timing of last year's product launches. That impact drove the higher rate of
decline for equipment revenue with annuity revenue showing a consistent 4% decline in both quarters.
Looking at the first half, Document Technology revenue was down 5% or 6% at constant currency, which is in line
with our expectation for mid single-digit declines, and includes an approximate one point negative impact associated
with our previous finance receivable transactions. From a geographic perspective, trends were generally consistent with
our last quarter with the U.S. stable, Europe improving and developing markets still weak.
Looking at our product group, activity levels were lower as we faced the challenging ConnectKey compare and some
large wins in the prior year in graphic communications. In addition, the timing of this year's product launches are more
back half weighted, which we believe will position us well later in the second half and into 2015. Planned launches
include the recently announced Versant entry production color product, extensions of our ConnectKey platform within
our mid-range portfolio and into entry, as well as a refresh of a number of entry desktop products.
Document Technology margin in the quarter was 14.4%, which was 360 basis points higher year-over-year and
continues to run above our long-term expectations. Our strong profit performance reflects ongoing benefits from
restructuring and cost initiatives. In addition, transaction currency and lower pension expenses boosted our
performance by a couple of hundred basis points. This quarter we also experienced more favorable mix and lower
pricing impact. The strong margin performance resulted in operating profit growth of 25% despite the revenue decline,
so overall it was a good quarter for Document Technology.
Looking toward the third quarter, we continue to expect Document Technology to have revenue down mid single-digits
with good margins although below the first half, as we invest in the launch of new products that I mentioned earlier,
and also expect to have a less-favorable impact for mix and some of the other variable factors.
With that, let's turn to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was strong at $325 million in the quarter following a good
Q1 result. For the first half, cash from operations was $611 million, which was a $165 million higher year-over-year.
Underlying cash flow, which excludes the impacts from prior-year finance receivable sales, was $437 million in the
second quarter and $846 million for the first half. It should be noted that the timing of operating cash flow generation
was more balanced between Q1 and Q2 for the first half of this year versus last and we're continuing to work to smooth
out our working capital flows. The drivers of the higher year-over-year first half cash flow improvement include lower
uses of cash for accounts receivable and inventory and higher cash earnings. Partially offsetting this positive is less
contribution to cash flows from finance receivables, which reflects the negative impact of the prior-year finance
receivable sale.
Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were $326 million used in the quarter. We spent $123
million on CapEx and $227 million on acquisitions. We closed in May on ISG, which complements Xerox's current
business with the top 20 U.S. property, casualty and commercial health insurance company. The acquisition pipeline

continues to look good and our full-year expectation to spend up to $500 million in 2014 is unchanged. Consistent with
our portfolio management strategy, this quarter we divested truckload management solutions, a small non-core business
within Services transportation. Cash from financing was a use of $561 million in the quarter and included $299 million
in net debt payments, $204 million in share repurchase and $79 million in preferred and common stock dividends.
Wrapping up cash flow, we had a good first half and our full-year guidance remains at $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion of
operating cash flow with a more even distribution through the year. Second half cash flow will be down year-over-year
as the prior year included $384 million in proceeds from finance receivable sales in the third quarter and $247 million
in proceeds in the fourth quarter with no sales activities planned in 2014. That said, second half underlying cash flow
should be more consistent on a year-over-year basis.
Now I'll walk through capital structure. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion in debt and in line with our original
guidance we continue to expect to end the year with about $7.8 billion in total debt. Applying seven to one leverage on
customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.4 billion, leaving core debt of $3.3 billion. We managed
our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our investment-grade rating, while financing debt has come
down the past few years driven by the finance receivable transactions, as well as lower originations. So we feel good
about our stable capital structure and if we move to the next slide, I'll review where we're at on share repurchases and
dividends.
With a strong first half cash flow performance in relatively high beginning-of-the-year cash position, we've been able
to steadily repurchase shares during the first half for a total of $480 million or 42 million shares. We continue to view
our shares as a good investment and anticipate doing at least $700 million in share repurchases for the year. Our
full-year guidance for dividend payments remains $300 million in 2014 and reflects our current quarterly dividend of
$0.0625 per share. When combined with the share repurchases, we expect at least $1 billion to be returned to
shareholders this year.
Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd just like to summarize our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. We
were once again pleased the performance of Document Technology and for the third quarter, we expect margins to be
at the high end of our target range, with mid single-digit revenue decline. Given the strong first-half profit performance,
we expect full-year margins to be at least a point above our target range of 9% to 11% and up a similar level
year-over-year.
Within Services, we expect to make further gains in the second half. The Texas Medicaid contract loss temporarily
slowed sequential revenue growth improvement and results in an exit revenue growth rate for Services in the low
single-digits. We feel good about delivering sequential margin improvement and exiting the year comfortably above
10% and as I mentioned earlier, we expect full-year Services margin to be at the lower and of our 9.4% to 9.8% range,
as result of the non-cash charges that we took in the second quarter. At the consolidated level for the third quarter, we
expect revenue to decline about two points and adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 to $0.27, which includes
approximately $0.02 of restructuring. And for the full year, we're narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $1.09
to $1.13.
And with that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks, Kathy. I want to get your questions, so I'll summarize quickly. Our second quarter shows progress, growing
revenue in our Services business, operating profit in our Technology business and reaping the benefits of our strong
cash flow. Our profits in Document Technology helped offset the headwind that we're seeing in some of our Services
businesses. Our focus on implementing the Services strategy is showing positive results and we're seeing good progress
internationally and in areas like Document Outsourcing and commercial healthcare. Our strong cash flow allows us the
flexibility to make strategic investments that will enhance opportunities in the future. Our 2014 priorities and focus are
consistent. In Services, improving growth through portfolio management and profitability by driving cost efficiencies
through the business.

In Document Technology, capitalizing on the most advantaged segments of the business to maintain our leadership
position in the industry, while maintaining strong profitability. And we'll continue to generate healthy cash flow to
deliver shareholder value.
Thank you. And now I'll turn you over to Jim.
James H. Lesko
Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today are Bob Zapfel, Head of our Services Business; and Jeff Jacobson,
Head of our Document Technology Business. Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end
of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and compliment our prepared remarks.
For the Q&A, I ask participants to please limit follow-on and multi-part questions so we can get to everyone today. At
the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.
Operator, please open the line for questions now.
Q&A
Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Maybe start off with a question for Bob.
So you had some nice sequential margin improvement; ex the restructuring or ex the charge-off, it was 9.2% over 8.6%
last quarter. What kind of – I guess the first part of the question is, what kind of milestones do you need to hurdle for
the remainder of the year to exit the year at a 10% or better than a 10% margin run rate? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yeah, Brian, thanks. I appreciate that we did make progress. I think we've got a good clear
game plan relative to cost management. We have moved to a capability centered organization which has allowed us to
look at our businesses and where we have a chance to leverage some cost advantages across businesses. So I wouldn't
view it necessarily as some key milestone to jump over. It's really more executing our overall plan and I think we've got
a very clear line of sight to the track that Kathy laid out that gets us to comfortably at 10% plus as we exit the year.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Okay. And I understand when we had the call last quarter, you'd only been there for about 21
days. Since then, I imagine you'd have the opportunity to peek under the covers to a little bit greater extent. If you look
at the guidance prior quarter of exiting the year better than a 10% run rate, have you been able to identify additional
low-hanging fruit? And is that going for – I guess along the lines of cost improvements, or operational improvements?
And would that potentially lead to upside to that number? And then following in at 2015, do we expect sequential
improvement again through the year? Or are there certain factors that could lead to additional lumpiness in margin
performance in 2015?
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Well, we'll do more on 2015 at the Investor Day session in November. But again, I would say
our track through year-end, we've got a pretty clear line of – I wouldn't call it low-hanging fruit, but I would say that it
never feels that way when you're operating the business, but I would say we've got a very, very clear plan that is
broadly owned by the team. And some of this is bad news that we've had that's affected our margins that won't repeat.
So we get a little bit of lift in the second half versus the first half because of some of the challenges that we've
specifically called out. But we've got a good solid operating plan to deliver those kind of margins as we exit the year.
And we certainly aren't looking at next year as though now we want to fall back in the wrong direction. But we'll give
more detail on the 2015 road map when we're together for the Investor session in November.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Brian, if you think about – this is Ursula – all the business lines that Bob manages and he's
been digging into in the last couple of months. We manage all of them to try to show us margin expansion on a

business-by-business basis. And in the second quarter we saw that, and we expect – and literally the plan is to continue
to drive those actions through the businesses so that we see the same kind of margin expansion in the third quarter and
in the fourth quarter. So just reiterating what he said, there is no miracle here, it's literally just operating the business on
a line-by-line basis, and getting better control over government healthcare, which I think we have a good foundation for
today.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Thanks, guys.
<A - James H. Lesko>: If we could move to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Hi. I just want to kind of go on to the margin question a little more and ask about the two
segments as we go throughout the year in maybe a little bit of a different way. In Services, you mentioned renewals
down quite a bit, and the bookings look like they're below your expectations. So I wanted to just – I was under the
impression renewals probably have a higher margin than new business. And in light of that, just how that plays out on
the margin line with you guys getting above 10%. And then on the Technology side, I just wanted to know, you guys
talked about margin coming down from 14.4%. Just how abruptly – like, does it stabilize in the 12%-ish type range?
Because the upside there was about $0.05 in the quarter on that Technology margin that was quite staggering. So I just
want to see how much that comes back in and why. So it's just a little more detail on both margins in the big segments.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. So, Ben, I'll start with just talking about overall kind of bookings and how we see
bookings impacting our margins. If we look forward to the second half, clearly we're expecting bookings to improve in
the second half fiscals, because we've got bigger renewal opportunity as well as additional new bookings expected on
top of that. In terms of renewals versus new, we wouldn't expect to see a negative mix implication overall. We always
anticipate that in renewals, we have price-downs; we're anticipating that overall. And so we don't see any negative mix.
And overall, if you look at how the mix of the portfolio is changing, our ITO growth has slowed a little bit, BPO
growth is picking up, that's generally a positive for us on mix overall.
If I flip to the second part of your question, which was really about Technology margins, if we look at what happened
in this quarter, I'd say three months ago, we underestimated the level of pension improvement we were going to get, we
got a little bit more currency improvement. And overall, mix turned out to be more favorable and we had a little less
pricing pressure than we would typically see. If I go to talk about then in the second half our expectations for
Technology margins, we'll see a dip in the third quarter because we've got a lot of new product launches, and so that's
mainly the impact there. We don't get quite as much pension benefit in the third quarter, so pension benefits are a little
bit lumpy for us because we have pension settlement costs.
But overall, if you look at the second half and certainly the guidance we gave for the full year, at least 100 basis points
above the high end of our 9% to 11% range, I feel really good about Technology margins, I feel great about our ability
to continue to well manage this business to produce very strong profit and very strong cash flow.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Ben. If we could move to the next question please.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Jeff, I had a question for you. Could you talk a bit about what you are
seeing in the printing market? I mean, you've got the rollout of significantly more product in the second half of this
year. Do you expect market share gains? What markets are you sort of focused on? And if you can give any color in
terms of geography, because it seems like Europe was pretty strong. And then I had a quick follow-up. Thanks.

<A - Jeffrey Jacobson>: Yeah, sure, Shannon. So let me just say in terms of our activity, our activity has been strong
for the past year and we gained a share point in 2013 and in Q1. And as Kathy said, we knew we would have a tough
Q2 compare due to ConnectKey, our entry production color high launch. However, Kathy mentioned our product
launches coming in the second half, which I think we'll really start seeing more of a benefit in Q4 and certainly into
2015 where we have about 20 new launches in the second half. They'll benefit the entire company, but I think though,
especially benefit our developing markets, our channels organization and certainly Document Outsourcing. And I think
it's also important to mention that even in this quarter where we had a tough compare in our mid and high segments, we
had sequential growth in both color and mono and in entry we were essentially flat in color.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Let me take some of the geographies, we're seeing pretty stable business environment in the
U.S., fairly predictable for us to manage it well and so you were right, Europe, last quarter we saw improvement, this
quarter Europe is hanging in there for us and doing well. Developing markets just continues to be a pressured place for
us. My expectation is that U.S. and Europe will continue the trends that they're on and unfortunately developing
economies will continue the trends that they're on and be tough for us. The product launch that Jeff talked about should
help us with giving them more optionality to sell and deal, but it's not clear that the environments there will pick it all
up.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. And then just my follow-up question for Bob or Ursula, I'm not sure which.
When you think about New York State in the contract that you've – I now it's not finalized, but it appears you're going
to be awarded, how do we think about that in light of some of the startup costs that we saw with California Medi-Cal? I
mean is this something where you're going to be able to leverage some of your newer platforms, so perhaps not as
many startup costs? Or just how do we sort of think about that as we look through the year?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Bob will take it.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yes, Shannon, I think the way to think about New York is obviously, first, we have to move
from award to contract, so we are excited for the opportunity to do that after the protest cycle. And our view would be,
we've really learned a lot through the prior implementations. We think that we will be able to execute New York well
for the citizens in the state and for us, so it won't be all of these new implementations start with not huge margins. You
make your money over time, but that's the way we built into all of our guidance. So that's planned for us, we
understand, we don't expect to have big unrecovered costs, but we do know that they don't start at high margin, that
that's the business model design, that's not unique to any individual state, that's Services broadly and that's part of what
we've accounted for in our commitments as we go forward.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Shannon. If we could have next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you and congratulations to you and your team there at Xerox.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you.
<Q - Jim Suva>: If we were to look at several of the metrics such as signings and bookings and margins and I'm
looking more forward-looking, should we then expect them to no longer come up? Or given the timing of when the
decisions were made from Texas, Nevada, California and New York, that there might be some impact to those? And I
think that maybe help us filter through the magnitude of what we should expect.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So on signings, the loss of Texas is basically behind us, it was reflected overall in our
renewal rate. What we're expecting going forward as we talked about is signings improvement in the second half, and
so New York isn't included in our numbers today, but we would expect to see that in the future. We have another award
that's under protest for a towing deal that we did in Florida, again not included in our numbers, part of the reason why
we have a good amount of optimism in the second half. So overall, we feel good about looking forward and signings

improvement in the second half.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And our renewal rate without the Texas loss would be in the range that we wanted to be in
the 85% to 90% range. So, the Texas loss is a singular event, but our business flows are fairly consistent with all of the
quarters previously, particularly on renewals.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Great. And as a quick follow-up, when we think about there's been a lot of public information about
the New York contract and the California contract, when those are ramping, are those fully considered in your margin
profile outlook? Or are you building in a little additional stand-up costs? I at least want to make sure that we're just not
then going to be seeing some additional pressure from those ramping.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Both of those are fully contemplated in the guidance.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Great. That's good to hear. Thank you and congratulations again.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Jim. If we could have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll just start out with Kathy. Could you
provide the impact or expected impact on the various government healthcare contracts you have rolling on and off over
the next several quarters? Specifically what the timing is for when New York MMIS will come online? And whether
the expected impact for Texas MMIS will be a very consistent 150 basis points year-over-year. Then I have a
follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: And so I'll take New York first. Our – New York is a little bit hard contract. Our
expectation would be that we start to see a little bit of New York coming on towards the tail end of this year, but it has
a more material impact in 2015. And then with respect to Texas, Texas is going to tail off pretty quickly. And so we
have a little bit of transition in Texas, but we expect to see Texas tail off pretty fast.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Kathy, if I could add, so that 150 basis points on the top line, we would be dealing with that,
if you will, for roughly four quarters. So, that is – it will hit us to start, as Kathy has mentioned, as we kind of go
through the third and fourth quarters. And then on a quarter year-over-year basis, we would be looking at that still in
the first half of next year as well.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: That's very helpful. Thanks. And lastly, Ursula and Bob, could you share color on how the
other parts of the Services business is performing? So, commercial BPO, commercial ITO and Document Outsourcing?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I'll start at the highest level. Let's say I'm pleased with all of them, but let me let Bob go into
a little bit more color.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yeah, I would say we really had – we've got the challenge obviously that we've talked about
in government healthcare, but if you look at the rest of the portfolio, our business in Europe was up double-digits
organically, even more sizably with the benefit of an acquisition earlier in the year. Our commercial healthcare
business is growing at double-digit rates with very strong margins. HR and learning business is performing very well.
For the most part, the mix – I mean, not everybody's perfect, but the mix across the rest of those businesses in
aggregate, we're very pleased with.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And one – if I can add one point on ITO very specifically, our revenue growth in ITO has for
last few quarters, last two quarters at least, slowed to low single-digits. And we spoke about this in last year's investor
conference and I'm sure in some earnings calls before about how we look at our ITO business. It's a good business for
us, it is a relatively small business for us and it operates at the lower end of our margin range, and so we're focusing on
margin expansion and improvement in ITO and not so much on revenue growth there. We're putting most of our bullets

or guns in the – bullets in the gun around BPO and Document Outsourcing from a revenue growth perspective. And
that will continue.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: And that's part of the portfolio mix strategy that the team covered last November at the
investor meeting. So that's part of our five-plank strategy is really around trying to grow more rapidly in our most
"advantaged businesses" and Ursula's comments are right to that point.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, George. If we could have our next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you, guys. I have two questions as well. The first is philosophical growth rate.
And what I mean by that is, Bob, I was hoping you could address BPO and ITO. The recent data points around BPO
have been very mixed. A lot of your competitors and even some of the leading consulting organizations have suggested
that the BPO market has indeed slowed. Now Xerox is in a slightly different segment, or at least a slightly different
segment than some of the leading organizations. But I was hoping you could address on the market level, if you are
seeing a slowdown in BPO? Related to that is the ITO side. Ursula just mentioned, your strategy is different, which I
think is completely appropriate. But can you grow the ITO side? Or does that become a negative growth rate as you
look out? And then I have a follow-on question on margins, please.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yeah, I would say on the BPO market, we're in the middle of our strategy cycle. We see that
market; obviously, it's a broad, $200 billion-plus market. It breaks into horizontal multi-industry components and
industry-specific components. Overall, we see it at mid-single digits, and there's a little bit different mix depending on
what area. But it's a very attractive market from our standpoint, and I would view it as a more favorable, from a market
dynamics standpoint, more favorable than ITO which is – was earlier in the maturity cycle, grew to be a very large
market more rapidly. So we still feel very good. Obviously segment-by-segment, we look at each of them, but if you
just macro to BPO broadly; we see mid single-digit growth through the strategic horizon in that business area.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Well, I'll transition to my second question, although, Bob, I'd love you to come back
on and say can ITO grow, or does it go negative? But my second question is for you, Ursula, as well as for Bob. You
seem – you do seem to be doing well on the commercial side of your Services business, which – the healthcare or
government side, more specifically, the government side of healthcare continues to struggle. Why not deemphasize that
business? Nobody makes any money who serves the healthcare industry in the government side, it doesn't seem. CSC
has been pretty vocal that they did not follow-up with a bid for the New York side because they didn't think they would
make money in it. So, just philosophically, why not focus more on the commercial side and deemphasize the
government healthcare-related activities, and thereby improve your sustainable profit levels?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I don't think that we are not focused more – or focused a lot on the commercial side, we are.
But we also – the government healthcare market is a very attractive market. We went through one cycle when this
market started many, many years ago, that showed that we could invest in the new platform, stand that platform up, and
have it last for many, many years, and continue to drive growth on the top line and profitability on the bottom line. That
remains our expectation.
And if you look at some of the contracts that are more mature, moving towards more maturity, California for example,
we have been able to literally move that contract from investment phase to flat profitability, now to looking for growing
profitability in a very predictable kind of a standard way. It took a little bit longer, but on a go-forward basis, California
is going to be beautiful and we expect as we implement New York to be beautiful as well. So we're not de-emphasizing
commercial in favor of government, not at all. We're focused on all of them and the demographics show that we should
be focused on them as well.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: If I could just add one point of color, we're above 10% operating margins on the majority,
roughly 70%, of our government healthcare business.

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Right.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: So our experience, I can't to speak to the competitor but our experience is, once you get
destabilized, you can have a great value proposition for the clients and good for the shareowners. And one of our clients
just yesterday came out and referenced that we've been working through some issues, but they expect the system to
have a 20-year longevity. So that's the reason that we don't view it as an area to exit or de-emphasize.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Keith. If we could move on to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Great. Thanks for sharing that commercial margin and the size. I didn't realize how big it was.
Actually I just wanted to ask first about signings and the outlook for the second half. Can you be more specific there?
Can you get to a book-to-bill north of, say, one in the second-half without New York?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah, so I'll get a little more specific. When we look at the second half, we're expecting
improvements and we think roughly we should end the year flattish on a 12-month trailing basis. So we clearly have
expectations to make up for some of the softness in the first half.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Understood. And then just my follow-up, the outlook on Document Technology margins,
same question there. Maybe you can be a little more specific. It sounds like you could stay above your target range in
the second half. You called out the two points around pension and transaction effects, but it feels like, with some of the
changes, is it possible we can assume that your longer-term margin target of 9% to 11% could be elevated, given the
run rate?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: I'm going to put aside sort of 2015 and long-term, but if you just look at the second half,
we guided specifically to being at, call it, the high end of that 9% to 11% target range for the third quarter. We typically
are a fourth quarter stronger just from a seasonality perspective in the Technology business, and if you look at some of
the kind of year-over-year things that are going on one of the things we had last year were these receivable sales or
financing receivable sales, and so year-over-year we have a little less headwind in the fourth quarter from that than we
do in the third quarter. So, we would expect seasonally better performance in the fourth quarter there.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Yes. That seems like it's in a good place; that's why I asked. Thank you.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thank you, Tien-tsin. If could have the next question, please.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I could. The first is on
Services rev growth. Bob, can you just kind of walk through what – given that there's been some choppiness this year
in both revenue growth and in signings, can you give us a sense of what the headwinds are going into 2015? And how
we should think about those kind of like layering in and falling off as we exit the year?
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yes, I guess from a headwind standpoint, we are still – have the student loan runoff. That's
more of a factor in the second half of the year than next year. Texas will be a headwind as we've talked about more in
the first half of next year than as we exit the year. We've got, as we've referenced, we've got some substantial contract
award potential for us as we close out this year, that will then lead to filling in some of those gaps, and we view the
market, as I briefly said earlier, at a mid single-digit growth rate, and we think that we can get to roughly that range as
part of our overall sales strategy. So there are a few headwinds. They are not unknown headwinds though, and we've

got a team that wants to be successful in the marketplace and that's our focus.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: If I can just put an umbrella on top of that. So BPO, Bob has talked about it, I've mentioned
it, higher growth rates. Document Outsourcing, higher growth rates. The part of the market that we are – that will
continue to have the lower growth rates for us is the ITO business. That is not something that the market should panic
on. That is literally the strategy, we want to actually focus on profitability there, be very selective with our contract
signings and we're doing that. Our renewals and our renewal rate continues to be strong, north of 85%. We continue to
have that as an expectation. Decisions are slow – well they were a little bit slower in the second quarter, a lot of them
have moved to the third quarter and fourth and we expect to sign the ones that are coming up then. We have a very
good win rate on new business there, of the 10 or so that we were pursuing in the quarter, we lost two and signed eight,
we expect to have that kind of a flow going forward. So, I think that the revenue portion of the picture, there are puts
and takes and there are of course some ups and downs, Texas down et cetera, et cetera, but I think on a macro basis, it
looks good.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Ananda. If we could have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of – excuse me, Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Thank you. My first question is on Services, so you have the Nevada issue out of the way,
which obviously gives you room for improvement in the back half. But given some of the other contract challenges
you've had and some of the unexpected challenges in recent months, is there a risk that we could see further
write-downs in the second half, or do you feel the model is fully scrubbed at this point? And then my second question,
a broader question would be on your restructuring plans, how's it going relative to your original targets? And as you
refine the Services strategy, are you finding any new opportunities arising in the restructuring category? That's it for
me.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So, overall on the first piece, the impairment charges that we took in the quarter were
associated with our state HIX platform, right, and we basically completely cleansed our balance sheet with regard to
that. As you look then at our Medicaid platform, I mean we're winning new business in the marketplace, so we don't
really see any issue there in terms of some future shoe to drop type of thing. Overall, I'd also mentioned in this quarter
that we settled with another state in terms of just our execution plan associated with their implementation, and more
specifics around the design and functionality. And so that's another one that I'd say we really kind of tucked away in
this quarter. So we feel pretty good about our grip on what we need to do in order to continue to mature the
implementations. And I'd say kind of kudos to the government health solutions group in terms of pretty well predicting
outside of the impairment charge what were going to see this quarter, which is why when I exclude the impairment
charge, we really have the profitability and margin progression that we were expecting.
The second question on restructuring, we're been very consistent about restructuring. I'd expect to continue to see about
$0.02 a quarter at the very beginning of the year. We said we expected restructuring charges to be pretty similar
year-over-year and I think we did about $115 million in total in restructuring charges last year, so maybe we would be a
tad higher this year. But we're going to continue to be pretty consistent in our overall approach to restructuring.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And one of the things that we talked about in this infamous or famous five-plank strategy,
one of the major things we talked but was cost improvement in Services. So we have a lot of focus on restructuring in
the Technology business and have a good rhythm there and Bob is developing that same level of discipline and rhythm
in the Services business. So I expect the restructuring to participate and drive margin expansion, a portion of the margin
expansion that Bob is counting on and continue to be strong margin contributors in the Technology business as well.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Bill. And, operator, I think we have time for one last question.

Certainly. Our final question for today comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: Hi. Thanks for sneaking me in and I'll ask my two upfront. First for Ursula, second for
Kathy. Ursula, when you look across the Services portfolio, which do you emphasize more? Is it revenue growth or
margins? And then, Kathy, I'll just ask you upfront, could you share some color on the margin characteristics of ISG
and Smart Data? And are there other dispositions, meaning asset sales that you have planned in the second half? Thank
you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Your first question is a good question and unfortunately doesn't have a singular answer. It
depends on the section of the business and market that we're speaking about. I just talked about ITO for example, and
in ITO I emphasized margin expansion over revenue growth. It doesn't mean I want them to walk away from good
business that we can get and we can stand up in a margin expanding way. But I actually tell them more margin – focus
on margin than on revenue.
In government healthcare, it's both. I want to make sure we do not lose any large contracts, and in places like in MMIS
where we have a platform, go hard towards growing that business, while you expand margins. So it's a mix of
discussions and it's different across the board. Transportation, revenue growth, et cetera. Our advantaged businesses,
revenue growth and our businesses that are not performing at the level that we want from a margin perspective, it's
margin focus. So it's a mix, it's a mix of things. And the good news is that, Bob can actually walk and chew gum at the
same time, so he can essentially manage the many different signals that I give him.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: And then just on the second question, generally as we talked about one plank of our
overall Services strategy is just portfolio management and we're trying to improve the overall mix of our business. So
as you look at the things that we're acquiring, they're very strategically aligned with that strategy. And I would say ISG
and Smart Data absolutely fall into that category. Smart Data gives us a little bit of added scale in the litigation space,
litigation services, which is a great business for us. It's a high-margin business and ISG got added into our insurance
overall portfolio. And so, again, looking to mix up, not looking to dilute margins.
James H. Lesko
Great, thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. We genuinely thank you for your interest. Ursula,
anything more to wrap up?
Ursula M. Burns
Yeah, thanks, Jim, and I'm confident that we have the right strategy and the right team in place to deliver on that
strategy. We're making progress. We have a lot of work to do to continue to create greater value for our employees, our
customers and our shareholders, and we are up to the challenge.
