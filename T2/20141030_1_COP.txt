MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine and I will be your
operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. You may
begin.
Ellen R. DeSanctis
Thanks, Christine, and thanks to all our listeners for joining us today. With me in the room are Ryan Lance, our
Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and our Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Fox, our EVP of
Exploration and Production.
A couple quick administrative matters, of course we'll make some forward-looking statements this morning. The risks
in our future performance are described on page two in today's presentation, also in our periodic filings with the SEC.
All this information as well as our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations and our supplemental data can be found on our
website. And finally, I just wanted to mention that we announced this morning that ConocoPhillips will be hosting an
analyst meeting on April 8 in 2015, so hope you'll save the date for that. We'll of course provide some additional details
very shortly.

And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Ryan.
Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Ellen, and thanks to all our listeners for your participation this morning. I'll begin our call this morning with
some remarks about the current environment. Let me just say that while the recent oil price downturn seems sudden,
we're well-positioned as a company to respond without impacting our strategic objectives of 3% to 5% volume and
margin growth. This is key and it's the result of a significant repositioning we have achieved as a company in the past
two years. We've cored up the portfolio, lowered the overall cost of supply and significantly increased our degree of
capital flexibility. And to put this last point in a bit of perspective, in 2014 our committed capital for major projects and
maintenance represents about 50% of our capital and this declines to approximately 30% by 2016. I'll come back and
highlight that again in a couple of minutes.
Another thing we want to emphasize is that events like the recent price downturn underscore the importance of staying
focused on the fundamentals. We know this is a cyclical business and we've been here before. And certainly the old
adages apply: full cycle, low cost wins, asset quality matters and financial strength is an asset. We intend to make
prudent adjustments at this time while continuing to monitor the environment.
So please turn to the next slide and I'll outline the reasons why we believe we're in a unique position today. This slide
summarizes what we want you to take away from our comments today. The headline and the chart on the right really
say it all. We have the flexibility and the resiliency to weather lower prices, and we'll exercise that flexibility as
appropriate. Importantly, at this time we do not see any major impediment to our ability to deliver on our stated goals
for the next few years, and those are 3% to 5% volume and margin growth with a competitive dividend. We still
believe this is a winning formula for our shareholders and we have a plan to deliver it.
We have momentum in our volume growth due to the startup of several major products this year in places like Europe,
Malaysia, the oil sands and APLNG. And we have steady growth coming from our North American unconventionals.
And it goes without saying we'll continue to stay focused on margins and returns. On a price normalized basis, we
expect to achieve our margin targets. This is driven by growing liquids production in areas with favorable fiscals. In
addition, the major project startups in 2015 will generate steady cash flows for years to come.
Importantly, at current commodity prices our capital investments generate attractive returns. And in the
unconventionals, we have a multi-year inventory of projects that have a cost of supply that is lower than the prices we
are seeing today. So we're well positioned to adjust to the current environment without affecting our overall
performance targets. And here's the key reasons why.
During the past few years, we've spent a significant amount of capital on the major projects I just mentioned. In fact,
2014 was the peak year of capital spending at Surmont and APLNG. So beginning in 2015, capital in our major
projects begins to taper off. As shown on the right-hand chart, with growing development capital spend, we have
significantly more flexibility to ramp up or down our capital as circumstances dictate. This is flexibility we have not
had for many years but is what we set out to create when we established the independent ConocoPhillips over two years
ago.
As we think about capital levels going into 2015, we first consider all of our priorities for investment. As we have said
consistently since the spin, our top priority is the dividend. This is an important part of our investment thesis. The
dividend provides discipline in our capital allocation process and we believe that it's important in a mature business, so
no change to the outlook on the dividend. The next consideration is affordability of capital and cash flow neutrality.
Since the spin, we've been consistent about targeting late 2016 to 2017 for cash flow neutrality and achieving that
neutrality is still a priority.
We are currently in the process of setting our 2015 capital budget and we'll announce that later in December. What you
should expect is that we will exercise the flexibility we have and announce a range of capital spending that is not only
lower than 2015 but lower than our stated target of $16 billion per year. Across the Lower 48, we can throttle back on

our less mature unconventional plays while continuing to invest in our highest-margin short cash cycle projects in the
Eagle Ford and the Bakken. These are the best returns in our portfolio and give us the confidence that we need to meet
our volume target of 3% to 5%, even with a bit lower capital next year. Finally, we have a very healthy balance sheet,
including cash on hand. We think of our financial strength as a competitive advantage.
So in summary, we're well positioned for the current environment. We're coming out of a significant transformation as
a company at a time when asset quality, capital flexibility and financial strength matter. We're going to act prudently,
but our plan is on track. We're focused on executing that plan and we don't anticipate any significant change to
delivering our stated goal to our shareholders. Hopefully these opening comments will provide you a bit of insight in
the context that we're thinking about the current environment.
So now back to our regularly scheduled program stepping through the quarterly results. So please turn to the next slide.
Here's a summary of our overall achievements for the third quarter. Of course this is our company-level said-did chart
that we show every quarter. I won't cover all the points here in detail. I'll leave that for both Jeff and Matt. But the key
takeaway here is the business is on track. We delivered our targeted volume and margin growth for the quarter, we
increased our dividend to the shareholders and we exited the quarter in a very strong financial position, with almost $6
billion of cash and short-term investments on hand.
So now let me turn the call over to Jeff and Matt, and they'll go over the results of the quarter in a bit more detail. And
I'll come back at the end of the call with some concluding remarks and field your questions.
Jeff W. Sheets
Thanks, Ryan. My comments this morning will be brief, reflecting the straightforward nature of our third quarter
results. Slide seven presents our adjusted earnings. Sequentially and year-over-year, adjusted earnings reflect lower
commodity prices. However, we saw strong operational performance this quarter and we successfully executed several
major turnarounds. Volumes reflected a dip sequentially for these planned maintenance activities. Third quarter
adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion or $1.29 a share. A segment breakdown of those earnings is shown in the lower
right of this chart and further segment details can be found in the supplemental data, which is available on our website.
If you turn to slide eight, I'll quickly summarize our production results for the quarter. As you know, our convention for
production is continuing operations excluding Libya. On this basis, our third quarter volumes averaged 1.473 million
BOE per day, which is slightly above the midpoint of our guidance.
We anticipated a significant level of turnaround activity in the third quarter. As you can see, we had 37,000 BOE per
day of additional downtime compared to last year, with 35,000 BOE of that coming from our planned maintenance
work. Normalizing for those impacts, we achieved 62,000 BOE per day of underlying growth. This represents a 4%
increase year-over-year and keeps us on track to deliver our 3% to 5% growth in 2014. On the same basis, this
represents a 7% liquids growth year-over-year. This high-value liquids increase is really making a difference in our
margin, which I'll cover on the next slide.
This is our typical slide showing year-over-year sequential cash margins. The left chart reflects margins at actual prices
during the period and the right chart is price normalized. On a price-normalized basis, third quarter margins improved
8% year-over-year. Of that growth, about 2% is from FX-related tax items and reduced Libya volumes. So underlying
cash margin growth was about 6%, and this is despite higher costs associated with the significant turnaround activity in
the quarter. This metric will be volatile on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but like our volume target, we're on track to
achieve our 3% to 5% growth target for margins for the year.
And finally, I'll review our year-to-date cash flow waterfall on the next slide. Again, this is straightforward. We began
the year with $6.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Year-to-date, we've generated $12.5 billion of cash from
operating activities and added $1.3 billion from the FCCL distribution earlier this year. Over this period, we've had
about a $200 million improvement in working capital and added $1 billion of net proceeds from dispositions.
Year-to-date, we have funded a $12.7 billion capital program with $4.6 billion of those expenditures coming in the

third quarter. The third quarter will be the peak capital spending quarter for 2014, and we're still on track for the $16.7
billion of capital for 2014 that we announced in December of last year.
After funding our capital program and dividend, we ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and short-term
investments. As a reminder, we need about $1 billion to run our business, so the remainder will be available to fund our
capital programs.
This concludes the review of our financial performance. Now I'll turn the call over to Matt for an update on operations.
Matthew J. Fox
Thanks, Jeff. The key operational message is that execution is on track across our global portfolio. It was a very busy
quarter for turnarounds in our base operations, and we completed these activities on schedule and on budget. We also
achieved some important milestones and stack-ups in our major projects, continued to deliver strong performance from
our North American unconventionals and progressed our exploration activities, including the discovery of a new oil
play offshore Senegal.
So let's jump into a review of our segment performance, starting with the Lower 48 and Canada, on slide 12. In the
Lower 48, third quarter production averaged 343,000 (sic) [543 million] (11:51) BOE per day. That's a 9% overall
increase from the third quarter of last year and represents a 25% increase in crude oil production over the same period.
Leading this growth were our liquids-rich Eagle Ford and Bakken assets, which averaged a combined 212,000 BOE per
day, a 33% increase from the third quarter last year. Sequentially, Eagle Ford production is relatively flat, in line with
our guidance. As you'll recall, last quarter we indicated growth would be flatter through the end of the year as we
continue to shift to pad drilling and bring new wells online in batches.
We remain on track for continued growth into 2015 and beyond. The Eagle Ford averaged 157,000 BOE per day in the
third quarter. This represents a 31,000 BOE per day, or a 25%, increase from the same quarter last year. We continue to
execute and evaluate pilot tests in the Eagle Ford, including single horizontal well tests in the Upper Eagle Ford. These
tests have been encouraging, and we'll soon begin testing a three-layer development concept by placing a layer of wells
in the Upper Eagle Ford and two layers of wells in the Lower Eagle Ford. The wells will be drilled 660 feet apart in
each layer. We call this an 80-acre triple stack.
The Bakken averaged 55,000 BOE per day over the quarter, up 21,000 BOE per day from the third quarter last year, a
62% increase. We continue to pilot test 160-acre dense spacing in the Bakken. But based on the results we've seen
to-date, it's too early to make a decision about our ultimate spacing there. We've also made good progress in our
Permian and Niobrara appraisal activities in 2014. In the Permian, we're currently focused on appraising the multiple
stacked horizons in the Delaware Basin. And in the Niobrara, we are testing several alternative well configurations and
completion techniques. In both areas, we continue to see encouraging results.
Before I leave the unconventionals, I want to highlight the chart on the bottom left. This chart represents third-party
data that shows ConocoPhillips has the lowest cost of supply unconventional portfolio compared to our peers. This
means we are the best positioned to withstand lower prices, and remember that not all unconventionals are created
equal, and being in the sweet spot matters now more than ever. We will provide a more complete update on our
unconventional reservoir appraisal and pilot test activities at our analyst meeting next year.
In addition to our unconventional activities in the Lower 48, we continue to be active in the Gulf of Mexico. After
further evaluation at Coronado, we have decided not to continue with appraisal of that discovery, and we took our
initial wildcat costs to dry hole this quarter. However, we continue to be very active this year appraising our three
significant discoveries at Shenandoah, Tiber, and Gila, so stayed tuned for more information on those.
In addition, we have a rig coming early 2015 that will allow us to start evaluating our operated portfolio. So our Lower
48 segment continues to deliver strong performance.

Our Canadian business also performed well during the quarter. It produced 276,000 BOE per day, which includes a 9%
increase in liquids production year-over-year. At Surmount 1 we completed a significant turnaround and are now back
at full production with rates as planned. Foster Creek F achieved first production in September and it's expected to
ramp up over the next 12 months to 18 months.
Our major project at Surmount 2 is making good progress and remains on schedule for first steam in May 2015. This is
an important large-scale oil sands project that will provide steady production and cash flow in the future. The chart on
the bottom right shows the steam oil ratios for several oil sands projects. Our three projects – Surmount, Christina
Lake, and Foster Creek – had the lowest SORs compared to our competitors last year.
Low SORs are the key to low cost of supply. And just like the unconventionals, it really matters to be in the best
geology in the oil sands. On the exploration front, we're continuing to explore and appraise our unconventional plays
with some very encouraging results in the Montney and Duvernay. Again, we expect to provide more detail at the
analyst meeting.
Next I'll cover Alaska and Europe segments on slide 13. Alaska average production was 155,000 BOE per day,
reflecting higher planned maintenance downtime at Prudhoe Bay. At CD5, the Alpine Central facilities tie-in work is
progressing on schedule. The project is more than 50% complete and on track for startup in late 2015. We've
sanctioned the Drill Site 2S project and, assuming acceptable federal permits, we plan to sanction the Greater Mooses
Tooth project in the first quarter of 2015. We are also progressing the 1H NEWS project.
This is the third new project we've initiated since the passage of the More Alaska Production Act. And in addition to
the progress on these projects, we have also signed a contract to build a new rotary drilling rig for Kuparuk.
We are also making progress on the Alaska LNG Project. We have FERC approval to start the pre-file process for the
project. This milestone sets the stage for the environmental review required for the siting, design, and construction
permitting of the project. An export application has also been filed with the DOE and the Federal Register. So we're
making progress on the preliminary work to move this project forward.
Moving on to Europe, third quarter production averaged 194,000 BOE per day. This is up 10% year-over-year,
reflecting new production from the startups at Jasmine, the new East Irish Sea facility, and Eldfisk South, partly offset
by normal fuel decline. The Britannia Long-Term Compression project started up in the third quarter, and Eldfisk II
hook up and commissioning activities continue on schedule for early 2015 startup.
Now let's review our Asia Pacific and Middle East segments and Other International segments on slide 14. In the
APME segment, we produce 301,000 BOE per day in the third quarter. This reflects major turnaround work at
Bayu-Undan and Darwin LNG. At Bayu-Undan we also initiated Phase III drilling during the quarter. We were pleased
to report that Gumusut achieved first production in early October. The new floating production system is running well
and we expect to ramp up production in this high-margin field over the next few months. This project is one of the key
drivers of production and margin growth going into 2015. The KBB project is ready for startup. We expect first gas in
November, but our rate will be significantly constrained pending repairs on a third-party pipeline. We expect to be at
full rate in this project by mid-2015.
On a combined downstream and upstream basis, the APLNG project is now about 84% complete and remains on
schedule for a mid-2015 startup. This is another project that will provide stable production and cash flow for many
years to come. In exploration, we spudded the Barosso-3 well in October and completed the second phase of our
appraisal program in the greater Poseidon area. These fields represent possible options for Darwin LNG backfill in the
future.
In our Other International segment, we announced that oil was discovered in cretaceous sandstones offshore Senegal
with our FAN-1 well. We're encouraged by the presence of a working petroleum system in this frontier basin, and we're
now evaluating further work to enhance our understanding of the play and its commerciality. We're currently drilling
an additional well, SNE-, testing a different play in the area. This is the second of a two-well commitment in this block.
By the way, if Senegal advances as a development project, ConocoPhillips has the option to take over operatorship, so
more to come on Senegal. We continue drilling our Kamoxi well in Block 36 in Angola and we expect to have some

initial results on this well soon.
In Poland, we're continuing to test the Lublewo well after a large fracture stimulation. As you know, we were exploring
for gas, but the results of the well indicate that we're in a more liquids-rich window. We're studying the data and
evaluating next steps, and we will update the market once our evaluation is complete. In Colombia, we recently
spudded the Picoplata well in the La Luna shale trend. Finally, the Es Sider terminal in Libya opened in late August.
We completed our first lift in early September and had two additional liftings this month. We're currently producing
about 25,000 BOE per day net. We continue to monitor the situation in Libya, but it will remain out of our production
guidance given the ongoing uncertainty.
I'll wrap up my prepared remarks with our volume outlook on slide 15. This is our typical chart of quarterly volume
guidance for continuing operations, excluding Libya. The first three quarters represent actuals. We expect a significant
ramp-up in volumes going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Key drivers of this production increase are the
completion of our major turnaround season and ramp-up at Gumusut and Britannia Long-Term Compression. We now
expect fourth quarter volumes to be in the range of 1,545 BOE to 1,575 BOE per day, which is lower than previous
guidance for the quarter but still achieves the full-year targets we laid out early in the year.
The fourth quarter adjustments reflect three main drivers. First, we don't expect to be providing ramp gas to our
third-party LNG project in Australia during the quarter. This was always viewed as a short-term production option.
Second, as mentioned earlier, we expect a delay of full ramp-up at KBB due to third-party pipeline repairs. And finally,
at current prices we expect to reject ethane in our San Juan Basin operations. This is strictly a value play. What we give
up on rate, we'll gain on margins.
Despite these changes to fourth quarter expectations, we've had a very strong year, and we're on track to grow
production by 4% compared to 2013. Again, this is exactly in line with the guidance we provided at the start of the
year. And we're well positioned to deliver our longer-term growth targets with strong momentum going into 2015. This
momentum comes from our continued ramp from recent startups at FCCL, Malaysia, the U.K., and Norway, and
ongoing strong production from our unconventionals.
In addition, in 2015 we have growth coming from our major project startups at Eldfisk II, APLNG, Surmont 2, and
Foster Creek Phase G. The bottom line is we continue to execute safely and efficiently, and we're well positioned to
deliver our strategic objectives. We look forward to providing an operational update at our Analyst Meeting in April.
Now I'll turn the call back to Ryan for closing remarks.
Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Matt. So let me recap a bit of what you've heard today. First, we are on track to deliver our goals of 3% to
5% volume and margin growth with an attractive dividend. And we're well positioned for the current price
environment. We're laser-focused on executing our plans while using our capital flexibility to respond to short-term
factors. We have good production momentum going into 2015 and we'll expect to announce a 2015 capital program
that reflects the priority of achieving cash flow neutrality without impacting our ability to deliver on our growth targets.
So we're following the plan and the path we laid out two years ago, and it's working. And as Matt said, we look forward
to providing you a more detailed company update at our Analyst Meeting in April.
So with that, let me turn it over to everyone on the phone and back to the operator for some Q&A.

<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Yes, so I think if I heard you correctly, obviously oil prices being lower, you've said sort of
similar volume outlook for less CapEx. Obviously correct me if I misheard that. But I was just wondering how much,
when you look at the overall program going forward, of that sort of saving on CapEx is sort of well performance, shale
outperforming, to enable you to hit your growth for lower amount of dollars spent? How much is deferral? You
mentioned deferring some early-phase shale. It would be interesting to know how much you spend on that in 2014. And
then how much is perhaps cost reduction?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, thanks, Ed. In our thinking right now, it's mostly, I would say, deferral from the less
mature of the unconventional plays that we have in the portfolio. Again, we're focused on our low cost of supply that
we have in the Eagle Ford, the core areas that we're drilling in the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, those are going to remain a
big part of what we're doing going forward. But it is a deferral out of some of those less mature plays.
What we don't know going into the year is how the costs are going to develop. Depending on your view or how bullish
or bearish you are in commodity prices over the next couple of years. What I don't know is how much scope we're
going to get done for the capital that we said. And that's something that we're going to watch pretty closely, depending
on where the prices level out and how long it stays there, what that cost structure is going to look like. Things will
correct if it stays at $80, we know that.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And then a question on APLNG. Obviously you're saying first production around the middle
of next year. When do you reckon you would get the first commercial cargo in terms of us starting to sort of model a
cash flow contribution from that project? Obviously we still hear about delays with the main contractors out in the
Queensland gas area.
And then any comments on this reversionary claim by Tri-Star? Would that disrupt your ability to hit those goals?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So, Ed, we'd expect the first cargo would be some time late in the third quarter or early in the
fourth quarter from APLNG. And we're on track to deliver that. We don't think that our resource possession is going be
influenced by this Tri-Star issue.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Yeah, I'm not as familiar with Aussie law, but if they win and secure an access to the project,
would you need to buy third-party gas from others? Or presumably you could buy it from them. And I just don't know
sunk costs would be treated.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So we don't anticipate that that's going be an issue, Ed. We don't think that that claim has
merit.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Ed.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Ryan, it seems like based on your comments and I think the way that you answered Ed's
question that you guys are probably going to be as focused as ever on your capital expenditure and your operating cost
control in the current budgeting round, at least as much as ever. But the second part was about sustainable cost
opportunities. What was your point, that it wasn't clear how significant they were? And also where they might be,
whether or not they're in the supply chain or the well service areas or what have you. And so I guess the question is,
first, kind of a clarification on that point. And also, are you doing anything different in the current budgeting round to
try and locate some of these cost opportunities and possibly capture them?

<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, thanks, Doug. No, we sent our procurement group out to scour the world in terms of
making sure that we're getting the best deal we can for all those services that we are providing. My comment is related
to the last downturn we saw in this business. The costs came down a fair amount as well. They've risen over the last
four years to five years, but if we stay at this $80-ish world for a year or two, then we would expect some of the costs to
start coming down. And we're trying to capture those as fast and as quickly as we can.
So, again, a lot of our contracts, whether they're drilling rig or pumping services, they're relatively short term. So the
reductions that should come, we ought to be able to capture them very quickly. And that's our intention. But we're laser
focused on both the capital that we're spending, make sure we get as much scope as we can out of it, and the costs that
we're spending across the whole enterprise.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. I understand. And then also on Venezuela, you guys filed for arbitration recently. So
just wanted to see if we can get an update on the next steps there, the timing and how you're thinking about that
situation.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, so we have two sets of arbitration that are going on. The recent arbitration that we filed
is a contractual arbitration relative to the joint operating agreements we had for both the Hamaca and the Petrozuata
projects in the Orinoco Belt. So that's different and separate from the arbitration that we filed a few years back that's
working its way through the system. So the phase of that arbitration is we are both submitting our damages claim to the
tribunal, both ConocoPhillips and the Venezuelans are submitting that to the tribunal. Then the tribunal will rule on the
amount of the damages. This contractual arbitration is something distinct and separate from that that will progress
through the courts, just like the other arbitration has.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. Thanks a lot, everybody.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Doug.

Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Great. Thanks. If I may kind of go into the CapEx sort of discussion again, when you look at
obviously a lower-price oil environment and moderating spending a little bit to bring more of that balance, how many, I
guess, years of that could you do before, when you look into 2017 and beyond, that becomes more of a question,
whether or not you can support that 3% to 5% growth beyond that period?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes. That's exactly what we're looking. We have a lot of flexibility in the portfolio. So we have
created that over the last couple of years as this major projects has ramped down, and we're spending more on the
development drilling side. So we can ramp that down or ramp that up based on the market that we see. And to your
point, I mean, if we stayed at lower capital levels than what we've described since the spin, and we do that for a
prolonged period, two years or three years, it starts to potentially impact some of the growth, but that occurs well
beyond 2017. So that's why we have a range of 3% to 5% production growth is we'll monitor the market, we'll watch it,
and make sure we do the right thing for the company and the shareholders. But the impact would be longer-term. So
what we're doing now with the major projects rolling off, the production that we're delivering is why we've got
confidence between now and 2017 in the plans that we've laid out that we'll deliver on the 3% to 5% volume growth.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: So you made a comment on some of the more, I guess, new venture type of unconventionals, you
know, could take a bit of a back seat for now. Where does exploration sort of rank on that sort of pecking order list?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, it's in a similar bucket as the less mature unconventionals, because that's investments
we're making today for the long-term growth and development of the company. So, yes, as we look at our
commitments that we have on the exploration side and some of the new opportunities that might presenting themselves,
we're taking a bit of a pause in slowing some of that down as well.

<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then if I could quickly ask on Coronado, could you give us a little bit
of color on your thoughts on, I guess, it doesn't look like you guys are going to be involved in any activity there
anymore. Can you give a little color on that?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes. I mean, the original discovery well was very encouraging, but the first appraisal well that
we drilled was intended to establish what the overall size was, and it was disappointing. So rather than continue to
appraise that, we feel as if it would be better to direct our exploration and appraisal dollars elsewhere. So that's why we
decided not to continue pursuing Coronado. It doesn't have any implications for overall deep-well or Gulf of Mexico
exploration program. We've got very strong position there, over 2 million net acres that we like a lot. We've got a few
big discoveries already that we're appraising and so it doesn't have any long-term implications for our Gulf of Mexico
exploration program.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy A. Baber>: Thanks for taking my question. The overall production this year, you expect to basically come in
line with your expectations, and we can see the growth projects expected to come on the next few years, which are
significant, as well as the uplift you'll get from the U.S. unconventional piece. But my question is around your
underlying and more mature base of production. How have you felt about that base this year, how it's performed? Are
there any trends you would highlight or areas where you have seen improvement or you see potential for improvement
going forward? Just trying to get a better sense of how base production might evolve over the next couple of years and
what you're seeing on that front.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: No, our base performance is virtually identical to what we thought it would be. I mean, we
have good predictive capability on all of our major legacy assets, and we understand the decline in our base projects, so
there are no surprises at all across the portfolio in our base production.
<Q - Guy A. Baber>: Okay. Great. And then upstream results in Canada have been especially impressive this year,
especially in light of where some of that profitability has been the last couple of years despite relatively consistent
pricing and production. So I was just hoping you could comment in a little bit more detail on the evolving profitability
of that business unit. Have you made significant strides there in improving the underlying cost structure and the
profitability of that business? Just wanting to better understand that strength and then the sustainability of that going
forward.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I think that's probably more of a factor of just market conditions that we've seen in different
quarters. The third quarter was a pretty strong quarter for us for bitumen realizations, kind of seasonal blending
requirements, kind of [indiscernible] (36:41) prices. All those things worked pretty well in the third quarter, so we had
strong bitumen realizations. I think you saw our market prices go down by $6 or so quarter-to-quarter, but you saw
bitumen prices only go down by maybe half of that. And a lot of that has to do with all the things that go into bitumen
realizations.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I mean the other thing that's helping the business is we're operating extremely well. I mean, the
operating efficiency in our oil sands assets is tremendous. I mean, Surmont, for example, is producing consistently well
above the design capacity. Our Western Canada business unit has had a tremendous focus on cost management and
capital efficiency for the development programs, so we're executing well, as well as seeing some benefit from the WCS
sort of differentials.
<Q - Guy A. Baber>: Thanks for the comments.

Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you, everybody. Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Hey, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Hey. Ryan, I wonder if I could try one for you and then one for Matt. And for you I'm really just
curious on your perspective on what's happened to the commodity here. I know it's a big-picture question, but I guess
one of the hangovers of being a big oil company is longer-term planning, so I'm not expecting Conoco to have any kind
of knee-jerk reactions. But I just wonder if you could give us your perspectives and specifically around Libya given
that you are, I guess, an operating company there, how sustainable you think Libya is. And then I've got a follow-up
more specifically on the assets. Thanks.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, thanks, Doug. Yeah, on the macro picture, probably a lot of what you hear surprising
how quickly the Libyans came back from zero to what we're seeing today, 600,000 barrels, 700,000 barrels a day gross
production. But we don't have any people on the ground in Libya, but we do have some national employees that are
part of our company that are there in Tripoli, and the situation is very tenuous. The one faction that took over the NOC
offices in fact bombed the NOC offices in Tripoli. So I think the whole Libya thing is just kind of hanging on right
now, so there is tenuous supply out there that I think is a bit at risk, which we'll have to just see over the course of the
next few months. But I think the demand side has been a little bit surprising out of some of the non-OECD countries in
the Far East, and obviously China trying to figure out where their demand is going to come out and how much the
growth is happening in the country.
So definitely a well-supplied market right now, and we can all speculate what the Saudis are going to go do. But I think
they are a little upset with some of their customer base being taken away by some of the other countries. So it is a bit of
a mixed bag of things that are out there. But I think for us, it's a global diversified company, that's what we're trying to
do. We run scenarios, we don't think about point estimates in oil prices, we run different scenarios and we try to
anticipate what we would do in capital investment, what the company, the portfolio would look like under these various
scenarios. So I think we're well-positioned for where we find the market today.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I appreciate that. I guess my other question is to Matt. It kind of really bridges between the
discretionary spending in the portfolio, Matt, relative to obviously the very competitive economics you guys have had.
So I guess what I'm kind of looking at is 15% of your spending budget, what was laid out, is exploration or defined as
exploration, which I guess would have no impact on the short-term production. So as you look at a lower oil price
environment and you think about the plan, not to get into too many specifics, because you haven't given us a number
yet obviously, how do you think about where you would cut capital first and if there was an area in your Lower 48
portfolio that might be challenged in the current environment, how would you kind of rank worst through best, if you
like?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So it's really an opportunity to exercise the flexibility, and where we would anticipate that we
would ramp more slowly than the previous plans would be in our less-mature plays. So we don't need to ramp as
quickly in the Permian as we had previously thought, so we could take some scope there. And the same applies to the
Niobrara and to some of our plays in Western Canada. So those are the primary areas where we could take some
flexibility without having any significant impact on our rate between now and 2017.
So those are the main areas. We'll also choke back a little bit in exploration, but we're still committed to exploration as
an engine for organic growth for the company in the long-term. So we need to be balancing a long-term view of the
company's growth potential with the short-term conditions that we find ourself in.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: Is it fair to describe, Matt, $2 billion of exploration? I mean that's a big cushion. Would that be
the first place if things got worse, [ph] last question (42:06), is that the first place you would look to cut while
maintaining rate? I just want to understand because it just seems you've got a lot more flexibility than some of your
peers now. I'll leave it there.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, Doug, that's one of the areas we would look. But as I say, it's a balancing act for the
short-term and the long-term. We've got a lot of flexibility in our Lower 48 and Canada portfolio to manage our capital
over this period without having a big impact on growth. So we're certainly not going to gut our exploration program.
We need to maintain exploration for the long-term organic growth of the company, and we're going to do that.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: All right. Very clear. Thanks, fellas.

Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Société Générale. Please go ahead.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yes, thanks. I've got some quick ones for Matt. Can you say anything else about the well in
Angola, the pre-salt well? Were you seeing anything on the way down? Because you're going to TD that soon. And
then also with Poland, can you talk at all about the test results in the shale?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: It's too early to say anything about the Kamoxi well, John. I mean, we expect to have that done
sometime in the next couple of weeks, and we'll make some announcement once we've actually got some results to talk
about. So it's too early really to talk about now. On the Poland well, yes, we have had some tests in Poland in a more
down-depth location than this well that were gas wells. We drilled this well in this location anticipating we'd find the
same fluids, and we essentially found what's really an oil well. And so we're scratching our head a bit to understand
what's going on. There's some sort of thermal maturity change that we weren't anticipating, and we're at the stage of
essentially conducting a long-term fluid test, done some pressure buildups, and then we'll have a better understanding
of what the implications of this are in the next few months.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Matt. And then one other one from me. Given the fact that we've had
prices break down, ultimately there may be more properties available on the market for the companies that don't go
public. Will you at all look to supplement your acreage positions in the unconventional plays by buying additional
assets or acreage? Be opportunistic?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, we're out there screening land all the time, both in North America and internationally. So
if opportunities come up that would meet with our portfolio well and at a decent price early in the lifecycle, then we
would be ready to take advantage of that if those opportunities came up.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I think the early in the lifecycle comment that Matt made is key there, because we do have a lot
of organic growth opportunities in the existing portfolio that we are funding currently.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thanks, John.

<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, guys. Good afternoon.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Hey, Paul.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Maybe this is for Matt or for Ryan. First question, from a portfolio management standpoint, if
we're looking at today, Bakken, Eagle Ford and SAGD account for 20%, 22%, 23% of your production. So from a
portfolio management standpoint, Matt and Ryan, is there a level that you feel uncomfortable saying that, okay, there's
too much concentration? Or what is the desirable optimum percentage of your asset mix should be in the North
American onshore and conventional oil portfolio?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, I guess, Paul, kind of thinking about it along those lines, or trying to hit an optimum sort
of percentage, I'll take low cost of supply, which the Bakken and the Eagle Ford represent, and then balance that with
the SAGD, which is these longer-term 40-year, 50-year projects that provide an incredible base amount of cash flow
with high-margin productions. They're a little bit different. So really not targeting a percentage, just making sure they
fit the returns profile and they're competitive with the rest of the investments we have, the opportunities we have in the
portfolio. And they do compete. And obviously Bakken and Eagle Ford are at a very low cost of supply, very high
returns.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So from that standpoint, risk come also with opportunity. And so if you did that, the commodity
price, let's say, stay at this $80 or even lower for one year or two years, will you be willing then to use your balance
sheet or perhaps stretch your balance sheet to make some acquisition there to even further beef up what you consider
that maybe is an advantaged position to be even bigger? Or you would be too concerned about the balance sheet and
that's not something that you would like to do?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: That really just depends on the quality of the opportunity that we see out there. As we've talked
about before, we do have balance sheet capacity. We ended up the quarter with $6 billion in cash. We're going to use
some of that as we go through just funding our program until we get to the point of cash flow neutrality. But as Matt
said, we're always going to be out there looking for opportunities if they make sense. We shouldn't be afraid to use our
balance sheet, but we do have a pretty strong inventory of existing opportunities in the portfolio today.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Two final quick ones. One, Matt, any rough range you can provide for 2015 production? And
second, for Ryan, it looked like there is somewhat of a status quo for your CapEx program at today's price, you may
trim here and there. But is there a level of the commodity prices that once you reach there for an extended period of
time, whatever you define it then, and you will start to be revisiting your overall program and maybe consider that time
had changed?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So on the production question, the best guidance I can give, Paul, is that we expect to deliver
3% to 5% production growth moving from 2014 into 2015, just as we have from 2013 to 2014, and then keep that
going through 2016 and 2017. So the best guidance is the 3% to 5% production growth.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, and on the second part there, Paul, there's nothing status quo about what's happening
today in the market. So we'll look at that as we've got a lot of flexibility. We've got flexibility in our capital program,
we've got cash on the balance sheet, we've got balance sheet flexibility. We'll monitor the system and I am pretty
focused on cash flow neutrality. I think we have to have a plan that gets us there, and so that's a stake that we've put in
the ground. And again, go back to the guidance that I provided in the call here, which says next year I'm looking at a
capital amount that's lower than this year and, in fact, lower than the $16 billion guidance that we threw out there when
we put our plan in place for the company's 3% to 5% growth.

Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Hi. I guess good morning, depending on where you are, or good afternoon.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thanks, Roger.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Just a couple of other things, kind of thinking about the whole cash flow balance sheet
approach. You all went through a very large, I guess, the shrink part of the shrink-to-grow approach here over the last
couple of years. If you're looking for ways to potentially plug an opening in the cash flow CapEx front over the next
year or two years if crude stays where it is, are there other assets identified for sale? If I remember correctly, you had a
larger portfolio of potential sales than were actually executed, so presumably there's still some non-core assets out
there.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: The approach we have on asset sales going forward is just to point people to the fact that we've
got a large portfolio of assets. You look at a company of our size, roughly $100 million of assets out there, but you can
always expect that there'll be some level of asset sales that will be happening. So is there $1 billion or so, maybe $2
billion of asset sales a year, that's probably not an unreasonable expectation. Unlike what we've done in the past where
we've kind of identified particular assets that we're going to be marketing, we don't anticipate we'd be doing that going
forward. So you'd just likely hear about things as they happen. We are going to be disciplined about portfolio
management going forward, but there's nothing in particular that we would identify today that we'd want to talk about
as an asset sale.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. Thanks. And then the other question on the OpEx side. We've talked a lot about capital
allocation and so forth and you mentioned earlier contracts with the service companies. But rather than necessarily
drilling a new well, what opportunities do you have on the operating side to lower costs, if any? Or what should we
think of to watch maybe as an independent factor for thinking about lower costs?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, so we're going through our budgeting phase just now, and we're asking all of our
operating units and our staff groups to take a very close look at operating costs for next year to look for opportunities to
adjust our overall operating cost structure. So it's just part of our ongoing disciplined approach to managing our cost
structure, and we certainly are focused on that. But we're always focused on that.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Right. So I guess is there anything we should think about, well workovers or something like
that, you can defer some of that work, or are there ways, I'm just trying to think expendable costs, something like that,
that you can manage down?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes. I mean, there are opportunities. Probably the last place we would go is through just well
work and workover activity. That's very value-adding operating costs. But we're asking all of our operating units to
take a hard look at their operating costs for next year. But that's not different from what we usually do, frankly.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thanks, Roger.

<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Thanks for being so clear at what is a difficult time of year I know to talk about this stuff. I
think just to clarify a comment you made, to be very clear, Ryan. I think you said quite specifically that CapEx next
year would be lower and below your $16 billion guidance. Was that your opening statement?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: That's correct.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: That's great. Thanks, that makes that clear. And I guess if we were to think of what you thought
of as an attractive dividend, we would assume that that would be rising over time, otherwise it kind of wouldn't be
attractive, right?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes. We've said over time, we expect to be increasing the dividend, so yes, it will remain
attractive.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: And by the way, I'm not setting out here to trick you in any way, I'm just making quite sure
we're clear here. So what you've then said is that you're kind of locked into the major project spending, obviously, and
that's a very important part of you meeting your volume guidance. But you have an increasing amount of essentially
discretionary CapEx over the coming years, which would allow you, should the environment stay tough, to cut back
fairly easily on your spending in order to balance your budget.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes. I think that's right, Paul. That's a place we haven't been as a company, that we set out to
create more flexibility, lower cost to supply across the portfolio. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, today and
through 2014, about 50% of our capital is what you described, the major projects that are going to help deliver the 3%
to 5% growth. The discretion, the flexibility that we're creating in the company is a lot more of that capital going to the
development drilling programs, both the mature, low-cost supply – Eagle Ford, Bakken – and the less mature things
that we're doing in the Permian, the Niobrara, and up in Canada, Montney, Duvernay and what we're doing
internationally.
So that represents in the next couple of years over 70% of our capital. So that capital is flexible and we'll manage the
capital level based on the commodity price environment that we see, the opportunity set that's in front of us, and the
cash flows we have coming in as a company.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Yeah, and it feels like even if you were, let's say, to cut in the way that you're describing
already in fact CapEx next year, the volume impact, because of the fact these are more frontier-type developments, the
volume impact is actually going to be fairly limited within the 2017 timeframe. Is that correct? I mean, very limited.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, that's exactly right, Paul, is the – our volume growth target is execution of the plans that
we've had over the last couple of years. It's the investments we've made over the last two years. It's the projects that
we've been investing in for the last five years or six years, those are coming to fruition now this year and into next year.
So what we do, whether it's 2015 or goes beyond 2015, has very little impact on our plans and our production growth
targets through 2017 that we outlined and described to the market over the last couple of years.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Right. So and then if I could just round it all off, one thing I think is very small, but I'll just
highlight, is that in the past you talked about running with $2 billion I think of cash as a kind of working need, but you
today said $1 billion. And secondly, one thing – you did, yes. Is that what you did say? Sorry.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yes, $1 billion would be the correct number.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: And the one thing that did worry me, Ryan, was that you said that you would meet your targets
in a normalized price environment. Could you specify that? Because obviously that could mean an awful lot of
different things.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I think the point we're trying to make there, Paul, is when you look at cash margins, those
obviously are changing as commodity prices change. So as we look at the shift that's happening within our portfolio, if
you just pick one price environment, no matter what price environment it was, and stuck with that, you'd see increasing
cash margins.

<A - Ryan M. Lance>: So we're trying to be very transparent on that, Paul. We're showing you what each quarter is in
terms of the actual, but we're trying to also ground back to when we described and launched the independent company,
described how we're going to grow both margins and volumes, and we're trying to report back to that basis.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: I got you. But what worries me is when you did that, the oil was – and your planning
assumption I think was $110 Brent, if I remember rightly. I mean, it was way higher than we are today. Does it -
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, no. I mean, we were quoted as saying that that's not our planning assumption. It is not
$110 Brent. In fact, when we throw that out, we just were using current prices to demonstrate here's what the margin is
today. If you track our performance relative to that, you'll see what the margin growth is doing. So my point is the
underlying margin growth is there. The absolute number's going to fluctuate and be a bit volatile quarter-to-quarter
based on the absolute level of commodity prices. But we're trying to show that the volume growth is coming and it's at
a higher margin than the base part of the portfolio, so the margin growth is coming and it'll turn to cash flow.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: That's fair. Great. Thank you.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Paul.

Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Thanks. I recognize it's late in the call so I'll try to be particularly brief. I'm sorry to flog
the CapEx piece, but I was wondering if you could define the absolute amount of spending that's actually rolling over
on a dollar basis from the major projects year-to-year. And then secondly, I didn't know if you could maybe define a
level or price point where you would actually curtail spending on some of the more mature unconventional plays.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, I am not sure. We'll have to get back with you on the capital that's rolling over from this
year to next year, but the price has to go pretty low before we start impacting the mature plays that we have in our
unconventionals.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Okay. The second question for you is on some of the issues on production in 4Q. I think
you referenced three of them: infrastructure in Malaysia, ethane rejection, and APLNG. Just trying to get a sense of
how transitory those are? In other words, should those be kind of behind us into 1Q? I'm thinking maybe the ethane
rejection piece is the only kind of wildcard.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So based on current prices, we would expect to be continuing to reject ethane through 2016 the
way things stand just now. And that's about a third of the variance that we talked about. On APLNG, we were prepared
to take the opportunity to sell ramp gas to one of the other venturers on Curtis Island. Their project hasn't come in as
quickly as they had anticipated, so we were unlikely to be selling ramp gas to them. And then on the KBB project we're
ready to start, we are going to start sometime in November, but there's a pipeline that runs from – once the gas gets
onshore, there's a pipeline that runs from Sabah to Sarawak to take that gas to the Malaysia LNG plants, and that
pipeline has had some issues that need to be repaired, and we're not sure how long that is going to take.
We certainly don't expect it to be repaired before the end of the year, and we're assuming that it may be as late as the
middle of 2015 before we actually get that pipeline fully repaired and to full operation. So that one will linger for a
while into 2015.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thank you, Blake.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. Thanks, gentleman. A couple of quick ones. One's sort of follow up, maybe this is too
specific, on CapEx, but I believe that your prior targets to reach cash flow neutrality were based around kind of $100
Brent, $90 WTI longer-term. When we think about the amount of relative CapEx that might need to come out of the
2015 budget, should we think about kind of a mark to market on the commodity price, and then we'll try to bridge that
gap on a year-by-year basis from here?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No, we are not talking about trying to get to cash flow neutrality in 2015. So as we go forward
from 2014 to 2015, you're going to see cash flow growing as production grows from these major projects that we have
starting up. So you're going to see that cash flow growth. Even in a lower commodity price environment that we are
seeing today, the comments that Ryan was making is we still feel like we're going to get to a cash flow neutrality
number by 2016, 2017. And before we were, at the higher prices that you talked about, we were at a point where we
were actually beyond cash flow neutrality. So we still feel like that's a very doable thing for us to be doing. We don't
have a number today that we can say that it's going to be this amount of capital expenditures in 2016 or 2017 to get to
that kind of cash flow neutrality.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. Thanks. Sorry, I wasn't implying cash flow neutrality in 2015. I was implying relative to
plugging the gap relative to the prior plan to keep on pace for that 2017 time period, but -
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So, yes, I think if you think about a $20 change in price, basically, which is what we've had,
that's about a $3 billion change in our cash flow. Part of that is going to come from the fact that we were beyond cash
flow neutrality and part of it would come from lower CapEx.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. So I guess one other question on a totally different issue. In Alaska, there has obviously
been, we hear it a lot on the refining side from West Coast refiners, about increasing competition as you see Bakken
volumes or rail volumes reaching the West Coast and the impact on Alaskan crude pricing. I guess in terms of your
outlook on Alaskan crude pricing going forward, what is the outlook? What are the opportunities that you have? I know
you've done one cargo at least in terms of exporting that crude. And what sort of price differential would you need or
bottlenecks in the systems are there in terms of exporting more of that crude to Asia?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, I think, yes, what we are trying to show is we've got a lot of flexibility. So right now the
market on the West Coast needs the ANS crude, and we hear a lot about the Bakken railing there, but we've got
flexibility. We've demonstrated that by taking cargo to Asia. We have the ability and the capability to go do that.
Obviously, there's a bit more transportation costs associated with that, so if ANS starts trading well below where it's
historically traded relative to either WTI or Brent, then we could exercise the optionality we have of exporting that
crude.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the help.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Hey, guys, we're past the hour, so we'll take one final question, if you don't mind, operator.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Thanks for squeezing me in. Just one from me. As we wait for APLNG to start up, and
obviously watching LNG prices fall along with crude, can you just remind us on what the off-take arrangements are for
the plant? And any color on that would be helpful.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, so all of the gas from train one and two is contracted based on the Japanese Crude
Cocktail prices. So it's all contracted. There'll be a few spot cargos as we're ramping up production, but once we get to
full production, it's fully contracted to China and Japan.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. Perfect. That's all I needed. Thank you.
