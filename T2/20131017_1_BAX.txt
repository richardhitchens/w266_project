Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.
Thank you, Mary Kay. Good morning. Thanks for calling in. As you all saw in the press release that was issued earlier
this morning, Baxter reported solid financial results for the third quarter, which met expectations. Adjusted earnings
increased 4% to $1.19 per diluted share, and worldwide sales excluding currency increased 9%.
Excluding Gambro and foreign currency, Baxter sales advanced 6%. We've also updated our financial guidance for the
full year, which now includes sales growth of approximately 7% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted earnings of
$4.65 to $4.67 per diluted share. As a reminder, guidance reflects the impact of the Gambro acquisition.
While we continue to meet our financial objective, Baxter's global presence and diversified healthcare model, together
with the advancement we've have made to our business portfolio and new product pipeline, are focused on driving
improved access to care across key franchises in both developed and emerging markets, better outcomes for patients,
and enhanced value for our shareholders.
During the quarter, we announced a number of business development initiatives and achieved an array of new product
pipeline milestones. Some recent highlights include finalizing the acquisition of Gambro AB, a privately held global
medical technology company and leader in dialysis products, which further enhances Baxter's global renal leadership
and provides a comprehensive product and therapies portfolio to meet the needs of patients in the large and growing
dialysis market. The acquisition provides a number of long-term growth opportunities for Baxter around the world, as
well as significant cost synergies.
Second, the company executed an exclusive distribution and license agreement with JW Holdings for parenteral
nutrition products containing a novel formulation of omega 3 lipids. The agreement remains in effect for 10 years
following the first product launch, and Baxter has specified rights to certain additional nutritional products that JW
Holdings may develop or produce in the future.
And third, we announced an exclusive collaboration with Coherus Biosciences to develop and commercialize a
biosimilar to etanercept in Europe, Canada, Brazil and other markets. Biosimilars, as you know, are intended to be used
in place of existing branded biologics to treat a range of chronic and often life threatening diseases, and have the
potential to reduce cost and expand patient access. This collaboration builds on Baxter's ongoing relationship with
Momenta, expands Baxter's evolving biosimilar platform focused in the areas of immunology and oncology, and may
support an accelerated entry for Baxter into this market within the timeframe of our long-range plan.
From a pipeline perspective, we launched HyQvia in Germany as a replacement therapy for adults with primary and
secondary immunodeficiencies. HyQvia offers patients the ability to administer their treatment in a single subcutaneous
site every three weeks to four weeks and combines key benefits of intravenous and subcutaneous administration into
one product. Additional EU market launches are scheduled for the coming months. In the U.S., our regulatory activities
remain on track and we expect to complete preclinical testing and file the amendment to our BLA before the end of the
year.
We've launched RIXUBIS in the U.S., which is the only approved recombinant factor IX treatment for routine
prophylaxis and control of bleeding episodes in adults with hemophilia B. RIXUBIS is also the first new therapy
approved in hemophilia B in more than 15 years in a global market that's more than $1 billion of revenue annually. In
the fourth quarter, Baxter intends to file RIXUBIS for approval in Europe and Japan and for pediatric indication in the
United States.
Also during the quarter, we continue to expand our parenteral nutrition portfolio with the launch of CLINOMEL in
China and OLIMEL in Brazil, and also received FDA approval for CLINOLIPID, an olive oil based lipid emulsion
used in parenteral nutrition indicated for adults.
And finally, we received EMA approval to include PK-guided dosing information in ADVATE's EU label. This
information is based on a Phase IV prophylaxis clinical study and offers some patients the option of a dosing schedule
of every three days. In the study, PK-guided and standard prophylactic dosing regimens were comparably effective
reducing annual bleeding rates. This advancement offers clinicians and patients information that enables them to

personalize their treatment regimens with the goal of fewer infusions per year while effectively reducing bleeds. As you
know, promotion of this label along with ADVATE's strong efficacy and safety profile has contributed to share gains
and accelerated sales growth of our hemophilia franchise over the last two years. And given the recent focus on our
hemophilia franchise, of course, we're happy to provide further perspectives on this topic during the Q&A this
morning.
So in closing, while the global macroeconomic environment continues to be quite demanding, we remain focused on
operational performance, achieving R&D milestones and executing on a number of initiatives to enhance our growth
profile. And while we're certainly not without challenges, Baxter's portfolio remains strong and will continue to benefit
from our focus on life saving therapies, and the four growth vectors that we've discussed that support our strategic
objectives and enable us to fulfill our mission. We remain confident in our business model, our ability to innovate, and
the prospects for growth in the future of our company.
So with that, I'd know like to ask Bob to review the financial results for the third quarter and also guidance for the
remainder of 2013. Bob?
Robert J. Hombach
Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, earnings per diluted share during the third quarter
excluding special items increased 4% to $1.19 per diluted share, which was in line with our guidance. As we mentioned
in the press release, GAAP results include after-tax special items of $111 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for costs
associated with the acquisition of Gambro, increased litigation reserves and payments associated with previously
announced collaborations.
Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to our financial outlook for the rest of 2013.
Starting with sales, worldwide sales of approximately $3.8 billion advanced 9% on both a reported and constant
currency basis. Given the timing of the close of the Gambro transaction later in the third quarter, Gambro revenues for
the quarter were $100 million. So excluding Gambro, Baxter's sales rose 6% on both a reported and constant currency
basis, in line with our guidance.
Organic growth in the base Baxter business improved sequentially by approximately 200 basis points, driven by
accelerated growth in emerging markets as we benefited from certain government collaborations as well as the timing
of tenders. High single digit growth of hemophilia and U.S. immunoglobulin therapies and strong performance of
certain injectable therapies, specifically cyclophosphamide, a generic oncology drug.
In terms of individual business performance, global BioScience sales exceeded $1.6 billion and advanced 6% in the
third quarter both on a reported and constant currency basis. Within the product categories, hemophilia sales of $851
million increased 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis. This strong performance was a result of solid
global demand for ADVATE, given our label expansion in the U.S. and Europe and for FEIBA, an inhibitor therapy.
This was augmented by a benefit from the timing of certain tenders as well as shipments to Brazil as part of our
ongoing partnership with Hemobrás to enhance access to recombinant factor VIII therapy in the world's third largest
hemophilia market.
As you may recall, last year, we signed a 10-year agreement with Brazil to be the exclusive provider of recombinant
factor VIII therapy as we work together on a technology transfer to support development of local manufacturing
capabilities. We expect peak annual sales related to this partnership to approach $200 million by 2017.
In BioTherapeutics, sales of $532 million increased 3% on a reported basis, and 2% on a constant currency basis.
Growth in the U.S. for immunoglobulin therapies improved sequentially by approximately $35 million, with growth in
the quarter in high single digits, driven by improved product availability and accelerated demand for GAMMAGARD
LIQUID. This was partially offset by lower sales in international markets as a result of our decision to exit certain
markets due to previous supply constraints.

Sales in BioSurgery of $173 million increased 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. This performance
was driven by Synovis and solid growth in international markets, including sales for surgical sealants like TISSEEL
and FLOSEAL.
Finally, Vaccines revenues totaled $64 million in the quarter and increased 8%. Excluding foreign currency, sales
increased 5%, driven primarily by modest milestone payments related to our ongoing collaborations on the
development of influenza vaccines and strong performance of our FSME vaccine.
In Medical Products, global sales in the third quarter exceeded $2.1 billion and increased 10%. Excluding foreign
currency, sales increased 11%. Excluding Gambro revenues, medical product sales grew 5%, or 6% on a constant
currency basis.
Within the product categories, Renal sales totaled $746 million and increased 19%. On a constant-currency basis, sales
advanced 21%. Excluding Gambro, Renal sales increased 3%, or 5% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong PD
patient gains in the U.S. and emerging markets.
Sales in the Fluid Systems category of $792 million increased 13% on both a reported and constant-currency basis.
Performance continued to be driven by solid demand for IV solutions and price improvements for the injectable
oncology drug cyclophosphamide, which collectively more than offset lower sales of infusion pumps.
Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies, posted sales of $372
million, reflecting an increase of 1% on a reported and constant-currency basis. Strong global anesthesia growth of 8%
offset lower sales in nutritional therapies resulting from supplier shortages of distributed vitamins and lipids.
Finally, sales in BioPharma Solutions, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $244 million and declined 5%
on a reported basis or 4% on a constant-currency basis. This performance can be attributed to the timing of shipments
and our focus on building demand as we've alleviated supply constraints experienced earlier this year. We expect this
business to return to growth in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter of 52.0% was lower than the prior-year period by 10 basis
points and reflects the impact of Gambro. Excluding Gambro, Baxter's gross margin expanded by 30 basis points
versus the prior-year gross margin of 52.1%, and also improved sequentially by 10 basis points. The gross margin
improvement in Baxter's base business was a result of mix and price improvements, which offset a number of
headwinds, including foreign currency, incremental pension expense, the medical device tax, and government austerity
measures.
SG&A totaled $827 million and increased 11%, with Gambro contributing 4 points of growth. Excluding Gambro,
SG&A increased 7%, driven primarily by incremental pension expense and investments we are making in promotional
and marketing initiatives, new product launches and within international markets to enhance our global presence. In
total, these items more than offset the benefits related to tight expense management of discretionary spending and
operational efficiency derived from our process re-engineering efforts.
R&D spending in the quarter of $265 million increased 10% versus the prior year and includes 3 points of growth
related to Gambro. Excluding Gambro, growth continues to be driven by the investments we are making to advance a
number of our programs in our pipeline, including those in our leading Hemophilia franchise, our Home HD therapy,
and as well as earlier-stage programs and key collaborations.
The operating margin in the quarter of 23.0% is 80 basis points lower than last year's operating margin of 23.8%.
However, excluding Gambro, Baxter's operating margin was modestly higher than Q3 last year.
Interest expense was $45 million compared to $25 million last year, due to new debt issuances within the last year to
fund both the Covington plasma manufacturing site and the Gambro acquisition. The tax rate was 21.5% for the
quarter, generally in line with our full-year expectation and, as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted
share of $1.19 increased 4%.

Turning to cash flow, for the quarter, cash flow from operations of $966 million improved by more than $200 million
versus Q3 last year. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations exceeded $2.1 billion and is lower than the prior
year by $46 million, largely due to the timing of U.S. tax payments, the large receivable collection in Spain last year,
and an outflow related to inventory. DSO ended the quarter at 59.4 days and was higher than the prior year period by
2.4 days. Excluding Gambro, Baxter's DSO was 55.1 days and was lower than the prior year by almost 2 days.
Inventory turns of 2.1 are lower than the 2.3 turns in the prior-year period. As you know, we've increased inventory
levels to support growing demand, particularly in plasma proteins, as we remain on track to benefit from enhanced
capacity in the second half of this year.
Lastly, on a year-to-date basis, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares for $863 million, or on a net basis, 4
million shares for $428 million, in line with our full-year objective.
Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the full year 2013. As you
saw in the press release, we confirmed guidance within our previously stated range and now expect earnings of $4.65 to
$4.67 per diluted share. This includes the impact of the Gambro acquisition. By line item of the P&L and starting with
sales, we now expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, of approximately 7%, and this includes a
contribution from Gambro revenues of approximately $500 million. At current foreign exchange rates, we expect
reported sales growth of approximately 6%. Excluding Gambro, we continue to expect the Baxter base sales to grow
approximately 4% on a constant-currency basis.
For the full year, we expect gross margin for the company to be approximately 51.0%. In terms of expenses, we expect
SG&A to increase in high single digits and R&D to grow in mid-single digits. Both line items reflect leverage in the
Baxter base expense, along with the addition of Gambro. We expect interest expense to total approximately $140
million and other income to total approximately $25 million for the full year. We continue to expect a tax rate of
approximately 22%, and we expect a full-year average share count of approximately 550 million shares, which assumes
approximately $400 million in net share repurchases.
From a cash flow perspective, our plan remains to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $3.3 billion,
which excludes any cash costs associated with the Gambro transaction. We continue to expect capital expenditures
totaling approximately $1.7 billion, which includes Gambro and the investments we are making to enhance our plasma
manufacturing footprint in Covington, Georgia.
Let me move to sales and expand our assumptions for the two businesses and the major product categories. Beginning
with Medical Products, on a constant-currency basis, including the contribution of Gambro, we expect sales growth of
approximately 10%. Excluding Gambro, we expect sales for Medical Products to grow 3% to 4%. Specifically, we
expect Baxter's Renal sales to grow in low single digits, which will be augmented by the contribution from Gambro
revenues totaling approximately $500 million. We continue to expect Fluid Systems sales, which includes IV solutions,
infusion pumps and access sets, to grow in mid-single digits. We expect Specialty Pharmaceutical sales, which includes
our nutritional therapies and inhaled anesthetics, to grow in low-single digits. And we expect our BioPharma Solutions
sales to be flat to slightly down for the year.
For BioScience, we continue to project sales growth, excluding foreign currency, in the 4% to 5% range. Our outlook
includes mid-single digit growth in our Hemophilia franchise, which includes recombinant and plasma-derived factor
VIII and factor IX therapies and FEIBA, an inhibitor treatment. Growth will continue to be fueled by underlying
demand for ADVATE where we continue to realize benefits associated with the new expanded label, including
competitive gains and conversion to prophylaxis treatment. We now expect low single digit growth in BioTherapeutics,
which includes IG [immune globulin] therapies, albumin and alpha-1 treatments. While our enhanced capacity will
support accelerated volume growth in the U.S., we have lowered our guidance to reflect an expected decline in sales of
low single digits in the fourth quarter, which is due entirely to the timing of albumin shipments in China.
In BioSurgery, we expect mid to high single digit growth. And finally, we now expect our Vaccines franchise to grow
more than 15%. As mentioned in our press release, for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share of $1.24
to $1.26. Including revenues associated with the Gambro acquisition of approximately $400 million, we expect sales

growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency of 14% to 15%, or approximately 12% to 13%, including the impact
of foreign currency.
Excluding Gambro, we expect the base Baxter sales at constant currency rates to grow approximately 3% to 4%.
Thanks, and now let me open up the call for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind
participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be available on the Baxter International website for
30 days at www.Baxter.com.
Our first question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Thank you and good morning, everybody. I wanted to start with cyclophosphamide, which
you called out in your prepared remarks as driving some strength in the quarter. That's also a product that you called
out as potentially facing generic competition on a go-forward basis. So maybe you could just talk to us a little bit about
your thinking around the evolution of that product and maybe if you could throw Suprane into the mix there, as that's
also another product, I think that has a potential to face new competition as well.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Okay, David. This is Bob Parkinson. So on cyclophosphamide, just to maybe frame
this for everybody, this is a product that has grown significantly, it's approaching an annualized sales rate of about $400
million by the end of this year, and as you might expect, very high contribution margin. So the issue, obviously, is the
prospects of generic competition. And candidly, as we sit here today, it's a question of if we get competition, if so,
when; and if so, how many. And those are questions that we don't have specific answers to at this stage.
I think it's reasonable to expect that there will be competition to this product in all likelihood in early 2014. So in terms
of – and I don't want to get into too much detail in terms of potential impact for next year, like I say, it's a function of if,
and if so, when, and how many competitors, and if there's multiple competitors, as you all know, it's a very different
scenario than if there's one. So we just have to see how that goes.
But to kind of frame this maybe for everyone, and I know various analysts have taken a stab at quantifying this, we
would estimate that if we have, let's say, two competitors in the market by mid-year 2014, the bottom line impact could
be anywhere from $150 million to $200 million. So potentially, that's a very big hit. But again, it's a function of those
questions that I raised in terms of if, how many, and timing.
So on the Suprane one, that's a – it's a little different issue. And I think even more speculative. It's likely there'll be
generic competition in Suprane sometime in 2014. Not likely that there'll be multiple generic competitors. So it's a
different scenario in that regard. It's also kind of a longer term thing, I think, in terms of competitive progress in the
accounts because of the issue with the vaporizers and the fact, as you know, we still have the full spectrum of
inhalation agents that in many markets are on contract with hospitals where we own the vaporizers that are installed
and so on. So it's a very different set of dynamics. So the impact of generic Suprane next year, obviously, very, very
modest compared to the numbers that I threw out on cyclophosphamide. But not insignificant, I don't know that we've
quantified that or at this stage would even want to.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: No, we haven't quantified, other than to say that it's $300 million in sales globally, about
$200 million in the U.S. on a run rate basis. But again, I think the trajectory, as you pointed out, is going to be quite
different given the nature of the business.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: This is Mary Kay, but I'd also add Suprane also has a high contribution margin as well.

<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. Understood. And maybe just switching gears to the Hemophilia franchise and more
specifically ADVATE, as you obviously called out in the script, it's getting increased focus as we approach the
potential for a Biogen launch next year. But maybe just sort of help us understand what has been the positive impact of
some your additional indications of – I know you've had the adult prophylaxis in the U.S. for a little over a year now,
obviously, you had an additional indication in Europe. Maybe just talk to us about – remind us your view on
competitive positioning and any steps that you're proactively taking to help build the moat around the ADVATE
franchise.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Okay, I'm going to turn it over – Ludwig Hantson, as Mary Kay mentioned at the
outset, is with us and he's obviously closer to this. So Ludwig, I guess, two pieces which is impact in the market of our
expanded label and the price. Clearly, we continue to have good momentum with the brand. And then secondarily, as
we anticipate generic competition next year, [indiscernible] (26:18). So I'll turn it over to you.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Great. So thanks for the question. So the launch of the first indication is going well, it's
still ongoing. So since beginning of 2012, we switched the 400 patients to ADVATE prophy. And we've been doing
this in different waves. The first wave was the most important one focusing on efficacy and striving for a bleed-free
world. We do believe that that's key in the treatment of hemophilia.
The second wave, which we started, like, eight months later, was focusing on the three-day PK dosing method and the
launch of the 4,000 IU vial. And now we're working on the third wave, which should reinforce the second wave. We're
planning to submit an ADVATE PK device before year end, and the device should enable the physician to personalize
the dosing towards the target factor level on the basis of two blood samples. So this should help us to further reinforce
the PK dosing piece.
Now with respect to what we're doing, and let me bring the discussion up maybe one level. So last year during the
investors conference, we talked about guidance of 3% to 4% sales CAGR for the next five years. That has not changed.
So we believe in ADVATE. We believe in our team and we believe that achieving a bleed-free world is key. And with
respect to what we have done, the U.S. team is getting ready for the challenge. This team has turned a declining market
share into a share growth, and has put the bleed-free world concept on the map. So I feel pretty confident about our
LRP and our guidance that we gave for the next five years for the franchise.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay, maybe I'll sneak one more in here while you reference the LRP. One of the things you
guys have talked about is an 8% to 10% earnings CAGR over the long-range plan period, lower at the front end and
higher at the back end. Is that still a dynamic with which you're comfortable?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah, I don't want to get into the specific numbers, David. At this point, obviously,
we don't redo our LRP every quarter or every six months. We do it annually. I would maybe – just some comments to
help maybe frame our outlook in response to your question. Obviously, franchises like Hemophilia and Renal,
particularly in view of the recent Gambro acquisition, we do continue to focus on the five-year outlook on kind of an
ongoing basis. And just to reiterate Ludwig's point on the Hemophilia franchise, one year on from our investor
conference last year, our long-term outlook for our Hemophilia franchise, broadly defined, is very comparable to what
we shared with you last year, both in terms of size and rate of growth, as Ludwig commented.
I mean obviously, there's downward pressure as a result of competition, which we anticipated in our roll-up last year,
which we shared with you. There'll continue to be pricing pressure on very expensive therapies, but on the other hand,
this still is a largely underdeveloped market globally. We have an emerging pipeline that we're very excited about. The
public/private partnership with Hemobrás in Brazil, we're hopeful it's not the last one of that nature that we do. So we
think the positives are greater than the negatives, which is why we continue to be positive and optimistic about the
long-term growth of this franchise.
As it relates to the Renal franchise, likewise there, I mean this is something we'll discuss with you quarterly in terms
Gambro, now that we've closed the deal and we're integrating it both in terms of revenue growth as well as synergies.
But the base Renal business outside of Gambro, specifically PD, has exhibited the most robust growth this year that it
has in years. So our long-term outlook for the Renal business, both the base business and Gambro and, of course, last

year when we had the investor conference, we had not closed the Gambro deal, but the base case Renal outlook for the
next five years also continues to be very positive.
So – now as it relates to the rest of the businesses without getting into too much detail, I think there are some things
that have changed both negatively and positively from a year ago, I think. Admittedly, austerity measures around the
world that affect pricing are more pronounced across all of our businesses than we would have anticipated a year ago.
I mean this year, we've continued to experience negative impact of FX headwinds, particularly in emerging/developing
markets. I don't have a crystal ball. I don't know how that's going to change over the next five years but that's been a
significant headwind this year. And I also think generally, there's been lower growth in acute care hospital settings,
certainly in developed markets and we've all seen the impact of that here at home in the U.S. So those are some of what
I'll call the downward drivers, if you will, from our outlook of our long-term business a year ago.
On the other hand, we know pension expense, which has been a drag, is starting to work in our favor. How much and
for how long, I think, also like exchange rates, is difficult to speculate on, but that should be a positive versus our
outlook last year.
Also, I think in terms of business development, there continue to be many additional opportunities, just activities during
the last year that were consummated subsequent to our investor conference. Obviously, most notably Gambro but in
licensing deals like Rigosertib, which we're excited about; the recent collaboration with etanercept to continue to build
on our biosimilar portfolio. These were all things that weren't contemplated in the last year's LRP. And we fully
anticipate that the momentum we've built in business development is going to continue. So that represents a significant
upside from the base case LRP that we shared with you last year. Another driver that's a positive, I think, is the
opportunity to favorably impact our tax rate going forward as a result of how we structured the Gambro acquisition.
So that's just a few highlights, both downward pressure and upward pressure. But in terms of two core and critical
franchises, Hemophilia and our Renal franchise, not any fundamental change as we look out over the next number of
years from what we messaged to you last year. I'll stop there. It's easy to get into a lot of detail but hopefully, that
provides just a little bit of color, David.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Right, thanks.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Yeah, thanks, David. Now I just wanted to move on to the next question.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah, okay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Just a few quick questions here. Ludwig, just first on HyQvia filing. It was in
the script but it wasn't specific. Can you just give us an update on where we stand on HyQvia filing into the end of the
year here, and have you received any additional questions from the agency post BioPharma's decision to end their
hyaluronidase program?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: So we're still on schedule to submit our file before the end of the year, David. We've not
gotten any additional questions from the FDA. We expect that the regulatory path forward is well defined and we
expect a potential six-month review. So that means that we are getting ready for a potential launch of HyQ in the U.S.
second half of next year.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Very helpful. Maybe two BioSciences questions. Maybe, Ludwig, one for you and then
one for Bob Hombach. First off, on IVIg supply, I think there's this view that your supply is increasing but we're really
not seeing it translate into the numbers here in 2013. So maybe talk just a little bit about where we stand on safety stock

and sort of what could we think about in terms of the supply and growth prospective in IVIg over the next several
quarters.
And then maybe for Bob Hombach on albumin, just a clarification there. It's been a very strong market. Is the delay on
the contracting or it sounds like, is that simply a tender that you have very good visibility on, or is it this in any way
related to some of the pharma disruption that we've seen broadly across the universe here in the third quarter? Thank
you.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: So I'll start with IG piece, and as I mentioned before during earnings call, 2013 is a
transition year for BioT [BioTherapeutics] franchise, and we are now in a position to support 6% to 8% demand growth
for our IG business, and this is a result of recent capacity upgrades and expansions which we will complete in the
second quarter.
As you have seen in the numbers, we do see strong demand growth in volume in the U.S. So we do see an uptick there,
and we will continue to build that in the U.S. So that's how we're looking at this. Our international sales are lower than
last year as a result of our strategy to exit select markets outside of the U.S., given our prior supply constraint. So this is
something that we will have to work on in the next quarters to get the international market back up to the levels similar
to the U.S.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: But fair to say, increasingly, we're more comfortable with our inventory levels. As you
know, we experienced back orders periodically throughout the course of 2013. And as we look forward to the prospect,
as Ludwig alluded to, of a second half 2014 U.S. HyQ launch, again, we're going to be thoughtful about what markets
we look to re-enter as we move forward here and continue with the controlled launch in Europe for HyQ as well, as we
have reimbursement in one country and are looking to nail down reimbursement in several other countries before the
end of this year.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Sorry, about albumin?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yes, as it relates to albumin, David – so as you may be aware, all biologic products
exported to China have to have the license renewed every five years, and it just so happens that two of Baxter's
products in the albumin space have renewals coming due here in the fourth quarter. Given the significant growth in
demand in China and some other things going on, the regulatory requirements and approval processes have evolved,
and those have resulted in the potential for delays in renewal of our licenses. And so we're continuing to work with the
Chinese authorities, and we do expect to get the licenses approved or, I should say, renewed by the end of this year.
However, highly likely, that's going to impact the timing of some shipments, and so we reflected that timing delay in
our guidance here for the fourth quarter.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Great. Thank you, very helpful.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lawrence Keusch from Raymond James. Your question, please.
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: Yeah. Good morning. Bob Parkinson, could you talk to us a little bit now that you've
closed the Gambro acquisition, what some of the milestones we should be looking for in terms of integration? And then
also remind us, since the deal did close a bit later than anticipated, how you're thinking about the dilution for 2014,
which I think you had – you've obviously previously guided to.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: All right. Larry, Bob Parkinson. Let me make some comments and then in terms of
dilution and some of the financial specifics, I'll turn it over to Bob Hombach. So in terms of milestones that we ought to
be looking for, I mean obviously there's – I think there's two critical ones, which is as we complete the integration and
we move forward, obviously, the pace of growth. One of the questions when we did the acquisition, of course, was the
relative flattish nature of the business the last couple years while it was in private equity ownership compared to our –
the prospects that we saw in terms of being able to grow not only the core business but the acute business and so on. So

rate of growth is an obvious milestone that all of us should be looking at.
And the second one, of course, is the synergies. A big piece of the financial justification for this was contingent upon
meaningful synergies, about $300 million of synergies. And so those are the two milestones. I think it's – given the fact
that we just completed the integration, we're in the early stages, it's premature to take a specific position on either of
those this morning. But those are the two things that I'm going to be monitoring, Larry, internally, so I think you all
should be too, as well. So Bob, you want to handle the – ?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, as it relates to dilution. No change in our outlook, but let me just kind of reframe
how we've positioned this and then talk a little bit about some of the variables that may be additive or further dilution
here related to our outlook. So we previously said for 2014 that, including amortization expense, that we would be
neutral to modestly accretive in 2014. And assuming about $0.20 of amortization, if we were to back out the
amortization, it would be $0.20 to $0.25 accretive. And so as we look forward here and as we approach guidance in
January, some of the variables we're going to be looking at that could, again, impact that outlook, one is we closed the
transaction a little later than we expected. We had hoped originally in the middle of the year to close the transaction,
and then it ended up being a bit later due to the regulatory process.
So the timing of synergy achievement in the very near term will be a little bit challenged. I don't think anything
significant, but will be a little bit challenged. On the plus side, I think whether it's the financing costs coming in a bit
lower than we expected and some of the opportunities that we may have on the tax front that we've talked about, those
are opportunities, I think, to potentially offset any leakage we might have from a timing perspective and maybe do a
little bit better. But there are a number of variables, particularly on the tax front, that we still need to work through now
that we actually own the company, and look at some of the tax attributes around loss carryforwards and deductibility of
interest in certain markets and so on. But we do think there's opportunity there but not ready to quantify that at the
moment.
And so – but I guess the last thing I would mention, because this has come up a number of times, as we think about
intangible amortization related both to our existing business as well as now the significant increase we're likely to see
with Gambro, as we've mentioned, this is something we've been thinking about, and I think the appropriate time to
implement that would be in January, when we provide guidance for 2014. But given the significant impact that that's
going to have, and just to reframe that for everyone today within our core business, we incur about $100 million a year
in intangible amortization related to prior business development activities, which equates to about $0.15 a share.
As I just mentioned, we assume that the Gambro could be approximately $0.20 of incremental intangible amortization.
And so at $0.30 to $0.35 of impact on an annual basis that actually has about 150 basis point impact on our gross
margin as a noncash item. And so I would characterize it as very likely that we will move towards excluding intangible
amortization from our adjusted earnings projections, but we'll – given the timeframe that it's going to take us several
months here to get to a reasonably final number about what the Gambro intangible amortization's actually going to be
because that is done through an independent third party valuation that's ongoing as we speak, will mean a better
position in January, I think, to fully quantify it for everyone and make the final call here about making the change on
reporting going forward.
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: Okay, great. That's really helpful. And then just the other question is, Bob, in the context
of, again, concerns around the competition from Biogen in the factor VIII market, I was just hoping could you give us a
bit of an update on Brazil. Again, you made some mention of it in the prepared remarks. But can you quantify sort of
how much you're beginning to ship there? And are there efforts that you can take to perhaps accelerate that $200
million in peak sales in 2017, and I guess are there opportunities for, now that this relationship has been established,
other products that could also go into the Brazilian market?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Well, maybe all of us could comment on pieces of that. Larry, this is Bob Parkinson.
So first of all, we're very pleased with how the collaboration with Hemobrás in Brazil is evolving. As you might guess,
any time you have arrangements like this with governments, they can be a little untidy, and they all take their own
shape and form, but we've navigated through a lot of that and continue to be very – so the long-term outlook of $200
million continues to be a very realistic opportunity. To say it's going to be greater than that, I'm not prepared to do that

at this point, and we'll evolve to that over time. But just today, I think about 10% of all the patients being treated in
Brazil have moved from plasma-derived factor VIII to a recombinant product. So I think that's an interesting metric or
– indicating the pace, and we anticipate that that's going to continue to move very quickly.
I do think that – and one of the reasons I called this out at the investor conference last year is one of our four growth
vectors, public/private partnerships, and we continue to be very enthusiastic about this. There's no doubt that as a result
of this collaboration with Hemobrás in Brazil, we've developed a broader and I think – relationship built on trust and so
on with the Health Ministry in the broader government in Brazil, which we believe can lead to other opportunities over
time. And certainly, even with Hemobrás on the hemophilia collaboration, that's just on one product. That's really on
recombinant factor VIII. So as we continue to grow our Hemophilia pipeline, we certainly would anticipate that we
would build on that platform.
The last thing I would say is that we continue to have discussions with other governments around the world that can
represent meaningful opportunities in this kind of fashion, which is why we called it out as a specific platform or vector
of our growth outlook.
So I don't know, I covered a lot there. Ludwig, please. Go ahead, yeah.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yeah, so I just want to add something on the market itself to put things into perspective.
So there are about 9,000 hemophilia A patients in Brazil. The diagnosis rate is 70%. There's no prophy use, so one of
the objectives for us is to move from plasma to recombinant, but in addition to that, to move patients from on-demand
to prophy. And when you look at the IU per capita, it's about 2 IU, which is about half of Russia, and UK is around 8
IU. So I don't want to commit to a number higher than the $200 million that was quoted, but clearly, if we do our
market development right and we work with the treating physicians, there's a lot of work that needs to be done.
And as we do with all of our Hemophilia products, we're going to strive for a bleed-free world and Brazil is a long way
from a bleed-free world.
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: And lastly, your $200 million is predicated on IU per capita of what?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: We haven't specifically addressed that, Larry. But again, I would say that we have modest
assumptions around prophylaxis, which by the way, is not only our objective but a stated objective of the Minister of
Health of Brazil to expand prophylaxis. But we haven't quoted a specific IU per capita, but it is relatively low and there
is tremendous opportunity to enhance that and improve outcomes for patients.
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: Okay. Great thanks, guys.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Next question, Jonathan.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your question please.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Hi, thanks. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yes.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: We can, Bob, pretty good.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Okay. So I wanted to come back to the confidence that you guys are expressing in the
long-range plan relative to Hemophilia. And I wanted to ask the question, is part of your confidence in that long-range
plan a view that you really won't lose as much share as the recent surveys are suggesting? You guys gave some pretty
specific guidance, originally, in terms of anticipated share loss, and I just want to make sure that I understand what
you're saying here. And so specifically, are you more confident than the Street seems to be relative to share loss?

<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Well, let me make some high level comments, and then, Ludwig, maybe you can
pick up specifically on the share loss thing. As I said before, we fully contemplated competitive launches when we
stood up before you last fall. So no surprises. And despite recent surveys that have been done and so on, there's actually
no new facts in the marketplace that have emerged in the last six months to nine months, either about competitive
products, our own or otherwise. What there have been is perspectives that have been shared and so on. So I'm not going
to get into dueling surveys and things like that. But we fully contemplate that we will lose market share to competitive
entries as we shared with you last year.
But the longer term view of this critical franchise for our company is driven by some of these higher level dynamics
that I mentioned before in terms of the underdeveloped global market. Ludwig just took you all through the tremendous
opportunity that exists in Brazil, and Brazil's not unique. Not to mention our own emerging pipeline with our own
longer-acting product, the RIXUBIS that just got approved and is being launched, the development of a recombinant
von Willebrand, our factor VII and so on. So that's the basis of our position relative to the long-term outlook of this
critical franchise.
Now, the short-term impact of launches, surveys, our view and so on, like I say, no new facts, A. B, nobody knows.
And that doesn't mean that we haven't been busy over the last 12 months and we're going to continue to be very busy
over the next approximately six months before the competitive launch, and so we'll see what happens. But obviously,
we're very familiar with this franchise. We're very close to the treaters, the patients. And to do a survey, you ask one
question that almost assumes that you have a homogeneous market. This is a complex market with composition of
different patient types. And so to answer a question in a survey and then conclude that it applies broadly, I think, can be
a little bit misleading, but I'll stop there.
Ludwig, if you want to add -
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Sure. With respect to your first question on the confidence in the LRP, we believe that the
3% to 4% sales CAGR that I mentioned and we mentioned last year is driven by four categories. First of all, we
potentially have four new product launches in the next two years. So RIXUBIS is number one, OBI-1 hopefully by the
end of next year. And then we have BAX 855 and a recombinant von Willebrand. In addition to that, we have life cycle
management opportunity on the existing products. So we have five at prophy, hopefully, by the end of this year, as well
as BAXJECT III device for ADVATE sometime next year.
As Bob was saying the geographical expansion with Brazil as a great example, but in addition to that, we've launched
ADVATE in China and the first patients are being treated with ADVATE. And we plan to launch in Russia next year,
and we continue to see a healthy market growth of mid-single digits. So that's the reason why we do believe that we're
confident in the numbers that we gave you for the LRP.
With respect to the market share loss, our market research suggests that the penetration of an extended half-life product
will somewhat be slowed down by limited clinical experience, restricted label, restricted geography, brand loyalty,
frequency of physician visits. And when you think about the competitive pressure that we will have from the extended
half-life products, it will be primarily in the U.S. adult prophy market segment, which is about 20% of our global
recombinant factor VIII business. And in that specific segment, we know that about 50% of the patients on ADVATE
prophy are on a dose regimen of every three days or longer already.
So we do feel comfortable with the guidance that we gave you on the LRP for hemophilia, and we're looking forward
to a lot of opportunities with our launches.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: So thank you for that. But just to push a little bit on that. I think you guys specifically said
originally, as it relates to ADVATE competition, that you would lose about $100 million a year each year over the
course of the long-range plan. You didn't quite say it that specifically. You said you'd lose a point of growth to both
generic competition and ADVATE competition, but then you said two-thirds of that would be ADVATE. And pretty
simple math suggests that's about $100 million a year.
So I just want to make sure that I've got my math right and that that's what you're confident in from a share perspective,
understanding that you've got other offsets in terms of new products and market expansion. But specifically around the

issue of what market share loss you're assuming in the LRP, I just want to confirm that you're still comfortable
suggesting that it's roughly at that $100 million a year per year over the five-year range or the long-range plan.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, so, Bob, we gave a five-year outlook and said it would have a – competitive interest
and have a, cumulatively, 100 basis point impact on our CAGR, which if you do the math, gets out to about $700
million of run rate impact by 2017. I wouldn't conclude – and we did say about two-thirds of that related to factor VIII
competition, but I wouldn't assume that that's ratable over that timeframe, because the launches happen in different
markets at different times, as Ludwig alluded to, the competition will start first in the U.S.
Now, we just got news yesterday that one of the competitors we thought was going to be in the U.S. next year isn't
going to be in the U.S. next year. And so there's a number of variables here that are going to affect the timing of that.
And so I think in aggregate, you're in the ballpark, but the ratability is going to be a factor of a whole lot of things
including, again, when geographic approvals are achieved by competitors in different markets around the world.
Because, as you know, a little bit less than half our sales overall are in the U.S., which means quite a bit of it is outside
the U.S.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Right. Okay. I just want to make sure you weren't changing the guidance as it relates to share
in the LRP.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: No.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: No.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: No, there's no change.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Okay, thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your question, please.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thanks for taking the questions. Just one quick follow-up to that. So Ludwig, why is it
you think that a longer-acting product would just be used in the prophy population? There seems to be a lot of interest
from the hematologists in using it on demand on a belief that patients that come in on a bleed may not have to come
back for days two or three.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Okay. So as Bob started the discussion on patient types in U.S., about patient types, maybe
I'd like to go a little bit deeper with respect to patient types. It's not going to be a one size fits all. So every patient is
going to be different, and at the end of the day, the decision will be taken by the physician or the patient on an
individual basis. So patient segmentation is essential. So let me give you some examples of patient types that might be
reluctant to switch.
So first of all, patients with a zero bleed rate. Those patients, they control their disease very well and will ask that
question, should I really switch? I think that would be a natural question. The second type would be there's about
one-third of the patients that developed an inhibitor early in their life, and those patients were able to overcome the
complexity of an inhibitor through ITI treatment. I'm sure that those patients will ask themselves the question of, in
view of what happened, am I going to switch?

ADVATE prophy patients, and we estimate that 50% of the ADVATE prophy patients are on an every three day or
longer dose regimen, as I mentioned before. And then you have active patients and those active patients – and this is
not only for hemophilia A but also for hemophilia B, applies for RIXUBIS as well. Those patients, they live on the
peak. So every time they have an activity, and this could be a daily activity, they infuse themselves right before the
activity. You can ask yourself the question, would those patients go for a short-acting versus an extended half-life
product? I think the other segment is pediatric patients.
So it comes back to the discussion that Bob started, that at the end of the day, it's not going to be a one size fits all, and
we can segment as much as we want. But every patient will have its own life story, they will have a reason, are you to
switch? And some of those patients will be switched and we know that, and as we said, we will lose some market share,
but a lot of those patients will ask the question, should I really switch?

side with the Fluid Systems sales, I know you gave a little bit of context in the prepared remarks, but I was wondering
if you could just dive in a little bit deeper, just to help gauge kind of how to think about that business going forward.
And then any update you might have on the infusion pump side with respect to the warning letter.

end of this year and hope to be back in the market in 2014 with our Spectrum pump. Again, this is a 510(k) update, and
so, again, hope to expect to be back in the market, but no change in timeframe there.
As it relates to the rest of Fluid Systems, clearly, the key driver here from a growth perspective was the
cyclophosphamide. And from a sequential standpoint, second quarter to the third quarter, some timing and price driving
that. Other than that, we continue to see strong demand for IVs, particularly in the U.S., given some of the other issues
that are prevailing in the marketplace, but nothing else, I think, notable within the Fluid Systems segment here going
forward.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And how do you guys reconcile just the strong demand for IV in the U.S. relative to more
the macro comments on pressure with kind of acute hospital stays and admission trends?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Well, again, I think the competitive environment, there's some issues. One of our
competitors has provided us some opportunity there. So I don't think it's a market comment, it's more of a share
comment.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And then just turning back to the antibody therapies business. What gives you the
confidence in modeling out 6% to 8% unit growth for plasma? Do you have any concerns just from a reimbursement
standpoint since some of the use is more off label, albeit evidence-based? And historically, I remember, you guys had
thrown out some estimates that you felt that the end market growth rate from a unit perspective was more about 5%. So
I guess how do you get comfortable that it really is 6% to 8%, especially given all the capacity additions that you do
have coming online?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: So a couple things, and then Ludwig, if you want to jump in as well. Our long-term
view has not changed, and the 6% to 8% primarily relates to immune globulins from a unit perspective. And really, that
going back 15 years is a pretty consistent trend we've seen. And, in fact, the last several years, it's accelerated for some
of the reasons we've previously talked about, including more utilization in the neurological space where twice as much
product is used on a per patient basis, as well as the growth in subcu treatments which again use more product, at least
the existing ones, on a per patient basis. Of course, that's one of the benefits we think HyQ will bring to the
marketplace. But in any case, demand has been robust, particularly in the U.S. And outside the U.S., we continue to see

underpenetrated and underdeveloped markets that have great opportunities over the long term.
So as we continue to expand indications and find additional uses for the product and have the geographic expansion
opportunities in front of us, that's really the main source of the 6% to 8%, but Ludwig, if you want to add anything
there specific. But, again, and I think for us, we're confident we're going to be able to support, as Ludwig alluded to, the
6% to 8% unit volume here in the coming years, given the expansions we've already done and with the prospect of a
HyQvia launch in the U.S. in the back half of next year, again, just further adds to our confidence in the ongoing
demand for this product.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And then lastly, just on BAX 855, just in terms of timelines, has anything changed or do
you still feel confident in the ability to have that product approved in the U.S. in 2015?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Go ahead, Ludwig.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: So yes, let me take a step back so that everybody's clear. So 855 is an extended half-life
ADVATE. So it's a molecule that's proven and it's the gold standard in hemophilia A. So with respect to your question,
our recruitment is on schedule, and we still plan to file before the end of 2014. So far, no inhibitors have been reported.
So we're still gearing up for a 2015 potential launch.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And you said file before the end of 2014?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Correct.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Thanks, Kristen.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Jonathan, We have time for one more question.
Operator
Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein. Your question, please.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Hi. Thanks so much for fitting me in. Appreciate that. Just a follow-up, first off, on Ludwig's –
your comment on hemophilia and the potential pushbacks to switching to long-acting. Just on your comment about
50% of the – of your ADVATE prophy patients already being on sort of a three-day or longer regimen. As a layperson
just thinking about that, wouldn't those also be the patients who would then have the best potential to get to a once per
week regimen with the long-acting? So am I thinking about that wrong, or why – it would almost seem, perhaps,
opposite of maybe what you're saying that these patients might be the ones who might actually more like to switch to
long-acting?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yeah, so the numbers that you quote are correct. So that's what I mentioned, so 50% of the
ADVATE prophy patients are three days or longer. And we have seen this both in the U.S. as well as in Europe. It
comes down to what I said before, it's going to be on an individual basis. So if those patients are well controlled and
those patients have zero bleeds, then people are going to go ask themselves the question, am I going to switch to
something that potentially – since there's no registration yet – could have a longer dosing regimen? So I think it's going
to happen on an individual basis.
And then maybe come back to the question that was asked on, what about the on-demand patients. You'll see that a lot
of the on-demand patients for hemophilia B, for instance, 90% of those on-demand patients are mild to moderate. And
you ask yourself the question, are those patients going to be the ones that are going to think about a longer-acting
product for hemophilia A? This is about half of the patients.
So it's a – again, it's going to happen on a patient-by-patient basis, but I think as ADVATE is proven, since we have 10
years clinical experience, it has shown strong prophy data, and, as we said, we strive for a bleed-free world. We believe
that zero bleeds is the way to go, and that should be the focus of treatment.

<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay. Thank you. And on BAX 855, I mean, I think that's really key to the sustainability of your
recombinant factor VIII franchise moving forward. Have you had discussions already with the FDA around whether
they might have any additional requirements for approval, given that this is a chronic – this is a product with a
PEGylation formulation that'll be taken chronically in patients? What's your confidence or what sort of discussions
have you had with the FDA around whether or not that might require some additional regulatory requirements on their
part, or how comfortable is the FDA with the PEGylation formulation?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yes, we do have dialogues with the FDA on 855, as you can imagine. With respect to
PEGylation technology, this is nothing new. This is more than three decades old, so more than 10 products with a
similar technology have been approved. And when you look at the PEG concentration in 855, it is significantly lower
than some approved products that are indicated for chronic therapy. So we feel comfortable that the work that we're
doing should satisfy the regulatory bodies. Of course, as part of our market development, we will ensure that the
hemophilia community is familiar with the PEGylation technology and that's clearly a work in progress for us.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Great. Thanks. And if I could just slip one quick one in. Could you give us an update on how
you're see the HyQvia launch go in Germany, what you're seeing on pricing there and kind of just give us early
indications on the controlled launch there. Thank you.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: It's a little early. We just launched in Germany and a couple of the Northern markets.
So it's a little early, I think – it's actually too early to comment on that. I think that's – we'll update you the next time we
get together on the call, we'll have a better frame of reference on that, Derrick, frankly.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, I'd say your characterization is right that we're being very thoughtful about how we
launch this. It is a change in treatment regimen and making sure patients and treaters are well educated and it gets off to
a very good start. We started in Germany and we expect reimbursement in several other countries here in the coming
months.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Thank you.
