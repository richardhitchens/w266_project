Irene B. Rosenfeld
Thanks, Dexter, and good morning. Our second quarter reflected the continued challenges of a difficult macro
environment that again tempered category and revenue growth. In fact, the operating environment worsened in the
quarter in a number of markets, especially in Europe. But we continued to expand operating income margins and again
delivered strong high quality EPS growth in the face of these challenges.
Adjusted OI margin was 12.6%. That's an increase of 120 basis points, driven by gains in North America and Europe.
These operating gains drove a 19% increase in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. On the top-line; however, we
delivered modest organic revenue growth of 1.2%. While that's below our expectations and below the overall growth of
our categories, it reflects our decision to lead pricing to recover cost increases.
Our pricing actions were the most significant influence on our revenue growth rate this quarter. As we've said in the
past, our strategy is to increase prices to fully recover the impacts of input costs and currency over time. Of course,
that's the right thing to do for the long-term health of the business. And it's critical to driving sustainable profitable
growth. Specifically, it enables productivity savings to drive gross and operating margins as well as investments in
innovation and brand equity. This year, we're experiencing significant inflation in many of our inputs, notably, cocoa
and dairy. This has been magnified by weakening currencies in many emerging markets. In fact, nearly half of our
input cost increase has been due to currency.
This required us to take significant price increases, especially in chocolate. Given our share positions in most markets,
we chose to lead those pricing actions. And while we anticipated that this would be disruptive in the short-term, it's
been even more challenging than we expected. In a number of key countries and categories, our competitors have been
slow to implement price increases. As a result, we're seeing some negative effects on consumer takeaway as well as on
our share performance. Of course, our competitors face the same currency-related input cost pressures as we do. So
while this dynamic has tempered our revenue growth in the short-term, especially in emerging markets, we believe this
impact will be temporary. With that as the backdrop, growth in our emerging markets, although below our
expectations, was up a relatively solid 4.7%.
In developed markets, it's a more complex story. Some customers, especially in Europe, most notably in France, have
reacted quite severely to our price increases. In fact, a number have refused to accept our pricing, which has led to
extended disputes and near-term distribution losses. Given our leadership on pricing, we are taking the brunt of these
punitive actions. But to be clear, this is affecting the broader industry, not just us. This issue, together with slower
category growth in Europe, drove a 1.2% organic revenue decline in our developed markets.
Let's look more closely at our Q2 revenue by region. As expected, pricing had a positive contribution in four of our five
regions. In Europe, revenue was down 1.9%. Vol/mix declined, primarily due to the pricing-related disruptions and
slower category growth that I just talked about. The region's overall pricing was down modestly, as lower coffee prices
offset higher pricing in chocolate and cheese. While lower coffee revenues tempered the region's growth by 0.4
percentage points, we expect coffee will become a tailwind in the second half, reflecting the price increases that we
began implementing early in Q3.
North America increased 2.7%, with balanced contributions from vol/mix and pricing. Biscuits had another strong
quarter, in part, driven by innovations like Oreo Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and belVita Soft Baked. Candy also posted
solid growth. EEMEA grew more than 6%, also with balanced contributions from vol/mix and pricing. Russia grew
mid-single digits, including solid gains in biscuits, candy, and coffee as we continued to invest in our hot zone support.
Ukraine revenue was up slightly in the quarter, which was a tremendous accomplishment given the current political and
economic situation.
In Latin America, revenue grew nearly 12%. Pricing in the inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina drove
much of the increase, although it also pressured vol/mix. At the same time, Brazil delivered high single digit growth,

including positive vol/mix, despite aggressive pricing and increased competitive pressures. Growth was solid across all
categories.
And finally, in Asia Pacific, revenue was down about 8%, due to continued weakness in China biscuits and a more
intense pricing-related retail and competitive environment in Australia and New Zealand. India, however, delivered
another quarter of double digit growth.
As we look at our results by category, the same themes are evident. Global category growth for the first half was 3.8%,
above our organic growth of 2%. In biscuits, the entire 200 basis point gap between category growth and our revenue
growth was attributable to China. We expected a double digit decline in China biscuits as we cycled last year's stepped
up investments to reinvigorate category growth, including the launch of Golden Oreo.
In chocolate, our decision to lead pricing has resulted in the temporary disruptions and customer disputes in Europe that
I described earlier. Additionally, in some key markets like Brazil and South Africa, our competitors have been slow to
increase prices. We believe they will eventually price, given the sharp rise in cocoa, including a nearly 20% increase
year-to-date and the weakening of emerging market currencies.
But there's also some positive news in our category results. In gum, we continued to see steady improvement, both in
the overall category, which was up about 1%, and in our revenue, which declined only low single digits after several
quarters of steeper declines. I'm especially encouraged by our performance in the U.S., where our focus on product
assortment and shelf resets, our messaging on oral care, and advantaged innovations, like Sour Patch Kids gum, have
led to three consecutive quarters of share growth.
We've also continued to deliver strong gum performance in China. In just two years, we've captured a 9% share against
a strong competitor. And we're on track to deliver $150 million in revenue this year.
Let's now take a look at market share. Overall, year-to-date share performance remained solid, with 57% of our
revenues gaining or holding share. However, as expected, share softened a bit during the quarter, as we priced ahead of
competitors. This dislocation was most apparent in our emerging market shares, as consumers adjust to the
inflation-driven price increases. EEMEA, Latin America, and Asia Pacific all saw market share performance below
40% on a year-to-date basis.
Looking forward, we expect that shares will continue to soften in the near-term, especially in Q3, until competitors
implement pricing and we resolve the outstanding customer disputes. So as you can see, our revenue growth and share
performance were softer than we expected. But we believe much of the pricing disruption on revenue and share is
temporary and will revert in the coming months.
That said, we knew the environment would be challenging. And so over the past year, we've been rigorously driving
productivity, reducing overheads, and executing our supply chain reinvention initiatives. All of these actions have
helped to protect our bottom-line in 2014 and set the stage for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
David Brearton
Thanks, Irene, and good morning. Over the next few slides, I'll walk you through our bottom-line results and our
updated outlook before turning it back to Irene for a quick update on some of our strategic and operating initiatives.
Adjusted gross profit dollars were down 1.6% for the quarter, entirely due to mark-to-market adjustments, but up 0.4%
from the first half of a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross profit margin was down 90 basis points this quarter,
again, entirely due to mark-to-market adjustments on hedging contracts. In aggregate, we fully priced to recover
commodity and ForEx impacts this quarter, in line with our strategy, although the impact differs by region.
Gross margins in North America and Europe were up sharply, with aggressive productivity savings driving significant
step-ups versus prior year. However, in AP and EEMEA, we weren't able to fully offset higher input costs due to the

impact of currency. The full benefit of our pricing actions will be realized over the course of Q3 and Q4 and will set us
up well for 2015.
Productivity was again strong in the first half, with gross productivity over 4% of cost of goods sold. Net productivity,
which is our primary measure, was about 2.5% of COGS, exceeding our expectations. Adjusted operating income
dollars grew nearly 12% for the quarter, and nearly 14% in the first half on a constant currency basis. Adjusted OI
margin expanded 120 basis points in the quarter, despite the 90 basis point impact from mark-to-market charges that I
previously mentioned.
Margin expansion was high quality. We significantly reduced overheads as a result of our ongoing cost management
efforts. In addition, we continued to drive efficiencies in advertising of consumer support by consolidating media
providers, reducing non-working media costs and shifting spending to lower cost digital media outlets. For the first
half, A&C represented about 9% of net revenues in line with our full year expectations. So to be clear, we're not
reducing support of our brands or innovation platforms. We're maintaining our share of voice at least at historical
levels, especially in the face of our significant pricing.
Taking a closer look at margins, we see that every region posted margin improvement for the first half. The biggest
margin expansion was in our developed markets, which, as you know, is our near-term focus. In North America, OI
margin was up 310 basis points and Europe increased 200 points. Supply chain and SG&A cost reductions
implemented earlier this year drove the improvements.
Turning to EPS, adjusted EPS was $0.40, up 19% on a constant currency basis for the second quarter and was $0.79, up
15% on a constant currency basis for the half. Our first half growth was driven entirely by operating gains, despite
absorbing a negative $0.04 impact from mark-to-market charges. Below-the-line, unfavorability in taxes was offset by
lower interest expense and share repurchases.
Let me now quickly update you on where we stand on capital allocation and cash flow. We continue to deploy capital
to where we expect to deliver the best returns, whether it's reinvestment in the business, M&A, reducing debt, or
returning capital to shareholders. With regard to free cash flow, we remain on track to deliver our two year target of
$3.7 billion. In fact, at the end of Q2, we improved our cash conversion cycle by 21 days, driven by DSO and DPO,
continuing the progress of the last two years.
In the first half, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders, $900 million of which was through share repurchases. For
the full year, we still expect to return $2 billion to $3 billion to our shareholders, including $1 billion to $2 billion in
share buybacks. Finally, we've paid almost $500 million in dividends year-to-date and today, announced a 7% increase
in our quarterly dividend to $0.15 per common share.
Turning to our outlook, we expect our revenue growth rate in the back half to improve modestly as we pass-through
higher coffee prices and cycle favorable prior-year comparisons, especially in China. However, we now anticipate
revenue growth of 2% to 2.5% for the full year. That's down from our previous outlook of approximately 3%, reflecting
continued slower category growth and near-term dislocations as customers, competitors, and consumers adopt and
adjust to higher prices. As we said earlier, we believe the factors pressuring our revenue growth are temporary.
Category growth rates should improve over time, along with macroeconomic conditions, and demographic and
snacking trends remain in our favor.
Pricing-related disputes with our customers are a cost of doing business. And all of our competitors face the same
challenges from currency-related input cost increases. As Irene mentioned, we'll continue pricing to recover cost
impacts, allowing our productivity efforts to fuel the investments in innovation and brand equity that drive sustainable
profitable growth.
Turning to 2014 margin and EPS, we continued to expect adjusted OI margin for 2014 in the high 12% range and EPS
guidance of $1.73 to $1.78 at constant currency. The pricing actions we're taking, along with the supply chain and
overhead reduction initiatives we're driving, enable us to maintain our 2014 earnings targets despite a softer top-line.
With that, let me turn it back to Irene to discuss the strategic and cost reduction initiatives we announced in May.

Irene B. Rosenfeld
Thanks, Dave. The headline is we're on track. First, we continue to make good progress on taking the steps necessary to
successfully close our coffee transaction in 2015. As you know, we intend to combine our coffee business with D.E
Master Blenders to create the world's leading pure play coffee company. Both companies have been working closely to
prepare for the combination, including identifying the key leaders and having discussions with Works Councils.
Second, we remain firmly committed to delivering best-in-class costs in both our supply chain and in overheads. Our
supply chain reinvention is on track to deliver $3 billion of gross productivity savings and $1.5 billion of net savings by
2016. We've already begun to see the impact of these efforts in the margin improvement in both Europe and North
America. Our new biscuit facility in Salinas, Mexico is scheduled to open as planned in the fourth quarter. And we're
on track to open new facilities next year in the Czech Republic and in India.
As Dave mentioned, we're exceeding our productivity objectives, with gross productivity over 4% of cost of goods sold
and net productivity at about 2.5% in the first half. With respect to overheads, we're also advancing our zero-based
budgeting initiatives. We've identified key areas of improvement in overhead costs, assigned accountability for
achieving those cost reductions, and have already announced several policy changes to begin capturing some non-head
count-related savings. We'll announce additional changes in the coming months to further drive savings.
Finally, we're simplifying and standardizing our ways of working across the company. Last week, we named Mark
Clouse to a newly created position of Chief Growth Officer to ensure that growth remains at the forefront of our
strategy and that we bring the same focus and discipline to driving sustainable profitable growth as we're doing to
improving our cost structure. In this role, Mark will be accountable for all of the key drivers of growth by overseeing
the teams responsible for corporate strategy, global categories, marketing, sales and R&D. This integrated approach
will enable us to more efficiently allocate resources to accelerate expansion of global innovation platforms, Power
Brands, and breakthrough technologies.
Also last week, we announced that we're adopting a category-led model in all of our regions, beginning January 1,
2015. This region-based, category-led approach is not new to us. Europe has been operating under this model for years.
And North America adopted it at the beginning of 2014. So we'll leverage the learning from these two regions as we
implement this model in our other three.
The new operating model will: accelerate growth of our Power Brands and innovation platforms; provide greater clarity
of roles to drive growth, cost, and operating excellence; deliver standardized processes to reduce costs and improve
capabilities; and finally, ensure that we're making the right investments in long-term technologies. All of these actions
underscore our determination to become a leaner, more focused and more nimble global snacking powerhouse that
delivers top-tier performance over the long-term.
With that, let us open up for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. I had just two questions if I could for you, Irene. The first just in relation to the
softer category growth rates, I just want to get a better sense of how much you credit that to the pricing that's going
through in this category? Are consumers shifting to other categories as best you can tell? And I guess related to that,
have you seen any stabilization of that market share performance through the quarter? It sounds like it remained pretty

soft through the quarter.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I would say actually I think our categories are holding up better than many. So in the world
of food, one of the reasons we continue to like participating in snacks is that it tends to have a better trajectory in most
markets around the world. So, yes, our categories have softened, but I think they're still out-performing many other
food categories.
With respect to our shares, it's a little bit of a mixed bag as you look at different countries around the world. Again, the
biggest issue is whether, in fact, our price gaps have widened more than we'd like them to be. And as we start to see
those gaps close in various markets around the world, we see our share recovering. So I think that's what gives us great
confidence that what we're seeing right now is a temporary dislocation. We do think as the pricing gets out there and
depending upon reactions out in the marketplace, it will take us about another quarter or so to play that through. But we
would expect that our shares will revert.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And just one quick follow-on to that, then would you expect to see any increase
in, say, advertising spending or promotional spending to try and ease the progression to higher prices? Is that one of the
solutions to the issues you're having in some of these markets?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, as Dave said, we've been very careful to protect our A&C spending, particularly in
the challenging pricing environment and we will continue to do so. Any of the changes we've made in A&C have all
been in non-working and in consumer-oriented activities. But our fundamental media spending is exactly where we
need it to be to protect our market positions.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: I've got two questions. The first just to follow-up on Chris's question about organic sales
growth, just is there anything different with the consumer in emerging markets today that's making it more difficult to
raise prices and I guess above and beyond just the price gaps? And I guess my thinking was just in the past from
Mondelnz and really for most companies, a little bit of inflation at a local level is actually pretty good, because it
allows you to take maybe cost plus-type pricing. And so is there just something different this time around that's making
it more different in emerging markets to raise prices? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Bryan, I think a little of it is the magnitude. Again, I talked about cocoa being up about
20%. That, together with the significant weakening of some of the local currencies, has really put a lot of pressure on
pricing. And so I think the magnitude is a big part of it. But, again, we're taking a number of steps. Aside from making
sure that we're continuing to support our franchises, we're working very carefully with respect to pricing and sizing to
make sure that we are offering consumers a variety of options at different price points, all of which we hope will make
this dislocation temporary and allow us to mitigate some of the impact.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the change into the category-led model, I guess could
you just clarify two things? One, does P&L responsibility at the division level change? So is it still a regional P&L or is
it a category P&L? And I guess similar with Mark Clouse's new position and kind of where he sits in the organization,
does he have P&L responsibility?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: So the category – the P&Ls continue to reside at our region level and within that, at the
region category level. We really believe, for us, that is the best balance between capitalizing on local market knowledge
and local market execution, while, at the same time, leveraging our scale on a global basis. So that's how we're going to

play this out.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And then does – so will Mark – how does Mark's – does he have P&L responsibility
himself?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Mark does not have direct P&L responsibility. Our global category teams will continue to
steer the overall strategies of our categories out into the marketplace, but the P&L will reside closer to the market with
our region category leaders and our region presidents.

Your next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi. David, your line is open.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Sorry. Can you hear me? Good morning.
<A - David Brearton>: Hey, Dave. Yes. Hi.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Super. Wanted just to ask a little bit more about price and volume elasticity and
compared to historical price increases, can you comment on how the current chocolate price in Europe is going versus
those historical periods where you've had to do it? And separately, can you comment on maybe the early read on coffee
pricing? And if you can kind of tease out the difference between the two, I mean I've always felt like coffee was a much
safer place to take pricing. But I'd like to hear you comment on those two pieces in Europe specifically.
<A - David Brearton>: Okay. I mean, in Europe, we have obviously faced chocolate pricing in the past. This would be
of a magnitude that's bigger than what we've done in the past because of the impact of cocoa going up. Actually even
the cocoa butter ratio within that went up. Dairy costs went up. So essentially, most of the raw materials that go into
chocolate went up. And so chocolate's been particularly hard hit and there's been fairly significant price increases. I
would not say the difference this time, though, is consumer price elasticity. The biggest difference is really the trade.
The trade has pushed back very hard. And it reflects the tough environment in Europe and many of the retailers'
margins themselves are under pressure. So I think the bigger difference this time has been the trade push back. And you
see that in our shares. Our shares remain quite strong in Europe actually, the shipments not so strong. And that's really
the difference between consumers, who I think are more or less are in line with what we expected versus retailers are
pushing back much harder.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: And then just...
<A - David Brearton>: Coffee, as you say, is much more. It goes up and down with markets. I think it will be also a
little tougher than in the past because of the retail environment. But it is an easier thing to get a coffee price increase
through than a chocolate one, for sure.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: One follow-up, on the revenue outlook, I think you made the comment that Europe
was the single biggest driver of your reduced overall revenue outlook, but it also seems fair to say that emerging
markets are also a bit weaker than expected. Do I have the sequence in magnitude correct between the two pieces of
why the revenue guidance is a little bit lower?
<A - David Brearton>: Yes. I mean, the emerging markets for the quarter were up 4.7%, so less than we would have
liked but still pretty respectable. And as we get into the back half, we'll continue to have a little bit of pricing
challenges, but we're going to get past that China headwind. So I think emerging markets will still have pricing
challenges, but I think with the China headwind offsetting that that'll be okay. It really is Europe, where we expect to
continue to have some retailer pressure and where the pricing really has to flow through completely in the third quarter.
So that's the primary driver.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Thank you. I'll pass it along.

Your next question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Good morning. Two questions for me as well, in the past, have you typically led pricing in all
the categories you're implementing pricing today? Or is Mondelnz taking a relatively more of a leadership position
during this inflation cycle? And relatedly, are the lags in pricing by competitors atypical this time around?
<A - David Brearton>: I think we have traditionally led pricing where we have market leadership positions. And that
is the case in most of our category country combinations. So we have normally led pricing and we did that this time as
well. I can't speak for the competition. They all have their own unique situations, but they're facing the same cost
increases. It is typical that you would have some lags in some countries because they all are looking at it through their
own lens, based on whatever their specific facts and circumstances are. I think this time, the impact is a little bit bigger
than normal just because of the size of the pricing. So if we price and create a bigger price gap, that gap difference is
bigger than it has been in the past because of just the sheer magnitude of the pricing that's happening. And, again, it's
particularly on chocolate.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: And then second, you mentioned in your remarks the creation of the Growth Officer position,
the need to be nimble and focused and the need for innovation. All that makes sense. Is there something in terms of
your own execution, a particular area that you'd want to improve more than others? Perhaps it's the innovation side that
you'd like to spark. Perhaps it's other marketing. Could you just speak to that? Thanks.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: David, I think the single biggest opportunity – I think there's a number of benefits of the
new model. I think the single biggest opportunities, though, will lie in growth and speed. And very simply taking good
ideas from one part of the world more rapidly to another will be a key enabler, I think, of accelerating growth. So I'm
quite optimistic about the ability of this new structure and this new position to be able to allow us to move ideas from
one part of the world more rapidly to others.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Eric.
<A - David Brearton>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess, Dave, I was wondering last quarter, you mentioned how many basis points lower
A&P spending helped in terms of margin expansion. Can you give a little more detail about that this quarter
year-over-year?
<A - David Brearton>: Yeah, I think through the first half, as we said, we're around 9% of revenue. That's actually
right in line with what we said we'd do in the full year at the start of the year. The comparison year-over-year is
actually impacted by timing last year. So last year, we spent about 0.5 point higher than that in the first half. And then
we spent less than that in the back half. So year-over-year, I don't think there will be a material change. But this year,
it's very smooth first half, second half. Last year, it was much more front-weighted and really that comes down to some
of the programs we talked about last year, led by China. So we're pretty comfortable that we're sustaining the A&C at
the right level throughout the year this year and that we're supporting our brands. I think the key is the share of voice
hasn't moved. And I think that's the important metric that we look at.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then how long do you expect these E.U. disputes to go on?

<A - David Brearton>: Yeah, I don't want to get into predicting negotiations, but I think the guidance we've given you
gives us the flexibility to manage through that. I think it's important that we stick to our principles and we've always
priced to recover input cost increases. It's important we stick to that because if we don't do that, we don't have the
funding to drive growth for ourselves and our customers. So we'll continue to push that through. But the guidance
we've given today gives us the flexibility to manage through that.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Last question and I'll pass it on. You put in the 10-Q about possibly having to change,
I guess, how you account for the 49% interest you'll have in the coffee JV. Is it possible at this point to run through
what the implications of that are to the P&L? Maybe not specifically, but if you don't have that...
<A - David Brearton>: I can give you in principal what will happen. So when we get to a point when the deal is
certain or it closes, we will treat it as a discontinued business or a business held for sale depending on the situation next
year, probably mid-year. At that point, we will strip it out as a discontinued operation, the same as we did when we've
done other divestitures. And so all of our history will be restated to take it out. In terms of the go-forward, it would be
handled on an equity method. So we own 49%. We'd take 49% of the net income and that would be part of our EPS,
but it would be recorded below OI. So it would not be within our OI. It would not be within our OI margins. It would
be between OI and EPS, but it would be part of the EPS. So that's how it'll work starting at closing. And as I said, we
think by the first full year of operation, which should be 2016, that it should be EPS accretive.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: It's still accretive even if it's now kind of a discontinued op, like wouldn't you – do you have
to lower the earnings base because it's a discontinued op going backward?
<A - David Brearton>: Yeah, when I say accretive, I mean to where we would have been if we hadn't done the deal.
There's lots of factors obviously. We lose the OI on coffee when we take it out of the base. We pick up the 49%
minority interest and we've got $5 billion of cash coming back, which helps us obviously on the share and the interest
side. So that combination of things should be accretive in 2016.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you.

Your next question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Irene, just in China, wondering if you can speak
maybe to your execution there, it seems a few quarters ago you were optimistic that maybe shifting some of the brand
spend back to the secondary biscuit brand could stabilize the market share losses. But it sounds as though maybe that
hasn't happened quite yet. So just how would you characterize the fundamentals there, maybe your strategy going
forward?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Look, we're not pleased with China's performance. I need to be clear. But there's actually
no new news there. As we told you last year, we saw quite a dramatic slowdown in our biscuits category. We lost some
share. We've taken a number of actions to try to address both of those issues. But the facts are the biscuit category has
not yet recovered. In fact, it's growing only about 1% to 2%. So the reality is it's still a challenging situation. The good
news is, as we said, the toughest comps as we enter the second half of the year, the toughest comps will now be behind
us so we're not going to have the same kind of year-over-year headwind that we have had in the first half.
And, again, we are quite pleased with the performance of gum in China and that continues to be a really strong story for
us. But net-net, the China situation is essentially as we had shared it with you and we are starting to lap those
challenging comps as we enter the back half of the year.

Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Irene, you talked about the grocers rejecting pricing and
maybe taking products off shelf as a cost of doing business. And that's fair, but I guess it doesn't happen that often. So
I'm just curious to understand a bit how it took place? Did your marketing team maybe under-appreciate some of the
customers' will in this case? And I guess more importantly, where does your confidence come from that this will get
resolved? You said you expect your competitors to take pricing eventually, but why would they if they just saw what
happened to the industry leader?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Look, pricing is always a difficult proposition and we don't take it lightly, particularly in a
tough macro environment. What gives us the confidence is that our brands are stronger traffic drivers for our customers
and after a certain point in time, it's going to be important to our customers' overall growth to have these brands back
on the shelf. So we didn't take those decisions lightly. We made them because it is critical, as Dave has said, for the
long-term success and health of our franchises and our ability to continue to invest in them. It was critical to make sure
that we are recovering the cost increases that we are experiencing. But we are optimistic, given the strength of our
brands and the role that they play in driving traffic for our customers, that we will be able to successfully resolve this
dispute, but we're also allowing in our guidance, as Dave said, for the fact that it's not necessarily happening tomorrow.
And we want to acknowledge that.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Then, one more on the...
<A - David Brearton>: Let me be clear...
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Sorry.
<A - David Brearton>: Sorry. It has historically happened and we did identify at the quarter one call that we expected
some disruption I think. So the tactics are actually the same that we've seen in prior times. The difference this time is
it's quite broad across many more retailers and it's quite deep. So it is a typical reaction to de-list SKUs in France or to
stop shipments or stop buying for a period of time in France. I think it is more dramatic than we anticipated, but it's not
a completely new tactic.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: That is helpful. One quick one on the U.S., at least according to Nielsen data, some
traditional snacking categories, all of them, right, cookies, crackers, chocolates, salty snacks, they've all really
decelerated. I'm curious if you can talk about what's happening, in your view, there? We're seeing some strength in
nuts, dried fruit, sort of healthier snacks, things like that, so just any thoughts you have on whether there's a share shift
within snacking would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Actually, our snacking business has performed quite well within, as you rightly point out, a
challenging environment. So there's no question the categories are slowing. We have been out-performing the
categories for quite some time. And I think it's for a couple of reasons. I think we've had a very strong marketing and
innovation pipeline in North America. I think our DSD network is operating extremely effectively. And so we believe
that we can continue to drive our growth at or above category rates. Our year-to-date biscuit share is up almost 1 point
and our biscuits organic revenue was up about 4% in the first half. And it's because of the factors that I mentioned. So I
think there is some slowdown in some of the categories, but we've been able to capture more than our fair share and
that's been driving our overall revenue performance.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Thank you.

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Just one regional question, I was hoping to get a bit more color on the weaker sales this
quarter in Asia. I know you faced an easier prior-year comparison. You've been working through your issues in China
for several quarters now. And we, hopefully, are past the worst. But top-line did decelerate further, which I'm guessing
is attributable mostly to this Australia and New Zealand issue you called out. So is that the case? And if so, can you
characterize the impact that's having? What's going on and what we should expect there over the balance of the year?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: So let me start with the fact that actually through the first half, as we said, China was
actually a massive headwind. We were up about 8% year ago in the first half in 2013 in China and so that's a big
headwind to us as we experience some of the challenges that we said. And that continues to be the biggest factor, but,
certainly in the quarter, some of what happened in Australia and New Zealand is just a essentially a consequence of
some of the same pricing conversations that we've been having about our European customers. And, again, it's
something that we think will resolve itself as the year goes on. We did see some fairly significant de-stocking from
some of our Australian customers. And that was what caused some of the dislocation in the second quarter.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. But just to be clear, given some of your competitors over the years had
de-stocking issues that have been extremely difficult to resolve in that market. Would you say you have sort of an
equivalent level of confidence that you would have in Europe going forward as far as getting those products back on
shelf and resolved these quickly?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, the good news, again, these are brands that have very strong market positions. They
do drive traffic. And, quite frankly, as we look at some of the inventory positions, they are well below healthy levels, so
reasonable confidence. Again, we're not necessarily predicting timing, but we do expect that in the guidance that we've
given to you, we would expect to see that resolve itself in the coming months and weeks.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thank you, Irene.

Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hi. Thank you. Hey, Irene, I think it was a year and a half ago at CAGNY that you
established some pretty bold targets for points of distribution gains in emerging markets. And since then, there's been
some SG&A overhead cuts. I wanted to make sure that you're comfortable that you can still achieve those distribution
gains, despite the overhead reductions. And have you kept track of those goals and where do you think you're tracking
on them? And then I had a quick follow-up.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Absolutely, Rob. I mean, we are not cutting our investments in the emerging markets. We
have significantly – as you know, last year we significantly stepped up our investments early in the year. Much of that
was in route-to-market and we are benefiting from those investments. We are continuing to make the necessary
investments. We are protecting sales, to a large extent, as we look at some of the overhead initiatives. But the end in
mind is to make sure that we are making the necessary foundational investments in these key markets to capitalize on
the opportunities that will emerge as the economies recover.
So we continue to feel good about the investments that we made in route-to-market in places like Russia, like Brazil,
like India and we will continue to seed those investments, making sure that we're getting an adequate return. But this is
not about cutting back on those investments. This, again, the focus is on head count elsewhere in the world and, to a
large extent, as well as some non-people-related overhead costs.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay. And then the follow-up is you said that your share of voice is still at high levels, but
you've shifted a lot of money into digital. And I'm sure your competitors have also. Are you comfortable that your
ability to measure share of voice is still good? And are you able to measure digital in share of voice? And then also,
you were in market research. Like, do you feel comfortable that the return you're getting on digital marketing is
sufficient or is that still in its infancy in terms of measurement?

<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yeah, it's a fair question, Rob. I have to tell you, we actually are quite able to measure the
ROI of our digital investments. And we're finding it's paying back about twice the rate of our traditional media
investments, not to mention the fact that we're seeing quite significant media inflation in a number of our emerging
markets. And so the benefits of going to digital, as that explodes in markets like China and Brazil, is a positive because
that's where our consumers are. So I think that the evidence that we have is quite compelling and it gives us great
confidence that as we continue to shift our spending into digital, that we will get actually an even better return on many
of these investments.

Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Hi. Can I ask about the leadership changes that we've seen in China and India recently? I
think recently you brought somebody in from the outside into China. We've seen some changes recently in India as
well. What specifically were you looking for in terms of capabilities? How confident are you that you've got the right
people in place now? Just any color that you can give us on that would be great. Thank you.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I feel quite good about the leaders that we have placed in both of those countries and a
number of our other key emerging markets. As I mentioned, India is performing well, continues to grow at a double
digit rate. And Manu Anand has had a great deal of experience in operating within that country. And he has done a
great job in continuing to drive the momentum in that market. China, we mentioned that we brought in Stephen Maher.
He's about four weeks old, I would say, in his new role, but he's got 16 years of CPG experience, most of that, much of
that actually, is in China. And as a result, he brings to the task a very great seasoning in a variety of the disciplines of
general management as well as understanding the Chinese market. And so I am quite confident that Stephen will be
able to deliver on the ambitious agenda that we have in China.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: And then just a quick follow-up, can you give us the run rate – or the current run rate of
gum in China? I think the last time you talked about it, it was about $100 million kind of level. Where are we now?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: We're forecasting about $150 million for the year, Alexia. We're feeling quite good. We've
got about a 9% share and we're quite pleased with the performance of our gum business there.

<Q - Jason M. English>: A lot of rhetoric about decelerating category growth on the call, you've given us some data in
your slides, I guess it's Slide 16, suggesting that your category growth, end market growth, accelerated from 2.8% in
the first quarter to around 3.8% for the full first half, suggesting in the quarter, it may actually even have been
approaching close to 5%. So is that the right way to think about it? If so, where's the disconnect with the data in the
commentary and also where are you seeing that acceleration from a market perspective?

<A - David Brearton>: I think the slide we showed for the first half was about 3.8%. You're right, for the first quarter,
it was lower than that. But it's basically Easter. So there was a big flip between March and April, huge, actually. And
that's what's driving the second quarter to be a higher growth rate from the first quarter. The first half in aggregate is the
best way to look at it. And it's about 3.8%. And when we talked about the category slowdown, I think we saw that in
North America. We saw that in a lot of the European markets and we saw it in a lot of the emerging markets as well as,
particularly in the May, June months. So I think it's – we can't really look at only one quarter, given the Easter shift.
But clearly, I think we wanted to make sure that we reflected that in the outlook we give you.
<Q - Jason M. English>: That's helpful. Turning real quick to gum, I imagine you're not taking much price on gum,
just given the cost basket there. Is that fair to say?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Yes, it is.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Yet, in gum, you're still lagging the market by a substantial chunk, down low single digits.
The market's turned up around 1% now through the first half. Why shouldn't we be concerned that there's something
other than just price gaps and retailer push-back that's driving the market share weakness?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: I think you need to look at that on a market-by-market basis, Jason. I talked about the
performance in the U.S. We've had two quarters of solid share growth. I talked about what's going in China. In our
major gum markets, we're continuing to make good progress behind the initiatives that I've laid out. And as I said,
we're still not pleased with our gum performance. It is still negative year-over-year, but the good news is it's less
negative and we're starting to see it move in a better direction.
<A - David Brearton>: And I think the two places that are negative – we've talked about the positives – are Europe is
still negative and actually the other one will probably surprise you. It's Venezuela, because it's an imported product and
it's a struggle to get the currency. So the Venezuela volume is down quite a bit. So those are really the two that are
offsetting the good numbers we're seeing in China and North America.

Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Athlos Research.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Good morning. Thanks very much.
<A - David Brearton>: Hey, Jon.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hey, Jon.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Over the course of the quarter, would you say that volume, particularly in developing
markets, improved like month-to-month? And is that what gives you confidence in the second half that this deceleration
won't be sustained because it looks like you're guiding to for the full year in organic net rev what you've done kind of
year-to-date despite the decel first and second quarter, or is it more the pricing side maybe where you have a little bit
more control? You know prices are going to be going up and you know that second half of the year, I understand the
comps get a little bit easier in China, but they get a little bit tougher, particularly on a stacked basis, in the third and
fourth quarter other places, so just parsing out those volume versus pricing in your net rev regime? I appreciate it.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: So, Jon, again, pricing is the big variable here, because you're correct in saying that we do
see that we'll pick up some tailwinds in the back half as we lap China and as we cycle the coffee as we see higher prices
in coffee. That's going to be offset as we look at the outlook by the continued slow category growth as well as the
continued dislocation as our pricing makes its way through the system. And so that's – those are the puts and takes. But
the big impact offsetting the tailwinds is really the pricing continuing to play through. And as we've said, we would

expect, even in Q3, that we would expect our share performance will continue to soften as we work our way through
some of these customer disputes and more of our pricing impact hits the shelves. We do believe this is temporary, but it
will have an impact, a continued impact, in Q3.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: And volume in Asia Pac and Latin America, did that improve over the course of the
quarter or can you say?
<A - David Brearton>: I think the volume in Asia Pac was primarily a China item and a little bit Australia. And in
Latin America, the volume is really two-fold. It's Venezuela and Argentina with the hyperinflation there. And that's
been a sort of ongoing trade-off on low margin products as we price that away, and Mexico, to some degree, as we
adjust to the VAT. I think the important thing in Latin America is Brazil, which is really our powerhouse, continues to
grow vol/mix and most of the other countries do as well. So it's kind of Mexico VAT and it's Venezuela, Argentina
which are kind of anomalies.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Got you. That's helpful, but can you say whether it improved over the course of the
quarter? I'm just talking month-to-month. Did we leave June on a high note or did we leave kind of just average?
<A - David Brearton>: We left it where we expected to be. The China issues was really a question of comparisons to
year ago. It wasn't so much about improvements this year. And I think last year, we had a very strong June month. So
we were down in China year-over-year. I would expect with the absence of those tough comps going into Q3, we're
pretty comfortable that the run rate in China is where it needs to be to hit the numbers we gave you today.

<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hello, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Just talking more about the things you can do in your control, I know as you go through
ZBB, a lot of times, I think, through the process, companies tend to find a greater deal of cost savings through this
process. Can you talk about have you seen greater opportunity than you initially thought? And at what point do you
think there's a potential for an acceleration of even greater savings, because it seems like you guys have done actually a
pretty good job on this stuff?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, look, we've set some fairly aggressive targets as we've laid out our targets of
approximately 300 to 400 basis points over the next three years. And that's a fairly aggressive agenda. The good news
is I will tell you as we continue to work our way through the specific initiatives, I have great confidence that we will
deliver those targets. But I think the – we just need to continue to make progress quarter after quarter. I am pleased, as I
said, in the programs and the impact it has had in just even in our Q2 results. And I think we'll still continue to see that
play through.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: And my just a follow-up, I know in parts of the business, are you actually adding
infrastructure? I know you're adding a Growth Officer. Is there other levels that are somewhat being funded by this
whole cost savings opportunity? Or is that always part of the plan of having, maybe not another layer of management
but, another layer of infrastructure?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Simple answer is no, we're not adding a layer of infrastructure. And, in fact, there's some
puts and takes that go with the creation of the Chief Growth Officer role. But it is a fact that as we look at our
opportunity within the context of the new operating model, we are continuing to invest in sales and route-to-market.
And so we are taking disproportionately, we're taking some of our savings disproportionately from some of the other
areas of the operation in favor of those key front line investments. So you will see that play through. But we are not

<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your final question comes from David Hayes of Nomura.
<Q - David H. Hayes>: Good morning. Two questions if I can, first, a broad one and then a more specific on Europe,
just in terms of the broader question, obviously lots of moving parts in terms of the disappointment in terms of the sales
growth through the year. But is there any anxiety at all internally that there's too much demand on the cost savings side,
the margin delivery side in the organization, and that's what's basically defocusing the business from performing as
well as maybe it could do or has done in terms of sales and share delivery?
And then the second question is just going back to the E.U., two things on this. Firstly, you mentioned France and then
Europe interchangeably. Just trying to understand is it just France that these issues are existing in in terms of the
retailers or were there other markets as well? And then just in terms of the dynamic, you made just the point yourself,
that the consumer off-take is still good, that the shipments effectively are lagging that because of negotiation. To some
extent, you'd have thought with your brands being mass stock in many cases, to your point earlier, that you would just
catch up the shipments. And therefore, the second half would bounce. So I guess the question, to some extent, is that
the dynamic? And is your guidance for the second half therefore very cautious in your view and actually you could be
better than the 2%, 2.5% as that dynamic plays out? Thank you.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Let me answer your last two questions and then I'll come back to the first. It is about
France. And again, should these shipments catch up, the simple answer is, we hope so. But the speed with which we
resolved some of these disputes is kind of not something that I wanted to predict. So we believe in the guidance we
have given to you. We have adequately reflected the reality that someday we will get ourselves through these
conversations but we're not counting on it necessarily happening tomorrow. And so I hope that gives you some
perspective on that question.
With respect to the question of is there too much focus on margin and to what extent is that putting, creating more
pressure on our top-line? There's no question we are doing a lot right now. But I really do believe that it's much better
to move quickly and decisively rather than leaving a lot of uncertainty out in the organization. We are certainly
experiencing some disruption. But our focus is to protect the long-term health of our business and our ability to invest
in our franchises and in our people. And so, again, we believe that the dislocation that we're experiencing is temporary.
We will work our way through it. But, most importantly, we believe we are doing the right things for the long-term
health of the business. And, as I mentioned, our strategic initiatives are moving along on track consistent with what we
had expected.
<Q - David H. Hayes>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Dexter Congbalay>: Hey, Operator, that's it for questions?
