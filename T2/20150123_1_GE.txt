MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. At
this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Larissa, and I'll be your conference coordinator today.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Now I'd like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor
Communications. Please proceed.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Great. Thank you. Good morning and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to host today's fourth quarter webcast.
Regarding the materials for this webcast, we issued the press release, presentation and GE supplemental earlier this
morning on our website at www.ge.com/investor.
As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our
businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light.
For today's webcast we have our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt, and our Senior Vice President and CFO, Jeff
Bornstein.
Now I'd like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.

Look, we still see the global environment as generally positive with a lot of volatility. GE had a strong fourth quarter
with some elements better than we indicated in December. Operating EPS was $0.56, up 6% led by Industrial EPS,
which grew by 23%. Orders grew by 3%, which was 5% organically, and our backlog expanded to a new record.
Industrial organic growth was up 9% and margins expanded by 50 basis points. Our initiatives continued to deliver
results. Industrial CFOA was $7.2 billion, up 64% reported in the quarter or 30% ex the 2013 NBCU taxes. Capital's
quarter was consistent with our expectations.
The U.S. continued to strengthen as did Asia. Some businesses are seeing more momentum like aviation and
healthcare. Our Oil & Gas team executed well despite volatility. Their underlying performance was revenue flat and
earnings up 6%, and we believe that our diverse and integrated model worked for investors in the quarter, as it will in
2015. We delivered on our key commitments for the year; Industrial segment profits grew by 10% driven by 7%
organic growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion. GE Capital reduced ENI by $17 billion and hit their earnings
plan.
CFOA was in the middle of the range at $15.2 billion. Free cash flow was $11.2 billion, up 6% for the year. Our capital
allocation choices were in line with expectations. On the M&A front, Alstom should be a financial and strategic driver.
Appliances is well priced and done a down to a good point in the cycle. And the Synchrony spend will result in a
substantial reduction in GE shares. We're executing a valuable pivot at GE, one that improves our business mix while
delivering EPS growth and expanding returns.
Now for orders, total orders grew by 3%, which is pretty good in the environment. As I said earlier, organically, this is
5% in total with 3% in equipment and 8% growth in services. Orders grew by 7% for the year. We had strength in
services, which was up 6% in the quarter and 10% for the year and we grew backlog by $17 billion year-over-year.
Power & Water had a solid quarter, but comps were impacted by the huge Algerian deal in 2013. Without that, orders
were up 13% in the quarter and we now have 15 H orders with another 30 technical selections. Oil & Gas orders were
down 4% organically, consistent with our expectations. Turbomachinery actually saw orders grew by 16% in the
quarter.
Aviation orders grew by 15% and they end the year with a record backlog. Aviation commercial spares grew by 37% in
the quarter. Importantly, the U.S. healthcare equipment orders grew by 17% demonstrating renewed strength in our
biggest market. Our success with the Tier 4 locomotive continues. We took 1,355 orders in 2014 and are positioned for
record shipments in 2015.
The U.S. was strong with orders growing by 18% in the fourth quarter following a 25% growth in the third quarter, and
growth markets were mixed. For instance, Middle East and North Africa was negative in the quarter due to the
Algerian order I talked about earlier, but was up 20% for the year. And Asian growth market orders grew by 21%.
We closed 2014 with a backlog of $261 billion, and in December we called out a 2015 organic growth range of 2% to
5% and we still feel good about this range. For execution, our team really executed well in the quarter with organic
growth up 9% and margins up 50 basis points. For the year, Industrial segment profit was up 10% with 7% organic
revenue growth and 50 basis points of margin enhancement.
Our initiatives are driving growth ahead of our peers. Our product lineup is quite strong. The H turbine is winning in
the market. Our Aviation wins are huge with 79% LEAP share to-date. The Tier 4 continues to win. Our healthcare
products are gaining share in CT, MR and ultrasound. Aviation commercial spares shipments grew by 24% and power
gen services grew revenue by 14%. As I said earlier, growth market revenues expanded by 7% in 2014 with five of
nine regions growing.
Also an update on a few of our adjacencies. Life sciences grew earnings by 15% for the year. Water hit a 10%
operating profit rate in the quarter with 26% earnings growth for the year. And we won the Boeing 777x onboard
computing system. This is the huge win and positions GE as a Tier 1 avionics supplier.
Margins continue to be a good story, up 50 basis points for the year. Simplification and services again are the big
drivers. We hit 14% of structural costs as a percentage of sales for the year with another $1.2 billion of cost out. And

corporate costs ex gains, restructuring and NBCU declined by more than $900 million. We're seeing the impact of
analytics on service productivity. Service margins grew by 270 basis points in the quarter and we have momentum in
every business. And with an intensifying focus on gross margins and product costs, we're on track for another year of
margin growth in 2015.
Now on to cash, for the quarter, our Industrial cash by 64% to $7.2 billion. This is consistent with our expectations for
the quarter and the year. We finished the year by shipping a tremendous amount of volume and our teams did a great
job on working capital, which reduced by $2 billion in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow for the year was $11.2 billion,
up 6%, and the GE capital dividend was $3 billion below the $6 billion they delivered in 2013.
We ended the year with substantial liquidity and financial strength. GE Capital ended the year with Tier 1 common
ratio of 12.7%, substantially above the regulatory guidelines. We returned about $11 billion to investors in dividends
and buyback and we remain on track for $12 billion to $15 billion for cash flow and dispositions in 2015. We will
allocate our capital in line with the discussion we had in December. Our priority is to execute on Alstom, fund organic
growth, and continue to grow the dividend. Remember that Synchrony at the current pricing should return $18 billion
to $20 billion to investors in the share exchange.
In any environment, where we have an uncertain macro economy, it's important to talk about execution. In 2014, in our
performance, you can see the tangible results of how we're running GE. Our underlying business has significant
operational momentum supported by the changes to how we're running GE day-to-day with more transparency and
more accountability. This was an excellent execution quarter for the team.
And now Jeff will give you the business details.
Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Thanks, Jeff.
I'll start with fourth quarter summary. We had revenues up $42 billion, up 4% in the quarter. Industrial sales of $31
billion were up 8%, and GE Capital revenues of $11.5 billion were up 4%. Operating earnings of $5.6 billion were
higher by 4%. Operating earnings per share of $0.56 were up 6% with Industrial EPS up 23% and GE Capital EPS
down 17%.
Continuing EPS of $0.52 includes the impact of non-operating pension, and net EPS includes the impact of
discontinued operations. We had $0.01 impact in discontinued operations this quarter associated with WMC. This was
driven by a reserve increase of $142 million to reflect WMC's current assessment of its loan loss exposure based on
recent settlement activity negotiations. WMC ended the quarter with $809 million in reserves, flat with fourth quarter
of 2013.
As Jeff said, CFOA for the year was $15.2 billion. We had Industrial CFOA of $12.2 billion and received $3 billion of
dividends from GE Capital. In the quarter, Industrial generated $7.2 billion of CFOA, up 64% on a reported basis and
up 30% excluding the impact of NBCU taxes from last year.
The GE tax rate for the quarter was 13%, bringing the year-to-date rate to 17%. In the quarter we benefited from the
passage of that extenders bill and deductions from higher restructuring and impairments. The GE Capital tax rate was
5% for the quarter and 2% for the year, consistent with the low single-digit estimate that we previously communicated.
On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were up 6% reported and up 9%
organically, reflecting about two points of headwind from foreign exchange and one point from acquisitions and
dispositions. Foreign exchange was approximately $600 million drag on Industrial segment revenue and about $180
million impact on our profit in the quarter. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 9.0%.
GE Capital earnings were down 19% primarily driven by lower gains and tax benefits associated with the Swiss and the
Bay transactions from the fourth quarter of last year. I'll cover the dynamics of each of the segments in a couple of
pages.

First, I'll start with the other items page for the quarter. We had $0.04 of restructuring and other charges at corporate.
Over $0.02 of that related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and other items as we continued to take actions to
improve the Industrial cost structure. At $353 million pre-tax, this was approximately $75 million higher than the plan
and reflects the acceleration of some restructuring opportunities from 2015.
We also had a $217 million pre-tax charge for an impairment related to a strategic investment in the energy space. This
investment has underperformed in the market, but we continue to expect there to be long-term value in the asset.
In November of 2013, I reviewed with investors our plan to invest $1 billion to $1.5 billion in restructuring to
accelerate the repositioning of our Industrial cost footprint and position us to grow earnings through the pivot in 2015
and 2016. On the bottom of the page is a profile of those restructuring and other charges that we took in 2014 by
quarter and the $0.01 gain associated with the Wayne disposition. For the total year, net charges were $0.11 per share
or $1.7 billion pre-tax.
Next I'll give you an update on Industrial cost dynamics. On SG&A, we've made a lot of progress. We ended the year at
14% SG&A to sales, which is down almost two points from 2013. This was driven by a combination of cost-out efforts
in the Industrial segments and corporate. For the year we took out $1.2 billion of structural costs, in line with the $1
billion-plus we've been communicating with you.
On the bottom left you can see Industrial segment gross margins excluding corporate. For the year, segment gross
margins were down 80 basis points, which is driven entirely by negative mix, as we grew equipment revenues faster
than services, particularly in Wind, GEnx, and Thermal.
As we discussed at the December outlook meeting, Dan Heintzelman, Jamie Miller, and I are driving a focused
initiative to improve Industrial gross margins through intense focus on product costs, similar to our programmatic
approach around SG&A. We are targeting to improve gross margins by 50 basis points in 2015.
On the right side, you can see the corporate operating costs. The bar graph excludes gains, restructuring, and NBCU
operations from 2013, so you can see our true operating expenses. We've taken significant actions on corporate costs,
with about $950 million reduction for the year. This includes functional headquarter cost improvements, lower global
and growth spend, operating pension and retiree health cost improvements, and non-repeating charges in 2013,
principally the EBX charge we took in the second quarter of 2013.
The focus on reducing corporate costs will continue into 2015, and we expect corporate costs to be about $2.3 billion to
$2.5 billion for the year. We'll continue to reduce corporate costs, but this will be partly offset by higher pension
expenses, as Jeff outlined during the outlook meeting in December.
Now I'll go into the segments and start with Power & Water. Orders in the fourth quarter totaled $9.5 billion, down 8%.
Orders were higher by 13% excluding the Algerian mega-deal in the fourth quarter of last year. Equipment orders were
down 12%, driven by Thermal down 62% as a result of a difficult comparison to last year's 270% increase, including
Algeria.
We had orders for 41 gas turbines in the quarter, flat with last year excluding the Algerian deal. In the fourth quarter we
received an order for two H turbines, bringing units in backlog to 15 H's. And we've been selected for another 30 units
on projects and are bidding an additional 61 units as we speak. Total gas turbine order count for the year finished at 105
units, representing 18 gigawatts of power.
Partially offsetting Thermal's orders decline was Distributed Power, which was higher by 66%, and Renewables was up
47% for the quarter. Distributed Power equipment growth was driven by turbines, up over 100%, partly offset by a
decline in engines. The turbine strength was attributed to a large win in Egypt, consisting of 20 trailer-mounted units,
14 LM6000s, and some balance of plant. The 20 TMs and six of the 14 LMs converted to sales in the quarter. For the
year, DP recorded orders for 167 turbines versus 174 in 2013.
Renewables equipment orders were up 47%, reflecting orders for 1,251 turbines. The U.S. was up 16%, including 138
safe harbor units associated with the PTC extension. And we saw significant growth in Latin America, the Middle East,

and in regions we took no orders in the fourth quarter of 2013, including China and India.
Service orders were down 2%, also driven by no repeat of the Algerian deal. Excluding Algeria, service orders grew
9% on strong transactional upgrades and outages. AGPs in the quarter were 26 versus 25 last year, bringing the total
year AGP count to 80.
Power & Water revenues of $9.4 billion in the quarter were up 22%, with very strong equipment revenues up 37% and
service revenues up 7%. Equipment revenue was driven by strength in Thermal, up 64%, with sales of 44 gas turbines
versus 28 last year, and Renewables up 20% on 206 more wind turbines, and DP up 33% in the quarter.
Operating profit in the quarter totaled $2.1 billion, up 13% versus fourth quarter of 2013, and earnings were driven by
higher volume and cost productivity, partially offset by negative value gap, principally price, and unfavorable mix of
higher equipment sales versus services. SG&A in the quarter was down 12% year over year, and margins in the quarter
were down 190 basis points.
As you look into 2015, we expect to continue to grow services, including upgrades, and we anticipate a flat gas turbine
market but expect to gain share. We're planning for wind to deliver 3,000 to 3,200 units and Distributed Power will
continue to be pressured as we look in 2015.
Next Oil & Gas; Oil & Gas orders at $4.9 billion were down 10% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effects of FX and
the Wayne disposition, orders were down 4%. Notwithstanding the volatility of oil prices in the fourth quarter, we
believe the relative impact was modest, with more impact expected in 2015. Equipment orders of $2.5 billion were
down 15% reported, down 9% organically. The subsea orders were down 38%, with no repeat of large fourth quarter of
last year orders with Petrobras and ENI.
Downstream technology orders were down 46%, driven by a large shale order in the fourth quarter of last year in our
Distributed Gas Solutions business, partially offset by strong growth of 7% in our downstream products platform.
Measurement and control equipment orders were up 6% organically, as we continue to see improvement in end flow
and process markets.
Drilling and surface orders were down 2%, with drilling down 72% as expected, partly offset by 7% growth in our
surface business. Turbomachinery was up 60% on natural gas orders in North America, the Middle East, and in Russia.
Service orders were down 4% but up 1% organically. The TMS orders were down 10% on lower installations in the
quarter, partly offset by 6% organic growth in M&C, downstream technology growth of 16%, and drilling and surface
higher by 11%. For the year, total orders were flat, with backlog up 1%.
Oil & Gas revenues in the quarter of $5 billion were down 6% reported and flat organically, driven by three points of
FX and three points of disposition impact. Equipment revenues were down 5% with subsea down 10% but flat
excluding exchange. M&C was higher by 3% organically and downstream technology and drilling and surface were up
10% and 11% respectively.
Service revenues were down 6%, primarily driven by TMS down 11% and M&C down 5%, but M&C was up 12%
organically. Operating profit in the quarter was higher by 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year and up 6%
organically, driven by strong value gap and cost productivity, offset by the effects of foreign exchange. Margins
expanded 110 basis points in the quarter and 100 basis points for the year.
As we outlined in the December outlook meeting, 2015 will be a challenging year for our Oil & Gas business. Lorenzo
[Simonelli] and the team are focused on executing on the cost-out actions to offset volatility and deliver on their
commitments.
Next up is Aviation. Aviation demand continues to be strong with revenue passenger kilometers November year-to-date
up 6.1% on international routes and up 5.3% on domestic routes. Freight growth was 4.4% November year-to-date.
Orders for Aviation were strong up 15% in the quarter. Equipment orders of $4.4 billion were higher by 8%, and
service orders grew 25%. Equipment orders were principally driven by commercial engines. GEnx orders of $1.2

billion were up 23% on large orders from American and Air France. GE90 orders were up 2.5 times to $900 million in
the quarter, and LEAP and CFM recorded $1.2 billion of orders. Our total win rate for the LEAP since launch is now at
79% on narrow body aircraft.
Military equipment orders were down 59%, driven by the slow military environment. Service orders up 25% were
driven by strong commercial spares orders at $35.6 million a day, up 37%, and stronger military spares. Orders for total
year 2014 grew 8% and backlog grew 7% for the year to $134 billion.
Revenues in the fourth quarter were higher by 4% to $6.4 billion driven by commercial equipment revenues up 8%,
services up 3%, and military equipment down 3%. Commercial spares was strong up 24%. We shipped 77 GEnx units
in the quarter and 287 for the year. Leverage in operating profit was strong with 12% growth in volume with positive
value gap, partly offset by mix and higher R&D. Op margins improved 140 basis points in the quarter. Overall, the
Aviation team had a strong quarter and year and we expect strong performance to continue into 2015.
Next is Healthcare. Healthcare had a better quarter than the headline results would suggest. Orders were up 1% in the
quarter, but up 4% excluding foreign exchange, and the U.S. was quite strong up 9%. Latin America and China were
both up 2%, offset by Europe down 1%, but up 5% organically. Japan was down 23%, driven by the consumption tax
and reimbursement reform and the Middle East was down 26%, mostly driven by Saudi.
Healthcare system orders were down 3% but up 2% organically, driven by U.S. imaging and ultrasound equipment
orders, which were up 12% in the quarter. We saw growth across most modalities, with particular strength in CT, up
22%, from our new Revolution CT introduction, and ultrasound up 15% from our new Voluson product in the women's
health diagnostics space. This was offset by softer orders in Japan, Russia, and the Middle East. China orders were up
2%, reflecting delays in government tenders we've seen over the last several quarters.
Life science orders, up 13% driven by bioprocess up 60% on very strong demand in the U.S. and Europe offset
partially by core imaging down 7%. Revenues of $5.1 billion were flat but higher by 3% ex foreign exchange. And
HCS revenues were down 3% but up 2% organically and life science revenues were up 9% and up 6% organically.
Operating profit was down 4% but was up 1% organically with strong cost execution including 5% lower SG&A was
more than offset by price and foreign exchange.
Looking forward, we expect the U.S. market to continue to improve. Although final industry figures have yet to be
publish, we believe we are winning share in key modalities in the U.S. and China should grow modestly as we look into
2015. The business will continue to drive structural and product cost out as we move forward.
Next, Transportation, which had a strong orders quarter up 62% with equipment orders up 107% and services higher by
19%. In 2014, Transportation had a strongest orders year ever at $9.6 billion up 89%. Locomotive orders in the quarter
were 284 units versus 70 last year driven by North America where we took orders for 235 additional Tier 4 compliant
units.
For the total year 2014, we received orders for 1,355 Tier 4 compliant locomotives. Backlog for the year grew 43% to
$21 billion with equipment higher by 148% and services higher by 22%. Carloads grew strongly in North America up
4.4% in 2014 led by intermodal up 5.4%, commodities including agriculture were up 3.7% and petroleum was up
12.5% for the year. In the fourth quarter, petroleum volumes continued to grow up 16% year over year.
Revenues in the quarter were up 8% driven by locomotives up 8%, services up 14% partly offset by mining down by
31%. For the total year revenue was down 4%, largely driven by mining. Operating profit in the quarter was up 13% on
higher locomotive volume, material deflation and cost productivity partly offset by lower mining volume. The
Transportation team has executed well and has positioned the business to capitalize on the new Tier 4 requirements in
2015.
Next, Energy Management, which earned more in the fourth quarter than it earned in the entirety of 2013. Orders in the
quarter were down 2% largely driven by softer marine orders and power conversion, which was down about 16%,
partially offset by digital energy up strongly at 17% and Industrial Solutions up 5%. Backlog grew 9% to $5 billion.

Revenues were down 2% but up 2% organically. Power conversion revenues grew 6%, digital energy grew 1%.
Industrial Solutions was down 6%. Operating profit of $113 million was higher by 2.5 times on strong value gap and
cost execution. For the year we earned $246 million of operating profit, up 124%. Execution continues to improve and
we expect substantial improvements again in 2015.
In appliances and lighting, revenue in the quarter was up 5%, appliance revenues were up 8% driven by strong volume
and industry core units were up 8% with both retail and contract markets up 8% as well. Lighting revenues were down
1% on lower traditional product demand, which was down 15% and more than offset the strong LED lighting growth of
72% in the quarter. LED now makes up 27% of lighting's revenues up from 16% in the fourth quarter of last year.
Operating profit of $188 million was up 32% in the quarter and margins expanded by 160 basis points.
Next I'll cover GE Capital. GE Capital's revenue of $11.5 billion was up 4% primarily from lower marks and
impairments. Net income of $1.9 billion was down 19% principally driven by lower gains and tax benefits including
those related to last year's portfolio exits including the Swiss and Bay Bank transactions, partially offset by lower credit
costs, marks and impairments.
ENI excluding liquidity of $363 billion was down $17 billion or 5% from last year and down $2 billion sequentially.
Non-strategic ENI was down $12 billion to $132 billion or 8% versus last year. Net interest margin in the quarter at 5%
was essentially flat. GE Capital's Tier 1 common ratio on the Basel I basis remains in a strong position and ended the
year at 12.7%. This is up approximately 60 basis points from the third quarter and 150 basis points year-over-year.
Our liquidity levels were strong ending the quarter at $76 billion. This includes $13 billion attributable to Synchrony.
Our commercial paper program remains stable at $25 billion and we had $10 billion of long-term debt issuance for the
year excluding the activity related to Synchrony. In 2015 we've already issued $7 billion of long-term debt as part of
our total year plan of around $20 billion.
On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be stable with significant improvements in our mortgage
portfolio driven primarily by the sale of a $0.5 billion non-performing loan portfolio in our UK home lending business,
which generated a small gain during the quarter and in the move of our Hungarian bank to held-for-sale. We expect to
complete the exit of the Hungary bank during the first half of 2015.
In terms of segment performance, commercial lending and leasing business ended the quarter with $172 billion of
assets, down 1% to last year largely driven by foreign exchange. Global on-book volume was $12 billion, down 10%.
However, we continue to see strengthening in the U.S. largely in equipment financing with volume up 4%. New
business returns in both lending and equipment were largely in line with the first three quarters of the year. Earnings of
$549 million were up 109% driven by lower marks and impairments. In 2014 the CLL business earned $2.3 billion up
16%.
The consumer segment ended the quarter with $136 billion of assets, up 3% from last year with earnings of $1.1
billion, down 45%. Our share of Synchrony earnings was $451 million, down 3% driven by minority interest and
partially offset by core growth. Consistent with last quarter as a now publicly traded company, CEO, Margaret Keane,
and the team will host their own investor call later this morning. Separation efforts remain on track.
Excluding Synchrony, assets were down 17% as we continue to reduce our presence in non-strategic portfolios.
Earnings excluding Synchrony were $686 million, down 57% driven by the non-repeat of gains and tax benefits
recorded last year for the Swiss and Bay transactions partially offset by $594 million gain associated with the sale of
the Nordics Consumer platform.
Just as a reminder, as a result of the accounting guidelines roughly half that gain was recognized in prior quarters as tax
benefits in GE Capital corporate. These benefits were reversed in the fourth quarter and the gain was taken in the
consumer segment resulting in a net gain in GE Capital of $300 million in the fourth quarter. In 2014 the consumer
segment earned $3 billion, down 30%.
In real estate, assets of $34 billion were down 11% versus prior year. The equity book is down 35% from a year ago to
$9 billion. Net income of $299 million was up 134% driven by higher gains and portfolio earnings partially offset by

higher impairments. In the current quarter we sold 350 properties from our real estate equity book with a book value of
about $2.1 billion for a $328 million in gain. In 2014 the real estate business earned $1 billion, down 42% on lower
gains.
In the verticals, GECAS earned $218 million, up 207% driven by lower impairments, partially offset by lower gains
and lower assets. Overall, the portfolio is in great shape and we finished the quarter with zero delinquencies and three
aircraft on the ground. New volume remains strong at $2 billion, up 50% with attractive returns in line with the first
three quarters of the year. For the year, GECAS earned $1 billion and was up 17% from prior year. The Milestone
acquisition continues to progress and we expect to close during the first quarter of 2015 pending regulatory approvals.
Energy finance earned $111 million, down 5% in the quarter, in line with lower assets. EFS' volume was up 31%
year-over-year and had very attractive returns. In 2014 EFS business earned $401 million, down 2%. Overall, Keith
and the team continue to execute the portfolio strategy and deliver solid operating results.
As we look forward to 2015, we expect GE Capital to generate about $0.60 on an EPS basis as Jeff discussed last
month during the annual outlook meeting. We expect GE Capital to earn approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter
of the year.
Lastly, I wanted to spend a minute and talk about the framework for 2015 and cover four points. On the left you have
our segment outlook as Jeff shared in December. Overall, there's no change in that framework. On the right side, first,
positively, we are seeing strength in the U.S. healthcare market. Orders were strong, up 9%, and equipment orders were
up 17% with particular strength in imaging and ultrasound. Orders have been on a positive trend in the U.S. since the
first quarter of 2014, and after the final fourth quarter results, we are more encouraged that this trend will continue into
2015.
Second is Aviation, which we feel is stronger. Spares orders grew 25% in 2014 and we are targeting high single digit
growth in 2015. Revenue passenger kilometers and freight miles continue to be strong and low Jet A should be a
meaningful positive for our customers in this space.
When you think about currency, we plan 2015 assuming a stronger dollar, but we've seen some continued strengthening
since the December meeting. Assuming the euro at today's rates for the entire year, foreign exchange would have a
modest impact, about $0.01 a share. So very manageable in the context of the total company.
In December, we also outlined our expectations for Oil & Gas with a backdrop of oil at $60 to $65 a barrel. Since then,
prices have fallen further. When we planned the year, we relied on multiple scenarios including a further fall in oil
prices. Lorenzo and the team are laser focused on executing against their backlog and their costs. The team is reducing
employment, executing restructuring and simplification projects to materially reduce their cost structure, all predicated
on a tougher scenario.
Additionally, across the company, we expect to realize some incremental benefits in direct material and other logistical
and variable costs as a result of lower fuel costs. Oil & Gas represented about 15% of our Industrial segment earnings
in 2014. We believe that within the context of the company portfolio, the potentially tough Oil & Gas scenario is
manageable and consistent within our framework.
With that, I'd like to pass it back over to Jeff.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Thanks, Jeff.
We remain comfortable with our framework for 2015. We expect Industrial EPS of between $1.10 and $1.20, behind
solid organic growth and margin expansion. Corporate costs will be substantially lower. Remember, we funded $0.11
of uncovered restructuring in 2014. In 2015, we will offset restructuring with gains. In addition, we should have the
impact from six months of Alstom.

Capital results were on track, with Synchrony timing the main variable. Free cash flow and dispositions are on track for
the $12 billion to $15 billion we spoke about in the year. And again, cash return to investors depends on Synchrony
timing, but it would be substantial if we do the split this year.
So closing the year and since the outlook meeting, the GE world remains balanced. There are always puts and takes in
the global economy. For instance, the U.S. is quite strong, which has a positive impact on businesses like Healthcare
and Aviation, and the price of oil has declined even further since December. Our job is to manage the company through
volatility. And while we see the potential for risk to Oil & Gas based on current oil prices, we're aggressively working
offsets through cost actions and positive opportunities elsewhere in GE.
We're also seeing stronger momentum at several other businesses. In total, this demonstrates the strength of our
portfolio approach. Looking back on 2014, out of eight Industrial businesses, three beat their plan, three met their plan,
and two missed their plan. But together we did what we set out to do, growing core earnings by 10%.
In addition, let me give you more insight to the plan I gave you in December. We have an internal plan that is above the
midpoint of the range I gave you. The business results that deliver that plan are embedded in our team's new incentive
compensation for the year. In other words, our leaders achieve their IC when we hit an EPS that is above the midpoint
of this range. Now I want you to have transparency on how we think about the world and manage our team. Our targets
encompass a thoughtful approach to the environment and a broad range of macro dynamics.
So let me reiterate. We feel comfortable with our framework. 2015 is an important year for the company, and we plan
to deliver for you.
And now, Matt, back to you and let's take some questions.
Matthew G. Cribbins
All right. Thanks, Jeff. We will take your questions now.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Thanks for the color. This is a better presentation than we've seen in a while, so thanks for
that. I know this is going to be really tough to answer, but it's going to be really important for us to try to ring-fence the
Oil & Gas perhaps the downside. Is there some sort of scenario analysis you could share with us, or at least a sensitivity
that if we are to off 35% on upstream, what kind of profit drop you'll see on that?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Listen, Scott. This is Jeff. Scott, the way we've thought about it, particularly when we
went through it in December with you, is we evaluated multiple scenarios, including a general expectation at that point
that we'd be down zero to 5%, but we evaluated scenarios that were down beyond that on lower oil prices. And when
we talked about the range with you of $1.70 to $1.80, in total $1.10 to $1.20 industrially, we included in that our view
of what those downside scenarios are.
So I think you've got to step back and look at it. Oil & Gas is 15% of our segment earnings in Industrial. Being down
beyond 5% I think is manageable within the context of the Industrial portfolio. And I think importantly, Lorenzo and
the team are laser-focused on driving the cost and the productivity in their business. And the programs they launched
were the programs needed to support a lower downside scenario than what we even talked about in December. So I

think we feel reasonably comfortable, as comfortable as you can be that within the context of what we've shared with
you that we can manage this inside the portfolio – our Industrial portfolio.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I think, Scott, I would add to what Jeff said just to say I think any time in our world we have
multiple hedges. We have a hedge inside the Oil & Gas business, driven by the cost action they're taking. We have
other upside of what lower oil prices mean inside the company, and then there are businesses inside the company that
are doing better as we close the year. And so I really – I think we've envisioned different scenarios for Oil & Gas, and
we still feel quite comfortable on the way we talk – the way we described the company in December.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay, fair enough. Because there wasn't anything additional, I don't think, that was said on
the call on Alstom, and there was a bit of a price adjustment we saw on the quarter, I think it was something like $700
million or something. Can you give us a sense? And I know you're probably five months away from close here, but can
you give us at least some sense of your confidence in the asset?
And given the new world that the offsets, you've got a better euro environment for Alstom, but on the other hand you've
got some North Sea oil headwinds. So can you give us just a better sense of your confidence in the puts and takes of
that transaction, and maybe a little color around the $700 million adjustment?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Why don't I start with the adjustment and then Jeff can...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Great.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: ...give you some color on the company. So effectively, there were several points within
the contract that were open to negotiate post-signing. We made a couple of adjustments. It's about €250 million more
that we will pay at closing. Part of that was a payment we're making at our request. The legal entities we want to
restructure and buy into, we wanted to change a bit for our benefit long term in terms of taxes and otherwise. And so
part about €250 billion was a payment to ask them to close differently from a legal entity perspective than what was
originally contemplated.
The second was we originally agreed to about a five-year use of the Alstom brand. We extended that in this agreement
to 25 years. That was about $85 million associated with that. And then there was some other very small items. I think
you'll hear Alstom talk about €400 million. They are counting about $100 million of interest that they contemplated
owing us on cash that they used over the course of the year. We never modeled that; we never counted that. So we see
it as about a €250 million adjustment to the purchase price, but we get a lot of long-term value as a result of that legal
entity restructuring.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So I would say, Scott, always puts and takes. The grid business is reasonably strong. I'd say
the Renewables business is consistent and also reasonably strong. I'd say the Power business is in a flat market, kind of
the same market we see. Clearly, the euro devaluation helps the purchase price. Other than that, the puts and takes are
pretty consistent with how we underwrote the business going in. So their year-end is in March and we don't expect –
we don't really have a change in closing date. We still expect, for the purposes of the plan planned on July 1 for
everything more or less.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the detail, guys. I'll hop back on.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Great. Thanks, Scott. Great.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: So to Jeff, you talked about a pretty limited impact from the dollar on your plan, but I'm just
wondering maybe if you could just address how the strong dollar and the weak oil price could impact the broader
emerging market demand for infrastructure? I wonder. Are you seeing any backlog or project deferrals as a result of
that?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I'd say there are multiple Jeffs here, Nigel, so you never know quite...
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. I don't mind who.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: We'll both answer everything. How's that? Yeah. Go ahead, Jeff.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Sounds good.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So I'll start. There's multiple dimensions to this obviously. My comment was at about
$1.15 and $1.16 we've opened up softer than that was morning. It's about $0.01 a share. We do hedges, we're not 100%
hedge; we hedge all of our transaction exposure to the extent we can.
We are subject to some translation and we do very short-term hedging around earnings in a quarter. So there'll be some
volatility associated with currency, but I think my point was that in the context of the company we're not at a point yet
where we think it's something that's not manageable across our portfolio.
We do have natural hedging, we have the ability in some of our businesses to move our manufacturing base globally
which allows us to take advantage of changes in currency in a couple of our businesses where that matters. We are
actively looking at our bill plan for the year to make sure we take as much advantage of that as possible. I would say in
the short run here we've seen very little that I'm aware of, very little impact on our order performance as result of
currency. That may play out more in 2015, but through fourth quarter of this year we've seen very little of that.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And then I would say on the – you had a multi – both currency and oil price. I think if you
took a tour around the world – look, our biggest market is still the U.S., the U.S. had orders up 25% in the third quarter
and 18% in the fourth quarter. So I would always start by reminding people that actually the U.S. is the best we've seen
since the financial crisis.
And then what we call rising Asia, Nigel, which is really China, India, ASEAN and stuff like that, those are actually
quite positive for us right now from an orders standpoint and then the resource-rich countries I think are going to be
mixed depending on what your cost position is and things like that.
So we still, I would say on an underlying basis, see pretty good kind of underlying demand in the Middle East, but
clearly places that are marginal producers like Iraq or Venezuela, things like that, those are going to be places that
we're not counting on much business in 2015. So it's kind of a mixed bag. And then Europe for us is flattish, I'd say if
you look at the organic and if the stimulus increases European demand, that's a good thing for us.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just switching to the mix in 2015 and obviously tremendous
margin expansion on services in 4Q. How does 150 bps look between service and OE in 2015 and how does the mix
shakeout on the 2% to 5% between OE and service.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Look, I think if you look at the – in 2014, I would say, product margins were flattish and
service margins were up. And look, we described to you guys – we described to our investors in December kind of an
extremely intense focus on gross margins and product costs and so our expectation is that that delivers in 2015. So
we're looking to get some OE margin enhancement in 2015 along with continued service enhancement. And then, Jeff,
do you know on the revenue mix?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, I would just say on the revenue mix the equipment service should be little less
impactful next year than it was in 2014. That's our plan. I think the gross margin focus that we have going, which is
particularly centered on product service cost, is driving at the OE margin.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Product and service costs. Yeah, yeah.

Thank you. The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Deane.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Hey. A couple of questions. First for you, Jeff Immelt, a
macro strategic question regarding balancing your framework priorities. And then I've got one for Jeff Bornstein about
truing up on tax and restructuring benefits.
So to start on the macro question, you're pretty clear you're in a volatile environment, but I'd love to get an update on
how you're balancing the framework priorities. You've got longer term big mix changes and could be near-term
disruptive to the organization.
And then meanwhile, you're on an EPS framework with a cadence of earnings, quarterly earnings. And I've always
called it a bit like trying to change a car tire going down the highway at 55 miles an hour. So how are you balancing
these big mix changes versus an earnings expectation for 2015?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: The best way I can describe it, Deane, is since the – I would say since 2013 inside the
company, or even longer, we've been kind of talking about and executing around this kind of mix shift that we've
described to investors. I think Jeff earlier in the presentation talked about the investments we've made in restructuring
in 2014 to kind of set us up for 2015 and beyond, which again, everybody in the leadership team is on.
So the way I would look at this, Deane, is on the Industrial side I think the teams, their world is in front of them. Their
incentives are aligned. They know exactly what they need to do. We've got Alstom coming in Appliances going out,
and that is – that team is laser like focused between Dave Joyce and Lorenzo and Steve Bolze, and those guys know
exactly what they need to do in this environment.
And GE Capital said, look, we're just going to make it smaller if we can as time goes on. We're going to execute on
Synchrony and that's what the Capital team is doing. And so I think you've got to look at it in terms of every team
knows exactly what their piece of how we need to execute here. There is absolutely no confusion on the Industrial side.
And financial services, we're just going to look for opportunities to continue to make it smaller. We talked about 75/25
as a goal, but we really run the place with that as an output function not an input function, right? We run the place to
execute well on our businesses and we think 75/25 is the output.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Got it. And then for Jeff Bornstein, maybe you can true us up on the tax outlook for 2015 and
restructuring benefits that you'd carry in and anything unique about the first quarter tax?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Sure. So on tax, Industrial tax we think is going to be, the core rate will be what it has
been, which is high teens. We will do the Appliance transaction. That'll be a high tax transaction, which will bump the
rate up to low 20%s for next year. And I think that's consistent with what we've communicated. The trend will probably
be higher in the earlier part of the year, lower in the later part of the year on Industrial tax.
On restructuring, same discussion. We're going to do restructuring next year. It's critical to delivering on everything
we've talked about. We've assumed the gains. The Appliance and signaling transaction will happen mid-year. We will
do restructuring in the first half of the year before those gains manifest themselves, but we still believe that for the total
year our restructuring and gains and to some degree the impact of mortality are all going to offset. We're not going to
be doing, today anyway, naked restructuring.

<Q - Deane Dray>: And what's the carry forward of restructuring benefits in 2015 from actions in 2014?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: About – what we've got in our makeup and our cost role is about $500 million. We'll get
an incremental benefit from new restructuring we do in 2015. As you know, we'll get partially depending on where we
execute those projects. But the carry through from I would say both 2013 and 2014 is about $500 million for 2015.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. Could you just give us a better sense of the detail around the gains that happened
within GE Capital in the quarter, just the major gains including as well as the real estate side but across the whole
business? And did the Norges thing come through, all that?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So I'll start with Norges. So we did close Norges. The impact on the quarter was just over
$300 million. The headline impact in the segment reporting in retail was the full $600 and that's probably because we
did the tax accounting earlier in the year that recognized the tax benefits for about half the gain. We reversed that in the
fourth quarter and the full effect of the disposition took place in the fourth quarter in the retail segment. So within the
fourth quarter about $300 million, $600 million for the year.
In addition, I talked about we sold the non-performing loan portfolio in our UK home lending business for about $0.5
billion. It had a very small gain associated with it, about $20 million, but a big deal for our UK portfolio. I talked about
$2.1 billion of real estate sales in the quarter that led by Japan multifamily that we sold. That specifically was about
$229 million. I think total real estate gains for the quarter were closer to $330 million. And that made the bulk of what
GE Capital gains were in the quarter.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, great. And then just maybe pausing on the order price profile for the quarter and
the trend line in some of these. So I know we've talked about Oil & Gas a little bit, it was down 20 basis points, and
Power & Water down 70 basis points. Are you seeing pressure in the existing backlog at all in terms of any kind of
renegotiation activity happening?
And also currency, are you also feeling any pressure? We talked about currency a little bit, but are you feeling any
pressure to use pricing to make up for any of the segments, whether it's Power, Healthcare, or Lighting, where you
might have broader international competition? Any of that coming through?
And then Healthcare I guess as part of that same thing, which is I know this is the business model to be down every
quarter and take costs down by more but that can't be a good thing for too long. So maybe some thoughts on that too.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So, Steve, here's what I would say. I would say most of the pricing impact that that we see in
the fourth quarter is more mix driven that anything else. For instance, in Power you've got most of the heavy-duty gas
turbine action is in the H. That's really is not in the base yet but those are higher priced bigger units. You get a little bit
more competitiveness on Aeros but not a lot to talk about.
Oil & Gas, we really haven't seen it yet nor have we seen – there's some initial letters and stuff like that on pricing but
no real action. I think that's all. Again, I don't think we've seen it in the fourth quarter. We haven't seen it yet but this is
early days. So I think there's certainly going to be chatter out there, so I don't really take all the stuff that's happened
necessarily in the fourth quarter as what's going to happen throughout the rest of 2015 I just think we have to be ready
on all fronts. And I would say no conversation at all around currency and anything along that yet. We'll see how that
plays out.

In terms of Healthcare, look, I think you're right. This has been the historical business model, but I also think kind of
what we're doing with Steve, with Jeff and Jamie and Dan Heintzelman is we're ripping apart the critical X's in gross
margins across each one of these businesses. And I think in Healthcare, managing the pricing is going to be a key part
of how we get enhanced gross margin improvement in that specific business.

<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: So just to make one thing clear, what were the impairments in the fourth quarter? It
shows total gains of $650 million in GE Capital. What were the impairments?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Hold on one sec. I'll get it for you. What's your next question, Steve, and I'll run that
down?
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: My next question would be another kind of detail question. Lufkin, specifically an
artificial lift. I mean, we've seen some varying reports on inventory destocking. I think PCP yesterday talked about their
oil and gas business implied down 50% to 60% in some of their – kind of on a quarterly run rate basis. It shows some
destocking. Did you guys see destocking in your artificial lift business, the Lufkin business?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Not yet, Steve. When you look at like revenues in the quarter were up mid-single digits in
Lufkin. Orders were kind of down mid-single digits. So not enough to read into. Again, a lot of this I think in Oil &
Gas is yet to play out, but I would say the fourth quarter was pretty much inside of our expectations for Lufkin.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Got you. And then just one last question just on cash, Jeff, just philosophically around
the dividend, you guys are kind of bumping up against kind of an 80%-ish type of payout ratio on the free cash when it
comes to the dividend. I mean, there's a pretty significant – it's a big dividend relative to your free cash flow. Is that
dividend viewed as – I mean is there a fine line here given obviously the location of cash makes that a little bit
complicated as far as moving things around and being able to pay that?
Would you – is there a fine line as a percentage of free cash flow that you don't mind going over Industrial free cash
flow and paying the dividend? And then as far as growth, do you view the dividend as it's a must grow over time? I'm
just trying to get my hands around how much you defend that dividend.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: You got $16 billion of cash on the balance sheet right now. We're going to do Alstom this
year. You're still sitting on top of substantial excess cash in GE Capital. Look, I view the dividend as being key. We
have capital allocation choices we make, we're going to continue to grow our free cash flow as time goes on, and we're
comfortable with where we are right now so.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I'd say, listen, we've been running it slightly above the 50% payout ratio. I think long-term
we expect to be slightly less or to above 50% payout ratio. So as we work through the pivot through 2016, we made a
conscious decision that we were going to run a little harder to our target payout ratio. But the dividend, as Jeff said, is
certainly a priority for us and very important to our retail base.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: And I would add, Steve, just something that – I just want to make sure people don't forget,
and that is look, the synchrony transaction is effectively going to be a $20 billion buyback whenever we execute that.
So that's another big capital allocation choice that's just going to be executed in a lump in a different way, but that's
quite meaningful to our investors as well.

<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Sure, and the impairments?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: The impairments, so as you would expect, impairments year over year were down
substantially, about $550 million. You'll recall in the fourth quarter of last year, in CLL we took the Momentive charge.
And we took a second charge on business aircraft. And then the big item in the fourth quarter of last year was the
GECAS aircraft impairment. So year-over-year impairments were better by $550 million pre-tax. In the quarter, we
really didn't have a lot of big impairments. We had one big impairment on a real estate property domestically for just
under $100 million pre-tax, and that was really about it of consequence.

Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you, gentlemen. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Hello, Jeff Sprague.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey, close enough, just a couple quick ones. I know we're running tight on time. Could you
just reconcile the comment on Lufkin orders down mid-single-digit versus drilling orders down 72%? I know obviously
there's a little bit more – a little bit of difference there, but that sounds like a fairly sizable disconnect.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I'm just looking at fourth quarter orders, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah. So...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Go ahead.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We report Lufkin separately from drilling and surface. Drilling and surface orders were up
4% in the quarter, so antithetical to what you would expect in this environment, and Lufkin was down 6% in the
quarter. So I would say generally if you look – as I went through the script, if you look at the orders for Oil & Gas in
the quarter, they're not necessarily what you would expect in this environment. The things you would think would be
stronger, including downstream and the surface related stuff...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Turbomachinery.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: ... turbomachinery were good to slightly down. And the things you would think would be
most impacted, the upstream stuff was a little stronger in the quarter year-over-year. So I think we're way too early.
You're not yet seeing an impact on behavior with our customer in the current order rates. That's to come in 2015.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. You did say drilling down 72% though right?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Drilling was down; surface was up. So drilling BOPs were definitely down substantially
but surface was up. We report it as one group, drilling and surface.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. And I know the H price is not in the index. But can you give us some color on how
that's pricing versus expectation?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: It's not in the index. I would say without giving away any real competitive information I
would say sequentially pricing is improving order to order.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay, and then just one really quick one on FX. Is the $0.01 headwind or so that you're talking
about for 2015 incremental to what you were thinking previously? And the reason I ask is you had $0.02 in Q...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes, Jeff. So what I was trying to say was when we did the framework in December, if
you look at that versus – I did that math at $1.15 – $1.16. The move in December from $1.15 to $1.16 for us meant that
we were working with a $0.01 headwind that we would figure out.

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: But again, I'd come back to there are other mitigants to a lot of this stuff....
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yes.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: ...as you go through the system. We're just trying to give you guidance...
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I'm not changing guidance in any way.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: We're try to give you guys the pieces because I think that's – we want you to know how we
think about it. But there are a lot of other things inside the company that we use to offset it, just like we did in Q4.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Right.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hi, yes. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Andrew, good morning.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hey. Just a question – two questions. So the first, part of the reason for creating Oil & Gas was
to actually to deliver to national oil companies in an environment like this. Could you share some of the conversations
that you are having with these customers? And how are you guys positioning versus the competition? And are you
seeing that your structure is actually making a difference? And from the outside, how do we know that it does make a
difference?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Look, I would say, again, there's not one size fits all. But I think clearly the national oil
companies look differently at this cycle than some of the integrated oil companies do. So I would just say in the case of
a company like Saudi Aramco, they're going to continue to produce and there are a number of strategies that are
associated with that similarly to a company like PETRONAS and things like that. And then there are other places that
are in more stress.
So look, I would just echo back, Andrew, to a comment I made in December. We like the Oil & Gas business. We like
how we're positioned in it. And we think these cycles give us an opportunity to pick up market position similar to what
we did in the Aviation business and in the Power business and other businesses. But short of going through private
conversations with customers, I can just say that we still think with a lot of the NOCs, and we're starting to see with the
NOCs, there's still potentially going to be some good business to be done in 2015.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just to follow up, what's the latest strategic thinking on energy management and the
progress that they're making?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Look, I think we're in a pretty good strategic position. This is a business where Alstom adds
some competitive capability and scale. And our pathway has to be one that gets us to margins that are more competitive
with the ABBs and the other players in this industry, and we can accept nothing less. So I think the way I look at right
now, Andrew, we're in it to win. We expect margin accretion and earnings growth year after year in this business. And
here's one where the ceiling is very high in terms of what we should be able to do in this business.

Thank you. The next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey. Maybe first for Jeff Bornstein, when you think about driving this swing from
down 80 bps gross margin this year to up 50 bps, how do you see that phasing through 2015 numerically? And also
where are you and Dan and Jamie at in terms of what you're doing to drive that?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: So right now, Shannon, we're doing very deep dives with each business. Basically – I hate
to get too tactical, but basically we're starting with the outcome and building back the project decks from there. So on
every element of product and service costs, direct material inflation, deflation, direct material usage, warranties, scrap,
operating cost per hour of our different facilities, labor, et cetera, building the project decks that support delivering at
each of the segment levels their share of gross margin improvement at the segment level, and that's where we are today.
Jamie, in parallel with that, is continuing to drive and support the businesses with the ERP, which is a big part of giving
them visibility and driving our ability to consolidate, et cetera. So we are in the process right now of building very
detailed action-oriented plans that have every dollar of cost between sales and the gross margin line owned by
somebody with a plan.
So that's where we are today. I would say this is going to accelerate throughout the year. We're early in the process now
and – but I'm quite confident if we get at it the way we have programmatically around SG&A, I think we can make a
big difference here and I think there's a lot of opportunity, as Jeff said earlier, particularly around original equipment
margins.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. That's great. Really helpful. And then in terms of just the U.S. Healthcare
strength, I mean can you give us a little more color there? I mean what are you hearing from customers and where do
you really think that market is and decision making is at this point?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah. So, Shannon, the only two data points I can give you is just kind of what we saw
which was pretty good. We don't have the market data yet so we don't know share and things like that, but we had good
products and good activity and we've got to believe that we gained a little bit of share. And then just I would say the
other data point I can give you is conversational, which is as I see hospital CEOs when I travel the circuit, you just get a
lot more positive in terms of their ability to know what the next few years are going to be like to do their planning, to
do their growth plans and things like that; and that didn't exist let's say 24 months ago. So we're guardedly optimistic,
but it's too early to call it a trend, I would say.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thanks. Just on the Healthcare business, you talked about how the Q4 performance
was something of a blip, but I guess the profit drivers down price and FX probably persist through the whole of this
year. So maybe talk a little bit about why you're so confident that Healthcare earnings are going to rebound?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Again I would say, Julian, on the under – the comment you made, this is, as Jeff went
through this his presentation stuff, there's always going to be concern about FX and stuff like that in this business.
Nonetheless the U.S. is just a big, powerful driver of Healthcare profitability, mix, things like that. And so when I look
at – when I look at 2015, that in addition to momentum we've got in life sciences and stuff like that, I think that offsets
all the other let's say headwinds we might see in terms of FX and otherwise.
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: I'd just – Julian, I'd just add I didn't – if you took it that way I apologize. I didn't mean to
describe the Healthcare performance as a blip. What I meant to say was organically the performance was better than
headline when you think about the impacts of FX. So – and I completely agree with Jeff, I mean when you – the
developed markets feel like they're getting stronger for Healthcare. We're going to have challenges in Russia and some
of the emerging markets, but the bulk of our – percentage-wise the U.S. is still the biggest single market we have in
Healthcare and we feel much better about the strength there than we have in the past.

<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then just the gross margin up by 50 bps, what are you including for price or
for value gap in there? Because I guess value gap was a decent tailwind in 2014. Do think it's sort of flattish this year?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, I think in our working construct for the year we expect value gap to be roughly
what it was this year. So we ended this year at about $300 million net value gap and $300 million value gap, and our
expectation is that that will likely be what 2015 looks like.

There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Cribbins, do have any additional remarks?
Matthew G. Cribbins
Yeah, thank you. Before wrapping up just a couple of quick announcements. The replay of today's webcast will be
available this afternoon on our website. We'll be distributing our quarterly supplement for GE Capital later today. On
Friday, April 17, we'll hold our first quarter 2015 earnings webcast.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Great. Matt, I just want to reiterate as we close the framework we've got for 2015 really has a ton of strength and
thoughtfulness in it in terms of the scenarios that we're seeing globally. So I would just echo that and just reiterate, we
talked about the new compensation plan that the leaders have inside the company. That really has each and every
business aligned to deliver right in a very effective way for our investors as we go forward, Matt. So I would just make
those two points in closing.
Matthew G. Cribbins
Thank you. And as always, we'll be available later today for questions.
