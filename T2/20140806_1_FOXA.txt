Also note that the historical results for periods prior to June 28, 2013, described in the press release and on this call
have been adjusted to reflect the separation that was completed at the end of fiscal 2013.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Rupert.
Keith Rupert Murdoch
Thank you, Reed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us today. I'd like to start with some
overall remarks, then turn it over to John to review our financial performance. After that, Chase will provide an
operational update, before we move on to question-and-answers.
Let me take a moment to highlight what we have achieved since introducing 21st Century Fox to you at our August
2013 Investor Day. That day, we provided a roadmap for how we intended to achieve industry-leading performance in
the first fiscal year since our separation. We executed well against this plan, tackled challenges and continued to be
focused on the strategic objectives we presented to you a year-ago.
Financially, we just concluded this past fiscal year with the strongest quarter of the year. Our earnings growth this year
has been broad-based. It has been driven by the themes you know well by now, strong affiliate revenue and momentum,
domestically and abroad, continued growth at retransmission fees and increased content monetization. Taken together,
it underscores my confidence in our ability to achieve our fiscal 2015 and 2016 targets, even as we continue to invest in
our long-term growth.
We are committed to delivering value for our shareholders, not only through earnings growth, but also through robust
capital returns. In that regard, yesterday, our board authorized a new $6 billion share buyback program. It is effective
immediately and will be completed within 12 months just as we have completed the $4 billion share buyback program
authorized last August.
We believe buying our own stock when it is under-priced represents a unique opportunity to maximize shareholder
value over the long-term. And at these levels, we believe our stock is severally undervalued.
We have had a busy year considering and executing many strategic transactions, transactions that will further bolster
our ability to drive long-term value for all our shareholders. We could not be more pleased with our recent agreement
to combine our European satellite television holdings to create Europe's leading pay television business.
With this transaction, Sky Europe will be poised for a new level of growth and with our 39% ownership stake we will
enjoy the benefits along with all shareholders.
Now, let me briefly address the topic of Time Warner. We made a formal proposal to acquire Time Warner, because
we viewed it as a unique opportunity with clear strategic benefits. However, the refusal of Time Warner's management
and board to engage with us to explore this compelling offer, coupled with a reaction in our share price that
undervalued our stock, resulted in our conclusion that this transaction was no longer attractive to Fox shareholders.
As you know, yesterday, we walked away. This is our resolute decision, which is why we formally withdrew our
acquisition offer. 21st Century Fox is an amazing company and our future has never been brighter. I'm deeply proud of
our businesses and confident in our ability to create growing value for our shareholders.
Over the year, our team of outstanding executives, animated by a culture of entrepreneurialism, commercial acumen
and creative audacity has delivered outstanding operational performance and earnings growth resulting in superior
shareholder returns. We look forward to building on that track record. While we remain opportunistic and nimble, we
are a strategically complete company and have a clear sense of where we are going.
To tell you more about our progress towards our goals, I'll now turn over to John Nallen.

Thanks, Rupert, and good afternoon. As you'll see in today's earnings release, we finished the year by delivering our
strongest quarterly financial performance, which sets us up very well to achieve our growth targets in fiscal 2015 and
2016.
First, I'll make a few comments related to our fiscal year results and a more detailed review on the fourth quarter and
finally on our outlook. For the full-year, total revenues were $31.9 billion, up 15% over year-ago levels, led by
double-digit revenue growth at the Cable Network and Film segments and the effect of the full-year consolidation of
Sky Deutschland.
Total segment EBITDA for the year was $6.72 billion, 7% higher than the prior year, this growth was driven by higher
contributions from all of the company's segments, with more than half of this growth generated by our Cable Networks.
Our EBITDA growth was achieved, despite absorbing a 17% increase in total company expenses, including our
investment spending in the new cable sports networks and FXX as well as the impact of the full-year consolidation of
Sky D.
Reported net income from continuing operations this year was $3.8 billion, or $1.67 per share. And this included $174
million of income reported in other net, this largely reflects gains on the sales of investments, partially offset by the
impact of the exchange devaluation in Venezuela.
Additionally, our full-year results include gains of $134 million from participating in BSkyB's buyback program.
Excluding the net income effects of these and comparable items in both years, adjusted earnings per share from
continuing operations was $1.55 compared to the adjusted year-ago result of $1.36, a 14% improvement year-on-year.
So, now let me turn and focus on the fourth quarter results. As expected, the fourth quarter was our strongest quarter of
the year, with 19% EBITDA growth, driven by a 17% increase in revenues.
From the revenue side, the increase by $1.2 billion to $8.4 billion in the quarter, led by a 38% increase at the Film
segment and double-digit growth at the Cable Network and DBS segments.
Total segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.77 billion, a $278 million increase over a year-ago. This
improvement was led by record Film segment contributions and double-digit growth at our Cable Networks, and this
was partially offset by lower Television segment contributions. Overall, unfavorable foreign exchange movements
reduced our EBITDA growth rate in the quarter by approximately 2%.
This year's fourth quarter reflected the recognition of various tax benefits, which reduced our overall effective tax rate
in the quarter and the full-year to approximately 25%. As we previously indicated, going forward, we expected our
annual effective tax rate will be around the low-30% range.
From a bottom line perspective, income from continuing operations was $966 million this quarter or $0.43 a share.
Making comparable adjustments to both years as we just did for the full-year results, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was
$0.42 this year versus $0.31 in the prior year, an increase of 35%.
Now let me provide some additional context on a few of our businesses, as it relates to their fourth quarter
performance. Let's start with the Cable Network, where total revenues in the fourth quarter increased 13% from last
year, highlighted by a 16% increase in affiliate revenues and 9% advertising growth.
On the affiliate side, domestic affiliate fees increased 19%, primarily from higher average rates, led by the RSNs, FX
and Fox News, as well as the benefit from the conversion and launch of our new channels FS1 and FXX. The
consolidation of the YES Network also contributed to this increase.
Our reported international affiliate fees were up 8%, reflecting strong underlying local currency growth of about 18%.
Fourth quarter advertising revenue growth at the Cable segment reflects domestic advertising increases of 12% led by
the RSNs and FX Networks.

At the International Channels, reported advertising revenue increased 5%; however, local currency ad revenues were up
15%.
Total Cable segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter of $1.2 billion was up 11% over prior-year levels. Our domestic
channel results were up 17%, reflecting continued strong underlying EBITDA growth at the RSNs, as well as the
impact of consolidating the YES network.
Contributions from the FX Networks were below last year, but this was expected, due to higher investments into FXX
and the timing shift and expansion of original programming, such as Fargo and Tyrant into this fourth quarter versus
the third quarter a year ago.
International Channel EBITDA contributions were up 12% on a local currency basis, led by higher FIC and STAR
Entertainment contributions. On a reported basis, the international results were slightly below prior-year, but this is due
to the negative impact of foreign currencies.
At our Television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $145 million as compared to $213 million in the prior year.
This decrease largely reflects 11% lower advertising revenues due to declines in general entertainment ratings,
particularly on American Idol.
Turning to our Film segment. We reported record fourth quarter results with EBITDA of $339 million, nearly triple the
$117 million contribution reported a year-ago. This quarter's results include several successful theatrical releases,
including X-Men: Days of Future Past, Rio 2 and The Fault in Our Stars. Quarterly results also include increased
contributions from our television production businesses, led by the syndication of Modern Family.
Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $146 million in the quarter, down slightly from last year, as growth at Sky D
offset the expected lower contributions of Sky Italia from Sky Italia's higher costs related to the broadcast of the FIFA
World Cup.
Year-end subscribers at Sky Italia of 4.725 million declined 30,000 from year-ago levels. Sky D reported 3.81 million
subs at the end of June, reflecting the addition of 360,000 net subscribers over the last year.
Now before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of comments on our cash flow and capital structure. We ended the
fiscal year with $5.4 billion in cash and approximately $19 billion in debt.
In fiscal 2014, we made a considerable investment on to our balance sheet for working capital and support of our
growth. And we are expecting a similar investment level in fiscal 2015, after which we expect our working capital
investment to normalize.
Subsequent to year-end, we announced the Sky transaction, which will have the impact of increasing our available
balance sheet liquidity by approximately $5.5 billion. And that's after factoring in the net cash to be received and the
removal of the Sky D debt, partially offset by the reduced leverage capacity from the elimination of the DBS
contributions.
A portion of this increased liquidity is being used toward our new buyback program. With regards to the buyback
program that we announced a year ago, we've now fully executed that program and bought back $4 billion of the
company shares within the last 12 months. Similarly, as Rupert referred to earlier, we expect to complete our new $6
billion Fox A buyback authorization within the next 12 months.
So finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2015, total segment EBITDA growth and our outlook for 2016. The
recently announced Sky transaction is expected to close during this calendar fourth quarter, after which these DBS
businesses will no longer be reflected in our reported EBITDA. Therefore to eliminate any confusion, as we provide
our EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2015 and our outlook for fiscal 2016, we are removing the impact of Sky Italia and
Sky D for the entirety of each year in 2014 through 2016. As a result, recasting the reported EBITDA for fiscal 2014,
the year we just completed, to remove the Sky contributions results on a base EBITDA of $6.29 billion.

As we indicated a year ago during our Investor Day, our growth in fiscal 2015 will be impacted by the continuation of
several strategic initiatives. Most notably, the continued planned investments into our new sports and entertainment
networks here in the U.S. and internationally, particularly in India.
Additionally, based on current rates, we are expecting adverse currency effects to impact 2015's growth, principally
from Latin American currencies. The combined impact of these Cable Network investments and currencies will impact
our fiscal 2015 growth rate by approximately 4%. However, the consolidation of the YES Network for a full-year will
mostly offset these impacts.
Considering these items and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are anticipating total
segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 to be in the high single-digit range, above the $6.29 billion
base level for fiscal 2014.
Again, this growth rate completely excludes the results of Sky Italia and Sky D, in both 2014 and 2015. The overall
growth in fiscal 2015 will be driven by our Cable segment, which excluding our DBS businesses, represented 70% of
our EBITDA this past year. This segment is forecasted to post high single to low double-digit EBITDA growth in fiscal
2015, led by contributions at the RSNs, Fox News and FIC.
This growth rate takes into account that Cable segment expense increases in fiscal 2015 will be slightly higher than the
17% we reported in fiscal 2014. These planned expense step-ups are led by our new sports channels, most notably from
increased event costs at Fox Sports 1, the unusually heavy cricket calendar at STAR Sports in India and the full-year
effect of consolidating YES Network.
Despite the absence of the Super Bowl on Fox, we're expecting the Television segment to post higher profit
contributions in 2015, underpinned by continued increases in retransmission consent revenues and higher political
advertising from the mid-term elections. And at the Film Entertainment segment, we're expecting fiscal 2015 results to
be similar to the very successful 2014 levels.
So overall, our company is well positioned to continue our planned growth trajectory in fiscal 2015 and to also achieve
the fiscal 2016 target we presented to you a year-ago. In our last earnings call, we confirmed that we were on track to
deliver the $9 billion in fiscal 2016 EBITDA target. However, now, as we just did for fiscal 2014 and 2015, we need to
recast that target solely to remove the impact of the DBS businesses.
At our Investor Day, we forecasted at least a doubling of the DBS segments EBITDA over the 2013 levels by fiscal
2016. So, removing that $850 million to $900 million of estimated EBITDA, relating to these DBS businesses, from the
$9 billion target, yields our re-casted target of around $8.1 billion and a growth rate over fiscal 2015 in the high-teens
percentage range.
The acceleration in EBITDA growth rate in fiscal 2016 will be led by our Cable segment's growth including the return
on the investments we will have made into the new channels.
In fiscal 2016, Cable segment revenue growth will be led by affiliate fee gains and expense growth at the new channels
will decelerate since our new stepped up U.S. rights deals will be in their second year. And there will be lower rights
costs at STAR Sports due to fewer marquee cricket events.
At our other segments, we remain comfortable with our Film Entertainment outlook and our 2016 target reflects a
realistic goal from improvement at the network and prices foreign currency earnings at current rates.
So in summary, we had a strong finish to fiscal 2014 and we have good visibility into our most significant growth
drivers, which give us confidence in our growth plan to fiscal 2016 and beyond.
And now, I'll turn it over to Chase for his comments.

Okay. Thanks, John. As is evident from the financial review, John just took you through, we feel great about the future
of 21st Century Fox as it is today. But before I get into addressing the progress we've made, I want to add a few
comments to what Rupert had to say about Time Warner.
First, let me be clear. We are done. We pursued this potential combination to achieve one overarching goal to create
value for our shareholders. It became increasingly clear that the combination of the drop in our share price and the
highly defensive nature of Time Warner's actions was going to lead to a transaction where too much of the value
created in success went to Time Warner's shareholders.
Second, this initiative was one of opportunity, not necessity or defensive concerns. We feel great about the future of
21st Century Fox. We have a great combination of industry-leading franchises, emerging growth businesses, and
international leadership. We're confident we can successfully prosper in a consolidating distribution world because our
powerful content and brands will continue to be the sweet spot in our industry. Our confidence in our future made the
thought of issuing our stock anywhere near its current price simply untenable.
Third, we have no plans to pursue any other third-party content company as an alternative to Time Warner. We have
created shareholder value with Fox by being an industry leader in building businesses, realigning franchises and
establishing leadership positions in brands and content around the world. One of the most important traits that
distinguishes us from our peers is that we are growth company. We build new businesses. We are market leaders in
areas of opportunity like the international markets. Our story is one that balances growth with an appropriate return of
capital to shareholders. We are already lean, so we can grow profits by pursuing exciting opportunities. There are many
opportunities for us to continue to build on that strategy and that will be our priority.
Finally, we hope this decision will reaffirm our commitment to building value for our shareholders. Our decisions in
recent years regarding splitting the company, simplifying the company through both sales and acquisitions, realigning
key businesses, as we recently did with the Sky entities and our increased return of capital to shareholders, are all
driven by the singular goal of increasing shareholder value.
Now a few comments on our operations; let me begin by adding a bit of insight to the 2015 and 2016 guidance that
John just outlined. We recognize that our projected earnings have a bit of a hockey stick curve to them. This curve is
largely due to our domestic and international new channel initiatives, particularly Fox Sports 1, FXX and STAR Sports,
which require investments in 2015 and turn around to be a tailwind to growth in 2016. The underlying growth of our
core business, if we exclude these new channel initiatives, is actually both stable and strong. Excluding these new
channels, we would have solid low to mid-level, double-digit growth in both 2015 and 2016. In fact that solid
double-digit growth would carry through into 2017 too.
Importantly, as these new channels continue to grow, it will provide us the long-term growth in profits that really
distinguishes us from our peers. We've made good progress with these channels, both in terms of distribution and
advertising growth and expect viewership to grow heading into fiscal 2015 as key content, like, the Major League
Baseball playoffs, U.S. Open Golf Championships, FIFA Women's World Cup and Sprint NASCAR Cup races,
premiere on Fox Sports 1 and the iconic Simpsons, with an excess of 500 episodes begins its run on FXX with an
expanded slate of original content.
At STAR Sports we launched our new Kabaddi League last week to great success with an audience 10 times the recent
World Cup and we have a lot more to come.
At our established U.S. Cable businesses, we continue to build on our leadership positions. For example, this season, 12
MLB teams on our RSNs have ranked at the top primetime programming in their respective markets.
At Fox News, we continue to see new shows like The Kelly File and The Five, grow to complement our established
franchises and become market leaders in their own right. The network shows continue to dominate the cable news
competition with The O'Reilly Factor, Special Report and Fox and Friends all remaining number one in their respective
time slots for over 100 consecutive months. At FX, we continue to lead the way with high quality, diverse
programming, like Fargo, The Strain, and Tyrant, which truly put FX in a class by itself.

Further underscoring our U.S. Channel strength, we successfully completed affiliate renewals during fiscal 2014 at or
above target. At this point, nearly 95% of fiscal 2015 and 70% of fiscal 2016, U.S. affiliate revenues are underpinned
by agreements in place, with the balance representing an opportunity to accelerate.
At our International Channels, FIC continues to perform well, despite the currency efforts John discussed, expanding in
particular, the sports business across all three major regions. Our ongoing strong growth at STAR India enabled us to
finish the year with our highest ever share at over 20%, driven by Hindi entertainment than our regional language
portfolio.
At our broadcasting group, we continue to be opportunistic in key markets, as illustrated by our recent strategic station
swap picking up two San Francisco stations including the market leader in exchange for ones in Boston and Memphis,
further optimizing our ability to monetize retransmission revenues and our NFL rights.
At the entertainment network, we obviously had some challenges this year, but we feel very good about the future. We
advanced key strategic initiatives like year-round development and event series and of a promising slate of new fall
series, including Gotham, Red Band Society, Empire, Utopia and Gracepoint.
More importantly, we're excited about the recent appointment of Dana Walden and Gary Newman as Chairman of our
new Fox Television Group. As creative executives, Gary and Dana are simply unmatched in the industry. Moreover,
the closer alignment of our network and studio will enable us to maximize opportunities for those businesses to work
together, while continuing to pursue business with third parties.
Business at the recently completed up fronts would best be described as cautious. We hit our targets in terms of pricing,
but overall volume was down. Many have asked to what extent this result was driven by advertising moving to digital
platforms.
Clearly digital ad spend is growing particularly in mobile platforms. However, television effectiveness is standing up
pretty well to the competition. The primary factor leading to lower upfront volume was the lackluster economy leading
advertisers to make the decision to rely more on the scatter market and keep dollars in their pocket at the upfront.
Consequently, if our programming delivers on its ratings potential, the scatter market is an area of opportunity.
Longer-term, we need to better monetize the expanding viewership on digital platforms. The move to seven-day
measurement and improved VOD experiences are a step, but we have a long way to go to better monetize this
viewership.
We're also thrilled by the recent success in the theatrical side. The outsized performance of small budget films like
Grand Budapest Hotel and Fault in our Stars, served us perfect complements to our global franchise films like Rio 2,
X-Men: Days of Future Past and most recently Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. We believe the feature film business
has exciting growth potential and we look forward to upcoming releases like Gone Girl, Exodus and our next
installment of Night at the Museum.
Finally, as you know, we successfully reached an agreement with BSkyB to combine our European satellite platforms
to create the continent's leading pay television platform. Each of these businesses is performing well.
In Germany, we continue to add subscribers and add new subscriber experiences. In Italy, we successfully renewed
Series A Soccer with expanded exclusivity, while continuing to achieve improved efficiencies and improving and
adding to the overall consumer offering. Nonetheless, we recognize there was an opportunity to take these platforms to
another level by putting them under one roof, hence the Sky transaction.
We are quite pleased with our 39% ownership in this platform and have no plans today to change that position. Our
focus will be on helping the platform achieve its full potential. In summary, we're immensely proud of what we
achieved over the past year and even more excited about the opportunity we have over the next two years to three years
to take our business to a whole new level. Our sole focus will be achieving that goal and ensuring shareholder value
grows with it.
Now, I'd like to open the call to Q&A or turn it back to Reed for that purpose.

Thank you, Chase. Ryan, we'd be happy now to take questions from the investment community.
Q&A
Operator
Okay. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you. It's a two-part question, I guess, on the same topic, and thank you for
addressing the Time Warner situation clearly. I think it would be helpful for your shareholders to hear what it was
about Time Warner that made it compelling to you from an acquisition or merger perspective, and why now, just to get
a sense of your thought process.
And related to that, use of cash. John, you guys laid out last summer leverage goals for the end of fiscal 2016, and with
the Sky deal, you almost made it harder for yourself to reach those. But, could you give us an understanding on how
you think about those targets now, and a multi-year framework for thinking about either buybacks or capital returns to
address that? Thank you.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Sure. And, I guess, in the first – I don't want to get too far into it, then again, I guess, I want
to be clear, we have moved on. So, I don't want to be dwelling on sort of a transaction that we moved on from, but I'm
happy to provide a little clarity. And, like, I think at its core, there were a handful of things that were compelling, and it
really was a unique opportunity. And, which is why, I wanted to be clear. This isn't a case where we move on to
another target. We really like our business, and we like our future and we like where we're at.
But I think what made Time Warner unique, and the benefits that came out of it, were a couple of things. I mean, I
think first – and I guess it sort of highlights rates. One, I think we've been clear, I think scale does matter. I think we've
got enough scale and we've got unique enough brands and content to navigate the world we're in, but I think there were
opportunities to further emphasize that by having, putting together the breadth, the brand and content, I'm certainly – it
would have been more with them in place.
I think second, there was real optionality that came out of the ability to mix and match the assets. And look, we've done
some of that on our own. We [ph] created Soapbox Soccer, Speed (35:00), and we turned them into a broad-based
general entertainment channel and a broad-based sports channel.
I think as we looked at the array of content and network opportunities, whether it's in sports or kids or general
entertainment, news, non-fiction, there are an array of places to mix and match content networks that we had – would
have had across that portfolio, that we thought really gave us opportunities to continue to build on that. And I think
importantly, all this probably would have been particularly true internationally, where clearly the markets are not as
developed.
And I think probably third is a little bit longer term that, there's no question, these businesses continue to evolve with
all these digital platforms as they emerge again here in the U.S. and overseas. The manners and options of which
content's going get packaged, people access it. That content gets monetized through advertising and the like, is all
clearly going to evolve and grow, and I think the breadth of what we would had would have provided a unique
opportunity to really create those next generations of experiences and businesses off the back of it.
Yeah, I think hand-in-hand with that, was the fact we thought these businesses were pretty good mirrors of each other.
This wasn't a tech company buying a content company, or two companies that weren't familiar with each other.

In many ways, our businesses look pretty similar. I think it gave us confidence in the ability to manage and navigate it.
And really, it did enable us to create scale in almost every place, whether it's a TV studio, a film studio, say the
entertainment networks, sports, kids, news, non-fiction, that they really were pretty good mirrors of each other, and
therefore really created advanced scale. And again, I want to be clear, we have a leadership position in scale. This just
obviously took it to another level.
So, I think it was those combination of things, but it really made sense, going to do it and pursue it in terms that
enabled us to create value for our shareholders. We like the hand we've got, and we're only going to do it if this was
enhancing value for our shareholders. And obviously, as we said, we made the judgment that wasn't going to be
possible.
So, we thought the right deal, the right thing is to pursue, and focus on the opportunities. And we obviously have been
focused. Like with the last month, we got the Sky transaction done, and we've made some senior management changes.
So, it's not like we haven't continued to build the businesses that we've got in hand, and that's always going to be
priority one for us. What's the second question?
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Yeah, just on the balance sheet and where we stand, so...
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I mean, I guess in some degree, I feel like it's a little bit, I guess we're going to be a little bit
like we're back where we were two years ago. And I think, probably, the guidance we gave back then isn't that different
in terms of what we think is appropriate in terms of leverage, cash and the balance sheet and the like. I think our uses of
capital are no different. And, I think, to the degree we can invest in organic growth or sort of opportunities that fit
within our portfolio, as Rupert said, I think we view ourselves as strategically complete.
And, I think, in that mix certainly return of capital, it's an important part of it. We've made the $6 billion – and we
recognize the $6 billion buyback does not unto itself get us to the balance sheet we've talked about.
And so, it will be an ongoing work in progress, and we will continue to address it as we go forward. But sort of the
guidelines we had before are really still largely the guidelines and we will certainly work and focus on trying to drive
ourselves to that place. But this does, obviously, create excess liquidity on the balance sheet, we don't know.

Comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks a lot. I think, John, in your remarks about the guidance you talked about, despite
the absence of Super Bowl, you expect the Television segment to post higher profit levels in 2015. So, just wondering,
what gives you the conviction that the Television segment can turn it around?
And what types of ratings performance does that imply for the broadcast network and sort of what gives you the
confidence that Dana and Gary Newman can kind of achieve those types of ratings requirements to get there? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I guess, yeah, I'll address it. I mean first, the entertainment network is not driven by growth
in the entertainment – profitability of the entertainment network. I mean, we have great confidence in Gary and Dana,
but obviously, this business is you build over years not months. We're excited about the year. I think we feel great
about the shows we've got in place.
As I said, we've launched a number of initiatives, but we're not expecting anything dramatic in terms of a turnaround
this year from a profitability perspective. I mean, I think our profitability in the entertainment sector is actually
probably down a touch. What it's driven by is – clearly, the political spending helps offset some of the Super Bowl
upside and probably first and foremost retransmission continues to be an increasingly important underpinning of

<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks. And then just, if I may, one quick follow-up on housekeeping. If you can give
us, in the quarter, at the Cable segment, domestic advertising and affiliate ex the impact of the consolidation of YES?
Sorry, if you did, but that would be great.
<A - John P. Nallen>: No, I didn't, Anthony. If you look at it that way, the affiliate growth that we reported at 19%
domestic, you'd be in the low double-digits ex-YES. And the ad growth that we reported at 12%, you'd be in the mid to
high singles.

Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thanks. I guess, following up some of the prepared remarks. Your approach on the Fox
side, as opposed to News Corp., has essentially been to build rather than buy. And totally hear what you said about
Time Warner being a unique opportunity, but it does sort of beg the question, as I guess, Ben indicated, what do you do
with the excess liquidity? Because you know that you'll always – from here on, it will be constant speculation that Fox
is a buyer of anything that could be for sale.
So, I was just hoping you could address, if you were interested in buying other assets, would the focus be more on
content? Do you think there's a chance to consolidate mid-size players? Or is the focus really just to build internally?
And then I have...

<A - Charles G. Carey>: No, I mean – I, guess...
<A - Keith Rupert Murdoch>: We build ourselves. If you look at all our base businesses, we've started them
ourselves and we're very happy with that. You said, we'd buy anything that was around. We're not going to buy
anything that's around at all. If there was something very unique but small, I don't know, I wouldn't say never, but we
have no plans to go out on the acquisition trail.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, and I mean, I guess I really would disagree with your promise. I mean, we had – you
know, as much liquidity if not a bit more a few years ago. And I think conducted ourselves pretty consistently. I mean I
think we believe this was a very unique opportunity to end up saying to look at it as a sign of sort of a broader strategy,
I just think it's flat out wrong. We think this was a one-time opportunity unlike anything else.
I think our actions over the last few years when we have had this liquidity speak to how we conduct ourselves. And I
think the fact that we felt there was potentially something here and in some ways, look, it obviously was a big
acquisition; but in many ways, I actually think at a level the core, this was building. I mean what you're going to have
with this content was really, a scale and a brand's content that let you build the next-generation of consumer
experiences in businesses on these digital platforms. Now, there isn't anything else like that.
So, I think, I'm not saying we wouldn't find – they're bolt-on advertisement – they're bolt-on things that fit within our
portfolio. We've had some opportunistic things that we've looked at, but they fit inside what we do and that's how we
operated the business. And that's how we expect to continue to operate the business.
And I think the fact that this one transaction, we've got presented a unique opportunity really shouldn't in any way
shape or form be taken as any sign of a shift and how we're going to drive these businesses, manage these businesses,
operate these businesses. And I think, I'd say, the last three years are probably a better sign of what we're planning to
do.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thank you. That's very clear. And then, just completely separately, you highlighted the
RSNs as a big driver throughout the call. Can you tell us what the length of your sports contracts are now and the
outlook for the RSNs the next year or two?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I mean, I think, on average they sort of average about 5% or 6% – actually, John thinks 7%. I
was going to say 5% or 6%, so it's a little longer. I mean, there are always a couple coming up, we're actually pretty
good at renewing them. We just extended the Cavaliers after...
<A - John P. Nallen>: LeBron.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: After LeBron arrived. So, we've got a couple where we're well engaged in now. Obviously,
we recognize complexity in navigating the space and there are places where we'll decide, it doesn't make sense for us,
as we did the Dodgers in L.A., but they're pretty long-term and I think we feel pretty good about where we are with
those agreements in aggregate.

you give us a sense of where you think things are shaking out and where they've come from?
And then, I guess, secondly, for all of you, how do you think about – it's been a year since you've recapitalized Hulu
with your partners. You've gotten a lot more traction on the programming front, I think since the recap domestically,
what's the international strategy for Hulu? How do you think about how you're going to use that asset internationally?
Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think, in terms – I mean, a reverse comp, I don't want to get too deep into the sort of really
what our discussions that we have with our – you know, I feel like the basic premise is pretty simple.
In the world, we're in today, and we've said it before, we believe you need to a dual revenue stream. And essentially,
we need to get a dual revenue stream from every household we deliver our content to, and our most valuable content is
the network content. When we have an O&O we can get the dual revenue stream directly through our owned and
operated station. When it's going through an affiliate, the affiliates between us and that – and the payment of that
subscription side of the revenue stream.
So, we negotiate with the affiliates upfront, what we think is an appropriate share, a fair share for us to receive for the
programming. We provide to them that they in turn go on and negotiate with distributors the character rights for.
And in this world, the type of unique content, certainly led by the sports content we provide those affiliates have an
increasingly disproportionate value, which is why we said retransmission and reverse compensation probably continue
to be the most undervalued of any of the content that is distributed in the marketplace. So, it's an ongoing process to try
to move that closer to what is fair value, though obviously we're nowhere near on a competitive basis, fair value for it.
In terms of Hulu, our focus in Hulu right now is domestic. Realistically – down the road, maybe, but Hulu went
through – put new management in place. Mike Hopkins did a really good job putting a new team in place with him. I
think he has really started to make an impact in the market, he seemed to be more active in the last set of months, but I
think his priority really has to – his priority in focus is to build – to really build scale at Hulu in the domestic
marketplace. From there, we'll see where it goes from there. But that is the priority of focus.
<Q - David Bank>: Thanks very much.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Thanks, David.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Ryan, next question, please?
Operator
And that comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Hi. Thanks. I'll refrain from the urge to ask you about liquidity and the buyback for the 20th
time. Let me instead start on something else, you've hit a couple of times, which was this notion of long-term sort of
digital opportunities and the changing consumption environment. And you've mentioned on your own, you have a lot of
assets to bring to bear. You just made a huge investment in the Simpsons. You have this growing platform of FXNOW.
You just talked a little bit about Hulu, which is a little separate.
Would love to hear your thoughts, with your own assets, how does that get monetized in the near-term? How does that
come together in the long-term? What is the pace of investment versus pace of growth? Now that you have dismissed
sort of the Time Warner aspect of that, how do you look at that from your standpoint going forward? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Well, I mean, I think, simplistically, it's quite clearly a work in progress. And the digital
platforms are going to be a tremendously important part of our future, particularly the mobile ones. And I guess
everybody talks about it almost like it's competing with us. And realistically, the content and brands we have are
probably going to be the contents and the brands that are most in demand on these platforms.

So, I think in an array of ways, we will exploit it. Some of it is through complementary experiences that complement
our core established businesses in some degrees, and FXNOW that complements what FX exists in places they can
move to be somewhat more independent. Certainly Hulu, which we have a piece of, is obviously much more
independent and autonomous. We obviously participate in it, licensing product to others.
So, it's not only owned and operated. Certainly, we have deep relationships with Hulu, Netflix, Amazon and the like. I
think we do those things with care to make sure all of those businesses can exist, but I think we see growth
opportunities in each and every one of those from ones that are extensions, ones that are more new platforms, platforms
that we own a part of, and third-party platforms that are all part of the mix.
And I think added on top of that, which is really part of this whole digital experience is, how do we really start to
monetize viewership, not just monetize – not just sort of through payment streams, but there's the question. The viewers
you've already talked about sort of what's happening with viewership? Where is it going? And mainly people are
watching as much of our product as ever. They're just watching it in more and more places.
And we've got to catch up with sort of the ability to figure out how do we monetize and capture the value inherent in
that viewership. And some of that's through measurement. Some of that's through technologies like targeting. Some of
that's through being smarter about advertising that makes it entertaining, native advertising and the like.
All these things were clearly, really, just at the start of, but I think it's all going to evolve. I think we need to
realistically compete and develop those opportunities, both in terms of the content packaging, the content experiences,
the types of content extensions that come off it, as well as monetizing all that viewership at every level. It's all
important.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Got it. I'll reserve my follow-up for another time. Save it for somebody else. I know we're late in

Comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I'll just do one. Chase, James or Rupert, I would argue that – and I think you'd
agree that last year you guys had scale and the year before you guys had scale. So, what's changed now that you think
you need more scale? Is it consolidation of cable, the rise of SVOD or so? Given the strength of your business, what
made you even search out even greater scale?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: No, we've made it very clear, and I thought I'd said it. We don't need more scale. I mean, it
doesn't mean there aren't opportunities created by having more scale. But we have industry-leading scale, in terms of
brands and content, and this was an opportunity to add a unique portfolio of those brands and content to what we have.
But we do not need – we've been very successful navigating it realistically. We continue to be highly confident in an
ability to do so.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay. And can you – with FS1, there's been some concern on FS1's first year, and you
cited all the new sports rights you'll bring up next year. How would you rate the FS1 launch, and at what point should
we evaluate it? Do we have to wait a couple more years to make a judgment on it?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I think, going in, I mean, and I think we said from the get-go, so it's not new, that
you've got to measure – these new channels are, look, they're hard to build. Things will go right, things will go wrong.
And it takes two years or three years to sort of build the channel.
And again, particularly when something like [ph] sportswear (54:09) and a variety of our – the core properties that will
be sort of a foundation for it, haven't even launched yet. On FXX, we haven't even launched The Simpsons yet. We're
still ramping up in terms of originals. So, it's all of what takes time. I mean, I think everybody I think forgets where Fox

over $1 billion a year. So, these things take time.

challenges of doing it. I think we feel good about where we are. But I think we were realistic going in where we
probably would be. Yeah, I mean, as I said, building a channel is hard work. We don't delude ourselves. But we've
made a lot of headway. We've built critical foundations, in terms of affiliate agreements, and continue to refine the
programming. So, we're essentially where we probably thought we'd be, and we feel good about the track we're on.

Comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thank you. Chase, you gave some color on the ad market. How different is the environment
between, say, domestic cable, the Fox Network, and TV station advertising from a demand perspective? And are you
seeing any relative improvement between the three?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I mean, there's always a little. I mean, there was some difference. I mean, I wouldn't say, it's
sort of at a high level, I would not say – I mean, I would not say the ad markets, certainly robust at any level.
In the summer, you're always in a bit of summer doldrums, so it's a little tough to really get too fine-tuned on the ad
markets when you're sitting in the summer. I think as you get into the fall, you'll have a much better sense of it. I think
clearly both cable and broadcast, from a volume perspective, had people keeping money in their pocket.
And I think locally, you obviously don't have the upfront dynamic in the same way. I think the local market probably
right now for the quarter, is tracking to be down a touch for the September quarter. A couple of the local sectors that I
think have been important, telcoms and autos, probably look a bit soft for the quarter.
But, you'd like to be a bit stronger, but it's okay. But I think overall, you'll find it certainly a place where everybody, I
think – I guess, I'd use the word cautious, and I think that's probably true. In the local, you get a little bit more sort of
day-to-day activity, with people – the upfront creating a little bit longer dynamic in the national markets, on both
broadcast and cable.

<Q - Michael Morris>: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions, just with respect to what you would have
acquired, had the Time Warner transaction taken place. And I think that's HBO and some national sports rights, both of
which were unique.
You addressed this a little bit before about digital rights, but HBO's clearly very unique in that it's a premium network
and also really probably has the potential to be an over-the-top platform as well. Do you see yourself investing in or
building organically a similar product now? In addition to what you have with something that's – a premium product in
something that could be a global over-the-top platform that's unique?

And then secondly, the national sports rights – obviously, the NBA comes up. It would have been something that
perhaps you would have been in as part of this deal does it change your approach to perhaps be more aggressive in
bidding for the NBA? Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I guess, in the first, in terms of unique content, I mean, yeah, I guess – I think the right way
to – I guess, respond is in two ways. I mean, in some ways, as I talked about digital, and look, we have a great portfolio
of content brands. And I think these digital platforms will evolve and will be part of it. It's determining how do you
continue to package and offer product.
I mean, in some ways, people have said, to what degree, is Netflix a different version of – you know, a version of HBO
without the linear channel. Hulu as it evolves, is it offering, an array of premium original content without a linear
channel?
And I think these digital platforms will provide an array of opportunities to package product. I don't think you'd start to
say – it doesn't mean, we're going to our goals and create HBO. But I think there are opportunities to take unique
product.
I mean, in many ways, look, FX, I think, probably is second to none, in terms of creating unique distinct product and
having a real established brand in the marketplace. And I think we will have opportunities, and we'll continue to
develop and exploit them, is how do you take advantage of these emerging platforms here and abroad.
Obviously, we have some unique strengths overseas and some unique businesses overseas that to build on, Asia,
Europe and the like. That will give us opportunities to develop and expand and build on new things.
I think in terms of sports it really hasn't changed. I mean sports, we've got the portfolio. I mean right now, we've got the
rights in place to build Fox Sports 1 and develop it and along the plan we laid out. We have the rights we need to be
successful.
I think we'll look at – I think as we should, we we'll look at whatever rights come up, and if there's rights, we think that
fits and we could reach agreement on that would increase the value of FS1, we'll engage on it. But we have a sports
portfolio that lets us fulfill the plans we had for FS1, so I think anything we add to it would be opportunistic to take it to
a further level.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Great. Thank you.
