MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to today's program. [Operator instructions] Please note today's call is being recorded.
It's now my pleasure to introduce Kevin Stitt. Please begin, sir.
J. Kevin Stitt
Good morning.
Before Bruce Thompson and Brian Moynihan begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does
contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results and that these
statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations.
Please see our press release and SEC documents for more reference.
And with that, let me turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce R. Thompson
Great, thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start on slide four as we work through the presentation.

We earned $0.20 per fully diluted share during the first quarter or $2.6 billion, up significantly from both the first and
fourth quarters of last year. The one item we want to highlight up front since it only happens once a year is
approximately $900 million of expense related to retirement-eligible stock-based compensation awards that we have
had in the first quarter for the past several years.
We believe first-quarter results demonstrate significant progress towards the goals we have discussed over the past
several quarters. Global Markets client activity drove improved sales and trading results versus the fourth quarter of
2012, while Investment Banking performance remains strong. Global Wealth & Investment Management [GWIM]
reported record earnings post the Merrill Lynch merger.
Expenses in most of our businesses continued to decline, although they are partially offset by higher revenue-related
incentive compensation and the impact of expense related to annual retirement-eligible stock-based compensation
awards. Capital and liquidity both continued to strengthen and are at record levels by most metrics.
The interest rate environment continues to be challenging, but moderate loan growth and reduced average long-term
debt helped stabilize net interest income versus the fourth quarter.
Credit quality improved in almost all products, and both consumer and commercial loss rates were the lowest in several
years. And we continue to make strides in resolving legacy issues, as we just recently reached an agreement to settle
three class action lawsuits involving Countrywide-issued RMBS.
On slide five, if we look at the balance sheet, you can see the total balance sheet was down from both the fourth quarter
of last year as well as the year-ago period, although total loans are up slightly. If we look at commercial loans and
leases, they're up 3% relative to the fourth quarter of 2012 and up 17% compared to the year-ago period.
If we move down to deposits, deposits were down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013,
although up approximately $54 billion or 5% from the first quarter of 2012.
Tangible common equity ratio was up 20 basis points from the fourth quarter to 6.94%. And tangible book value was
up about $0.10 to $13.46 at the end of the first quarter.
As you know, we started reporting under Basel 1, incorporating the market risk final rule this quarter. The change
added approximately $87 billion to risk-weighted assets. As you can see on slide six, at the end of March our Tier 1
common capital ratio under Basel 1 incorporating this change was approximately 10.6%, up from what we would have
reported had we incorporated the change at the end of last year. Under Basel 3, on a fully phased-in basis, Tier 1
common capital was estimated to be $131 billion or 9.4%, versus the fourth quarter estimated calculation of $129
billion and 9.25%m respectively.
I do want to bring to your attention that effective January 1 of this year, on a prospective basis we adjusted the amount
of capital being allocated to the business segments. The adjustment reflects an enhancement to prior-year methodology
and now considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to our internal risk-based economic capital
models. On slide 22 in the appendix, we summarize the adjusted allocations for you.
If we turn to slide seven, our global excess liquidity sources remained very strong at $372 billion. Ending long-term
debt did increase $4.1 billion from the fourth quarter of 2012, as we funded the January payment for the Fannie Mae
settlement and opportunistically accelerated our 2013 issuance plans. While we issued $11.5 billion of vanilla parent
company debt during the quarter, we still expect our long-term debt to decline over the remainder of 2013 as well as
during 2014. Our parent company liquidity remains strong at $100 billion, and time to required funding was 30 months.
We would expect to continue to remain over two years of coverage.
You turn to slide eight, net interest income, our net interest income increased from $10.6 billion, or a net interest yield
of 2.35% in the fourth quarter, to $10.9 billion, or 2.43% in the first quarter of 2013. If we adjust these numbers for
FAS91 and hedge in effectiveness, on the upper right-hand chart you can see that net interest income was effectively
flat at $10.6 billion, or 2.37%, during the first quarter of 2013. As we look at these results, we benefited obviously from
the market-related premium amortization expense. In addition, we also benefited from higher commercial loan balances
as well as the reduction in the average long-term debt as well as the deposit rates paid. Those benefits were partially

offset by lower consumer loan balances and yields as well as two fewer days during the period.
Let's move to slide nine and look at expenses. Total expenses were down from both the first quarter a year ago and the
fourth quarter, as we delivered on expense reductions in LAS [Legacy Assets & Servicing] as well as ongoing cost
savings in our other businesses from New BAC. LAS expenses excluding litigation in the IFR [Independent
Foreclosure Review] acceleration agreement were down approximately $500 million from the fourth quarter to $2.6
billion during the first quarter. This decrease marks the first quarter where the correlation between expenses and lower
delinquent loan levels is visible. Delinquent loan levels started to drop during the middle of last year. But as we had
previously said, there is a lag of one to two quarters before you see the associated expenses decrease.
LAS head count for March was down approximately 3,000 from December, while head count excluding LAS was
down approximately 1,000.
As we've said previously, we believe that LAS expenses ex-litigation will be at $2.1 billion or lower in the fourth
quarter of this year, and we feel like the progress that we made during the first quarter in getting to that goal was quite
strong. Excluding LAS expenses, litigation, and annual retirement-eligible costs, expenses in the quarter, or in the red
box on the slide, were $13.8 billion, an increase of $558 million from the fourth quarter of 2012, and down $920
million or 6% from the first quarter a year ago. The increase from the fourth quarter was due to higher revenue related
incentive compensation, approximately $800 million, which more than offset the impact of cost savings. We continue
to believe that we will achieve 75% of Project New BAC cost saves, or $1.5 billion per quarter, by the fourth quarter of
this year.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%, with nothing noteworthy to point out. We would expect a slightly higher
effective tax rate for the rest of the year plus or minus any unusual items like another UK tax rate reduction. This year's
expected UK rate reduction of 3%, up from the previous assumption of 2%, should be enacted in the third quarter, and
will result in a charge of approximately $1.2 billion to write down our UK DTA in that quarter.
If we turn to slide 10, you can see that credit quality continues to improve. Net charge-offs declined 19% to $2.5 billion
during the first quarter, which is the lowest level in several years. The consumer loss rate dropped 34 basis points to
1.7%, the lowest since the beginning of 2008, while the commercial loss rate declined five basis points to 25 basis
points, the lowest since 2006. Provision expense of $1.7 billion includes a reserve reduction of approximately $800
million, reflecting the improved trends. NPLs and reservable criticized balances also continued to decrease.
In addition, 28% or $6.4 billion of our NPAs are current consumer loans that were modified and are now current after
successful trial periods or are loans classified as NPAs due to regulatory guidance that was issued in the second half of
2012. Our loans coverage to annualized charge-offs increased from 1.96 times in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 2.2 times
in the first quarter of 2013.
If we turn to slide 11, we highlight the results of Consumer & Business Banking. Starting this quarter, we have
combined Business Banking and Deposits for reporting purposes. Pre-tax earnings for Consumer & Business Banking
increased 4% versus the fourth quarter, driven by improved credit costs as well as lower expenses. However, net
income was relatively flat due to a higher tax rate.
Average deposit balances increased 4% or $18 billion compared to the fourth quarter, driven by $11 billion of organic
growth and $7 billion related to transfers from Global Wealth & Investment Management. As you know, we
periodically move customers across business segments after an evaluation of how they can be best served by us.
Rates paid on deposits during the quarter declined three basis points due to pricing discipline and a mix shift in our
deposits. Brokerage assets increased $6.7 billion from the fourth quarter, or 9%, due to market appreciation and
increased customer flows.
We reduced banking centers during the first quarter as we continue to optimize the delivery network. Our mobile
banking customer base reached 12.6 million, which is up 5% from the fourth quarter and 30% from a year ago.
Combined credit and debit card purchase volumes had a seasonal decline of 6% from the fourth quarter but increased
3% from a year ago. U.S. consumer credit card retail spend per average active account increased 7% from first quarter

a year ago. Average loans did decline $1.6 billion from the fourth quarter due to seasonality and continued non-core
portfolio runoff. And as I mentioned earlier, credit quality continued to improve, with some of our credit quality
indicators at historic lows.
If we turn to slide 12, we address one of the two businesses within our Consumer Real Estate Services [CRES] area,
home loans. As you know, the home loans business is responsible for first lien and home equity originations within
Consumer Real Estate Services. First mortgage retail originations of approximately $24 billion were up 11% from the
fourth quarter and were up 57% compared with retail originations from a year ago. We believe these increases are
reflective of improvements in our retail market share. Consequently, we are adding employees to improve our sales and
fulfillment capacity, which is the driver behind higher expenses in home loans during the quarter. However, given
lower margins realized during the first quarter, core production income decreased from the fourth quarter.
If we turn to slide 13, Legacy Assets & Servicing had a loss of $1.4 billion in the quarter, a significant improvement
from the fourth quarter that was impacted by our settlements with Fannie Mae. The provision for reps and warranties in
CRES was $250 million during the quarter. The MSR asset ended the quarter at $5.8 billion, up slightly from the end of
the fourth quarter. Although we announced the sale of mortgage servicing rights in January, the accounting sale will be
recorded throughout the year as the servicing asset is transferred. MSR results, including hedges, were positive for the
quarter. The capitalized MSR rate ended the period at 61 basis points versus 55 basis points at the end of the year and
58 basis points a year ago. Results did include approximately $700 million of litigation during the first quarter of 2013
as well as a similar amount during the fourth quarter of 2012.
As you can see from our press release this morning as well as on slide 24 in the slide presentation, we did reach an
agreement in principle to settle for $500 million three class action lawsuits involving Countrywide issued RMBS. We
feel very good about resolving these exposures, which addressed original principal balance RMBS that exceeded $350
billion, or what we believe represents approximately 70% of the unpaid principal balance of all MBS as to which
securities disclosure claims have been filed or threatened as to all Bank of America related entities.
Servicing income decreased 17% or $182 million compared to the fourth quarter. 47% of this decrease was related to
the legal sale of MSRs in connection with the sales that we announced in January, together with other smaller MSR
sales. The balance reflected payoffs that exceeded originations in the portfolio, due mainly to our exit from the
correspondent channel in late 2011 combined with the seasonality and the timing of mortgage payments.
The number of loans in our servicing portfolio totaled approximately 6.5 million the end of March, down 866,000 from
the end of the year, due to actual transfers of approximately 570,000, and the rest due to payoffs. Sixty-plus-day
delinquent loans dropped from 773,000 units at the end of December to 667,000 units the end of March, of which a
third of the decrease is associated with transferred servicing. We continue to believe that our 60-plus-day delinquent
loans at the end of this year will be at 400,000 units or below.
If we turn to slide 14, Global Wealth & Investment Management had a very strong quarter. Earnings increased 25% to
$720 million from the fourth quarter and continue to set post-merger records in several metrics. The pre-tax margin of
approximately 26% was impacted by low credit costs and a higher contribution from corporate ALM activities, some of
which we would not expect to continue.
Overall client activity in the Wealth Management business in the quarter was strong across all categories. Client
balances were up $82 billion or 3.8% from the fourth quarter due to higher market levels and net positive flows, offset
somewhat by the net migration of deposits to Consumer & Business Banking.
Period end deposits dropped $26 billion, driven by $19 billion of net migration once again to Consumer & Business
Banking. The rest of the decrease reflected year-end seasonality, heightened by the fiscal cliff and client investment
activity, including long-term assets under management activity. Ending loan balances were at record levels, and
long-term AUM flows were a record $20 billion, the highest quarterly amount since the Merrill merger and the 15th
consecutive positive quarter.
Net income in Global Banking, slide 15, was $1.3 billion versus $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter and down from the
first quarter of last year, primarily due to higher provision expense due to loan growth and asset quality stabilization.

Revenue increased 2% from the fourth quarter, reflecting increased business lending revenue.
Asset quality continues to improve. Net charge-offs declined $117 million or 51%. Reservable utilized criticized
exposure declined 6%, and NPAs dropped 20% to $1.7 billion.
On slide 16, you can see corporate-wide Investment Banking fees increased 26% from a year ago, but were down
slightly from a record-setting fourth quarter in debt issuance. Per Dealogic, Bank of America Merrill Lynch gained
market share compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. And based on our reported peer results, we believe at $1.5 billion
in Investment Banking fees during the first quarter of 2013, we were a very strong number two.
Average loans increased almost $12 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by growth in C&I as well as within
commercial real estate. Ending loan balances continue to be higher than average balances, reflecting the momentum
that we saw throughout the quarter. Average deposit balances at $221 billion for the first quarter declined
approximately $21 billion compared to the fourth quarter, partially impacted by the expiration of TAG [Transaction
Account Guarantee].
If we switch to Global Markets and flip to slide 17, net income of $1.4 billion increased approximately $1 billion
excluding DVA from the fourth quarter, reflecting increased sales and trading activity. We did record DVA losses of
$55 million in the first quarter of this year versus losses of $276 million in the fourth quarter and losses of $1.4 billion a
year ago.
Total revenue ex-DVA was up $1.9 billion or 58% from the fourth quarter and was down 11% from the first quarter a
year ago. Sales and trading revenue ex-DVA increased $1.9 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by our FICC
business due to improved market sentiment. FICC revenue ex-DVA was up 85% from the fourth quarter due to
improved customer activity across all product categories. Versus a year ago, FICC revenue was down 20% ex-DVA as
market-making opportunities and credit products were reduced due to spread tightening being much more significant a
year ago than what we experienced in the first quarter of this year. Also contributing to the decline was a gain in credit
products in the first quarter of last year that did not repeat and a decline in commodities revenue.
In equities, excluding DVA, results increased 61% from the fourth quarter, due primarily to improved trading
performance and increased volumes in cash markets driving higher commissions. Versus a year ago, equity results were
up 8% due to increased client financing balances. Average VAR of $81 million in the quarter is down from $100
million in the fourth quarter and effectively flat with the year-ago period.
On slide 18, we show you the results of All Other, which to remind you includes our global principal investments
business, the non-U.S. consumer card business, our discretionary portfolio associated with interest rate risk
management insurance, and the discontinued real estate portfolio as well as the international Wealth Management
business. The loss of $867 million was driven mainly by first quarter annual retirement-eligible costs. The $1.7 billion
decline in net income versus the prior quarter was driven by the annual retirement-eligible costs and the absence of tax
benefits that were recognized in the fourth quarter of last year.
With that, let me turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Moynihan
Thanks, Bruce. Before we take questions, I thought I'd leave you with a few thoughts about the quarter.
As you can see on slide 19, we continue to work to stabilize the revenue streams and begin to build the strength to
driving the future. At the same time, we continue to work on the cost structure, both reducing costs at the same time
investing in businesses. Bruce talked to you about the 4,000 people we put to help drive our mortgage production and
1,000 more loan officer are examples. That in turn will help increase our profitability now and in the future.
We continue to see continuing momentum and driving balance growth across all our customer groups. When you look
at the consumer side this quarter, we were pleased with the growth in deposits, the continued stabilization and
profitability of credit card business, and the ability to continue to drive the mortgage activity, the production activity

the way we want to, up 50%-plus year over year.
As you see in our Global Wealth Management businesses, we have had a record level of assets under management
come in from our industry-leading business. And they had strong performance, including operating margins. As you
think about the commercial lending business, you can see both year over year and linked-quarter, we've had strong
commercial loan growth, as those businesses continue to produce strong profits for our company.
We remain strong in our Investment Banking revenue; as Bruce said, number two positioning, and we continue to drive
our position in that business.
When you look at our Capital Markets business, as you can see, we continue to show good profitability and a strong
increase from the fourth quarter. But we continue to maintain a low-risk methodology in which we run that business,
driven toward the customers we serve and making sure that we balance risk and reward in turn.
We still have a lot of work ahead of us as a company. We feel good about where we are and the progress we made this
quarter. We'll continue to drive the earnings forward to deliver the results that you expect of us and we expect of
ourselves.
So let's open it up for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] With that, we'll first go to the line of Glenn Schorr from Nomura. Your line is
open.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi, thank you. So good loan growth on the commercial and C&I and commercial real estate side.
Just curious. What kind of yield is that bringing – being brought on? And from what I understand, there's pretty
reasonable competition for those new loans. So I'm curious on how you balance the growth and margin pressure in the
markets.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning, Glenn. It's interesting. If we look at the commercial loan balances across
the platform, the spread on the new originations was actually up slightly relative to both the fourth quarter of last year
as well as relative to the first quarter last year. And it's interesting in that the loans that came on, not only were the
spreads wider, but based on our internal risk ratings, the credit quality of what was being brought on was also stronger.
So we feel like the loans that we're bringing on we're doing in a prudent way, and you can see that as you look in the
supplements that a decent chunk of the loans that are being brought on are international; not any real concentrations,
but both international, domestic, and really across all products.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Oh, that's great. I appreciate that. I wanted get -- on your thoughts on the expenses from slide
nine. I wanted to make sure that I understood. Should the starting point – being that the retirement-eligible is a first
quarter phenomena, is the starting point, the $18.12 billion (sic) $18.2 billion (28:05) less the $900 million or so as we
think about second quarter and then folding in the New BAC incremental efficiencies?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes. I think, Glenn, that's exactly right that that $18.2 billion included the $900 million
from the retirement-eligible employees. That only happens once a year, so you're right. As you go to the second
quarter, the starting point should be $17.3 million (sic) [$17.3 billion] (28:35).
The two other things that I would point out once again is that if you look at the compensation expense in the first
quarter relative to the last couple quarters of last year, it was elevated by about $800 million based on the revenues that
we saw within the sales and trading, the Global Banking, and to a lesser extent the Wealth Management business. So
we hope those repeat, but I would just highlight that that's a delta relative to the last several quarters of last year. And
then obviously, from that starting point, we would look to continue to drive down expenses based on the work that
we've spoken about with New BAC that we would expect to achieve throughout the year.

<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Perfect. I appreciate that. And you also mentioned your long-term debt's down $75 billion year
on year and you expect more maturities in 2013 and 2014, in the $20s billion, I guess. That's perfectly straightforward.
Does that include any adjustments for what's coming down the pipe with OLA, or do you just have to take a
wait-and-see attitude on what those rules are?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think we obviously are paying close attention to the different OLA proposals. I think if
you look at the mix between the Merrill debt as well as the BAC debt and you compare those dollar amounts relative to
risk-weighted assets and you compare us relative to our peers, at least all the work that we've done suggests that we're
at the very high end of the amount of debt and related instruments that we have relative to risk-weighted assets.
So the rules obviously are not clear at this point. We feel like we're positioned very well based on what we understand
the different proposals are that are out there, realizing it still is moving around. So as we go throughout the year, we
would expect, as I said, to continue to drive that footprint down not only in 2013 but throughout 2014. And we continue
to be very focused on that, Glenn.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Glenn, I'd add that there's also rationalization of the footprint. Remember, this was put on
by various companies, not by one company that we've been restructuring. So even if there's an amount outstanding, the
cost can come down because you can string it out. The rates paid are fairly high because they're different environments
than we've been in and expect to be in the next couple years. So there's even value even if you said the notional
wouldn't move as far based on some interpretation of the rules to get the debt footprint more rational, more spread
across time than it is today.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: All right; thank you both. Appreciate it.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Just to follow up a little bit on the fixed income trading results, obviously it can be lumpy
quarter to quarter, but it was down a little bit more than we thought elsewhere. You talked about some of the mortgage
areas. Was there a particular gain last year that was unusual, or is it just activity?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, as I said, we referenced three things. The first was that there was a gain that as you
look at that decline that was in the area of $250 million that I would categorize more, quite frankly, as a recovery than a
gain that we had highlighted during the quarter last year. So a decent chunk of that was a gain that did not recur.
Then I think it's important if you go and look at during the quarter what we saw the financial spreads, which tend to be
a fairly significant part of any FICC trading business, tighten significantly in the first quarter of last year and during the
first quarter year start to finish actually widen. So that was the second piece of it.
And then the third piece as we referenced is that commodities had a particularly strong quarter last year and did not
have as strong a quarter this year, so those three general things. I would say flows generally continued to be very
strong. And as you look at where we were relative to the fourth quarter last year, actually think we continue to make
good progress, but it was a little lumpy in the first quarter last year.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: yeah, and, Matt, I'd add that as you think about how we're running the Global Markets
business, if you look at our VAR and our risk taking, we're keeping a balance relative to the rest of the company. And
so there will be times when people do better than we are and times when we'll do better than them, but we're keeping a
balance.

The second thing that Tom Montag and team worked on is on the expense side. So you can see the operating leverage
when you look across the first quarter last year, this year and importantly the fourth quarter of last year to this year.
You can see that with a little bit of revenue you generate a lot more profit. And so the idea is we're keeping this
business so that we can make good money at a $3 billion – some money at a $3 billion trading revenue level in the
aggregate in the business and a lot of money at a $5 billion level, and you're seeing that play out. So if you think about
it, we made money I think every trading day of the quarter. The VAR was down. And so I think we should be careful to
think we may not roar as much as some other people might because this is one of many businesses we have, and we
drive it for the benefit of the investing customers and also the issuing customers.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay; thanks. That's helpful. And then just separately in terms of your capital actions, I
think many were positively surprised by the CCAR Fed approval for buybacks for both common and preferred. Just
any commentary in terms of the pace of the common share repurchase, and on the preferred side the timing of that; and
do you have to issue any to replace what you're calling?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: yeah, two things on that. The first is, as you probably saw, I believe on April 1, we
actually went ahead and issued the redemption notices for the $5.5 billion of preferreds that are outstanding. It's just
under $500 million of preferred dividend savings that we'll have on that, and there was no requirement to issue to
replace that. So as you look at that redemption, that's a good redemption where you can look at those savings.
As it relates to the common, we'd expect to be balanced and work through the share repurchase throughout the year,
and really don't have much more to comment on than that.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, thank you very much.

We'll move next to the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Your line is open.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Thank you, Bruce and Brian, for taking my call.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Hi.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Bruce, a quick question. In the release, you talk about – and we've gone through expenses
in terms of the stock compensation, if you will, in the quarter and also higher first quarter compensation related to
revenues, and you can back that out and see what the run rate is for the second quarter. But you also mention that you
expect to achieve $1.5 billion in cost saves per quarter by fourth quarter of 2013 related to Project New BAC.
How do I account for that third piece of the pie? I know there's stock compensation in the quarter. I know the overall
compensation being high because of revenues. How do I account for New BAC and getting to a run rate of second
quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. So what we've said – it's good question -- we've said that at the end of 2012 on a
quarterly basis, we had achieved $900 million per quarter of New BAC cost saves at the end of – or in the fourth
quarter of 2012. So as you look to adjust your models, we will take that $900 million a quarter that we would have had
in the fourth quarter, and that will grow to $1.5 billion by the fourth quarter of 2013. Some of that we achieved during
the first quarter, and we'd expect to continue to achieve that throughout the year.
And then the second piece outside of the more one-timers that we talked about in the first quarter were the LAS
expenses, where we've said we'll get that number below $2.1 billion by the end of 2013. And we obviously got that
from $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter down to $2.6 billion. So in addition to those compensation-related items, we've
got those two levers to continue to drive expenses down during the balance of the year.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: And just to be clear, the $1.5 billion of New BAC by fourth quarter 2013 -- what are the
cost saves running in this quarter on New BAC, so the delta I can gauge?

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We've not given an exact number. I think what you should do is if you go back to slide
nine and look at the red bar, we've said that there was $800 million of increased incentives in that $13.8 billion. That
gets the number down to $13 billion. You should assume that part of the benefit between $13.3 billion and $13 billion
related to New BAC, but we've not given an exact number.

And we'll go next to the line of Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisory Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Meredith A. Whitney>: Hi, good morning. I just wanted some commentary on sequencing of litigation reserves
and what has already been factored in, in terms of the bulk of litigation settlements and then what's on the horizon.
Thanks.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's a good question. One of the things, and I'm going to walk through the different pieces
as it relates to overall litigation as well as the rep and warrant, and I'd ask you to flip back to slide 23 where we lay this
out. And I think one of the things, Meredith, that we feel very good about the progress during the quarter is if you walk
through what we've laid out on the bottom of page 23, if we start with the reps and warrants, between the settlements at
the beginning of 2011 as well as the Fannie settlement that we had at year end, you can see that, as we lay out here,
we're generally through the GSE exposure as it relates to rep and warrant.
You then go down to the monolines. There are three significant monolines that we did business with, five in total. We
obviously have had previous settlements with two of those three monolines. The one that obviously gets a lot of press is
MBIA that continues to be out there.
You then go down to the private label rep and warrant. And obviously the most significant piece of that is the Gibbs &
Bruns settlement that we'll work through – continues to work through the court process. And we would expect the
outcome of that to be during the third quarter of this year. So as you look at reps and warrants, we're through a
significant portion of that.
We then – if you then flip to the securities litigation, which is the other significant piece of the litigation expense, one
of the reasons that we think the settlement that we announced today was significant is, as I referenced, if we look at the
original unpaid balance company-wide of all of the securities that were underwritten, this settlement today relates to
company-wide about 70% of that. So I don't think anyone is going to ever at this point declare complete victory. We do
think that between the Fannie and related settlements and the look-back in the fourth quarter as well as the settlement
that we've announced today that we're moving through in a pretty meaningful way this pipeline of items.
<Q - Meredith A. Whitney>: Got it, thanks. That seems to be the big question for investors. Thanks so much.

We'll move next to the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, thanks. Bruce, just following up on that, you have on that same page the range of
possible loss above additional accruals of up to $4 billion. There were some concerns that some of the recent legal
decisions in the monoline cases, particularly around the causation issue, might have impacted your estimates there, and
it doesn't look like it did. Can you tell us why that hasn't changed any of your outlook on that RPL [Range of Possible
Loss] number?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. Once again, the RPL that we have within the rep and warrant will continue to be up
to $4 billion, as we've said before. We cover at this point – given we don't have repurchase history with the monolines,

the monolines are covered within our litigation reserves, and we have both litigation reserves as well as range of
possible loss for litigation. And you should assume that there was some additional monies during the quarter in
litigation expense that was set aside for the monolines.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then you noted that the settlement that you announced today covers 70%
of issuance on which claims have been made. Is that what you said?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Not only – claims or threatened claims, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it. So where does that leave some of the higher profile government suits like
FHFA [Federal Housing Finance Agency] and some of the things that we know about?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The two most significant that are out there on the securities litigation that have been more
public would be FHFA as well as AIG.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And on the Gibbs & Bruns, the final hearing is in late May. I guess the
deliberations could extend for a few months after that. Do you have any idea? I guess you said third quarter. Do you
hope to get the final resolution in the third quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's our best sense. Far be it from us to forecast that process, but our best estimate, to
your point, would be the third quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then switching gears on the net interest income, Bruce, do you expect
maybe to do better than the core $10.6 billion now that you have a little bit of loan growth and then day count, or do
you expect to stay on that level?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think at this point, where we've guided is we've said that with the work that we've done
that ex any market-related impacts that $10.5 billion is a good starting point. That number can bounce around, but I
would continue to look at that $10.5 billion in the near term as the right starting point.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, and how about on credit costs? You had a nice move down this quarter. Do you
still have capacity to take the reserves down further? And do you expect the provision to make further progress below
the $1.7 billion that you did this quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's a good question, John. I think as we look at the charge-offs and the move in
charge-offs, to have almost a 20% decline in charge-offs I think speaks to the quality of the portfolio and the work that
we've said had been done back in late 2008 and early 2009 as it relates to consumer underwriting. We've previously
said that as we look at provision, charge-offs will come down about the time that the releases also come down to get
you to a level between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion. If you look at what we experienced this quarter and with what
we're seeing at the trends, it clearly feels like we'll be at the low end of that going forward.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yes, this quarter you were below the range, right?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: So are we setting a new range, or do you still think we should think about that range
of $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I would think about it at the bottom of the range at this point.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then...
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And, John, this is clear; it's all about the home finance side now. You see the credit card
business continues to make some incremental improvement. But this made a dramatic improvement from the high

points going back several quarters. But it's really about mortgages and everything you hear about in the market that
we're witnessing in our portfolios in terms of how price improvement activity levels continue to – will bear well on that
as we look forward, obviously.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, one more thing, Bruce. On the revenue side, the servicing – mortgage servicing
revenues seemed to take a step down from MSR sale. What should the cadence of that be going forward? Is part of the
decline built in from the phased-in sale?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes, I think what we've said is that roughly – I think it was roughly $90 to $100 million of
the decline in servicing revenue was the result of the sales. We've said that we think as we get to the end of the year
that sales will ultimately lead to a reduction in revenues of about $200 million related to the MSR sales. We obviously
had a fair bit of that given that a decent chunk of the performing sales had an effective close date on January 31. So
we've clearly taken a piece of that, and there's probably another $100 million a quarter to come relating those sales by
the end of this year. Obviously, as you look at, and we tend not to just look at the revenue number, but we look at the
contribution from a pre-tax perspective. And obviously, as you see the work that we're doing within legacy assets and
servicing, we continue to think that the opportunities there are significant.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And one more follow-up. How do you guys think about the ultimate target of MSR
size and maintaining a balance between origination and servicing in the mortgage business for when rates eventually
rise?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think as we look at this point, the MSR balance was roughly $5.8 billion at the end of
the first quarter. If we were to pro forma those sales throughout the year, assuming rates stay where they are, it gets you
down to about a $5 billion number from an overall capital perspective. Plus or minus, that feels about right. Obviously,
any change from that is going be a function of the opportunity to originate things that makes sense versus any type of
accelerated prepayments that may or may not happen. But I think $5 billion from an MSR balance perspective is not a
bad number to be looking at.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: John, on the origination side, the first order of business was to – after we got out of the
correspondent business was to get the business on an upward trajectory. If you go back and look, starting the fourth
quarter of 2011, we've basically grown retail originations quarter after quarter after quarter. And this quarter again, we
had another 15%-odd off the fourth quarter last year. But if you actually look at the head count you see on the page,
remember we've got 1,000-plus loan officers working this quarter that weren't here last year. They're trained and
getting up to speed on their closing rate. So the next order of business is how to overcome the [ph] heart grief (47:54)
financing levels, which we have in the portfolio and get the core run rate. So there's no cap on us in terms of retail
origination. We'll do as much as we can do for clients, and you've seen us drive it forward every quarter. And now we
have more people, more trained. We're up to speed, 4,000 more people in the fulfillment area, and we don't see the
pipeline slowing down.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, thank you.

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So in Wealth Management, just hoping to dig in. You guys highlighted a couple things that
helped the margins get a bit higher, which it seems they're going to repeat. About how much of a tailwind were those
items? And if we were looking ex – how much of – it seems as though maybe we might have an updraft anyway
because we were looking at a 500 basis point increase year over year and quarter over quarter?

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes, a couple things. If you look at the – we talked about credit costs. Credit costs I think
within the business, there was roughly a $30 million reserve release during the quarter that we wouldn't assume is
necessarily going to continue. But I think if you look at overall pre-tax margin, we've been in the 20% – 21% area. This
quarter was 26%. I think the assumption going forward is that we'll clearly be north of the 21%, but I wouldn't expect
that in the near term we run at 26% either.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure, sure. I think you also highlighted the ALM as a tailwind too. Is there any way to
quantify that? And can you – forgive the potentially ignorant question. But can you help me understand the mechanics
of how ALM will run through GWIM?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes, I would say that the easiest way to look at it is if you look at deltas, we had some of
the market-based benefits that we quoted that were roughly $300 million during the quarter. A portion of that gets
allocated to GWIM. And if you look at the GWIM business, you can see that the net interest income was up about $100
million. So I'll give you those pieces of data, but we're not going to quote exact numbers as to how we allocate that out,
but it's a piece of that.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, that helps. Thanks, guys. And then last one, and sorry, it's a little bit technical. On the
NPAs I guess you guys had said that 20% were from mods or regulatory requirements, and we've run through the
regulatory requirements before. I'm just hoping to understand on the mods. It was my understanding that after about six
months of payments, the TDRs [Troubled Debt Restructurings] are reclassified as current. Do you guys account for
TDRs differently than that, or can you help me maybe understand how that works?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, you're exactly right that once a borrower goes through the trial mod period and gets to
a permanent mod, they need to be current for six months before we would look to bring those back in. And when you
consider that number, realize that coming out of the national mortgage settlement there was heightened modification
activity during the third and fourth quarters in particular of last year. So we clearly would expect some of those to cross
the six-month period during the second quarter. But realizing if you go back to I believe it was the third quarter when
we adopted the regulatory guidance, the biggest of that $6 billion-plus north of $4 billion that is the regulatory guidance
that was given. So that's going be the bigger piece of the two things.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, thanks. That helps.

<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: A couple questions, one on mortgage. You indicated in the past that you were interested
in increasing the mortgage origination share, and you've done that. I'm just wondering how close you are to where you
want to be, or are you still in the process of building out what capacity you want to have there?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: As you can see, Betsy, on the page, you can see that the mortgage loan officers are up
about 1,000 year over year. We are still adding as we speak. The success of putting them into the branch environments
where you have the mortgage loan officer and FSA, the personal bankers, is multiples of the success in other branch
environments, and so we're just driving at that. So I don't have – the pipeline is still as strong as it has ever been. We
have thousands of people to get them closed on time, and we're still working our tail off to get mortgage loans closed
on time. I don't think, obviously, there's any cap on where this could go. We still have tremendous opportunity with our

client base that are unserved people. Our clients go elsewhere to get their mortgages.
So you've seen it drive up 50%-plus year over year plus, another $3 billion increase in quoting production fourth
quarter to first quarter. So I challenged the team; they've got to outrun the HARP at some point because that will die
off, although it's been extended. But just I wouldn't tell you there's any sort of cap. I think we should be able to drive it
up to more of our natural share in things like deposits and stuff, which is more than the 10% level over time.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Right. Okay, so go from 4% a couple quarters ago up to 10% to 12%?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes, but this could take time. We're talking about – we've been about 0.2% increase in
market share each quarter, so this is a lot of activity. But $24 billion of retail production, we're in the top couple there,
top two or three. And our view is we ought to be able to push that forward.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: And so two follow-ups on that, one is on HARP you mentioned. How much of
production right now is HARP and how much HARP is in your footprint, your client base that you haven't done yet?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes, if we look at both combined MHA and HARP, that's just under 50% of the total for
the quarter.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. And what's left in your client base to do that you haven't done yet? How many
more quarters of this do you think you have?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think I would say generally that there was more of it this quarter than we probably
would have thought coming into the year. We're hesitant to give an exact number. But as Brian referenced, I would say
overall pipeline and activity as we went through the first quarter continued to be very strong.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I'd expect that component though is probably at a strong point right now and would come
down over the next three or four quarters just because, frankly, as we sell some of the servicing that some of that
opportunity goes away. That was part of the transaction value that we got. But the key is, if you look at the non-HARP
type production, the non-HARP type production, making homes affordable production, you're seeing that grow at a
faster rate.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay, and you're just HARP-ing your current portfolio set; you're not going after other
people's. You have enough to do with your own portfolio.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We've got enough to do with our own portfolio.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Right, okay. And then just separately, on page six you go through the regulatory capital.
Could you just remind us what your expectation is for RWAs going forward, passive mitigation, active mitigation?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. Yes, I'd say generally throughout the quarter with some of the growth that we've
seen, and I assume you're referring to Basel 3, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Correct.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think we continue as we go through over the next couple quarters, we'd just say what
we've continued to say, which is that with where we are from a DTA perspective as we go forward, pre-tax should be
the way that generally we're creating capital. And I think as it relates to different mitigation opportunities, the biggest
thing that we see out there is that as home prices continue to move up and we continue to see the home equity portfolio
amortize, which has been about $3.5 billion a quarter, that there's a fairly significant tailwind as it relates to reductions
in risk-weighted assets there.
As we go forward, the runoff of the structured credit portfolio that we have, we would expect to accelerate as we go
into 2014, 2015, and 2016, and that will obviously be gone by the end of 2017, so that's an opportunity. And then the
third thing I would say is that we continue to work through – you can see we made progress on the private equity
portfolio this quarter and we'll continue to wrap that up. But the biggest item as we go forward is just going be the
pre-tax income line. But I do think that there will continue to be other opportunities to drive that as well.

<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: And the runoff of the structured credit, how much is that right now?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We've not given an exact number that we would expect that to run off, but you should
assume it's north of $20 billion of risk-weighted assets.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Today in 1Q.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. And then the last question is on how you get to the $5 billion ask that you had for
CCAR that got approved. Because with a 9.4% common Tier 1 ratio 1Q 2013 and these RWA mitigation opportunities
coming going forward, clearly you must know going into it you were going to be well above the 8.5% FSB minimum
that's out there and that you'd be approaching the 10% high end of the range scenario that people in businesses like
yourself have targeted. So I'm just wondering how you got to $5 billion and how we think about capital ask going
forward?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. I think and, Betsy, as we've spoken, I think there are three different metrics and
ways that you get to looking at capital allocation and capital return. The first is obviously where your ratios are after
stress through the CCAR process. And as you look at the results that we had, we ended up just above 6% after our ask,
which relative to our peers we think positioned us well. The second item which, is you referenced, you move to Basel
3. And we feel like we've done a very good job on Basel 3 and, to your point, are above the minimums, above buffers,
and feel like we've done a good job there. And then the third, which is what you've heard us talking a lot about, is just
driving the core earnings as the third component. And so we balanced all of those three.
And I guess the other thing I'd say is you look at the ask that, obviously, we've got $5 billion that will get returned to
the shareholders based on our plans. But I don't think you should also minimize though the other $5.5 billion that will
go to redeem preferred stock because that preferred stock had coupons between 8% and 8.625%. It's not tax deductible
and we're not replacing it with other preferred stock.

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: A couple questions for you on retail. You've closed I think 262 branches, if I'm looking at
the numbers correctly, over the past year. Can you tell me how that number looks for the coming year and if there is
some "optimal" number of branches that you want to maintain?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So I think that we were clear that a few quarters ago we said we'd do the 750. And I'd say
that's assuming, Nancy, we're at 750. And I think we're – you can see that that number is close to 5,000. So think about
that as 5,400-odd getting down to 5,000. The point was at the time we did an optimization thought process, looked at it
with the customer behavior and got that number, and we're visibly doing that in a very thoughtful way so that we retain
a lot of customers, especially on the consolidation side. And then also obviously, as you know, Nancy, we have exited
some of the markets and sold the community banks where they can get the leverage in the operations that we can't get
in some of those markets.
So the question of what happens next I think is probably a question that we take up as we get into 2014 and think about
what the customer behavior change has been because we're seeing a fairly strong change in the behavior of the
customers, evidenced by the mobile volumes. And so not only do we have the number of mobile customers goes up
about 10,000 a day to 12.6 million, it's also what they do. So 100,000 checks a day get deposited by people taking

pictures of them type of numbers. And so that behavioral change we've got to keep monitoring. At the same time, we're
building the centers to be these more destination with the FSAs, which are brokers in a branch, the mortgage loan
officers. And so that configuration I think we're still testing. So I don't know the exact answer because the near term is
to get the other 400 changed that we're talking about through. So if you step back from it, look year over year, the
branches are down, the customer satisfaction is up, and the deposits are up strongly, which is a nice combination.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: So what I hear you saying is that as you go into 2014, this 5,000 branch number is not
written in stone. Is that correct?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We'll keep monitoring – think of us as a retailer looking at what the best way to get the
most out of the market and serve our customers the best, and that will always be a subject that we'll talk about, and
making massive investments and other ATM architecture, the virtual ATMs, and the mobile space to make sure that
we're right with our customers.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: And my second part to the question would be, Brian, in addressing all these changes in
consumer behavior, et cetera, has part of the program also been to address some of the service issues that you guys had
encountered over the past few years as other stuff took more attention?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Absolutely, and part of it is continuing to upgrade the system. So if you look at our
company between 2009 and 2015, we will have rewritten all the systems, and we'll bring systems which were more
standalone product system into systems which are consistent with the customer approach, Nancy. So the kinds of
inquiries you get where we can see a person in one system and not in other systems, those are going away. Frankly,
getting out of the multiple deposit systems helps. And so our complaints are down a lot. Our attrition is way down. And
so we're seeing the benefits as we go through it. But absolutely, this is all geared at maintaining a customer posture,
customer satisfaction posture which is up year over year and driving it to places we haven't driven it before, honestly,
based on all the tools we have.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. One question, one final question for Bruce. Bruce, the stock is down roughly about
3% in the market right now. And there was some disappointment with the headline number, but all the ingredients of
the quarter looked pretty good. Was it your sense that the $900 million in seasonal costs was built into most estimates,
or was this a point of variance do you think?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think there are probably two things. I think the $900 million built into the estimates,
which we have every period as we look out there, I think it was in some, not in others. So I don't think there was
uniformity on that across.
And then I think the other item that was out there is – as we look at a lot of the analysts as they look at core, they don't
include any litigation number. And obviously, there was a $900 million litigation number. We obviously need that to
come down. But when I mentioned to Meredith's question, I think that getting this class action and shrinking the tail
risk with respect to our mortgage backed security litigation tail risk was a significant item for us. And we were able to
get through this quarter being generally in line with what you all had expected.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay, thank you.

We'll go next to the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks. I just want to circle back to the litigation issues for a moment. Could you just help
me understand what precisely at the upcoming hearing on May 30 is being debated? Is it simply the amount of the
settlement, or is it more the actual legitimacy of the process by which the settlement was derived?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's hard for us to predict what's going to happen on May 30. But I think as we've spoken
to that the process – and we're obviously not a part of this business Bank of New York Mellon in their capacity as
trustee. Obviously, the standard and what needs to be worked through is, is that did they go through and were they

prudent and did they follow a process to getting to the point to say that this settlement made sense for investors? And so
that will be the general topic. We're not going to predict what exactly happens on May 30 besides that we obviously
wouldn't have entered into the settlement if we didn't think there was a basis for it.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Right, correct. I'm certainly not asking you to anticipate an outcome. I just want to make
sure it's not as narrow as the monetary settlement. It's the broader issue of whether BoNY followed the appropriate
procedures in terms of determining a settlement. Is that correct?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: All right, great. Thanks very much.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Thanks very much, just another litigation question. Is it fair to assume that the Countrywide
RMBS that were included in the settlement that you announced this morning are all included in the securities that were
the subject of the settlement of the Gibbs & Bruns and Bank of New York as trustee process?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: There is clearly a significant overlap. I think as you look at the people that were part of
the settlement today tended to be people that would have been original purchasers of the securities. With respect to
Gibbs & Bruns, they could have either been original purchasers or subsequent purchasers, but there is overlap. And as
we've said in the release that the people that were part of the settlement today, to the extent that Gibbs & Bruns gets
approved, they will receive whatever they would have otherwise received as part of Gibbs & Bruns.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Okay. But looked at from the perspective of the Countrywide securities issues, again, would
all of the ones in today's settlement be included in the other – in the Bank of New York as trustee settlement?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes, because as we've said in the release, this covers 80% of the Countrywide securities, of
which Gibbs & Bruns was obviously a very significant piece. So you're absolutely correct in that.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Okay. And then I don't know if there's anything you can say on this, but any prospective
statement about the settlement or possible timing of resolution for the various alphabet soup of remaining litigation,
MBIA, FHFA, and AIG?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: No, there's really nothing we would say there. I think I would reiterate though that as you
look at the component of what we've settled today from a securities litigation perspective as it relates to current
outstanding amount as well as what was originally underwritten, it's obviously a significant piece of that. We continue
to want to resolve and get these legacy issues put behind us. At the same time, between the capital that we've built and
the number of them that we've put behind us, it has to make sense for the shareholders.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Great, thanks very much.

We'll go next to the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Great. Just like on the trusts that were outside of the Bank of New York you did provide on a
similar basis, is there anything you can say about the other lawsuits as to whether there is provision that has been in
there for them based upon some of the experience in the other cases?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I'm not sure what you're talking about. Maybe you can rephrase the question.

<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: You've had experience with some of the monolines. I don't know if it's facts and
circumstances when you think about MBIA. So how do you think about whether there has been a provision there? And
the same thing for the FHFA lawsuits, are there elements of some of the others that cause you to have had some degree
of provisioning for them, or would that only happen once those get advanced?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: They're all in the litigation reserves, which are not on that page. Those are just the rep and
warranty reserves. So the monolines, the FHFA, those are in litigation reserves, because FHFA and AIG are RMBS
cases.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Right. But the question is, is there – should we think about there having been a component of
them, or is that all going to be pending?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I want to make sure I understand the question. So within the – as you go through the
litigation reserves, we have reserves for those litigation items that we have the basis to reserve. To the extent that we
don't have the basis to reserve, we have a range of possible loss. So as it relates to these items, those are the two ways
that we work through the reserves. In the litigation reserves, as we've said before, are where we house reserves for
litigation matters as well as, as I said, the monolines reside within that litigation bucket as well because we're in
litigation with them. And then obviously as you move to the rep and warrant reserves, we've got the actual reserves.
And then we've also disclosed the range of possible loss for those items that we don't have the basis to reserve.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Okay; thanks. I'll take that offline. Just a second question with respect to the mortgage
business and the gain on sale. That primary/secondary spread did end the quarter lower than where it was on average.
Talk a little bit about how you see that gain on sale trending into Q2 and as we go forward.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think that there's – as we look, I would say that the – if we look at where we ended the
quarter relative to where we started, I would say that it feels at this point that the spreads at this point have somewhat
settled out. But obviously, those spreads are going be a function of activity versus capacity, and we'll have to see how
that unfolds over the quarter. We've obviously built up, and as Brian referenced it, have built up the capacity to do what
we need to do for our customers, and we'll just need to see where those margins go throughout the quarter. But at this
point, there was obviously a step down in margins during the first quarter. It feels to some extent as if that has leveled
out, but we'll have to see how it plays out over the second quarter.
<Q - Moshe Orenbuch>: Okay; thank you.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered
already, but just a quick question in terms of the deposit costs. You've got your domestic deposit costs down to sub-20
basis points. You've got somewhat higher costs outside the U.S., although obviously much smaller balances. Is there
any – how are you thinking about being able to reduce the non-U.S. deposit costs, particularly in the time deposit
categories, over the next six to twelve months?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: You're right. The international component is obviously a very small component. Those
are largely – they're almost exclusively either wholesale deposits that are out there. I'm not sure you're going see much
movement in that.
I think to your early question, where the majority of the deposits are and where the majority of the costs of the deposits
are those housed in the U.S. And you can see that as we build up the core deposits, the amount of time deposits that we
have here in the U.S., we would expect those to continue to come down. And as those come down, all other things
being equal, you'd expect deposits here domestically, the cost of those continue to move down.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And now a bigger picture question on OLA. You've got about $134 billion of
long-term debt at Bank of America Corporation as of the end of the year, an additional $90 billion of Merrill Lynch

debt. When you're thinking about OLA, does any – do you think about potentially explicitly agreeing to support the
Merrill Lynch debt? Does that help you at all under OLA, or are you planning on just maintaining the status quo on that
basis?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think as I said before, the OLA rules continue to evolve. If you look out at our annual
filings that we've put out there, we've said that we're looking at does it make sense to have ML&Co merged into BAC.
That's ongoing work that continues. We believe ultimately as the Merrill debt runs off and to the extent there's
reissuance, it's at the Bank of America level, so we pick up that benefit. And like I said, as we look at any ratio and as
we consider the different rules, it feels like we'll have more than enough in total parent company debt relative to
risk-weighted assets.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay, and then just one final question. You had mentioned the time to required funding
has come down a little bit from the end of last year, and you intend on maintaining that as above two years. Should we
think about that coming down closer to 24 months over the next six to twelve months, or is it too early to tell?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Two things. The first is the one thing when you mentioned it came down in the quarter,
realize that one of the reasons why it came down is that we've included the $5.5 billion of preferred redemptions in the
time to required funding.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: So that largely drove that. But to your question, it's a good one. We would expect over
time that the amount of parent company liquidity that we have would tend to come down over time. As we get through
the 2013 and 2014 maturities, we still believe we can bring the parent company liquidity down, bring the cost of it
down. And you're right, we will keep time to required funding at at least two years. Initially given we work through
maturities, that will stay elevated in the high 20 months – 30 months. But the goal is to obviously flatten out the
maturities and have that become more in the two-year area, which is consistent with what we've been saying for some
time.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Right; okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure; thank you.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I had a question on litigation. But before we go there, there's an article saying that, Brian,
you were leading a revenue push at the company. And I was wondering if this is a tweak, a strategic change. And as far
as a revenue push starting from the top, is that because of what Bank of America is not doing or is it because of the
weaker than expected environment, or both?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We have been driving the company, and so there has been two basic pieces of strategy.
One is to continue to push the legacy issues and costs [ph] and turn them (1:17:00) out of the company, and at the same
time take the company and drive the underlying business metrics. So that has been going on.
And as we clean up more of the former, then the focus of the company is on the latter and involved in the latter; in
other words, driving the core company was that we had say a credit card, a big book of business that we were running
off that we're getting towards the end of that or less impact quarter to quarter, and now we've got to grow the credit
card business. So this quarter I think we did 900,000-plus credit cards, which is the highest amount we've done in a
quarter since 2008 or something like that. And 70% of those are through the branch structure and through the referral
business and things like that. So the goal is to continue to drive as a company and get the value of the combination of
all the pieces of businesses through it. It's not a new push. It's just as the other issues go away, this is what the team has
to be focused on.

So we're seeing great progress in some of the businesses, and look at the GWIM business and look at the connectivity
of the GWIM business. We literally have millions of referrals that go between businesses a year. We goal those at 30%
to 50% increases every year, and we see that number is being hit and has tracked in every single market, 100-plus
markets with about 20 different pieces of business flows between businesses tracked that we track and monitor on a
monthly basis. It's all geared to just driving the value of the franchise and, frankly, delivering the customers' entire
franchise. And it appears in all businesses, whether it's in the commercial business bringing our 401(k) platform, which
is new to the Bank of America structure since Merrill came in. And we just see that wins and that happening every day,
it is bringing the capital markets expertise deeper in our middle market business. It's bringing the personal side of the
Wealth Management business to our business entrepreneurs. It's all those things. And so newness is probably a word
that overstresses it. It is just what we have to do to drive the revenue and continue to work the expenses to produce the
bottom line we need.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Right, so as you finish or you move further along with the cleanup, just more external focus?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes, one of the tough things is we have 260,000 people in this company. A lot of them
have been focused on this and it's just their time to shine. The rest, what Bruce and I have been working on and others,
restructuring, balancing, getting the capital up, getting liquidity. Legacy issues are starting to fade away.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then a separate question back to the litigation. The 10-K and some 10-Qs say that if the
courts disagree with the argument of loss causation, then the reserves may need to go up, and that has not taken place.
Your range of possible loss is about the same. So I'm trying to reconcile those two thoughts because it seems as though
with Assured versus Flagstar, loss causation was shot down and just some other comments in the courts. How do I
reconcile what happened with Flagstar and some other court comments that shoot down loss causation with the
comment in your 10-K?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think that the couple things I'd say, the first is – and I'm not going to drill into the
Flagstar case, but I want to be clear. Flagstar gave a borrower a flawed reference and that was part of that case, which is
not something that we've done. But at a high level, Mike, I'd go back to that's correct. It's in the disclosure. And as I
said in my earlier comments, within the litigation reserve during the quarter, we reassess those every quarter, and we
did provide within the litigation expense some element of cost with respect to monolines during the quarter.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And the big question here is, what happens if the $8.5 billion settlement doesn't go through? I
asked Bank of New York that question this morning. And the answer from Bank of New York is it's up to the courts to
decide. But what if the courts decide the $8.5 billion agreement does not go through? What would be the impact on
your reserves?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think that the first thing is that the court is not opining on a number. They're either
opining on approving or not approving. And obviously, if they don't approve, we have set up reserves within the
Countrywide securities assuming that every trust gets to the 25% threshold. And so obviously, if it doesn't get
approved, this will revert back to going individual trust by trust and working through it. But I don't think it's
appropriate to comment on reserves on something that we don't know what – that it's not going happen.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So you have $8.5 billion in reserves for the $8.5 billion settlement, and that may change, but
you'll wait and see what happens May 30?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct. And I think the other important thing is, Mike, when we set up the $8.5
billion to Countrywide, we also used that same methodology with respect to bank-issued securitization rep and warrant
to set up reserves based on the same methodology across the company.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.

<Q - Jonathan Thomas LeTrent>: Good morning. This is actually Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. I have a quick
follow-up, and I just want to make sure I heard you guys right. Did you say that 50% of your total originations were
HARP? And if so, would that imply that – I guess what I'm asking is do you think you can replace that with normal
retail volume if HARP starts to dissipate in the back half of the year?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I want to be clear. The 50% was both MHA as well as HARP.
<Q - Jonathan Thomas LeTrent>: Okay.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: And it was slightly less. In fact, if you think about it year over year, the growth rate as a
non – those activities has been as strong as the growth rate. That's the challenge going forward is just how do we keep
the originated broader product set. Right now, that is an opportunity, which is here and near and it goes away over time.
But the rest of the production continues to grow at a fast pace also.
<Q - Jonathan Thomas LeTrent>: Okay, great. That's helpful, and one additional question real quick. Can you tell
me what type of products that are actually in your portfolio right now?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Within the Consumer Mortgage business?
<Q - Jonathan Thomas LeTrent>: Yes.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Largely nonconforming. And obviously, we're not looking to go out – what we want to do
is to provide the mortgage product and balance sheet for it that which there isn't another alternative, and we're pressing
hard within the different businesses. The mortgage activity within the Wealth Management business this quarter was
very strong as well as within the mass affluent client space. So that's largely the focus.
<Q - Jonathan Thomas LeTrent>: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Just on the underwriting though, you should be – rest assured that the underwriting is
consistent with very strong underwriting that going on in the industry in total right now.
<Q - Jonathan Thomas LeTrent>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.

Okay. I think we're through the questions. So once again, thanks for joining us this morning, and we'll be talking with
