Brian T. Moynihan
Thank you, Lee, and good morning and thank all of you for joining us to review our fourth quarter results for 2014.
As we think about the year, we've accomplished a lot, including resolving many significant legacy issues that were
overshadowing the underlying progress in our franchise. Settling these issues obviously came at a cost and drove a
decline in year-over-year net income. But importantly, the settlements removed for all of us: for investors, regulators,
rating agencies, and others. It allows us to focus on the core business and operations of the company going forward.
As we move to slide two, you can see that we have a simplified and stronger company. Today, we reported earnings of
$3.1 billion after tax. The company is simpler and more straightforward with improved risk profile. Everything we do
now is focused on driving the company forward and delivering for our customers and clients.
On this slide, you can see some of the important results. This year we completed arguably the industry's largest ever
cost savings program, which achieved $8 billion of annualized savings. Let's think about that. We started that program
in 2011, when we had around 290,000 FTEs. And over the three years since then, driving it the right way, we
completed it in 2014, ending the year with around 220,000 FTEs.
Non-interest expense excluding litigation declined $4.4 billion compared from 2013 to 2014, and is down more than $8
billion in the last couple years. And yet we have more work to do ahead of us.
We further strengthened an already strong and liquid balance sheet and increased our common stock dividend during
2014 for the first time since 2007. As you can see on this page, our credit costs are at a decade-low level.
So notwithstanding the headwinds our industry faces with rates and an ongoing flow of economic sluggishness, we
have built a platform for growth, especially in the context of the continued improving U.S. economy. We built a
company with leading market positions across every core customer base, and our task now is to continue to build on
that foundation and the progress we've made.
As you look at our results, you'll see that year-over-year earnings in our primary businesses with the exception of the
Consumer Real Estate business made progress that shows stability in a volatile rate and geopolitical environment.
Importantly, as you think about our company, we have been investing in growth while taking out expense. We reduced
our overall head count during 2014 by around 8% at the same time we invested. We invested by reallocating resources
to sales capacity from those savings, increasing in all our core businesses. We invested by reallocating expense
reductions to product capabilities: our loan capabilities, our cash management capabilities, and other capabilities
around the world. We've invested some of those savings in our technology, spending over $3 billion in 2014 to improve
and protect our company. Now you can see the results in the appendix pages, and Bruce will touch on that in the line of
business presentations.
We expect to continue this effort going forward. We have teams working on it every day. They are working to
reallocate non-productive expense to drive towards growth, allowing us to maintain the good expense management
you've come to expect from our company. At the same time, we're laser-focused on winning market share and growing
with our customers as the economy continues to improve, and we look forward to reporting that progress during the
year ahead.
With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce to take you through the quarter's numbers.
Bruce R. Thompson
Great, thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on slide three, and I'm going to go through the details.
During the fourth quarter, we recorded $3.1 billion of earnings or $0.25 per diluted share. Let me give you a few
thoughts on revenues. There were two significant adjustments to revenue as well as negative DVA charges that in the
aggregate reduced reported revenues this quarter by $1.2 billion pre-tax or roughly $0.07 a share after tax. Of the

components of the $1.2 billion impact, we recorded a roughly $578 million negative market-related adjustment, which
as you all know, we refer to as FAS 91 in net interest income for the acceleration of bond premium amortization on our
debt securities that was driven by lower long-term rates.
Otherwise, our core net interest income, which excludes this market-related adjustment, was pretty stable, with the
fourth quarter coming in a little bit better than we signaled to you all during our third quarter earnings call.
In addition, this quarter we adopted FVA, which is for funding valuation adjustment, and incurred a $497 million
charge against our sales and trading results as a result of that adoption. And as we normally provide to you, our credit
spreads tightened, and this tightening caused a negative charge for DVA in the trading account of approximately $130
million during the quarter.
Expenses during the quarter were well managed. Our total non-interest expense in the fourth quarter was $14.2 billion,
which included approximately $400 million in litigation expense during the quarter. This level of expense is the lowest
level of expense that we've seen since the Merrill Lynch merger. And credit costs during the quarter improved, as our
provision for credit losses was $219 million and included $660 million in the release of reserves.
On slide four, reduced asset levels in our Global Markets business drove our balance sheet levels lower, coming down
$19 billion from the third quarter of 2014, and we finished at just over $2.1 trillion in assets. We continued our focus
on balance sheet optimization for liquidity, as we continued to shift our discretionary portfolio into HQLA-eligible
securities from non-HQLA loans and also improved our deposit composition.
As we signaled to you in the third quarter earnings call, discretionary portfolio first-lien loans declined from the third
quarter of 2014 levels, but we were very pleased with the loan growth we saw in our core businesses during the quarter.
If we look in those core businesses, Global Banking loans increased $4 billion during the quarter. Within Wealth
Management, loan balances grew $3 billion. And our U.S. consumer credit card receivables increased $2.9 billion
during the quarter.
We did have a $2.7 billion decline in our direct and indirect portfolio, as we transferred a portfolio of student loans to
held-for-sale. Our deposits grew from the end of the third quarter, while short-term funding declined. We executed
another successful issuance of $1.4 billion of preferred stock early in the third quarter, and that benefited regulatory
capital. Shareholders' equity improved with both the earnings growth as well as the improvements in AOCI. As a result
of that, our tangible book value increased to $14.43 per share, and our tangible common equity ratio improved to
7.47%.
If we move to regulatory capital on slide five, under the transition rules, our CET1 ratio was 12.3%. If we look at our
Basel 3 regulatory capital metrics on a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $6.2 billion during the quarter.
That was driven by earnings, deferred tax utilization, as well as the improvement in AOCI.
Our operational risk-weighted assets during the quarter increased again. They now represent 34% of total risk-weighted
assets. But notwithstanding that increase, we were able to keep our Basel 3 Advanced ratio at levels consistent with
what we saw at the end of the third quarter. Under the standardized approach, our CET1 ratio improved from 9.5% in
the third quarter of 2014 to 10% at the end of the year.
If we look at our supplementary leverage ratios, we've done a lot of work over the past year to improve those.
Obviously, the fully phased-in kick in, in 2018. If we look at where we ended the quarter at our bank holding company,
our SLR ratio was at 5.9%. And at our primary banking subsidiary, BANA, we were at approximately 7%.
If we turn to slide six, funding and liquidity, long-term debt ended the quarter at $243 billion, down $7 billion from the
third quarter of 2014. We've done a lot of work over the past couple years to smooth out our parent company maturity
profile. And as you can see, we have $22 billion scheduled to mature in 2015 and comparable amounts over the next
four years or five years. Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources reached a record level during the quarter and closed at
$439 billion. And within those Global Excess Liquidity Sources, our parent company liquidity improved $5 billion
from the end of the third quarter to $98 billion at the end of the year.

Time to required funding increased to 39 months during the fourth quarter. And during the quarter, we continue to
increase our estimated liquidity coverage ratios at both a consolidated as well as at the bank levels. At the end of the
year, we're well ahead of the 100% fully phased-in 2017 requirement at the consolidated level, and at more than 90% at
the bank level, which is well ahead of the 80% phased-in 2015 requirement, and are well-positioned to achieve the
2017 requirement.
If we turn to slide seven, on net interest income, our net interest income on an FTE basis was $9.9 billion, down from
the third quarter of 2014 as a result of the more negative market-related adjustment I mentioned a moment ago, which
also drove a reported net interest yield decline of 11 basis points.
Lower long-term rates coupled with the flattened yield curve resulted in adjustments to our assumptions to our bond
premium amortization, which drove the $578 million of market-related adjustments in the fourth quarter versus the
negative $55 million we saw during the third quarter of 2014. If we adjust this market-related adjustment, NII was
$10.4 billion and declined less than $100 million from the third quarter of 2014 despite the challenging rate
environment we saw during the fourth quarter. The adjusted NII decline was driven by the impacts of the lower
discretionary loan balances within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio.
If we look at net interest yield on an adjusted basis, it was up a touch from the third quarter of 2014 to 2.3%. Given the
movement lower in rates that we saw during the quarter, we did become more asset-sensitive such that 100 basis point
parallel increase in rates from what we saw at the end of the year would be expected to contribute roughly $3.7 billion
in NII benefits over the course of the next 12 months. And given the movement in rates, the sensitivity is now more
evenly weighted to both long-term as well as short-term rate moves. Before we leave this slide, I do want to remind you
that during the first quarter of 2015, we have two fewer interest accrual days than the fourth quarter of 2014, which will
negatively impact NII by a couple hundred million dollars.
Non-interest expense and I'm moving to slide eight, was $14.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 and included
approximately $400 million in litigation expense. As I said earlier, this is the lowest quarterly expense amount that we
have reported since the Merrill Lynch merger.
If we exclude litigation, total expenses were $13.8 billion, which declined $300 million from the third quarter of 2014
and was driven by our LAS initiative cost savings as well as lower revenue-related incentive costs within our Global
Markets business. If we compare these expenses to the fourth quarter of 2013, we were down $1.2 billion, driven by
LAS cost savings, New BAC benefits and to a lesser degree, the lower revenue-related incentives.
Legacy Assets and Servicing costs ex-litigation were $1.1 billion in the quarter, $200 million lower than the third
quarter and $700 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2013. As we continue to work through these delinquent loans,
we expect these quarterly costs will come down a few hundred million dollars more by the end of 2015.
Headcount was down 5,800 during the quarter. And as we look at expense, a reminder that we will record our normal
annual retirement eligible incentive costs in the first quarter of 2015 and we expect that number to be roughly $1
billion, consistent with what we've seen the past couple years.
If we turn to asset quality on slide nine, credit quality continued to improve during the quarter. Q4 provision expense
was $219 million and we released a net $660 million of reserves given the continued pace of asset quality
improvement, particularly within our Consumer Real Estate portfolio. Reported charge-offs were $879 million, and
declined from the third quarter of 2014. I would remind you both periods of net charge-offs included NPL sales and
other recoveries and the fourth quarter included approximately $150 million of costs related to actions that were taken
in relation to our DOJ settlement, which were previously reserved for. If we exclude the recoveries and the DOJ
component, charge-offs in the fourth quarter were just over $1 billion versus a similarly adjusted net charge-off amount
of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Loss rates on the same adjusted basis were 47 basis points in the fourth
quarter of 2014 versus 52 basis points that we saw in the third quarter of 2014.
Let's now move to the business segment results, which we start on slide 10 with Consumer & Business Banking. Our
results within Consumer & Business Banking show solid bottom-line performance with earnings of $1.8 billion. Those
were down from the fourth quarter of 2013 due largely to lower release of loan loss reserves and to a lesser degree,

higher tax rates. Business generated a solid 24% return on allocated capital during the quarter. Revenue was up slightly
on a year-over-year basis despite net interest income being down as our non-interest income grew more than 5% with a
strong improvement in card income. If we look at customer activity during the quarter, we had solid deposit growth,
and our rates paid is now at five basis points. Loans on a linked-quarter basis increased seasonally, driven by U.S.
consumer credit card. Our card issuance remains very strong at 1.2 million new cards in the fourth quarter of 2014, of
which approximately 67% of those were issued to existing customers. If we look at all of 2014, we issued 16% more
cards in 2014 than 2013, and increased the percentage of the issuance to our existing customers, which is consistent
with the overall strategy.
Credit quality improved again as our U.S. credit card loss rate fell to 2.7% and continues to have a very strong
risk-adjusted margin at just below 10%. Our Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew to $114 billion, which is up 18%
year-over-year on new accounts, strong account flows as well as higher market levels. Our mobile banking customers
reached 16.5 million in the fourth quarter and now 12% of all customer deposit transactions are done through mobile
devices. If we adjust for portfolio divestitures, combined debit and credit purchase volume was up 4% relative to the
fourth quarter of 2013 and if we back fuel out, was up 5%.
Let's move to Consumer Real Estate Services on slide 11. The improvement in the results compared to the third quarter
of 2014 was driven by the third quarter of 2014 DOJ settlement, which impacted expense, provision as well as income
tax. Revenue did increase slightly over the third quarter of 2014 while expense, even after we exclude litigation,
declined from the third quarter as both fulfillment costs on the production side and costs on the delinquent loan
servicing side were down from the third quarter. Core production revenue and servicing fees were both stable compared
to the third quarter of 2014, while servicing income did benefit from better MSR hedging results. On the production
front, first mortgage retail originations were stable with the third quarter of 2014 at $11.6 billion and the pipeline was
consistent with the third quarter of 2014 as well, albeit up on a year-over-year basis.
On home equity, we are the number one lender in line originations during the quarter. We're $3.4 billion in line with
the third quarter of 2014 and up north of 70% on a year-over-year basis. The credit quality of those second lien
originations remains very strong with average FICO scores over 790 and combined loan-to-value ratios at less than
60%.
Expenses in the segment did include $262 million of litigation costs in the fourth quarter versus $5.3 billion that we
saw in the third quarter of 2014. We continue to work through and resolve RMBS securities litigation matters,
including this quarter the FHLB of San Francisco matter.
With the resolution of that, we now estimate that we've resolved approximately 98% of the unpaid principal balance of
all RMBS as to which RMBS securities litigation has been filed or threatened against all Bank of America related
entities.
LAS expense ex-litigation this quarter was just over $1.1 billion as we achieved our first quarter of 2015 goal a quarter
ahead of schedule. Importantly, the number of 60-plus-day delinquent loans that we have dropped to 189,000 units,
which is down 32,000 or 14% from the third quarter of 2014.
If we turn to slide 12, Global Wealth and Investment Management delivered another strong quarter. Pre-tax margin was
strong. Net income was just over $700 million, but was down from the fourth quarter of 2013 as solid fee-based growth
was offset by lower net interest income and higher expense.
Record asset management fees offset some weakness we saw in transactional activity and still drove a 7% increase in
non-interest revenue relative to the fourth quarter of 2013. Our asset management fees now represent 45% of revenue
within this segment, up from 40% a year ago. Non-interest expense did increase from the fourth quarter of 2013 as a
result of higher performance-based incentives as well as increased incentive – or increased support costs – excuse me.
We increased the number of financial advisors and year-to-date retention of our experienced financial advisors remains
at record levels. Return on allocated capital was 23%. Client balances were nearly $2.5 trillion, up $36 billion from the
third quarter of 2014 and were driven by strong count – client balance inflows.

Long-term AUM flows were $9 billion for the quarter and represented the 22nd consecutive quarter of positive flows.
Our record loans closed during the quarter reflect $3 billion in growth over the third quarter of 2014 in securities-based
as well as residential mortgage lending. And our period-end deposits were up $7 billion or 3% from the third quarter of
2014.
If we turn to slide 13, Global Banking earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up from the fourth quarter of 2013 on
lower credit costs and to a lesser degree, reduced expenses. Results were partially – or the net income was partially
offset during the quarter on a year-over-year basis by lower investment banking fees off of what was a record level in
the fourth quarter of 2013.
Return on allocated capital was strong at 18%. If we look at the investment banking revenues of north of $1.5 billion
we feel very good about the results, they were up on a linked-quarter basis and our investment banking team executed
very well in a tough distribution environment given the volatility of rates as well as energy prices.
Provision was a slight benefit in the quarter and reflected continued low loss rates and a small reserve release compared
to the year-ago period, which included a reserve addition of $434 million. If we look at the balance sheet, we'd point
you to average loans were $271 billion, up $3.7 billion from the third quarter of 2014 levels.
We switch to Global Markets on slide 14. The business reported a modest loss in the quarter but that did include a $497
million charge to implement FVA. For those unfamiliar with FVA, funding valuation adjustment is an adjustment to
the fair value of uncollateralized derivative trades to account for the present value of funding costs. This is an
accounting practice many of our peers have also adopted and as you all know, this is a one-time transition cost for
implementation. Separately, net DVA for the quarter was a loss of $130 million versus a loss of $617 million during the
fourth quarter of 2013.
Earnings are down from the fourth quarter of 2013 as a result of a decline in sales and trading revenue that was mostly
offset by a decline in expense. You recall on our fourth quarter 2013 call, fixed sales and trading during that quarter
included $220 million in recoveries on legacy positions in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Sales and trading, adjusting for net DVA and FVA were $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus $2.8 billion in
the fourth quarter of 2013 after we adjust for the recoveries. On the same adjusted basis, fixed sales and trading
revenues of $1.5 billion compare to $1.9 billion in the year-ago period.
December results were particularly challenging during the quarter with the toughest areas of performance being the
credit-sensitive businesses within FICC, most notably mortgages and credit trading, which are generally our largest
trading revenue-related businesses. On the positive side, we saw increases in both FX and rates revenues versus the
prior year that were driven by increased volatility given global deflationary expectations leading to the U.S. dollar
strengthening. Equity sales and trading was up modestly from the fourth quarter of 2013 as increased volatility was a
positive for secondary flows across both our Cash and Derivative Trading businesses.
On the expense front, the decline reflects litigation expense of $655 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. If we take
that litigation expense out, expenses still declined 5% from the fourth quarter of 2013 as the incentives were reduced to
align with the revenue performance that we saw.
On slide 15, All Other, the results in the fourth quarter of 2013 reflect lower revenue from NII largely associated with
the market-related adjustments that we've discussed as well as lower securities gains and equity investment income
partially offset by gains on the sale of certain loans with long-term standby agreements that were converted to
securities.
Significant equity investment income is largely a thing of the past for us as we have reduced the size of the principal
investing positions in the business as well as strategic positions, and should be modeled accordingly. You'll also notice
we took additional reserves for the payment protection insurance, but at a lower level than we saw during the third
quarter of 2014.
Our fourth quarter 2014 expense is down year over year on less non-mortgage litigation expense and lower
infrastructure costs.

Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29%, and I would expect the tax rate for the company in 2015 to be in the low
30%s absent any unusual items.
One other thing I want to mention before wrapping up is the movement in our business lines that you'll see as we report
them to you in 2015. In the first quarter of 2015, we expect to align Business Banking into our Global Banking
business, which takes this more commercial business out of our core Consumer and Business Banking unit. In addition,
we expect to move the home loans portion of our Consumer Real Estate Services business to Consumer Banking, as
this product remains integral to their relationships with us.
So to conclude my comments, as we look at both 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2014, capital liquidity reached record
levels, which provides a solid base to support our businesses that hold leading or top-tier positions in the industry. We
continue our focus on expense and operating leverage after reaching significant milestones this year on both New BAC
as well as LAS cost-saving initiatives. We reported a quarter of much lower Legacy Assets and Servicing operating and
litigation costs, which had been burdening our reported results. Asset quality continued its trend of improvement
against a slowly improving U.S. macroeconomic backdrop, and we continue to remain well positioned to benefit in an
environment where rates start to increase.
And with that, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey. I just want to talk a little bit about the asset sensitivity and how we should be
thinking about that from here. In particular, as you know, the long end of the curve has come down since the end of the
quarter. So I just wanted to understand. Is that FAS 91 effect Q-to-date, given what the long end of the curve has done?
And then maybe you could speak to what you're doing to try to minimize any further pressure,
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure, a couple things. So if you recall, Betsy, we've historically been saying that the 100
basis points is in the $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion range, and think of the increase to $3.7 billion more or less just
representing the recapturing of the FAS 91 that we saw this quarter. And that's why we referenced that there's been
more asset sensitivity on the long side. The short-end side really hasn't changed at all.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Sure. And then given the fact that the 10-year is now yielding like 1.8% or so, should
we assume like if we end the quarter in 1Q at 1.8% that the same type of 10 basis points down draw is FAS 91 effect,
it's the same in first quarter as it was in fourth quarter? Or is it because you're more asset-sensitive, there's a little bit
higher impact?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's a good question. I think when we looked at this last night that the movement that
we've seen so far in the first quarter of 2015 is almost identical to what we saw during the fourth quarter. So if you
were to snap it off of what we saw last night, it would be a comparable type number, realizing we still have two and a
half months to go.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. And is there any give-back in refi activity that you're expecting?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes, I'd say if we look at – we referenced refi activity increased as a percentage of overall
mortgage production in the fourth quarter. And as I said in my prepared remarks, if we look at the pipelines and

compare the mortgage pipeline at year end relative to the comparable period, it's up pretty significantly. And we'll just
have to see how that plays out, realizing that the first quarter does tend to be a little bit seasonally slow.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Sure.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: The other thing, Betsy, is that January to date there's been a stark move in the amount of
applications coming in, a very stark upward move due to this LAS rate fall-off. So as those things close through, we'd
expect to see some pickup in production this quarter from the refi.

We'll take our next question from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Go ahead, please.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Bruce, I just wanted to follow up on the NII. On the core side of NII, ex the FAS
91, your core NII held up well despite what you'd indicated in October about being conservative with the buy ticket. I
guess how did you hold the core in on NII? And how are you navigating that now in what feels like an even more
difficult environment for reinvesting cash flows today with the 10-year where it is?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure, those are good questions, John. There are a couple of things. The first is if you look
at in the quarter, I think we did a good job with respect to the overall debt footprint, which was down $7 billion, which
helped us out a little bit. Secondly, if you look at, we were able to get another basis point out on the deposit front. And
throughout the quarter, we saw some loan growth that was a little bit better than what we would have seen when we
spoke to you during the quarter. The other thing that we did see during the quarter is we were able to invest and get
some of the investments in the portfolio, and I believe it was in mid-November when rates did back up. And as we go
forward, we do have liquidity to invest in the second and third months of the quarter, and we'll be prudent with how we
invest it relative to OCI risk.
The other thing I would say just before we leave this, John, that I should have referenced with Betsy's point is that it's
easy to focus on the FAS 91 because we're resetting the amortization of premium. I think the other thing you need to
realize that we did see in the quarter is with the rate movement up, while you do have a negative on FAS 91, you've got
a significant positive from a capital perspective where OCI in the quarter from the rate movement was north of $3
billion.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got you, got you. So on the core piece, Bruce, do you expect it to be more
challenging to hold into that $10.4 billion with the 10-year where it is? Does it make it more difficult? And how should
we think about the risk to the $10.4 billion if rates stay low?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think as I said in my comments, the $10.4 billion, you really need to start at about $10.2
billion because you've got two less days during the quarter. And I've said there's a little bit of headwind to hold that on
a core basis, and we're obviously doing everything we can to keep it as close to $10.2 billion as we can realizing that
we're not going to take outsized OCI risk.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then shifting gears on expenses, you got the LAS target a quarter ahead of
time. Do you have a year-end target? I think you said you expect to continue to reduce the LAS to $1.1 billion. Could
you just clarify that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think as we look out and we look at the plans and actions along with the progress that
we've made on the 60-plus day delinquents, I think broadly speaking, and as you know, this number can bounce around
a little bit that, we'd look to have the LAS expenses down to the $800 million type area by the end of the year. And
we're obviously working through plans as we look out to 2016 to continue to drive that number south of $800 million
as we go forward.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And how should we think about the core rest of Bank America expenses, where
you came in nicely at $12.7 billion for the fourth quarter? Obviously, you mentioned the stock option expense stuff in
the first quarter. But as we think about 2015, what are you hoping to do on the core expense base?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: John, I think I'll answer at a broad level, and then Bruce can touch in. So if you think about
the fourth quarter, a couple things happened. One is you've got to remember that Markets revenue was down, so be
careful not to forget that as we see it coming back this quarter expect it to rise as traditionally as in the first quarter.
That would be an increased expense, which you should want obviously.
But for the rest of it, it's basically a continuous process of taking out expenses and either bringing the bottom line of
reinvestment growth. So to give you a straightforward way, in the fourth quarter the reduction in head count of
approximately 5,000, 1,100 or so was LAS and the rest was core activity where we just keep drawing down the expense
base. At the same time, we've added salespeople during that quarter. So what we're trying to do is I wouldn't expect it
to fall dramatically. But I'd expect you guys to be able to see us to continue to make strong investments in sales
capacity, technology products while holding expenses relatively flat with a slight downward bias irrespective of you've
just got to be careful of compensation related to revenue because we'd all want that to be higher.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Okay, thank you.

And our next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So in FICC, it seems a little bit below certainly what I was looking for, and I know you
highlighted some of the difficult markets that you're large in. Was there any specific positional pain given what we saw
in some of the credit spreads and some of the movements there?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, not at all. You have to go back to the core premise that we talk about, which is that
the banking and markets businesses are run as an integrated business. And a lot of the activity that we see within the
Markets area is in market making and other things that are done off of the new issue platform from an underwriting
perspective. And I think what we saw during the quarter, particularly in December, was that that there was a significant
slowdown as we saw overall volatility in the markets from both a new issue as well as a secondary market perspective
that flowed through. But there were not any, if you're looking, there were no losses or particular pain points within the
Global Markets piece of the equation during the quarter.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, thanks. That helps. And then can you guys add any comment to the press reports
we've seen recently about you all rationalizing the PB business and cutting ties to 150 hedge fund clients?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think this is a customer profitability exercise that as we look at driving the franchise the
way Tom [Montag] and Fab Gallo and the team have done a good job of repositioning the equities business. We have
to constrain the prime brokerage a bit due to size because of its low balance sheet return as you'd be aware of. But
importantly, it's the customer profitability. We're looking for customers who will use us with multiple products and
services, whether it's fixed income, equities, and all aspects of fixed income. And so as we take these scarce resources,
which are the GAAP balance sheet and the RWA balance sheet, and allocate it across customers, we've got to make
sure we get the returns, and this was a natural reflection of it.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Should we expect to think about some revenue headwinds in your equities business as we
model out 2015 as a result of some of those efforts?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I'd say no. It's all pretty much through it right now. And as you look at the revenue quarter
to quarter around plus or minus $1 billion, and Fab and the team have done a good job of increasing the yield from the

other clients at the same time. So absent market forces, I wouldn't expect it to have much of an effect.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Terrific. Okay. And then helpful to hear about the target of around $800 million for LAS by
year-end and then driving it lower in 2016. Can you help us think about how you think about that number to zero
because ultimately that given the title, the L in the LAS, that's got to go to zero eventually. How should we think about
that?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: You've got to take a look at the [indiscernible] (42:24). So it's all the servicing expense in
the companies in that unit for all the good loans and bad loans, so it doesn't go to zero, but it's got to get a lot better.
Because if you start to noodle on the 4 million or so units we have in first mortgage servicing and think about the
annualized costs, we've got to get it down significantly to make servicing and mortgages makes sense to us. But that's a
project that we're working against doing it the right way for the customer, doing it the right way for the regulatory
environment and the consent orders and all things that have gone on and you're well aware of. And so we've just got to
keep peeling that away. And so when we say $800 million or so, that is the next way station on our train ride here. But
it's got to go a lot further than that for the 3.5 million to 4 million of good units we have, so to speak.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. So no indication about where that sort of settling out level might ultimately be even if
not a when but what the number would be?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think we talked about $0.5 billion but I'm not sure if that's a great performance in that
over time either. So just assume that there's nobody more interested in driving that number down to a normalized
servicing cost than this company.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Fair enough. And then last one from me. You guys hit on in wealth management business
and the margin there support costs and revenue-related comp. Could you maybe quantify how much each of those
factors impacted the margin change quarter-over-quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think if you look at a couple of things. The first is that from a margin perspective, you
had a little bit of a headwind with NII being lower than what it was. As you look at the support costs during the quarter,
I would think of that as being about 200 basis points on the margin during the quarter that we saw.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Great, thanks a lot.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi, thanks very much. I wonder if we could get your best comment that you can give us on
energy-related exposures. In your Q, you have a general comment of energy and $20 billion, but if you could break it
down a little bit more, what's secured, what's not secured, what's investment-grade, what's not, and just how overall you
feel your position, that'd be helpful.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. I think if we look at the amount of funded exposure across what we refer to as oil
and gas, that the amount of funded exposure which includes derivative exposure was roughly $23 billion at the end of
the year. As you look at that $23 billion, I would think of it generally as 60% that's directly reflected or affected by the
price of oil. There are a lot of those that are not, so you've got roughly $22 billion or $23 billion funded, 60% directly
affected by oil, well north of 80% of that are investment-grade borrowers and for those non-investment grade
borrowers, they're obviously secured facilities and in most cases, have formulas upon which they can borrow based on
the value of the assets that we're secured by.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think if you think overall, one of the things that give a perspective that we see is in a
consumer spending in January, on debit and credit cards, basically, we've seen the spending go up by 3%, and if you
look at the fuel side of that, it's about 5% of that total spending and it is down 28% year-over-year. So the people are

getting a benefit – that our consumer customers are getting benefit, but they're re-spending that benefit and overall
spending levels are growing through it. So there is competing – there's a technical risk to the oil producing companies
that Bruce has talked you through, but the overall economy, even the first week or so of January, we're seeing the
benefit to the consumer very historically in a year-over-year comparison.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I definitely appreciate all that and you said that was the funded to oil and gases is
commitments a larger number, I think, than that and do you...
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: ...the ability to pull back on the commitments?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think on average, the fundings are roughly 50% of what the commitments are. As it
relates to the pulling back of commitments, I think what I'd point to and what our team just did a very good job with is
we obviously have commitments in the originate-to-distribute piece which if we look at, we ended the year, I believe,
with two commitments of investment-grade borrowers on an originate-to-distribute basis, one of which has had a
significant positive event from a financing perspective already this year. The other's a single A credit that will get done
in the second quarter and outside of the investment-grade originate-to-distribute, I think there was a couple hundred
million dollars that still needed to get done. So you're not pulling commitments from borrowers, but as it relates to
commitments that needed to be distributed, the teams have done a very good job.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like you're semi-comfortable
with the positioning. There will be some hits along the way, but this is not a major risk to the portfolio? Again, I don't
want to put words in your mouth.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We're comfortable with the positions. You should assume as we're making these
commitments in environments where oil is higher, we're continually running and stressing those portfolios to be
comfortable with the commitments. And as Brian referenced, to the extent that we're in a prolonged period where these
prices persist to the extent that there are costs that run through because of difficulties that a commercial or corporate
borrower may have, and as we look across the overall credit platform, we'd expect there to be offsets given what we're
seeing with consumers and other people that are benefiting from lower energy prices.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. That's helpful. Last one for me is I didn't hear anything on TLAC if you could tell us
where you think your ratio shook out net of the conservation buffer and the SIFI buffer that would be helpful.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes. I think if you look at where we are from a TLAC perspective, we're generally in the
21% type area, and embedded in that 21% type area is the fact that structured notes we've assumed for that purpose that
we would not benefit from structured note funding and if we refinanced out those structured notes, you'd pick up
another 1% to 2% based on the current size of the debt footprint.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. And I just want to make sure the 21% is net of the conservation buffer and your SIFI
buffer, or a gross of?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, it's gross of. That's a gross of.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Right.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's roughly 21%, call it, plus another one to two for structured notes and then depending
on the exact treatment of the buffers as we go through that, that number would be reduced by the buffers.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Got it. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.

<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Good morning, just a quick question on the balance sheet and NII. I appreciate the efforts to
keep NIM flat, but to really get NII growing, we got to start to see, I guess, the balance sheet on a net basis grow. I
think your balance sheet was down close to $25 billion this quarter. At what point do we start to see the net balance
sheet, the restructuring of the balance sheet start to give way to growth?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I think what you're going to see as we go forward is that as we look out into our
forecasted models, we would expect there to continue to be strong deposit growth throughout 2015. And as we
referenced before, obviously, the goal with that deposit growth is very much a focus to grow loans within our core
customer segments. And as I referenced, we saw that within the Global Banking space this quarter. We saw within
Wealth Management. We're seeing pickups in overall mortgage activity. So I think you're likely to see the balance
sheet creep up as deposits come in and as we look to grow loans, I just want to make sure though that that we remind
you that we will continue to see the discretionary portfolio that's got whole loans in it that in this rate environment they
will continue to repay. So as you judge how we do on loan growth, you need to look at the core businesses. As I said,
we would expect to start to see the balance sheet move up. And at the same time, we're trying to get things that don't
have a return and our core to what we do off. But to your point, I think we're largely through that.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And I think if you think about this, say these two years ago, I think we cited about $100
billion odd of non-core loans. That's down around to $30 billion and a dominant part of that is still in the home equity
area, quite frankly. So in the card business, in the Business Banking area where we had some stuff that was put on to us
by some predecessor companies, we're largely through all that and that's why you're seeing some growth there. And so
the card you saw grow, it's seasonal but it grew and it's been stable for a number of quarters. The good home equity
side has grown quite strongly. The stuff we're running off in home equity starts is high charge-off contents, the better
decision economics of the company to run it. But the rest of the loan balances we ought to see growth with the
exception of the discretionary residential mortgage holdings which will continue to run down based on a better view of
what we want to do for outlook management going forward.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. And I think, Bruce, to your point, the deleveraging around trying to improve the
leverage ratio, the impact of that should be easing going forward? Is that what you said?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. And just one last follow-up on, I don't know if you mentioned this where you guys
are in the NSFR.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, we've done a lot of work. We've not put anything out public on that but as we've
looked through it and sorted through it, we do not see that being a constraint as we go forward.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, great. That's it for me. Thanks.

<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Morning.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: The capital ratios grew more than expected. Obviously, the decline in rates helped
the positive earnings, and you mentioned the DTA consumption. As we think about 2015 and the drivers of capital, is it
more of the same? Or is there, call it, optimization overall? Not just the loan runoff that you address, but as we think
about – you've had final rules for the last few months, there's still some adjustments to the business throughout. How
should we think about the capital build? And if you have an estimate for 2015, that would be interesting as well.

Page 13 of 21
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. We're not going to provide an estimate but what I would say is that as you look at
overall capital levels, if you start with the numerator, as we project out and look at the earnings stream, we think that at
least through 2015 and possibly into the first part of 2016, that on average, and you can have some quarterly bounces
around based on timing and payments, but that generally we should accrete capital over the course of at least four and
up to six quarters largely based on the pre-tax earnings of the company as opposed to the after-tax earnings. And that's
what you saw during the fourth quarter.
The other thing on the numerator, as I referenced, that there is – and if we were to snap a quarter today, there would be
OCI benefit from the downward movement in rates. As it relates to what we're seeing on the risk-weighted asset side, I
would say, generally, we continue to benefit although it declines a little bit each period. We continue to benefit from
the runoff of some of the Global Markets positions that would have been put on in the 2005 to 2008 timeframe that
tended to have tenures of 7 years to 10 years. In addition to that, as we continue to have payoffs and as we continue to
move out some of the tougher Consumer Real Estate assets and put higher quality real estate assets on that are better
credit borrowers, while the asset levels may stay comparable, you do have been RWA pickup from that as well.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: On RWA, any numbers you can provide in terms of how much benefit you get
from the, I guess, just priced on the credit correlation book and some of those contracts and the real estate running off,
just those two pieces?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No. I mean I think as you look forward, I mean these tend to be, I think, outside of op risk
this quarter. We had roughly $30 billion of risk-weighted asset benefit under the Advanced Approach. Roughly half of
that was in the consumer book, half of it was in the wholesale books. I think you'll continue to see benefits but I don't
think you'll see the quarterly benefit of that magnitude on a go forward basis.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, the home equity charge-offs increased a fair
amount versus 3Q. Obviously, 3Q is a very low level. But remind me what's going on there. I think there was an
accounting or methodology change a year ago. Has that fully worked through, or is there seasonality or a reset? What's
going on?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The biggest thing you had in home equity this quarter is that I believe it was roughly $150
million that went through charge-off that was related to the DOJ settlement. So realize you have $150 million of
charge-off, $150 million of reserve. So from a net P&L perspective, it was a push. But you did have that during the
quarter, and it's the reason that we wanted to give you the core charge-off number Q3 to Q4 because as we implement
the DOJ settlement, you will see both charge-off and reserve release come out in each of probably the first and second
quarter. Then we should be largely through that.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning. Bruce, I was hoping you can maybe help explain what prompted the
increase in operational risk RWA. The 34% I guess makes you an outlier relative to some of your peers, whereas
previously you were more in line. And I know the process typically is you submit the models to the regulators and/or
the Fed and then they give you feedback. And I wanted to know. Was the increase prompted by the feedback from the
regulators themselves as part of the annual review, or was it what you determined based on your own internal models?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I'll answer the question slightly differently, which is that as we worked through an
iterative process with our regulatory supervisors, we do believe at this point that from an op risk perspective that we are
adjusted, and the amount of op risk RWA that we have now is consistent with what you would need to exit parallel run.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, understood. So we shouldn't expect any further increases as a percentage of RWA
going forward, or is it simply too early to make that determination?

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We think with respect to op risk RWA that we're there. We obviously need to get through
those elements that are the rest of parallel run. But from an op risk perspective, we feel like we're there.

prepared remarks any color on the investment banking backlog and didn't know if you can give us an update there as
well.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's interesting and we have to be a little bit careful. I would say as we looked at the
backlog in the pipeline, particularly from an M&A perspective, that we feel very good about where the pipeline was at
year end. It's one of the stronger year-end pipelines that we have. I think the only tone of caution I would say is that
we've obviously seen a little bit more volatility in both the fixed income and equity new issue markets. But as it relates
to the amount of business that we're winning that's getting queued up and is in the pipeline, we feel very good about
that. It was a good backlog at year end.

We'll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: I just wanted to follow up on a couple of topics that have been touched on
already. And maybe just starting with the risk-weighted asset discussion once more, I just want to make sure I
understand all the puts and takes of what's going into the risk-weighted asset calc. It sounds like on the positive side,
obviously, there is the benefit of a GAAP balance sheet reduction as well as the trade-off between lower-quality and the
higher-quality assets. And it sounds like the operating risk component is now fully baked in. But are there any other
components that could drive that up in a way that's different from what's going on, on the GAAP balance sheet?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think the only thing that's out there is that as part of exiting parallel run, we're working
through with our supervisors that the different wholesale and other credit models that you need to exit parallel run, so
we're working through that. But I think absent that, you're largely at the point of looking at and you would expect that
the RWA is going to largely follow the GAAP balance sheet. The one thing, and I think you all know this, where you
could possibly diverge from that is that there is a pro cyclicality to the extent that you have volatility in the Markets
businesses as it relates to the stress VaR calculations that go into the risk-weighted asset. But outside of that, you would
directionally expect it to follow the GAAP balance sheet.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Okay. And with respect to the GAAP balance sheet, what is your overall
expectation about the net growth over 2015?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think you're probably going to largely see it in the zip code and probably be most
correlated to the overall deposit balances. And if you look at the range that we've been running at over the last 12
months, it's been in the $2.1 trillion to $2.15 trillion – $2.175 trillion type area, and I'd expect that area or that range to
hold for 2015.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Great. And then just to talk about the asset quality for a moment, obviously it was
the lowest provision that we've seen from you in some time. And many of your peers are inflecting from the point of
asset quality improvements to some modest now deterioration and the rebuilding of reserves. And I just want to get a
sense from you about where you think you are in that spectrum.

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. I think if we go back, and let's start with the fact that we saw during the quarter that
if we back out any impact of loan sales as well as the DOJ settlement, charge-offs in the fourth quarter came down
from $1.2 billion to just over $1 billion. I think as you look at charge-offs when you're at virtually zero, from a
commercial perspective it's hard to see getting much better than that.
I do think where we're probably a little bit different is that as we continue to work through and we had another solid
improvement of a couple billion dollars from an NPL perspective within the consumer real estate space that we
continue to work through and reduce those tougher consumer Real Estate credits. But I think that if you look at this $1
billion charge-off type level that we've seen, we're probably in areas where you're going to see that flatten out. And I
think as we look forward, there may be a little bit of reserve release on the front end on the first half of the year, and
you'd probably expect that to flatten out and go away as we get through 2015.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Great. And then just finally on the LAS expense, which I know you've touched on
several times, but I'm just wondering if the pace of that improvement changes at all as you're getting into the later
stages of delinquency and foreclosure inventory improvement
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes. It's just that the plus side is that you have the ability to push the numbers down faster
as the economy continues to improve and the market continues to improve and the opportunities for borrowers and time
passes, frankly. The flip side of that, though, is in the states that – in the areas where the process is slow, you're boiling
in a beaker and what's left is in the really slow areas. And so we've caught up in the states where the process that goes
through at a reasonable fashion and we still have the laggards in places that the process is traditionally oriented. So I
think you're absolutely right. There's a bias that as you get better at it and get lower, it starts improving. But against
that, you get to some of the rocks that are harder to move because the process is so slow.
Secondly is, remember, we took out up to almost 58,000 employees in that business, and there's a lag to getting the real
estate costs out and letting off the buildings and all the stuff that we have to do, and so we've got to be a little careful of
getting ahead of ourselves. The head count comes out first. The facilities then come out second. And so we're working
hard on that. So you're right that once you can see the pace of improvement continues almost nominally or even
nominally better than the past, but the reality is there are just some things that work against you in terms of assets left
are harder; and then secondly, there's a lag to the hard costs over and above people costs.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Wonderful, thanks very much.

We can take our next question from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Guy.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: I just want to go back to the net interest margin discussion a little bit. I thought that I heard
you say in the prepared comments that there had been a shift in the balance of the asset sensitivity to more of a balance
between long-term versus short-term rates. And I was wondering if that is strictly a function of the FAS 91 issue in a
falling long rate environment. Or is there something more structural that you've been doing with the portfolio that has
caused that to happen?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's the FAS 91, Guy. You're absolutely correct.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. And then if we can just take a look at that one historically for a second, obviously,
over time that has caused quite a lot more volatility in your NIMs than it has for a lot of the peer group. I seem to
remember that for regional banks, say, that have often had the same issue, there's a difference I guess in the way they
accrue versus doing the constant resets that you do. And I was wondering why you do it in the way that you do, which

seems to create more volatility.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We probably wondered the same thing this quarter. All kidding aside, I think if you go
back, you're right. There are two ways that you can do this. The first is the way that we do it, which is you have the
premium. You look at the average life of the premium. In each quarter, you reset it and basically retroactively make
that adjustment from when it started, and that was the determination that we had made a number of years ago. But
you're right, the other way that is allowed and provided for under GAAP is that you just basically adjust as you grow
and take it through the P&L as you go. And you can do it either of two ways, and we obviously do it the way that we
do.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Would you ever consider changing that? And if you were to do so, would there be a
significant one-time charge that would be associated with that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No. I think it goes the other way. The reality is that we run through the P&L that
amortization to catch up for, in effect, if rates ended up being lower than when the premium was set on. So I think the
way that we do it is absolutely appropriate. And keep in mind the other thing and I referenced in my earlier comment is
that as you do this from a balance sheet perspective, you're always adjusting the valuation of your AFS securities to be
the fair market value at the time that you published your financials and obviously that flows through OCI.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. You'd also talked about the changing line items or lines of business where
certain things are booked as we move into 2015. And that was fairly clear except I was wondering will this also entail
moving the very large investment portfolio of your mortgages from All Other into the Consumer category?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It would not result in a large portion of mortgages being moved. There may be a smaller
amount or a percentage of it that we continue to evaluate because the one thing that we want to make sure that we do is
to have the geography of the financial statements motivate the behavior of the people that serve the client base that they
do. So there may be possibly a relatively small amount of home equity loans that could travel into the consumer
business. But it's not going to be anything that distorts things in any meaningful way.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Thanks. And then final one for me. You talked a little bit about the investment
banking backlog at the turn of the year. But more broadly for Global Markets and Global Banking taken together, can
you give us a sense now that we're a couple weeks into the year how the, in particular, say, trading activity has started
off? And given some of the increase in volatility, especially with big moves like what happened with the Swiss franc
today, are you instructing the Global Markets business to pull back on risk? Or generally, are you seeing that some of
those volatility levels are in some way beneficial?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah. I think there's a couple parts to that. The first is, I think, if you look at overall risk
levels that we ran within the Global Markets business and if you look at our information that we put out at year-end,
that even with a little bit of a pickup in volatility at year-end, VaR was at low levels and overall balance sheet levels
were at low levels as we exited the year. I think we're nine trading days into the quarter. So I think it's a little bit early
to forecast what you would expect for the quarter for the overall sales and trading businesses. The only thing I would
say is that clearly the activity levels that we've seen that it's been more of a return to normal than what we experienced
in the month of December. But I wouldn't want anyone to draw any conclusions when we're nine days through 62
trading days in a quarter.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Sure, it's early. Thanks very much. I appreciate the color.

I think, 220,000. Did you sell anything? Or is that all improvement in just credit in the quarter? In other words, did you
move the houses out, or did you also sell?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah. My recollection is there was – roughly a third of that came from the sales of both
servicing as well as the underlying loans themselves. And then in addition to that, we saw continued improvement in
the net new 60 pluses. And then we obviously worked others through the normal foreclosure process as well as for
those borrowers that cured.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And one of the things that – because I – on your – you made a comment about that the low oil
prices has improved some of the consumer credit, consumer spending, and all that. Are you seeing any improvement in
working through those 60-day defaults from that? Or those loans are just so old relatively speaking in the default
bucket that the lower oil prices really doesn't help out?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I'd say it's much too early to figure out what the lower price impact would have on
mortgage defaults. What we're saying is you're actually seeing consumer spend the money they're getting and you're
seeing the consumer credit quality stay strong. But as you project out a period of low prices, you would see a benefit on
the consumer side offset by the commercial side. So I'm not sure, Paul, in the context of what's in that 60-day bucket
that it'll have a meaningful impact. It hasn't had any meaningful impact so far. It's fairly early days. But because of the
– if you look at our delinquencies in a first mortgage portfolio, they keep coming down and that's what drives long-term
reduction.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And, Brian, and I missed – I was writing it down as fast as I could but you talked about how that
you're seeing consumer balances increase over the last couple of months, I guess, or last month. Can you go over those
numbers again?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: The consumer spending increase, is that what you're referencing, Paul?
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So far, January of 2015 versus January of 2014 spending on credit debit cards is up about
3% year-over-year. And that's overcoming a drag effect of about a percentage and a half from lower fuel prices.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much.

And we can take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thank you. I wanted to drill into the markets business a little bit. In the sense that we've
seen pressure on fixed income the last two quarters, is there anything in the drivers of that weakness that would
jeopardize the seasonal uptick that we usually see in the first quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think if I understand your question, I think that the answer to that is no. If you go back
and look at, with the exception of last year, the fourth quarter does tend to be the weakest quarter of the year
seasonally. It was obviously a little bit more so this quarter. But structurally, there's nothing that would lead you to that.
Obviously, it's a market that ebbs and flows but, no, there's not anything structural that would lead you to believe that
that should be different.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And there is a lot of noise in the markets business, and I tried to take out as much as I
could. What I'm trying to look at is expense elasticity relative to the revenues. From third quarter to fourth quarter, it
looked very effective, was about 80% in relation to expenses to revenue reduction. But over the last year, when you
take out the litigation expense, it looks like operating expenses only declined about 20% of what revenues declined. So
I was just curious what you thought may be the right elasticity number would be there.

Page 18 of 21
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think largely what you saw in the fourth quarter was a reflection of the change in the
incentive levels due to the lower revenue, and you'd expect that to happen. But let me bring that up a little higher to a
more broader point which is about two or three years ago, Tom Montag and team made a fundamental restructuring of
that business to drop its expense base to where as long as we get $2.5 billion more revenues, more or less, we'd start
making some money. And if you adjust the FVA, which is the one-time charge, they made somewhere around $300
million this quarter to give you a sense. So in its worst quarter, it earns $300 million. In its best quarter, it earns over $1
billion and that largely is really marginally profitable when you see the revenues go from the high $2 billions to the,
say, $3 billion level up to the $4 billion level. Most of that comes through with a tariff on compensation of around 19%,
20% or something like that. So there's elasticity but as you get the lower level, you start to hit the floor on the fixed cost
structure.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: That's very helpful. And then, Brian, lastly, you've talked several times about the core
expenses and the investments you're making. A lot of the core businesses, really all except banking, showed declines in
net income sequentially and year-over-year. Do you feel like you're investing to try to reignite some of that growth
going forward?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes. One of the things you've got to be careful of is they reflect this – all these charges that
we talk about in NII get pushed out to all the businesses. So there's some elements of that really aren't in the businesses'
control, for lack of better term. And then secondly, you're still seeing, as we move from a period where reserve releases
were going on at the business level, you're seeing provision changes across the board that have it. But by and large, if
you look at the fees and the direct expenses, which are the two things they control the most, you see a pretty good
relationship going on and pretty good stability. And I'd say as you look across the businesses, the consumer bank
continues to make good progress on sales capabilities and its actual sales, you can look at some of the later pages you
can see it. As to Wealth Management, we've got to make sure the expenses and the revenue stay in line there. We
talked about that last quarter and John Thiel and the team, especially at Merrill Lynch, are doing a good job of getting
after that. And then on banking, I think you've seen a pretty good relationship if you back out the fundamental impacts
of FAS 91 and the provision, things like that which they – those are adjustments we make at the top of the house and
push through.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thanks.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. So you highlighted that the expenses are at the lowest levels since the Merrill merger and we
estimate that they are down almost one-fourth over five years so that's certainly good. But we also note that revenues
are down quite a bit over that timeframe too. So how do you evaluate the trade-off between more aggressive
restructuring and investing in the franchise? And specifically, you're pretty much done, I think, with New BAC. Would
you have a program maybe even newer BAC or a new restructuring plan?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, I'd say, Mike, the other piece of that is obviously the credit cost. You've got to think
about in terms of if you looked back and looked at the higher revenue levels at the time, the charge-off run rate was $2
billion and $3 billion a quarter. At one quarter, it was $10 billion, if you remember, for cards especially. So be careful
about that. But I would say, your point really is what you do from now forward, and we see that – we talk about the
core expense base, we've just had the LAS litigation, all that stuff, but just the core expense space. Basically, what we
continue to do is to take out nonproductive expenses and invest part of that back into the franchise and bring part of that
to the ability to see that quarter line continue to nudge down. Remember that when we're doing this, we're absorbing
healthy cost increases, wage and salary increases, incentive comp increases. So we are heavily focused on maintaining
a rational balance between the core revenue and the core expense dynamic going forward. And so you should expect –
assume that there's a continuous program of looking at this to continue to simplify our company, continue to take out

the vestiges of the cost of the crisis and as we downsize the company, take out the overhead that was harder to shake
out as you're well aware. So we're laser-focused on it. But I think on the other hand, we continue to invest in sales
capacity and you see that reflected in things like card sales and home equity sales and auto loans sales, direct auto loan
sales all increased.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So don't expect another new program with expense targets, it's more of a day-to-day perspective
now?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: No. Remember, we absorbed – if you think of 60% of our costs being people costs and you
think of inflationary level of cost increases of 3% on those, yeah, we basically to keep costs down and flattish, you got
to work your tail off. And whether – and that's the sort of process going forward. We had to drop the cost down to get
them to a reasonable level. We will continue to make improvement relative to revenues. And the world gets different.
We will then have to revisit it. But right now in this revenue environment, you have slow growth environment, we can
keep the cost flat as revenues start to rise.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then a separate question. What are your key financial targets for 2015? I know you've
expressed some of your targets, assuming interest rates increase. But if interest rates don't increase, what should
investors evaluate you on at the end of 2015? And all I had to go on without the higher interest rates is page 42 of the
proxy that talks about the PRSUs. And it says as long as you get over a 50 basis point ROA, you go in the money on
the PRSUs. So I'm not sure if I should be looking at the 50 basis point number, or it's 80 basis points, 100% in the
money, or the 1% number that you've talked about before. But again, assuming rates don't go up, what's your ROA and
ROE target for 2015?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Mike, we don't give specific projections but our goal is to continue to take earnings from
the $3 billion level this quarter and drive them forward. And our view is that based on everything we see as we see the
impact of all the work we're doing plus the rollover of the cost base, the reduction in LAS costs, the litigation falling
back to the kinds of levels you saw this quarter, you'll see us move towards that – those long-term goals of 1% ROA
and 12% return on tangible common equity.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: One last try. And so that 1% and 12%, that assumes higher interest rates. If your forecasts do
not expect higher interest rates as soon as they do right now, at what point would you take additional action with
expenses and how do you think about that?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We take additional action on expenses every afternoon. In other words, we have 4,000
reduction in FTE in the fourth quarter of 2014, Mike, out of the core franchise to keep getting efficient. So we're
working on expenses every day and we have teams of people working to do all the things that you expect us to do.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

And we can take our last question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Hi, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Two questions. Brian, I'm a little bit confused about the card growth. I think you said
you've got 1.2 million new cards out in the fourth quarter. Is that – and didn't you mention something about it being
seasonal? I mean you've got lots of ground that you can gain in that business, and I just want to clarify whether this is
something extraordinary going on here and what your projections are for the future for growth there.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, Nancy, sorry, if we confused you. Let's talk about the production of new card units.
That's the 1.2 million – it's 1.184 million. If you look on page 19, you can see that and you can see it building from the
fourth quarter 12,830 million – or 830,000. So the first is production of units and the second was balances. Balances in

the card business were up in the fourth quarter almost $3 billion, $2.5 billion to $3 billion. That we've got to be careful
because it's Christmas season, people spend and borrow and then they pay down.
So the point there was that had a little seasonal help to it, but if you look back in prior quarters, you've seen a stability
in our card balances, which as we continue to sell more units and people continue to use the card, we ought to expect a
positive growth there. But it's units at 1.2 million, balances grew at $2.5 billion to $3 billion and the balances are
common in seasonality. Units have been above 1 million new production units each quarter for the last several quarters.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Is there one particular card that's proving to be very popular? I mean I see your ads for the
cash-back cards, et cetera. Is that the card of choice at this point?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes, the cash – yes, that is our core card offering. We've simplified our offering to three or
four core products and that's the biggest one and it's contributing to sort of card income being up year-over-year by
about 7%, Bruce?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And so that card is selling well. And the good news is as you can see is 67% came through
basically our web online sales process and our branch sales process in the core customers. So we continue to drive it.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Secondly, the 25% margin in Wealth Management, I think back to the old days
when you had much fatter margins in that business. What do you see as a normalized margin in Wealth Management?
And number two, to what impact is the Wealth Management margin being maybe impacted by high liquidity levels that
customers are maintaining? And do you see that changing?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's a couple things to that, Nancy. I think the first is that we've said that over the course of
a couple of years that we need that Wealth Management margin to get to 30%. I think you've got a couple things going
on right now. In the low rate environment, that business has an artificial drag because as you know, you don't tend to
pay out compensation, which is a significant portion of the expense to those things that are net interest income related.
So we would expect, we also have in 2016 some deferred comp and other programs running off. So as we go through
over the course of the next couple years between the business growing and normalization of rate environment and some
other things that that should be a 30% type pre-tax margin business.
