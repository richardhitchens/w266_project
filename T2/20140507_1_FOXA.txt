MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 21st Century Fox Third Quarter 2014 Earnings
Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a
question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this
conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Please go ahead, sir.
Reed Nolte
Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings conference
call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Co-Chief Operating
Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer. First, we'll have some prepared remarks on the most recent
quarter and then will be happy to take questions from the investment community.
This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to 21st Century Fox's business and strategy.
Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company's Form 10-Q for the three months ended March
31, 2014, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by
the cautionary statements contained in such filings.

Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of, and a reconciliation of
such measures, can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Please note that certain financial measures
used in this call such as segment operating income and depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA and
adjusted earnings per share, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these
non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release. Also note that the historical results for periods prior to June
28, 2013, described in the press release and on this call have been adjusted to reflect the separation that was completed
at the end of fiscal 2013.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to John.
John P. Nallen
Thanks, Reed, and good afternoon. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, our third quarter results reflect
solid financial growth across the company, resulting in double-digit percentage increases in total company revenues,
segment EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share. We recorded third quarter fiscal 2014 revenue for the total
company of $8.22 billion, which is up 12% from a year-ago on the strength of our Cable Network, the broadcast of this
year's Super Bowl, and continued growth at Sky Deutschland.
Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.79 billion, a 14% increase over the $1.57 billion reported a year
ago. This increase reflects strong growth at the company's Cable Network and Television segments as well as a modest
increase in Film segment contributions. These EBITDA improvements were partially offset by lower DBS contribution.
Overall, unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced our EBITDA growth rate by approximately 2%.
This year's third quarter reflected the recognition of various tax benefits which reduced our overall effective tax rate in
the quarter to approximately 20% and approximately 25% for the nine months. As we indicated during our Investor
Day last August, we expect that, going forward, our annual tax rate will be around the low-30% range.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $1.07
billion or $0.47 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years, of amounts reflected in Other, net, and our
gains from participating in BSkyB share repurchase program, third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.47 this year versus
$0.32 in the prior year.
Now let me provide some additional context on the performance at a few of our segments, and let's start with the Cable
Network segment where total segment revenues in the third quarter increased 11% from last year, highlighted by a 12%
increase in affiliate revenues and 6% advertising growth. From an affiliate fee perspective, domestic affiliate fees
increased 12%, primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX, and Fox News, as well as the benefit from the
[indiscernible] (4:39) launch of our new channels, FS1 and FXX.
Our reported international affiliate fees were also up 12% with strong local currency growth of about 21%, reflecting
increases at the Fox International Channels that were partially offset by unfavorable currency movements, primarily in
Latin America.
Third quarter advertising revenue growth at the Cable segment reflects domestic advertising increases of 8% led by
double-digit gains at Fox News. At the International Channels, reported advertising revenue increased 4%. Local
currency ad revenues were up 14%, but this was partially offset by unfavorable currency movements led by India.
Total Cable segment EBITDA in the quarter of $1.18 billion was up 10% over prior-year level. We had very strong
underlying EBITDA growth at the RSNs, Fox News, FIC, STAR Entertainment, and the FX channels. The particular
strength at the FX channels included higher contributions from the SVOD sales of their series to Amazon, and lower
programming costs from the shift of the start date for some original series to later in the quarter as compared to last
year.
Our overall Cable segment EBITDA growth rate of 10% reflects growth of 13% at our domestic channels and a slight
decline at our International Channels, principally from unfavorable foreign currency movements and the impact of our

planned investment in STAR Sports in India. Combined, foreign currency and the new channel initiatives negatively
impacted Cable segment EBITDA growth this quarter by 6%, with the channel launches on their own impacting growth
by 2%, and that was primarily from the incremental investment in STAR Sports. Additionally, the EBITDA
contribution from the consolidation of the YES Network this year was substantially offset by the negative comparative
impact of similarly unique items from a year ago.
At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $288 million increased 32% from last year's result on revenue
increases of 27%. This revenue growth was driven by our broadcast of this year's Super Bowl, which generated
approximately $350 million in revenues, and from continued growth in retransmission consent revenue. These
increases more than offset the impact of lower general entertainment ratings.
Turning to our Film segment. Third quarter EBITDA of $354 million was up 6% from a year ago. This quarter's results
include increased contributions from our television production businesses driven by significantly higher SVOD revenue
from the sale of various series to Amazon, including 24, The Americans, and How I Met Your Mother, as well is the
syndication of Modern Family. This growth was partially offset by the pre-release costs of Rio 2, which was released
after the quarter.
Our DBS segment recorded EBITDA of $58 million in the quarter as compared to $91 million in the prior year. This
decline reflects reduced contributions from Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland, principally from higher exclusive sports
costs at each platform, namely, the Sochi Olympics at Sky Italia and Bundesliga soccer at Sky D. At Sky Italia, local
currency revenues in the quarter were similar to a year ago as a slight ARPU increase was offset by lower average
subscribers for the period. Quarter-end subs at Sky Italia of 4.75 million were essentially unchanged from the end of
December. Sky D reported ARPU gains of 4% and a year-over-year direct subscriber increase of 326,000, yielding 3.73
million subs at quarter end.
Now turning to our cash flow. You'll see that our operating cash flow for the first nine months of this year is behind the
year-ago levels. The main operating factors driving this are our planned increased investment in film and television
production, increased sports rights payments, and the increased acquisition of series and movies across our channels
and platforms in support of long-term growth.
Now before I turn to our guidance, let me give you a quick update on our buyback and the Australian Securities
Exchange delisting process. Since the date of the separation, we've been consistently repurchasing FOX A shares
resulting in approximately $3.2 billion of repurchases from July 1 through yesterday. We remain on-track to complete
the $4 billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe we previously announced. With regards to the delisting process,
May 1 was the last day that our shares traded on the ASX. The process completes itself tomorrow with all Fox shares
now trading solely in the U.S. market.
So finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2014 total segment EBITDA growth. Since our last earnings call three
months ago, we've updated our operational assumptions to reflect our first nine months' performance and our outlook
for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Our third quarter ended up a little stronger than we had anticipated, primarily due to timing changes between the third
and fourth quarter results. This primarily reflects the earlier deliveries of content to SVOD distributors, including the
recent sale to Amazon. That said, we continue to anticipate a good quarter of growth in our fourth quarter which will be
led by this year's comparatively stronger film releases including Rio 2 and X-Men: Days of Future Past. Considering all
of these factors and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we continue to expect that our total
segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2014 will be in the mid- to high-single-digit range above the $6.26
billion total segment EBITDA base level of fiscal 2013.
This is consistent with the guidance update [indiscernible] (11:32) three months ago and, as I indicated on our last call,
overall, the consolidation of the YES Network results for only four months this year does not materially impact our
current fiscal year outlook.
With that, I'll turn it to Chase.

Charles G. Carey
Okay. Thank you, John. The third quarter was a solid quarter and we're on track with our revised guidance. We're also
frequently asked if we expect to hit our longer-term EBITDA target of $9 billion in fiscal 2016. The simple answer is,
yes. Despite the benefit of an extra half year of the YES Network, we acknowledge that to achieve that 2016 target we
will have to overcome foreign currency headwinds and challenges at the FBC Entertainment Network that we did not
plan for last August. Together, all these items adversely impact our August assumptions by north of $200 million;
however, we'll have to work a bit harder but we expect to hit our target.
In our core cable channel networks business, we continue to execute on our expansion plans with newer networks, Fox
Sports 1, FXX and new international sports networks all gaining strength in programming and distribution. As we've
indicated in the past, these networks will take a couple years to build but the momentum we're seeing makes us
confident that the investments we've made will build long-term value for shareholders and consumers alike.
Similarly, we're pleased to increase our ownership of the YES Network now at 80%, enabling its financial and
operational consolidation and increasing our total portfolio of managed regional sports networks to 22. Across our
cable channels business, we're in great shape. FX continues to impress with its original series that are transforming FX
into a standout must-have brand. The Americans is delivering strong results, ranking as a top basic cable drama in key
demos. We believe the new season of The Americans is benefiting from our innovative partnership with Amazon,
which enable us to not only more deeply monetize our content, but also enable viewers to catch up on the prior season.
The third installment of the American Horror Story franchise, Coven, built on the success of the first two storylines and
concluded its season as FX's most-watched original series. In addition, Justified continued its run as a breakthrough
series, ranking consistently as one of the top scripted dramas on basic cable.
We're also at the start of launching a number of new exciting series. Fargo recently premiered and the 10-part limited
series is off to a strong start, averaging approximately four million total viewers for its first two weeks. And we look
forward to premier this summer of new series, Tyrant, from the creator for Homeland, and The Strain, from acclaimed
director, Guillermo del Toro.
Fox News continues to dominate as the only cable news network that drove an increase in both viewership and demo in
primetime. We're more convinced than ever that Fox News' commitment to developing fresh shows with a unique edge
is key to its success. The O'Reilly Factor, The Kelly File, and The Five, are all examples of this commitment.
Fox International Channels is also performing well with successful new launches spanning the Fox channel in Hungary,
Fox Sports 2 in Brazil and Italy, and Nat Geo People in Germany. In March, the Fox channel outside the United States
reached its highest viewership level ever, up 15% year-on-year, and up 9% from February and nearly double the
viewership of Fox's nearest global competitor.
At the Fox Network, we continue to face challenges despite continued growth in retransmission revenue and a
substantial boost in the quarter from the most-watched Super Bowl in history. While the sports side continues to be
strong, the performance of the entertainment network remains disappointing. American Idol, while a significantly
improved show in our opinion, simply did not attract the following we had anticipated or the ratings we had hoped for.
The key moving forward is to ramp-up our commitment to bringing viewers standout, must-have programming, shows
that are unexpected and that have the power to really breakthrough.
We're moving away from the decades-old rules of the broadcast business and prioritizing our resources, management,
and marketing to make sure the programs we air reach their fullest potential. In a world of infinite choice, the need for
breakthrough programming has never been greater. We're also being more opportunistic about what we bring to air,
looking to create big event-type shows like 24: Live Another Day, which premiered on Monday to strong results.
With our upfront presentations scheduled for Monday next week, we'll let our network executives unveil our detailed
strategies and lineup for next season. Generally, we anticipate the upfront market will be similar to last year. We
continue to believe that Fox is a network that truly stands out. It's youthful, unique, and edgy, and has a proven history
of surprising audiences with shows that redefine the TV viewing experience. None of that has changed.

The industry push towards C7 ratings continues to be a priority. We believe more deals against the C7 rating currency
will prove lucrative. Even with a small lift, as experienced in our freshman series, Cosmos, which shows [ph] 0.3%
(17:06) percentage of a point increase, underscores the potential of real incremental revenue.
Let me now turn to our content business where we're seeing real momentum at the film studio. After a few challenging
quarters, we feel we've turned the tide. Rio 2 from our animation studio, Blue Sky Studios, had a strong showing
domestically and continues to rule the international box office since release, approaching $400 million in global box
office. In addition, The Grand Budapest Hotel has been a critical and commercial success for Fox Searchlight, and The
Other Woman has exceeded expectations. The success of these films, which appeal to vastly different segments of the
film market, underscore the diversity of our film product and 20th Century Fox's ability to create and market films
across the audience spectrum. We're also optimistic about the upcoming releases of X-Men: Days of Future Past, The
Fault in Our Stars, and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, all of which we believe will perform incredibly well.
Our television studio continues to exemplify the benefits of being a content owner in a world with expanding digital
options for consumers. Our ability to more deeply monetize our television offerings in the SVOD market continues to
expand with the evolving digital marketplace. This past quarter's record SVOD revenue was a testament to the strength
of our product.
Our DBS platforms also continue to make demonstratable progress. Last month, Sky Italia signed a deal with Telecom
Italia enabling the distribution of Sky's premium programming to Telecom's broadband customers, adding a new
market of potential viewers that are unable to install a satellite dish. Sky Deutschland continues to build on its
leadership position with year-over-year subscriber additions, driven by investments in exclusive programming, product
innovation, and customer service. And we feel confident that Sky D is on track for accelerated growth this year.
In addition to our specific business activities, we're also focused on broader industry trends and events including
consolidation within the pay-TV industry and the development of over-the-top offerings. While none of these items
will materially impact our financial and operational targets in the near-term, we can assure you we are extremely
focused on their evolution and our response to the challenges or opportunities these issues represent. Needless to say,
we are still fully convinced that there's no better time to be in the content creation and distribution business.
Now I'd like to turn it back to Reed.
Reed Nolte
Thank you, Chase. And now Chase, James, and John would be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thanks. I guess one for Chase and one for James. Chase, when you think about things that
can make a difference in the next year, particularly I guess on the cable networks, The Simpsons seems like one thing
for FXX. Can you just talk about some of the drivers in the year ahead and how quickly can something, like a unique
product like The Simpsons, have an impact? And for James, I was hoping you could address this constant, just
never-ending speculation that your European satellite platforms will consolidate in one form or another? Can you give
current views on why it does or does not make sense?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I guess in terms of next year, and I do think it's an important year for the new networks, I
mean both with FXX where The Simpsons will launch, I think that's a defining event for The Simpsons. And I mean it's
a defining event for business because one of the – as we said before, one of the unique things we got with The

Simpsons is really an expanded, really almost a unique set of digital rights to really build the type of consumer
experience that we think for many of us will be a template for the business going forward. I think equally on the sport
side, I think we said before on – in looking domestically, certainly Fox Sports 1, a lot of our events start next year. So I
mean – we're really just starting into baseball, NASCAR, the big events move in next year, the U.S. Open Golf and
USGA Golf, the World Cup next summer.
So in many ways, we're sort of still ramping up that entire schedule and that's not to say – I mean, obviously, every
channel has certainly agendas and objectives it's looking to achieve, but I think probably you start to think what could
be the biggest change, it's probably the newest networks, and in many ways the same issues certainly in the
International Channels as well.
And I think probably the other business I guess you'd look at is the DBS business, which really – I think as we've talked
about, we've been working hard to transform Italy in a way to get its cost reset and to work through a period to re-instill
a level of growth into that business, and I think the team there has done a really good job sort of addressing both the
cost and the challenge of an economy that's still clearly has its challenges, even some of the political movements there
give it a little bit of hope.
And I think with Germany, they just had a call this morning, I think, and it communicated there, the continued strength
there and the belief they can step up a notch in terms of the growth of those businesses. So I guess that's sort of looking
at some of the places where there are important kind of developments occurring, that would be part of the [ph] lift
(23:14).
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Yeah. And, Jessica, it's James here. On your other question, look, I think we answered
this question in the past and I think I'd answer it in a similar way today, we've made no secret of our belief over the
years that we think the Skys are strong together. But that said, currently our focus is on operating each of those
businesses as best we can. Each of the marketplaces that we operate in are competitive and are very dynamic and we're
seeing right now the business is in very, very good shape, I think as Chase just mentioned, good growth in Germany. In
Italy, I think the business is creatively very strong, and while the subscriber numbers are flat on an overall basis, that's a
good place to be relative to the last two years and I think the churn numbers in particular are very encouraging. And in
the U.K., at BSkyB, seeing good growth across the board with respect to all of our products as well as creatively what's
being put on air. So as to the larger picture, there are no current or immediate plans and we're just focused on operating
the business as best we can.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Jessica. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Yes. We'll now go to the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thanks. John, as we look at the free cash flow outlook for the company, and
particularly as everyone's focused on your leverage targets out in 2016, can you just talk about the sort of pace of
investment in content? I think the last two years you've had some pretty big negative working capital swings as you've
gone into big production cycles. Does that unwind in fiscal 2015 and should we see free cash flow snap-back and then
grow along with EBITDA? Can you give us any color on the sort of pacing and sizing of these dollars, which are pretty
big?
<A - John P. Nallen>: I don't want to give you guidance and forecast for 2015. We'll do that in August. But
directionally I can tell you, Ben, we would expect to continue to invest particularly in production and channels in 2015.
I think we were pretty clear, many months ago, about the fact that we're still building – 2015 is still a building year for
three big initiatives in Fox Sports 1, FXX, and most notably STAR Sports in India. So I would see 2015 as a year
where we'll continue to invest in our growth, maybe not at similar levels as 2014, but you'll continue to see investment.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: And you're talking specifically through the balance sheet?

<A - John P. Nallen>: Through the balance sheet, yes.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Got it. Okay. And then as a follow up, picking up on that theme; maybe, James, can
you just remind us, as we think about STAR Sports, what the next sort of investment – what the investment cycle looks
like from here? Where are we in your sports commitment and how long do those run? And how are you feeling about
the position you've built from a rights perspective in that market?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Well, I think – thanks, Ben. First of all, I think we feel pretty good about the rights
investment that we're making there. Obviously, we have a long-term agreement with the BCCI for domestic Indian
national team cricket and that's really the sort of backbone of the cricket offering there. The Champions League
Twenty20 is also a long-term deal and we've said we've been clear in the past that that is a deal that we inherited in the
ESPN STAR Sports transaction and is of a high cost. And then you have the ICC World Cup in cricket, which is a little
bit lumpy. But I think 2016 is really the big year of that, so it's really after that that you see that STAR Sports business
in India start to deliver meaningful growth to STAR India.
Overall, I think the STAR Sports business in India is really coming along well. The integration has gone well. In the
last number of months, there were some – a time period before we could move the operations from Singapore to India,
and all of the new broadcasts have performed very strongly. So we feel pretty good about it, but I think you've got to
anticipate, particularly in cricket rights, a reasonable cost continuing with the big one being in 2016 with the ICC
Cricket World Cup.
Operator
And we'll now go to the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Oh, hi. Thanks a lot. I wanted to talk a little bit about domestic affiliate fees, if I could. It's
clearly one of the major growth drivers in your guidance the next three years. And I'm just wondering, as you look at
some of the specific incremental line items, like Fox Sports 1 or like FXX, specifically on the distribution side, or like
retrans, which I guess is different than affiliate fees. You can make a case for all of them. What I'd love to hear is, do
we need to be thinking about any trade-offs there in terms of crowding out, being able to get one – get all of those
things or have to make choices with your distribution partners on which things you prioritize? Or is it reasonable to
think that you can make progress on sort of all of those initiatives at the same time?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Look, I've – to me it's pretty clear. I mean, I think we expect to make headway on all of the
initiatives. I mean – and we've talked in the past – again, one of the things I think we've tried to do is to create and
make sure every channel really is a channel that stands on its own two feet. I think, if you go back enough – if you go
back a while, and I would've said I think we had some niche channels or channels that, in a world that has as many
choices as this, didn't have enough strength and wherewithal to sort of carry their own weight. And that sort of led us to
relaunch a number of channels, which evolved into Fox Sports 1 and FXX. And really to evolve our channels into sort
of a handful of core categories around the news, led by Fox News, with Fox Business [ph] rounding (29:19) it out,
FXX, which again as I've said before, I think stands apart in the entertainment universe. Clearly, the uniqueness of
sports, and National Geographic, which is a brand that again resonates around the world.
So I think what we really focused on is making sure we don't have channels that are baggage that are being dragged
along by other locomotive channels that you have to make those trade-offs, that we have channels that in each case are
channels that have a real audience or have real strength and really can get fair value competitively for what they are in
the marketplace and invest in the channels, we're not – I think it is important that we make those channels strong. I
think leadership and hit programming continue to stand-out and have disproportionately important value and high-value
and I think if we can create the type of distinctive hit programming we do at Fox News or in FX, we think we should be
getting fair value for those, and I think that is certainly the path we're on.
<Q - Todd Juenger>: Excellent.

We'll now go to the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. Chase, I was wondering if you could give a little more color on the
domestic ad environment, the stations may be kind of pacing in the current quarter, also pricing at the network,
cancellation options versus the prior quarter and maybe a year ago. And then on the cable networks you have a lot
going on there with some of the new launches, so even just looking backward in 3Q, domestically, if you exclude the
new launches FS1, FXX, the acquisition of YES, can you kind of give us a sense of core same channel ad growth and
how it looks sequentially in the current quarter? Thanks very much.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I would say, I think in the [indiscernible] (31:16) the ad market, in general, I mean I think
nationally it's okay. I mean it's sort of – and again you still have which I think has been the truth for a while and
continues to be a limited visibility going forward. And it goes up and down a little bit. I mean it was sort of down a
little bit at the end of the calendar year. It got a little stronger, it got a little weaker. Actually the last three or four weeks
I'd say it's a little stronger. So I think it's been okay. I wouldn't call it robust but it's up, it's an okay market. I think the
local market probably a little softer. I would say the local market right now is probably sort a flattish. I mean we'll get
some political spending as we get later into the calendar year. We don't have a lot yet, but. So they're not that that
dissimilar but I'd say the local market is probably a little softer than the national market, but probably again sort of the
market being flattish. Scatter's okay, I mean scatter pricing's okay. So, yeah, I think it's okay. Again, you don't have
long-term visibility to it. It's clearly driven by some sectors but...
<Q - David Bank>: Cancellation options?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: ...yeah, I think on the options again nothing sort of – I mean I think it's sort of pretty much
business as it's been. I mean there's nothing sort of out of the ordinary either way so it's sort of been sort of consistent
with what historical patterns would be. I think in the cable market, again, we've got a mixed bag, so it's not always the
same. Actually – I think that's actually been pretty good. I think FX has continued to strengthen and to stand out, I think
Fox News had a nice quarter on every level. So I don't think – I think on the new networks, I don't – again, I think our
focus is not sort of – I mean look we want to maximize ad dollars, but the focus really is on the new networks is where
are they going to be in two years not sort of what the ad revenue we can get out of them this quarter. I mean I'm not
saying we don't care. The new networks would not be material just because where they are in their life, they would not
be materially affecting our ad growth. They have advertising dollars and it will grow and it's important to us, but again
the priority for those networks is really where do we – getting them to the right place in the next couple of years.

And we'll now go to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Thanks. I have three pretty quick ones. James, can you do me a favor? I thought the
World Cup of Cricket was in 2015 but it's actually 2016, is that what you guys are saying?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: You're right. At the end of fiscal 2015, so it's just before the – the cost falls just at the
end of 2015. I misspoke.
<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay, cool. Secondly, Chase, [indiscernible] (34:03) weeks or days, I mean getting
some calls from clients and reporters about the status of your contracts and whether or not you're leaving, so given all
you've said about the future, can you just update on where you stand with your own contacts?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Sure. Very simple. Rupert and I have an understanding and a new agreement. We've simply
not gotten it on paper yet and the reason is we're focused on building the business. But we have a clear understanding
of where we're going.

<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: Okay, thanks. And last one is for John. If you look at your domestic cable expenses this
year, they're really lumpy, so you've grown 21%,16%, I think like 10% now. When you look at the last quarter of the
year, what's the right cable expense growth to think about for the last quarter given the YES Network's coming on as
well? So where in the ballpark of growth should we think about it for the fourth quarter?
<A - John P. Nallen>: I think if you look at the first half of the year, as you indicated, we had – anniversarying some
acquisitions from a year ago which increased the comparative cost base. This quarter, you don't have that impact
because everything is like-for-like. So really if you use that as a guidepost, the biggest difference next quarter is the
inclusion of YES in cable. So I think that's directionally how you should think about Q4 expense growth.
Operator
We'll now go to the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Thanks. I just want to continue on the cable expense, especially when you look at it globally and
with the new sports [ph] rights (35:43) that are coming through. So – but if you sort of – you've suggested that your
long-term guidance is intact, can you sort of talk about the cadence of growth 2014, 2015, 2016 on the, at least on the
cost side, so obviously, we'll see what happens on the revenue side.
<A - John P. Nallen>: I think if you look – and again we're not going to give guidance at this moment towards 2015
and 2016. But from a macro standpoint, as against 2014, we'll continue to – we continue to invest in the new channels,
Fox Sports 1, FXX and most notably, something we've called out consistently, the step-up in STAR Sports, principally
around cricket and most notably again in that regard, the World Cup. So you will see an increase in costs next year
focused on these big initiatives, but as far as the exact percentage and all of that, I think we'll address that on our next
call.
Operator
We'll now go to the line of Alan Gould with Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alan S. Gould>: Thank you. I was wondering if you could break-out for us or give us some quantification of the
magnitude of the SVOD revenue that you've recognized this quarter, well, in both the TV area and the Cable Network
area.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I don't think we probably really get that granular on it. Look, I mean, we did have a
material SVOD event with the Amazon transaction this quarter, so. And I think the SVOD revenue, because of when
products sold, probably is not going to be a constant quarter-to-quarter. So, at least we ought to anticipate that. But –
and it was up – it's a meaningful number, but I don't think we sort of generally break-out that type of
segment-by-segment revenue for each of our businesses. But I think we did have a – it was a benefit to the quarter.
But we – I think we feel good about where we are and we have – certainly have some fundamentals, multi-year
agreements in place that we'll continue to drive that, it's been an area of growth for us. We expect it to continue to be an
area of growth. I mean, this does – Amazon seems to be stepping up. Hulu has done a couple of transactions so it's
becoming a more aggressive player in the marketplace. So again, we're certainly excited about that as well as potential
broader developments in the over-the-top market. But...
<Q - Alan S. Gould>: Chase, if I could just follow up on that. What inning would you say we're in, in terms of the
SVOD market? Do you think there – I mean, how much growth is there ahead...
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Well, I guess – I mean...
<Q - Alan S. Gould>: ...in general terms?

<A - Charles G. Carey>: ...my personal view, I think I think – I mean, I guess I do view in some ways the SVOD
market as a subset of a larger digital marketplace. So I think if you really looked at – if you want to define the market
as players that are in it today, you certainly have a lot of growth left internationally. I mean, you've got one player that's
clearly got a leadership position in the U.S. in terms of Netflix. Amazon and Hulu, certainly continuing to step-up I
think much earlier than really from the first or second inning internationally. But I actually think the really appropriate
way is to look at it really in development of all these digital initiatives and digital offerings, and I was talking about
something like The Simpsons where FX essentially bought the SVOD rights, and therefore FX is going to develop its
own extensions of digital experiences around The Simpsons franchise and other products it owns.
So I think if you sort of define it as the broader universe, I think you're in the early innings of the broader development
of these digital franchises. But I think if you really define it narrowly or obviously in the U.S. market you're further
along. You're not in the latter innings, but you're certainly further along if you define it in a very narrow context. So I
think that's misleading but I think this market will continue to evolve. I think it's one of the – the real opportunity about
digital is because of the flexibility of that, and the ability to do and try new things, I think things could evolve pretty
fast. And I think there could be opportunities that may not have been apparent a few months ago that all of a sudden
emerge and become a new opportunity to develop and monetize and exploit key – if you have the right content and
brands.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Alan. The next question, please?
Operator
We'll next go to the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Hi. Thanks. First for Chase, along the theme of digital, in terms of ad supported digital, I
think when you look at all the delayed video viewing that's going on out there, be it DVR, let's say, post three days,
Hulu, the full episode players, free VOD. I mean the pie of viewership could very well be expanding and higher than
what it was in just the live viewership world. But when you just kind of look around at the ad slowdown that we seem
to be – maybe the slight or modest ad slowdown that we seem to be seeing in the industry, I'm wondering why this kind
of delayed viewership uplift is not really monetizing as well as we might have hoped? And where do you see the
biggest opportunity, in terms of perhaps monetizing that digital uplift, if you will?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Well, I think it's really simple. I mean, I think there's no question the advertising side of our
world has not caught up with the shifts in viewership. And today we're not measuring it close to well enough, we're not
exploiting it close to well enough, we're not developing new technologies like targeting well enough. And, to me, that's
an enormous opportunity and challenge. I mean, we need to clearly do a much better job of monetizing this viewership
and the viewership is clearly moving to a multi-platform, multi-device experience. And, as we've said, C7 is not the
goal. C7 is just to me a small step in a direction that at the end of the day has to get us to a place where we can
monetize every view on every platform. We can deliver the messages in more valued ways, whether that means
targeting or whether that means native or whether that means other forms of advertising messages that resonate with the
consumer.
And if you want to talk about where we are in that game, we're not even in the first inning as far as developing really
the ad opportunity. So I think what you're seeing is sort of – to me, it's a glass half-full. I do think the viewership is, and
the popularity of the product, it's stronger than ever because of the ability to access on all of these devices and we're
just not – it's all of us. We're part of that. I'm not blaming others. We're part of the mix. We're not doing a good enough
job yet today to capture that viewership and monetize that viewership. And as we do it, I think there's an enormous
opportunity because really [indiscernible] (42:57) our products – I think it's never been more popular. Everybody talks
about the shift of viewership to digital platforms and the like, and what do they want to watch on digital platforms? It's
our content and our brand. So we've just got to figure out – we've got to do a better job of capturing and monetizing the
value of that.

<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Understood, understood. Thanks. And quickly, we get this question from investors a lot
in terms of – and this is for either yourself, Chase, or James, asking is there anything about the political situation in the
U.K. that, in terms of political headwinds, that would give you guys any relief and allow you to contemplate, trying
again to go down the path for BSkyB? Anything there that we should think about in terms of the regulatory
environment in the U.K.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Look, I don't want to comment on the politics or anything like that. But the broader
point is just we don't have any plans to revisit that anytime – right now, there's no current plan to do that, so it's not
really worth kind of engaging on. But from a regulatory impediment perspective, I think, as we argued a few years ago,
we don't believe that there is one.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Anthony. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Thank you. So one of your peers that operates a RSN in the tri-state area said that there
was softness in subscribers in the March quarter. So I was wondering if you saw anything like that at all and if you
could more broadly comment on the subscriber trend in your RSNs? And another quick question is, senior executives
from FBC were saying that they wanted to change the way pilot season goes. So I was wondering if that has any
implications on financials for the Television segment and how does that change your upfront process? Thank you.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think in terms of subscribers, [ph] what I guess is they (45:03) – and I don't know that we
even have the numbers for March yet. So I'm not sure that I even have the – at least I don't think I have the quarter
trends. I think the subscriber world sort of continues to be pretty flat. I mean I think that's sort of what it's been and I
think right now that sort of – I guess I'm thinking over the last few quarters, but the last 12 months I think started a
pretty mature market and then a pretty flat market. And I don't think our RSNs would be different than our other
businesses, so it's a general comment on it, not on RSN specifically. I don't have RSN sub numbers specifically, but
again I'd say in general it's pretty flat.
I think in terms of the comment on pilots, I mean first, it's not financially driven. I don't think that comment was
financially driven and I don't think it's not going to – what he was referring to would not materially change the financial
plans for the business.
And again, what I think he was referring to was really part of a general which probably in some places we've got I think
twisted a little bit different than was meant because we still make pilots. The broadcast business is operating within an
overly rigid set of rules in a world today that sort of has players operating opportunistically by whatever set of rules
make sense, and I think that was really the message and there are places we'll have a pilot, there are places we won't.
But we're not going to have every show that starts to be developed September with a script and order a pilot in the
winter and then sit there at this time of year and look at all the pilots and pick shows we put on the air in September.
We'll have some shows that do that. We'll have some shows in the middle that begin with a pilot just to get a sense of
the show. Some shows we really believe in and we will go right to a straight order of 6, 10, 13. And I think we'll do
what makes sense which in some ways is the cable business has done for a long time and I think that was the message
that we need to operate our business with a lot more flexibility and agility and without the constraints of decades-old
rules, but it wasn't really a financially-driven statement and that wouldn't really change the financial plan for the
network.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Vasily. Can we have the next question, please?

The next question is from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Hi. Thank you. Just following up on your earlier comments on measurements a few
minutes ago. When Nielsen finally launches its cross-platform measurement rating system, I would assume you get a
national lift in ratings since you'll be capturing viewership that before wasn't monetized. I guess do you think that might
be a significant lift? Do you think advertisers will give you credit for it? I guess any color on that would be great.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think any of those changes are going to be sort of over time. They're not going to be – it
will take time with any of it. I mean you've got a lot of parties involved there, whether that's to measure it effectively as
well as to sell it as advertisers. But the bottom line with advertisers is we have to get credit for it and [ph] if it has
(48:16) viewership, it has value. And we are delivering that and we'll work through it. It doesn't mean we won't have to
work through with the advertisers just as right now we're doing with where we're trying to move from C3 to C7. It's a
process we have to work through. I think everybody understands there are issues around it that we have to address
constructively, but at the end of the day, that viewership has value and we need to make sure we can monetize that
value in a fair way.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: And just a follow up on FS1, I think there was a cancellation of a show recently, I guess
any sort of big-picture comments if you feel you're still on track to the guide you gave last summer? Or is it really just
too early to tell given you have a lot more rights coming onboard later this year and then after that you'll have a better
picture of sort of where you are?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, and I sort of – I think we've said and I said before, FS1 is really something I think
[indiscernible] (49:13) couple years, not a couple quarters and I think we said upfront, there'll be – I mean the nature of
building one of these networks, there are things that work and there are things that don't, and in reality there's probably
more than don't than do, and you work through that, you make changes, you think of things that work and don't work,
you launch new things or fix them if you you think it makes sense to do so. Building a network is hard work and we've
done it with really most of our networks were built whether it's Fox News or FX, and if you go back and look at it
usually the first couple years are the Fox Network. I hate to look at the lineup – go back and look at the lineup in 1988
or 1987 of the original Fox Network. You've got to fight through it and again, yes, it's fully within our expectations and
I think the issue is – and the real measure is where we are in two to three years.
Operator
We'll now go to the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Thank you. Good afternoon. Chase, you mentioned focus on the development of over-the-top
offerings, and I'm curious as to whether you are interested in participating in the Personal Subscription service that
DISH has introduced and has Disney onboard with. Is that something you're actively discussing participating in? And
maybe more broadly, how do you think about protecting the ecosystem while still allowing some of your content to
perhaps be used for an over-the-top system? And then just, John, if you don't mind, could you help us with the size of
the impact of YES on EBITDA in the coming year and maybe also on earnings, given some purchase accounting?
That'd be great. Thanks.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I guess that – and I'm not going to comment on any one specific over-the-top offering. I
think as a general statement what I'd say, I think we feel it's important for us to talk to any of the players that are
expressing interest in developing over-the-top offerings, and understand what's the opportunity there and how does it
make sense. And I think one of the primary things we do want to focus on is the second issue you raised which is, we're
looking for – I mean for us, if we're going to do something, it's important that it's enlarging the business. It's not a
substitution product, it's a product that adds and brings something new with a value to the marketplace, and there are a
lot of ways players can do that. And I think if there are opportunities, then those are the ones we want to pursue.
But I think it is – we're going to be disciplined about it, and it's the same thing as sort of certainly with the SVOD
market emerged. I think we felt it was important that we approach these opportunities in a disciplined way that really

makes sure we're enlarging the overall business for us, not just creating products that undermine each other. So I think
it is sort of goal number one, make sure these over-the-top offerings – we're bringing something new and exciting to the
marketplace and engage the consumer to do more, or engage a consumer we don't capture today.
<A - John P. Nallen>: And then dealing with YES, and as you know it's really an addition to our portfolio of RSNs,

<A - Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Mike. Operator, at this point we have time for one more question, please.
Operator
And our last question of the day will come from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tim W. Nollen>: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in at the end. My question was also about the issue of
measurement. And as we're in the digital upfronts now and the TV upfronts starting in a couple of weeks, there are a lot
of new measurement products really very much on the market, Nielsen and comScore. And I was just wondering if you
could talk about what is going on specifically now, whether it's you guys or in the market in general about actually
adopting C7, how meaningful that would be to your ad revenue base, OCR for Nielsen or VCE for comScore, all these
things that actually are here on the market now. How much can these actually make a difference in the upcoming cable
and broadcast season?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Look, we're engaged with all of them. I mean, I think we want – I think we are frustrated in
some ways, not that we don't have to do a better job ourselves. But an array of these things – and it isn't just
measurement and [ph] it's going to take (54:08) capabilities to do, to deliver more value through other – utilizing some
of these capabilities.
But, so we're engaged with all of them. Look, the opportunity is enormous. I mean it's not going to be enormous in 12
months, I mean, it's – it'll grow over time. But you have clearly a significant level of viewership, and you look at the lift
we get today on some of our shows where over half the viewership is not on a linear network anymore. I mean, that
speaks to the opportunity. And if we can go beyond that and start to take – create VOD offerings that have an appeal
that attracts the consumer to them instead of a DVR, that sort of further expands our ability to capture whether that's
through choice or recommendations or other experiences that enable us to drive viewers to find their preferred option
for viewing programming as in the types we experiences we can develop for them that enable us to maximize the value
of that content.
But again, I think all you need to do is look at the shift in viewer ship as it's gone to these platforms, particularly on
selected shows, and I think that speaks to the opportunity that exists. And, again, I don't want to be misrepresenting that
sort of somehow this is in the next 12 months. I think it could be something that's additive in the next 12 months, but I
think in the longer-term it's a tremendously important opportunity for us.
