Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2014. In Cable, we added Video subscribers
again this quarter, grew broadband subscribers at a continued industry-leading pace, and once again generated very
strong growth in Business Services. NBCUniversal was even better, with significant ratings momentum at NBC
broadcast, highlighting the quarter, along with really strong film results. Overall, revenue increased nearly 14%,
operating cash flow increased 10%, and we generated over $2.8 billion in free cash flow.
Starting with Cable, we continue to focus on innovation to position ourselves for the future and our customer metrics
are responding with meaningful improvement in Triple Play penetration. In Video, we added 24,000 customers, the
second quarter in a row where we have added customers. In High-Speed Data, we added 383,000 customers and grew
revenues at our fastest rate in two years. And in Business Services, revenue growth remained strong at nearly 24%,
impressive, given that we are now approaching $4 billion in annual run rate revenues.
We believe our X1 operating system provides our customers an unrivaled experience, making it easier to discover and
enjoy tens of thousands of content choices, while at the same time integrating apps and social media, and consumers
really like this experience. Voluntary churn for our X1 customers is down 20% to 30% relative to our broader base,
while viewing has increased in both linear and through On Demand and the metrics continue to get better. These
positive early results reinforce our decision to accelerate our X1 deployment this year, and we are now adding 15,000
to 20,000 X1 boxes per day, which is double our rate of deployment from just six months ago.
Additionally, we are now rolling out a new XFINITY TV app, which enables our customers to live stream virtually
their entire television line-up on any IP device in the home and watch DVR recordings in the home or on the go. In
broadband, we recently increased speeds again for the 13th time in 12 years, doubling speeds in our Blast! product to
105 megabits, while our Extreme tier moved up to 150 for customers in the northeast.
And we're not stopping there. Our focus on wireless gateway deployment is adding utility to our customers; while at
the same time helping us create the largest Wi-Fi footprint in the U.S., with over 1 million public which Wi-Fi hotspots
currently available to our customers.
We believe we are making real, tangible progress in customer service through simplifying the customer experience. In
the first quarter, truck rolls declined roughly 500,000 or 8% compared to 2013. We recently launched the new My
Account app, and early feedback has been very positive. The app allows customers to make payments, self-diagnose
issues, manage devices, and view technician appointments. We are encouraged by progress we have made with
customer service, but are going to stay vigilant and focused on further improvements over the course of 2014 and in the
years ahead.
Over at NBCUniversal, the results were terrific this quarter. The headline is obviously the Sochi Olympics, which aired
across our Broadcast and Cable Networks and generated over $1.1 billion in revenues and contributed positively to
operating cash flow. Any way you look at the Olympics, it was a tremendous success. NBC primetime averaged 21.4
million viewers during the Olympics, up 6% from the 2006 Torino Olympics, the last winter games held in a similar
time zone, which is especially notable given the growth in live streaming hours.
Speaking of live streaming, the Olympics generated 61.8 million visitors across all platforms, a 29% increase relative to
the prior Olympics 2010 in Vancouver. And the experience was further enhanced for Comcast Cable customers where
for the first time Comcast offered the NBC Sports Live Extra app on X1, which enabled our customers to watch 500
extra hours of live streaming content on their television.
The Broadcast story goes well beyond the Olympics this quarter and it's really an incredible turnaround story. Bob
Greenblatt and his entire team have done a terrific job. The momentum we achieved in the fall has carried through into
2014, led in part by an amazing transition in late night, with both the Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon and Late
Night with Seth Meyers off to excellent starts. In fact, NBC is positioned to end the full season as the number one
network in the coveted 18 to 49 demographic for primetime and late night.
We've also made strong progress with our NBC-owned stations and now pleased to say that nearly 75% of our local
newscasts now rank one or two in their market, which is up from 50% just two years ago. In Cable Networks, NBC
Sports Network had its most watched quarter in the network's history, buoyed by unprecedented live programming

hours, record viewership for the Sochi Winter Games, strong NHL viewership and the English Premier League's three
most watched months in U.S. Cable history. Bravo also had its best quarter in network history among all key demos.
Our Film division also had a strong quarter and is reflective of our focus this year on lower-cost films with a much
better financial risk reward profile. And the Theme Parks segment saw stable attendance, despite the unfavorable shift
in spring holidays in the first quarter, which will correct in the second quarter. With the upcoming opening of Harry
Potter 2 in Orlando and the added hotel capacity with the opening of Cabana Bay, the Theme Parks are set up for strong
performance in the second quarter and beyond. NBCUniversal has real momentum and we believe this is sustainable
throughout all of 2014. So all in all, I'm really pleased with the operating results across our entire business.
I'd like to spend a quick moment on our merger with Time Warner Cable. The more we get into the planning efforts on
our side, the more confident we are about the potential and about the potential synergies. We see significant benefit for
consumers in our ability to offer our innovative and industry-leading products to a larger residential footprint, along
with opportunities in Business Services and Advertising. The opportunity in this merger remains very compelling.
Time Warner Cable shareholders will get 23% stake in the combined entity and share in the upside of a company with
tremendous potential to create value for customers and shareholders.
In addition, there's been a lot of talk about potential divestitures and Michael will detail how we see the opportunity to
create value there as well. Our proposed merger with Time Warner Cable is an exciting and unique opportunity and we
remain confident that the combination will strengthen a world-class organization that will benefit customers, employees
and shareholders.
So with more on the first quarter, let me turn it over to Michael.
Michael J. Angelakis
Good morning, and thank you, Brian. We begin 2014 with solid financial results, which reflect consistent execution,
profitable growth and the fundamental strength of our businesses. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our consolidated
financial results on slide four. We are very pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect profitable growth across
all of our businesses. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 13.7% to $17.4 billion, reflecting solid growth in our
Cable business and an exceptional performance at NBCUniversal, partially driven by the success of the Sochi
Olympics.
For comparison purposes, when you exclude the $1.1 billion of revenue generated by the Olympics, our consolidated
revenue increased a healthy 6.5% during the quarter. Consolidated operating cash flow was strong and increased 10%
to $5.5 billion. This result includes $17 million of expenses related to the Time Warner Cable merger, which is
included in our Corporate and Other segment. Excluding these costs, consolidated operating cash flow grew 10.4%.
Free cash flow for the quarter decreased 10% to $2.8 billion, and free cash flow per share decreased 8.5% to $1.07 per
share as growth in consolidated operating cash flow was offset primarily by higher working capital related to the
Olympics and higher expenditures for film and TV production. Excluding this working capital impact, free cash flow
growth would have been positive. We will provide more detail on this topic later in the presentation.
Earnings per share for the first quarter increased 31.5% to $0.71 per share versus $0.54 per share in the first quarter of
2013. To provide a clear comparison, when you exclude gains on sales and acquisition-related items, our comparable
EPS increased 33.3% to $0.68 per share.
Now let's review the results of our business units in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on slide five. We
are pleased with our first quarter performance of healthy financial and customer growth in our Cable Communications
business. Before I discuss the details, I would like to highlight an important change we have made to our customer
metrics. Beginning this quarter, and as we have previously announced, we are changing our methodology for counting
Video customers from an equivalent billing units or EBU approach to a billable customers method.

This decision changed how certain establishments billed on to bulk agreements are reported, such as apartment
complexes, healthcare facilities and other multiple dwelling units or MDUs. Under the new billable customers method,
if Comcast has the ability to individually bill tenants for additional services not included in the bulk property
agreement, the total number of units served at that property are counted as individual customers. If we are unable to
provide additional service, it is counted as one customer. Previously, we had counted and reported these types of
customers on an EBU basis by dividing monthly revenue received under a bulk contract by the standard monthly
residential rate. Because of the nature of the calculation, customer counts under the previous EBU method can
artificially decrease or increase as residential rate changes occur in the markets.
In addition, the billable customers method improves our customer transparency and aligns our customer count
methodology with the rest of the Cable industry. This change has also been incorporated into our trending schedules,
including review of these Video customer metrics for 2013, making it easier to compare metrics as we report them.
Also, we will now disclose a number of our customer relationships in our average revenue per customer relationship.
So for the first time, we are disclosing our customer relationships of 26.8 million, which increased by 124,000 in the
first quarter, indicating that we have a relationship with nearly 1 out of every 2 of the 54 million residential and
commercial passings. We continue to experience real strength in our customer metrics, with positive net additions
across all of our products. Similar to our strong fourth quarter, our momentum in Video continued in the first quarter.
We added 24,000 new Video customers in the first quarter compared to a net loss of 25,000 in last year's first quarter.
As we continue to execute with improved products, improved customer support, and better retention efforts. This
growth is an accurate comparison, using the billable customers method for the first quarter of 2014 and 2013.
If we compared Video customers using our previous EBU method, we added 4,000 Video customers in the first quarter
compared to a net loss of 60,000 in last year's first quarter.
Moving on to High-Speed Data, the service also continues to gain share as we differentiate our product through service
and speed enhancements. We added 383,000 new data customers in the first quarter, and recently announced that we
are increasing speeds again, marking the 13th time in 12 years that we have increased speeds. In addition, our Voice
customer base grew by 142,000 in the first quarter, proving that Voice continues to add value to the bundle.
First quarter Cable revenue increased 5.3% to $10.8 billion, reflecting growth in our residential businesses, continued
strength in Business Services, and solid results in our Advertising group.
Total revenue per customer relationship increased 4.5% to $134 per month and reflects volume growth, rate
adjustments, a higher contribution from Business Services and an increasing number of our customers taking multiple
products.
We are continuing to have success converting Single and Double Play customers to Triple Play, and at the end of the
first quarter, 68% of our customers took at least two products, and 36% took three products, compared to 33% at the
end of last year's first quarter.
As we look at our service categories, we reported Video revenue growth of 1.3%, reflecting modest rate adjustments to
about 69% of our footprint in the first quarter and an increasing number of customers taking advanced services.
We now have 12.6 million high-def and/or DVR customers, equal to 56% of our Video customers. High-Speed Internet
revenue increased 9% during the quarter, making it again the largest contributor to Cable revenue growth, driven by
continued growth in our customer base, rate increases, and increasing number of customers taking higher speed
services. At the end of the quarter, 38% of our residential high-speed customers now take our Blast! and Extreme
products and receive at least 50 megabits of speed.
Voice revenue increased 2.1% for the first quarter, driven by growth in our customer base as we continue to focus on
the value of the Triple Play. We continue to successfully convert Single and Double Play customers to Triple Play and
acquire new Triple Play customer relationships. In fact, we added 155,000 Triple Play product customer relationships
during the quarter.

Moving from our residential to our commercial businesses, revenue increased 23.9% to $917 million, and was again the
second largest contributor to Cable revenue growth during the first quarter. This growth is impressive considering
Business Services now approaching a $4 billion run rate business. Our share continues to grow, but we have only
captured about 20% of the small end of the market, and about 5% share of the mid-size business segment. Our
optimism here continues as Business Services represents a large and attractive opportunity for the company.
Our cable advertising group also performed well as the first quarter revenue increased 16.2%, reflecting higher
automotive advertising and political revenue, excluding this political revenue, our core cable advertising increased
3.2%.
Please refer to slide six. First quarter Cable Communications' operating cash flow increased 4.3% to $4.4 billion,
resulting in a margin of 40.9%, compared to 41.3% in the first quarter of 2013, primarily driven by a lower level of rate
adjustments and the impact of two one-time items, including weather-related expenses incurred during the quarter and
the benefit from an NHL lockout rebate in the first quarter of 2013. If we exclude these one-time items, operating cash
flow would have been about one point higher and margins would have been flat. We are focused on maintaining stable
operating margins even as our programming costs increase, and as we support new initiatives, including the
deployments of X1, the deployments of the wireless gateways and the expansion of Business Services and XFINITY
Home.
Program expenses increased 8.8% in the first quarter of 2014 driven by increases in retransmission consent fees, higher
sports programming costs and step-ups for recently-completed long-term agreements. We also continue to increase the
amount of content we provide our customers across multiple platforms. As I mentioned previously, we still expect
programming expenses to grow at approximately 9% to 10% for the full year of 2014. We are effectively offsetting
these higher program expenses with an improving product mix as we add more High-Speed Data, Voice and Business
Service customers, and upgrade existing customers to higher levels of services such as HD and DVRs and faster
internet speeds.
In addition, we also continue to gain operating efficiencies, and as Brian mentioned, we reduced truck rolls by 500,000
or 8% year-over-year, even as we added new customers and upgraded existing customers to additional products.
Customers also continued to elect self-installations, which in the first quarter accounted for 47% of our total
installations, up significantly from 38% in the first quarter of last year.
In addition, we now have 36% of our customers managing their accounts online. So as we begin the new year, our
Cable Communications business is off to a solid start and performing well on all fronts; financially, operationally
enhancing the product, accelerating innovation, and improving our customer support.
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results which are presented on slide seven. For the first quarter 2014,
NBCUniversal's revenue increased 28.8% and operating cash flow increased 37.6%. These exceptional results were
driven in part by the success of the Sochi Olympics. Excluding any revenue impact from the Olympics, NBCUniversal
revenue increased a healthy 8.1%.
Now let's review the individual business segments at NBCUniversal. For the first quarter, Cable Networks generated
revenue of $2.5 billion, an increase of 12.6%, and included $257 million of revenue associated with the Sochi
Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 1%, driven by a 4.4% increase in distribution revenue, partially
offset by a slight decline in Advertising revenue of 1.4%, as increases in price were offset by ratings pressure at some
of our Cable Networks. Cable Networks' operating cash flow increased 4.2% to $895 million, reflecting higher
revenue, partially offset by our continued investment in original programming and higher sports programming costs,
including the impact of the Olympics and the launch of the English Premier League on NBC Sports Network.
With regards to our Broadcast segment, first quarter Broadcast Television revenue increased 72.8% to $2.6 billion,
including $846 million of revenue generated by the Olympics. Excluding the impact of the Olympics, Broadcast
revenue increased 17%, reflecting higher ratings due to the continued success of our primetime lineup, more hours of
The Voice airing during the first quarter compared to last year, the strength of our News division, including Today and
Nightly News, and the impressive performance in Late Night. Broadcast operating cash flow increased $157 million to

$122 million for the first quarter, reflecting a profitable Olympics, higher Advertising revenue from improved ratings
and increased retransmission consent fees.
Given NBC's ratings improvement and strength across the NBC channel portfolio, we are anticipating that this will be a
very successful upfront for our company. Early client discussions have been very positive and suggest this could be a
meaningful correction year where we can capitalize on our progress and ratings success and hope to close the
monetization gap we have mentioned in previous calls.
Moving on to Filmed Entertainment, this is clearly off to a great start, and with first quarter revenue increasing 11.1%
to $1.4 billion and operating cash flow increasing $219 million to $288 million, reflecting higher theatrical revenue
from the solid box office performance of our slate, including Ride Along and Lone Survivor and the international
performance of The Wolf of Wall Street.
Switching to our Theme Parks segment, revenue increased 5.4% to $487 million, reflecting increases in per capita
spending and stable attendance, despite the shift in spring holidays, which occurred in the first quarter of last year but
will occur now in the second quarter. Operating cash flow decreased 1.5% to $170 million for the first quarter,
reflecting higher operating costs to support new attractions. In the second quarter, we are very excited about the
opening of Harry Potter 2 in Orlando, as well as having the spring holidays in full swing.
Now let's move to slide eight to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consistent with our plan,
consolidated capital expenditures for the quarter increased 6.4% to $1.4 billion compared to the first quarter of 2013,
reflecting increased investments at both Cable and NBCUniversal. At Cable Communications, first quarter capital
expenditures increased $51 million or 4.6% to $1.1 billion, equal to about 10.6% of Cable revenue versus 10.7% in the
first quarter of 2013.
The increase was primarily driven by higher spending on CPE, including our new X1 platform and wireless gateways.
The level of CapEx spend this quarter benefited from the timing of equipment purchases and will ramp throughout the
year. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2014, Cable capital expenditures will increase with capital intensity
increasing to approximately 14% of Cable revenue compared to 12.9% in 2013, as we accelerate the deployment of X1,
deploy additional wireless gateways, increase network capacity, and continue to invest in the expansion of Business
Services and XFINITY Home.
As we move to NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures at NBCUniversal increased $28 million to $291
million, primarily reflecting increased investments in facilities as well as Theme Parks as we build new attractions,
including new Harry Potter attractions in both parks and a Fast and Furious attraction in Hollywood. As I mentioned in
February, we expect that NBCUniversal's 2014 capital expenditure plan will remain relatively stable to 2013's level.
Now let's move to slide nine. As I mentioned earlier, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $2.8 billion in the
first quarter, a decrease of 10% as growth in consolidated operating cash flow was primarily offset by increased
working capital, which was mainly driven by ad sales receivables for the Olympics and net production spend at our
film and TV studios. Excluding the $636 million swing in working capital, free cash flow would have increased during
the quarter.
We are executing on our 2014 financial plan and increased our return of capital to shareholders by 35% in the first
quarter to $1.3 billion, including share repurchases totaling $750 million and dividend payments totaling $508 million
for the quarter.
Let me now turn to Time Warner Cable, and as Brian mentioned, offer some thoughts on our return of capital strategy
and potential divestitures. As has been reported, when shareholder approval for our acquisition of Time Warner Cable
is obtained later this year, we intend to increase our repurchase plan by $2.5 billion. This is in addition to the current
plan of $3 billion for Comcast for an expected total of $5.5 billion in share repurchases during 2014.
In addition, as you know, we have committed divestitures in our Time Warner Cable transaction. We do not comment
on rumors, but I will outline our philosophy and financial perspective on this subject. There are a number of potential
structures for us to evaluate, maximizing value for our shareholders will guide our decisions. Some key considerations

include, amongst others, our ability to divest subscribers in the most tax-efficient way possible, our ability to shrink our
equity base and/or deliver cash for our shareholders and our ability to maximize our presence in our most strategic
markets.
In addition, we anticipate that any divestiture plan will be a leverage-neutral event for Comcast. In other words, the
extent that we sell properties for cash or spin properties, any cash proceeds after neutralizing or maintaining our
existing leverage ratio can be used for return of capital to Comcast shareholders. This is complex and we believe value
enhancing to our shareholders. There is a lot of work to be done in addition to the integration effort and we will provide
regular updates as we continue to refine our thinking and analysis.
So let me wrap up by saying we are very pleased with our operational and financial performance this quarter. We have
started the year off strong. We are making tremendous progress and are focused on continuing our momentum
throughout the year. We are excited about the Time Warner Cable merger and the synergy opportunities it presents. We
believe it will be accretive on a free cash flow per share basis and are confident that our disciplined investments and
our focus on execution will continue to generate profitable growth.
Now let me turn the call over to Jason for Q&A.
Jason S. Armstrong
Thanks, Michael. Operator, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come
from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thanks. I have a couple of questions. The first one, you mentioned on the call several times
adding wireless gateways and having all these hotspots. I was just wondering if you could give us your vision for Wi-Fi
in the kind of longer term with and without Time Warner Cable? How different would your strategy be with or without
them and is this a value-add service to existing wireline HSD subs or is it potentially a standalone service?
<A - Neil Smit>: Hi, Jessica. It's Neil. I think Wi-Fi; we've rolled out 8.3 million devices. We view it as a very
important asset, both as an extension to our data product as well as the ability to launch new products like XFINITY
Home. I think the Time Warner merger, it would extend the network further and the Wi-Fi network build out. We see
about 75% to 80% of mobile data consumption happening on Wi-Fi in the home and in the office. So, I think we view
it as a very positive, important asset and we'll continue to put in hotspots as we go forward.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: And maybe just to add to that. I think that's exactly right. Short-term, it's a big adder to
broadband and longer-term, including our MVNO potential and other wireless assets that we have in the company,
we're in a position to think about where wireless is going and how we can participate in a way to build value. And
whether that's to our existing products or it's a new product, nothing but good things seem to happen by us adding
Wi-Fi to the benefit of our consumers.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: And can I just follow up? Mike, you had talked about capital returns and the potential
divestiture post-approval. I just wanted to clarify something you said when you announced the Time Warner Cable
acquisition. You said that there would be $10 billion – I think the way you phrased it was that there would be $10
billion in proceeds next year or I mean in return of capital. If you divest subs and for argument's sake, let's say it's
roughly $10 billion in excess capital, it could be more or less, is that in addition to the amount you announced at the
time of Time Warner Cable or is that included in that?

<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Thanks, Jessica. Let me put a finer point on it. So what we said when we announced the
Time Warner Cable deal that when the deal would close, we would increase our authorization by $10 billion. Our view
was, if we had a $7.5 billion authorization at the beginning of the year and we, as we announced today, say we used
$5.5 billion of that due to the original $3 billion plus the additional $2.5 billion that would leave about $2.5 billion
worth of capability, $2 billion of capability. We would then, when the deal closes, look to increase our authorization by
$10 billion. That would be completely separate from any divestiture assets we're talking about.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Separate. Okay. Thank you. And then if I could just throw one last thing in. You talked
about closing the monetization gap. Could you or Steve give us an update on what you think the potential upside is
there? I mean your ratings have been great; you seem bullish about the upfront. If you could just clarify what you think
that is now, the gap is now and then I am done.
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: Well, I think we're going into the upfront with the best position we've had in over a decade,
primarily driven by NBC. Last year NBC came with 17% behind the leader, which was CBS. This year we're
estimating that we'll finish in first about 12% ahead of number two. So, if you look at that swing, it's a 29% swing,
which we've gone back to the beginning of people meters. We can't find any network that's swung that much in a year.
So that's going to give us I think a much stronger hand as we go into the upfront. And we're looking at this upfront as a
chance to have a correction in that monetization gap. It's hard to precisely say how much that is going to be worth to us,
but it's going to be worth a lot.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, next question.

Next question will come from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. I guess two questions. Following up on wireless, at the forefront is the
concept that your Wi-Fi network obviously can offload much of the wireless data usage giving you a cost advantage
with a hybrid Verizon Wireless MVNO Comcast Wi-Fi network. If you could talk through your longer-term aspirations
in wireless, and whether such a hybrid service could prove advantageous, could you have a cost advantage over the
incumbents in that business? And then, Michael, just for clarification if I missed it, when would you expect to make a
decision on divestitures? Thanks.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Let me just jump in first and say that I don't think we've announced anything on wireless.
There's – it's a premature question. I think what we're doing is building out hotspots. We're doing the routers with dual
FSID. We're finding our customers enjoy it. The technology is getting better. More spectrum has been allocated to
Wi-Fi and long term I think that we're studying that market and we're encouraged by it. Neil, does that sound right?
<A - Neil Smit>: No, I think that's exactly right. We're focused on building out a network and adding value to the HSD
product right now. While there's been some speculation on the combined Wi-Fi MVNO, we're focused on just building
out the network right now and providing a great experience for the customers.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: And I'll take the last question. We actually don't have a particular time-line in terms of
announcing the divestitures. Obviously, there's a lot of work to do, and this is very complex, so our view is let's be very
methodical about it and get it right from a variety of perspectives, and it will be announced in due course.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: So I mean, Michael, there is a possibility it could be early, but not necessarily a plan for that?
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: No, we don't have any particular plan, as I just mentioned. Our view is there's a number
of moving pieces related to regulatory, related to tax, related to a number of items, and our view is, let's be very
thoughtful about it. The goal is to maximum shareholder value, so there's no particular internal time line. We're going
to go at a pace that we're comfortable with to make sure that we do maximum shareholder value.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: And if I could just ask quickly, Brian, Neil, given your answer, is the way we should think
about it perhaps that the first product that you could offer is just a Wi-Fi voice – Wi-Fi-only voice service just to test

Next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Hi, guys. I wonder if you can talk about price increases through the year, both what you have
done so far and how you think about going forward. I know there's some confusion over the last month or so about
what is happening on the Video side because of equipment increases or the lack of that this year. Do you feel like the
equipment price increases are sort of tapped out given the price is already happening on the DTAs and the set-top
boxes? Or is that a possibility of going up in the future? Thanks.
<A - Neil Smit>: Hi, Phil. It's Neil. We did take lower rate increases in Video this year overall than last year. We've
looked at the market and adjusted as we felt it was appropriate. We target different segments with different price offers.
I don't think that the pricing is necessarily popped out, as you say. I think it depends on the segment; it depends on the
value of the service we're offering. What we're really focused on is driving out X1. We've seen great results with the
product as we've gotten it to market, and it's performing very well, as Brian said, churn is down 20% to 30%. The
Video numbers were driven by more upgrades and fewer disconnects this quarter, and so we feel pretty good about the
Video results we're achieving right now.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Neil, if I can follow up on your CapEx comment, given the fairly low pace of CapEx on the
Cable side this quarter, should we anticipate that that 15,000 to 20,000 could accelerate pretty dramatically between
now and the end of the year?
<A - Neil Smit>: Yeah, as Brian also mentioned, we're selling 15,000 to 20,000 X1 boxes a day right now, and so that
rate is double what it was six months ago. So it is accelerating, and I think that there will be some catch-up in CapEx
over the coming quarters.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: And let me just add to that, Phil, with regards to the CapEx, we talked about that back in the
first – in February. We're sticking to our CapEx plan in terms of percentage of revenue, and you will see, from a CPE
perspective, almost all of our set-top boxes are X1 type set-top boxes.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Thanks.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Phil. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Moffett>: Hi, good morning. Two questions if I could. First for Neil, Neil, you had tested a solution, as I
understand it, for delivering the X1 user interface without requiring an IP chipset in the box. So ActiveVideo had done
one; I think there are other vendors that are doing that. Can you update us on that? I mean it would seem like there is a
potential for a much lower CapEx profile with faster rollout if that works. And so I just wanted to see where we were
on that topic. And then for Mike, Mike, when you did the transaction with all cash for Time Warner Cable, I
understand that may be very tax-efficient, but is there any consideration separate and apart from maintaining the
leverage after divestitures of potentially readjusting the leverage profile of the combined company after all is said and
done?

<A - Neil Smit>: So, Craig, I'll cover the X1 product. I think what you may be referring to is the slave devices that act
off of the main gateway. You still need an IP set-top box in the house such as the X1, and then you can run lower cost
hardware off of that in terms of the additional outlets. X1, what's great about the product right now is as we've learned
as we've rolled out the new X2 interface, we can adjust on the fly and launch new products like [ph] EST (40:30), but
generally speaking, you need the master device in order to get the lower-cost additional outlets.
<Q - Craig Moffett>: But, Neil, if I could just interject. Sorry, my understanding is the solutions I was describing are
solutions that translate the IP interface back into MPEG for delivery to legacy boxes without having to replace boxes in
the home.
<A - Neil Smit>: We have some backwards compatibility. It's primarily with the advanced set-top boxes that we'll be
rolling out over time. We currently in our solutions rollout, the X1 box and the additional outlets, the advanced set-top
boxes, but there will be some backwards compatibility over time.
<Q - Craig Moffett>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Craig, let me just clarify. The Time Warner, you said all cash. The Time Warner Cable...
<Q - Craig Moffett>: Sorry, all stock I meant, sorry.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: That's what I thought you meant. I just wanted to clarify. With regards to our leverage
profile, when we do close the transaction depending on timing, we'll have approximately $70 billion of debt in our
balance sheet and pro forma between 2.2 times, 2.3 times leverage, depending on timing. I think the divestitures will –
are going to be what I call, leverage neutral that wherever we end up when the transactions are done, we'll end up at the
same place. I don't think we're revisiting our overall balance sheet profile. Our goal long-term, medium-term goal is to
be between 1.5 times and 2 times and that's going to take us several years to get to. And given the magnitude of debt,
given our A rating, given how we look at our balance sheet as a real strategic asset, we don't think it's appropriate to
relook at the leverage ratios.
<Q - Craig Moffett>: Thank you.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Craig. Operator, next question please.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you. Good morning. Neil, just coming back to the Video revenue growth and
rate adjustment comment you made, this is, I think was the lowest quarter in about eight quarters on Video revenue and
a lot of that is probably timing. So just curious if you could add a little more color on whether you are seeing a market
that you need to be a little more sensitive to price or if this is just the normal kind of quarter-to-quarter timing of when
price adjustments roll through the business. And then, Brian, last call, you talked about X1. I think the comment was a
majority of your customers in several years and it sounds like, if anything, you are more excited and see more
opportunity there. I was wondering if you had a finer point on the timing or any more color on sort of the deployment
schedule.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Concerning rate increases, Ben, we decided to take lower rate increase this quarter as we
evaluated the market. I wouldn't read any trends into it. We took rate increases across the smaller percentage of our
footprint this quarter than last year as well. But, we target different offers to different customers, and I don't think we're
seeing a topping out. In the competitive arena, the offers are in the same ballpark, the promo prices go up and down,
but the destination pricing is fairly similar across its various competitors.
<A - Neil Smit>: I think that in 90 days, nothing's changed, Ben, on our view. I think we're more encouraged than 90
days ago. We've now scaled it more. We've ramped it, doubled the speed in six months of the rollout. Churn,
pay-per-view revenue, customer satisfaction, all those statistics are headed in a good direction. I think your previous

question about how can we get it to more devices faster is always on our mind. Are there new technologies that can
come along and help speed that along? One of the things we're rolling out is an app, XFINITY TV, and it really looks
like the X1 guide without a box, and it works on every iOS and every Android and every Kindle in your home.
So there are real progresses being made on how to get this to more devices faster without having to spend more capital
necessarily, but I think ultimately this is a fantastic product and we're getting it out there at a measured pace. We started
with Triple Play, now we're Double Play, and we're constantly getting it to more – available to our customers, and
we're trying different marketing things to make it see how the response rates are and see how the customer satisfaction
is, but so far so good.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: And let me just say one other thing on Video revenue. I just want to make sure we're all
level set. You know, we have almost 70% of our customers take two services and 36% take all three services. So we do
look at it, from a yield perspective with regards to rate adjustments across the entire base, and you really have to look at
not just Video revenue but, High-Speed Data revenue is up 9%, which is a terrific performance compared to prior
years. And if you look at all of our recurring revenue, that's actually growing quite nicely as well. So as we continue to
have more Double and Triple Plays, the individual product revenue growth I think gets a little distorted.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question please.

Our next question will come from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thanks. Can you just outline the steps to closing the Time Warner Cable merger? We have
the Senate House Committee or the Senate Judiciary Committee will have the House. Then the Time Warner Cable
shareholder vote, DOJ, FCC. Is there anything I am missing? And then just a follow-up, do you know when the Time
Warner Cable shareholder meeting is going to be?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: This is Brian. I think you have most of the steps. We don't know when that vote is going to
be. You also have local municipalities and state franchising authorities and PUCs where certain business licenses exist,
so there's probably even a few more steps than you mentioned, but those are the basics.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Okay. And then just a follow-up on operations. Any thoughts about expanding Streampix
or something else with an over-the-top service? I think AT&T made an announcement this morning. We saw DISH and
Disney, so any thoughts there?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Well, Streampix has been a good product for us. We've learned what customers consume and
there are a lot of people who are using the product and even buying the product. I think the OTT model we found to be
very difficult. However, as we try to target different segments, we're open to the possibilities of including – up to and
including OTT.

<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay, thanks. I guess a follow-up to Marci's question. Last night on the Netflix call, Reed
Hastings reiterated his desire to get his product on the X1 box. What is Comcast's view of allowing other content
aggregators on the platform? That is number one. And then two, on the new buyback, can you give us a sense of timing

around the Comcast vote for the Time Warner Cable deal, when you expect that to occur? Thanks.
<A - Neil Smit>: So, this is Neil. Concerning the Netflix opportunity to get on X1, we've launched a lot of apps. We
have Pandora and Facebook and Twitter and we have a number of partnerships, and where there is a real win-win
relationship and a win for the consumer, we're certainly open to the possibilities. I think that a number of the apps are
getting a lot of use. We launched an Olympics app with Sochi and that got a lot of use, and we're going to continue to
integrate more functionality into the X1 experience to make it more personalized for the viewer.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: With regards to shareholder vote, it's hard to tell, to be honest with you, John. We have
to go through the SEC review, which we're doing now. But, I would hope it's over the next several months we'll have
that vote, but just difficult to pin-point, as Brian mentioned with Marci. So, we'll have, obviously, we have really two
shareholder votes, ours as well as Time Warner Cable's, and right now we're going through that SEC review.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks.

Next question will come from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Hi, thanks. Just had two quick questions. First, on High-Speed Data net adds, they have been at
a pretty consistent level in the first quarter for the past three years. We saw some deceleration this year. So the question
is, is this indicative of any kind of slowdown in High-Speed Data net adds, or was there something anomalous about
the quarter whether it's weather or just resource allocation or some other reason? And then the other question is on the
Cable Network ad revenue, excluding the Olympics, looks like it was down year-over-year. Just wanted to understand
what that weakness is related to. Is it just ratings? Was there a pricing or a make-good impact too and how do you see
the outlook in 2Q and 3Q on the Cable Network side for advertising? Thank you.
<A - Neil Smit>: So let me start with the Cable advertising. Actually, you have to adjust out the closure of the Style
Network or the shutdown of the Style Network and Fandango. We moved from one category of the company to another
company. If you exclude those two things, Cable advertising was up a couple percentage points, and we are optimistic
that we're going to have a good upfront, and the next ensuing quarters will do better.
<A>: And on the HSD side, we feel very good with the quarter, 9% revenue growth, 383,000 subs. We feel it's a good
quarter. And I wouldn't read any deceleration into the business at all. It's – we're capturing share and we continue to
focus on it and add value through things like speed upgrades and Wi-Fi.

Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Jayant with International Strategy Investment Group. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Hi. I have two questions. You talked about the Video ARPU trends and how we should think
about it as a bundle. Can you just talk about how the skinny video fat broadband offerings are tracking? Are they
becoming a bigger piece of the mix and really resonating? And second for Michael, talked about asset divestitures
being tax-efficient. Is it logical to assume basically that the [indiscernible] (50:57) assets generally have the highest
step-up basis on it, so would be most logical? Thanks.

<A - Neil Smit>: This is Neil, Vijay. With regards to the Internet Plus product, it has been a very successful product in
targeting millennials. It's a good margin product and we will continue to use it to target that audience. But overall, we're
pleased with the results there.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Honestly, Vijay, I don't think we want to get too in the weeds with regards to tax basis
and step-ups and those kinds of items. We have lots of assets between our company and obviously Time Warner and
we're evaluating a number of factors, including and tax basis is one of those factors. Other factors are how are we
clustered within certain markets and how do we think about value and growth and all of those other items. So I don't
want to leave you with the perception that there's only one factor or one set of systems. And I think it would be not
quite right to go into specifics at this point.

Operator
Our final question will come from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kannan Venkateshwar>: Thank you. The question I have is on the X1 side. While there is some opportunity in
increasing the customer lifetime value because the reduction in churn, could you help us with what the revenue
opportunity is in terms of the additional products that you are selling and how that is trending in the footprint that you
have? And secondly, on the content delivery network side, is there any way to expand that to include other partners and
offer differentiated services, which look like over-the-top-services but are probably a different tier?
<A - Neil Smit>: This is Neil. Concerning the X1 product, I think the revenue comes in a number of forms. One is, the
X1 customers are more likely to take Triple Play. Two is, we're driving more VOD revenue. Three is, there are – we're
monetizing better from an overall advertising perspective because they're spending most time watching On Demand
where we have the C3 window and as well as linear. So you're seeing a bump in both overall viewing of the product.
We've launched [ph] EST (53:16), which has been very successful for us. We've been the number one retailer in a
number of movies we've launched. So those are just a number of things that contribute to the revenue. I think the churn,
is you know, very important because driving that churn number down that dramatically is going to be a big factor.
Concerning the CDN, we've invested hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of building our CDN. It's a very
powerful asset and I think that as we've had people approach us to consider some sort of arrangement to share in it,
we're open to those conversations.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Let me just wrap up, Michael, do you want to add anything?
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Actually X1 customers take a much higher amount of DVRs as well, which is quite good
for us and adds more revenue.
Brian L. Roberts
So in just wrapping up, I think a really strong start to the year, terrific work at NBCUniversal and every business
segment, setting up for a continuation throughout the year. And I think, in that last question, what's exciting about
Cable right now is, we have a product with the X1 platform that is going to lead for years and years for more
innovation to happen. It's a game changer to put it in the cloud, to be able to click a button and have it go to Denver and
back faster than a click would have happened just looking at a television just a couple of years ago is, creates really
fantastic opportunities.
