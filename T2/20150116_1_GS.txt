Harvey Mitchell Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full-year results. Then
I'm obviously happy to answer any questions.
Briefly on the fourth quarter, net revenues were $7.7 billion, net earnings were $2.2 billion, and earnings per diluted
share were $4.38. With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $34.5 billion, net earnings of
$8.5 billion, earnings per diluted share of $17.07, and a return on common equity of 11.2%. Revenues were roughly
consistent with last year. We grew net earnings by 5%, book value per share by 7%, and earnings per diluted share by
10%.
If we take a step back and assess 2014, there have been challenges for the global economy and therefore the operating
environment for our clients. We've seen a global economy that has been grinding itself towards growth. Different
countries are naturally at different stages of the economic cycle, and the interconnectedness of these different
economies has made the transition to growth somewhat extended, choppy, and oftentimes unpredictable. Having a
global footprint means that we are impacted by both global and regional fluctuations. Most importantly, it also means
that we are a diversified enterprise.
The consistency of our annual revenues is a testament to both the product and geographic diversity of our operations
and the stability they collectively provide. Weakness in Asia or Europe can be offset by strength in the U.S. Headwinds
in Institutional Client Services can be offset by strength in Investment Banking or Investment Management. Ultimately,
our shareholders own a combination of industry-leading global businesses that have collectively generated superior
returns.
We have also achieved our results in the face of significant regulatory change. The financial services industry and our
firm specifically have been responding to unprecedented levels of new regulation. The regulators and the industry have
done a tremendous amount of work here and, as a result, have made the system stronger and significantly safer.
Since 2012, we undertook several strategic initiatives to respond to new regulations and at the same time derisked the
firm. This included a $55 billion balance sheet reduction over the past year. In addition, we sold our Americas
reinsurance business. We sold our European insurance business, and we liquidated our investment in ICBC. Along with
those actions, we also sold our hedge fund administration business and our REDI platform. In 2012, the businesses and
investments that I just listed produced $2.3 billion in revenue. As a result, since then we had to replace in excess of $2
billion of revenues in 2014 just to match 2012 levels.
As I said, the last three years have required us to adapt and source new revenue opportunities at attractive returns.
Between 2012 and 2014, Investment Banking and Investment Management generated $2.4 billion of incremental
revenues. This achievement demonstrates the strength of our client franchise, the diversity of our operations, the
commitment to quality of our people, and our culture of adaptability.
Now I'll discuss each of our businesses, starting with Investment Banking. Before digging into the details here, it's
worth noting a few achievements from 2014. We were number one in M&A, advising on more than $1 trillion in

announced transactions. We also ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings.
As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.4 billion, slightly lower than the third
quarter. A decline in underwriting activity offset a pickup in completed M&A. For the full year, Investment Banking
net revenues were $6.5 billion, up 8% from 2013 on the back of a significant improvement in advisory revenues and
modestly higher equity underwriting revenues. This was slightly offset by lower debt underwriting revenues following
record results in 2013.
Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter, advisory revenues were $692 million. The
16% increase relative to the third quarter reflects the increase in industry-wide completed M&A.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including: Walgreen's $15.3
billion acquisition of the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots; Royal KPN's €8.4 billion sale of E-Plus to
Telefónica Deutschland; and Athlon Energy's $7.1 billion sale to Encana. We also advised on a number of important
transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including: Allergan's $66 billion sale to Actavis; Baker
Hughes' $38 billion sale to Halliburton; and Talisman Energy $13 billion sale to Repsol.
Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $748 million in the fourth quarter, down 14% sequentially, as both equity
and debt issuance slowed. Equity underwriting revenues of $342 million were down 20% compared to third quarter
results, largely due to a decrease in secondary offerings and private placements. Debt underwriting revenues decreased
9% to $406 million due to a significant decline in leveraged finance activity.
During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Becton, Dickinson's $7.2
billion financing to support their purchase of CareFusion, ICBC's $5.6 billion debt offering, and Fiat Chrysler's $4
billion common stock and convertible offering. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels
and finished at its highest level since 2007.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were
$3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 17% compared to the third quarter. For the full year, $15.2 billion of net
revenues were down 3% relative to 2013. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter,
and included $55 million of DVA gains. Excluding DVA and last quarter's gain related to our trust preferred tender,
revenues were down 41% sequentially, as certain businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more
difficult market-making conditions.
Interest rates were lower sequentially, as client activity declined amid a challenging environment. Credit decreased, as
the market was characterized by widening high-yield spreads and low levels of liquidity. Mortgages declined versus the
third quarter, as volatility in client activity were generally low. While currencies was lower than a very robust third
quarter, volatility remained high and client activity was still solid. Given the higher volatility in energy markets,
commodities improved sequentially and was supported by stronger client activity levels.
For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues were $8.5 billion, down 2% year over year. Excluding DVA, the
gain related to our trust preferred tender, and the impact of the 2013 European insurance sale, revenues were down 5%
relative to 2013.
In equities, which include equity client execution, commissions and fees, and securities services, net revenues for the
fourth quarter were $1.9 billion, up 21% sequentially, and included $27 million in DVA gains. Equity client execution
revenues increased 75% sequentially to $751 million due to a more favorable backdrop with higher equity prices and
increased client activity. Commissions and fees were $829 million, up 11% relative to the third quarter, supported by
an increase in client volumes. Securities Services generated net revenues of $351 million, up 2% sequentially adjusting
for last quarter's gain related to our trust preferred tender. For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $6.7
billion, down 5% year over year. Excluding DVA, the gain related to our trust preferred tender, and the 2013 sale of
our reinsurance business, results were down 4% relative to 2013.
Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $63 million, down from $66 million in the third quarter,
with the largest decrease coming from interest rates.

Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in
the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $982 million, primarily reflecting company-specific
events, including initial public offerings and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and
loans were $358 million, which was relatively balanced between net interest income and net gains on certain
investments. Other revenues of $192 million include the firm's consolidated investments. In the fourth quarter, we sold
our investment in Metro International. For the fourth quarter and full year, Metro contributed $70 million and $325
million, respectively, to other revenues.
For the full year, investing and lending generated net revenues of $6.8 billion, driven by $3.8 billion in gains from
equity securities, $2.2 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans, and $847 million of other revenues.
In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 7% from the third quarter,
primarily as a result of $200 million in incentive fees, largely from alternative asset products. Management and other
fees were up 1% sequentially to a record $1.23 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were a
record $6 billion, up 11% from 2013, on record management and other fees, which benefited from growth in our assets
under supervision.
During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $28 billion to a record $1.18 trillion, due to net inflows
into liquidity products. On a full-year basis, we had long-term fixed income inflows of $58 billion and equity inflows
of $15 billion. Alternative inflows were $1 billion, and included $6 billion from fund-of-funds, offset by net outflows
from other private equity and credit funds.
Moving to our performance, across the globe, 83% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a
three-year basis, and 75% ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior-year equity awards, and other items such as benefits, remained roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2014, and
translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 36.8%. Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.5
billion, 11% higher than the third quarter, reflecting a $137 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our
donor-advised charitable fund. For the full year, non-compensation expenses were down 4%, primarily due to lower
provisions for litigation and regulatory expenses. Total staff at year-end was approximately 34,000, up 3% from
year-end 2013. Our effective tax rate was 31.4% for 2014.
Our global core excess liquidity ended the quarter at $183 billion. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2%
using the advanced approach. It was 11.3% under the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished
the quarter at 5%. The firm is now compliant with the 2018 minimum.
We repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion during the quarter. For the full year, we
repurchased $5.5 billion, helping to reduce our average fully diluted share count by 26 million shares year over year. In
addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share in the fourth quarter and paid out approximately $1
billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we returned $6.5 billion of capital to shareholders while, at the
same time, continuing to grow our regulatory capital ratios.
Now before I take your questions, let me offer some closing thoughts. Looking back on our performance in 2014, the
firm continued to execute on a top [ph] line (16:20) strategy. We remain committed to our clients, providing superior
service and execution, which is central to building any long-term relationship. The strength of our client franchise is
reflected in our returns and our leading market position. For example, we ended the year as the global leader in M&A,
with more than $1 trillion in announced transactions. This is nearly $250 billion greater than our next closest
competitor. We were ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings for 2014. We helped
deliver nearly $300 billion in equity capital from our investing clients to our corporate clients.
We executed more than 2 billion transactions for our institutional investment clients across equities, fixed income,
currencies, and commodities. And, we are the trusted investment manager for in excess of $1 trillion in assets. Our
track record of performing for our clients has translated into a leading market position within each of our businesses.

Another area of focus has been on our efficiency, both operating efficiency and capital. We announced an expense
initiative from a position of strength in 2011. We believe this is an important step which positioned us to remain
externally focused over the past three years. Continued discipline on compensation levels and focus on
non-compensation expenses has contributed to 300 basis points of pre-tax margin expansion since 2012.
Our capital philosophy is also clear. Having a strong capital base not only allows our firm to be front-footed in helping
our clients and capturing opportunities, but also provides protection in more difficult operating environments. The
existence of multiple capital regulations has materially increased the need for robust capital planning tools. To drive
better capital efficiency and comply with new regulatory requirements, we have developed critical technology and
operating infrastructure to inform our allocation decisions. While they can never replace good judgment, these tools
certainly help to inform it.
In closing, Goldman Sachs is essentially made up of our clients, your capital, and our people. Our firm stands ready to
use its financial and intellectual capital to serve our clients through this evolving period in the global economy. We are
committed to consistently delivering the firm in its entirety to our clients and maximizing our impacts, and we are
equally committed to generating superior returns for our shareholders through the cycle.
Thank you again for dialing in, and now I'm happy to answer any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi, thanks very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Good morning. First one on investing and lending, you had mentioned that there are a bunch
of sales inside the equity piece. Would you mind just updating us on what's left in the book equity-wise that eventually
has to be liquidated for Goldman? And in conjunction with that, have you been replacing on balance sheet to backfill?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So just to take a step back, you'll remember from the third quarter, the investing
and lending balance sheet was roughly $76 billion, which broke down roughly $4 billion of public equity, $18 million
of private equity, and the balance, really the vast majority of the balance sheet, in debt, north of $50 billion.
And so, in terms of the equity line, I think what you're continuing to see is just really the idiosyncratic performance of
the portfolio. We've guided you over time that over long periods, the portfolio will correlate with the MSCI or other
public indices, and there are certainly times where we'll outperform that or underperform that. And in this particular
quarter, there were – really the vast majority of the gains in the portfolio were driven by things that we refer to as
event-driven. So it was either the potential for very near-term IPO, we took something public, or there were refinancing
events. We don't look at this, of course, on a quarterly basis, but you'll remember I highlighted to you in the last quarter
that when we had taken Mobileye public, it contributed $285 million in revenue. So that would be an example of
something that was down during the course of the quarter. That was down a bit more than $70 million.
In terms of reinvesting and the portfolio, our strategy here is unchanged in terms of our philosophy in terms of how we
think about the capital. Where we can deploy capital to our clients and where we can find attractive returns, then we'll
pursue them, but we're going to be very disciplined about the kind of returns that we can gain out of the marketplace.
And so you'll continue to see us do this. One good thing in the quarter that you saw was that the regulators finalized the
extension of the Volcker Rule. And so there will be two one-year extensions there, so that was good to see. I think it
was thoughtful by the regulators because otherwise we might have seen fire sales across the marketplace.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: And equity left to Goldman's equity piece left? I think it went from $9 billion to $8 billion to
$6 billion, if my memory serves me correctly. Where are we at now?

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So are you talking about – so there are two things that sometimes I think get
interposed. I think if you're referring to where our investment is in terms of the private equity portfolio that we were
discussing under Volcker before the extension, that's roughly around $8 billion. There was some harvesting, but that
was offset by some gains. Again now, that's been extended two years. If you're talking about the significant financial
institution deduction, which is a separate number but it relates to our Basel III capital ratios, that's now roughly about
$5 billion.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, perfect. That's what I was looking for.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I wasn't sure exactly. I probably should have gone there first.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I probably should have worded it better, so then a big-picture question. Look, a couple
quarters ago we were all bumming out that every volatility chart points down. Now rates, oil volatility [vol], FX
volatility, credit volatility, all thumbs up, and all the banks get beaten up on inventories that we thought were a lot less.
So could we talk about good vol versus bad vol and what we're supposed to root for?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I don't know. I guess it's a little Goldilocks. It's too cold; it's too hot. We can't find
the right temperature. I think when you look – I find it very interesting to juxtapose the third quarter and the fourth
quarter because I think it really highlights what you're saying. We came into the third quarter and, as you said,
everybody bemoaning the fact that there was nothing happening in the world in July and then we got into summer in
terms of August. And then we came back and foreign exchange was very active. There was a lot of momentum, and
you saw big uptick in client activity in certain parts of the business.
Now we come into the fourth quarter and I don't know if you want to call it unhealthy volatility. But in October we had
whatever you want to refer to it in markets, now we're referring to it as the Treasury Flash Crash, and then Greece, the
continuation of Russia, a huge declining oil price, which of course it started in June but really came into frame in the
fourth quarter, which weighed heavily on credit markets.
And so I don't think when you look back at the fourth quarter, any of this should be particularly surprising. When you
see that much pressure on credit markets in terms of the ability as a market maker in the course of quarter to manage
liquidity, I don't think it's particularly surprising, particularly the stress that came under high yield as a result of the
energy decline.
Now for us, there were some real bright spots in the quarter in fixed income, which is why we think about it long term.
I will tell you as the energy prices have been declining, our ability to be an active and valuable provider of hedging
solutions and a market maker to our energy-sensitive and commodity-sensitive clients was, it's the kind of thing that
you really see. But it's not always going to be the case in any given quarter, and these are pretty unique events we're
talking about. But again, in the end, it's all going to be driven by the client activity, Glenn, and certain types of
volatility will drive more client activity, and certain will make people want to recede and be a little more protective.
Again, I know we're all focused on it, but quarter to quarter, when you think of the events, I don't think it's that
surprising actually.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: And the last follow-on on that is just in credit specifically, which is probably the most
liquidity dependent, do the desks themselves or do your risk management practices – do you tend to exit positions
during times of stress like that, or should we be thinking about you're sitting on the same kind of book right now, just at
lower prices?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So we're always managing the risk components of any of our books regardless of
the environment. And the kinds of markets that we're talking about, it's really very natural in what they're doing at the
desk level. So they're obviously fulfilling their client responsibilities in terms of making markets, but it can be
particularly challenging from time to time. But again, this is a long-term commitment. I wouldn't say that there were
any significant exposures in terms of that that we're really focused on. But obviously, things that have been in frame for
a while, Russia, Greece, energy, whatever the case might be, obviously, we pay a lot of attention to those things. Again,
as we've said in the past, Glenn, it's a moving business, not a storage business. It's just sometimes moving is harder.

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I appreciate that, and my time's up. Thank you very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Glenn. Thanks so much.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks, Harvey. Hi. Harvey, just upfront you mentioned a lot of the businesses that have
been repositioned. I think you mentioned the $2.3 billion on the revenue side. I guess when we look at 2015, now that
most of the rules are finalized, is the vast majority of the repositioning out of the way because when I look at the ratios,
you're basically where you need to be? So should we see ongoing revenue headwinds, or is the repositioning mostly
through?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So look, we'll have to see as all the rules ultimately get finalized. There are still a
number of rules out there. So I would say things that we very deliberately did in terms of derisking the firm or
responding to regulatory requirements, like the sales of the insurance businesses and the other things that I listed,
there's nothing right now that we're looking at that you should expect to see in the near term.
Now having said that, these businesses have always been dynamic. They will remain dynamic. And over the next many
years, things will continually evolve, and we will look to be very dynamic in all those businesses, whether they're
market structure changes, whether they're things like we've seen in terms of regulatory driven. I think it's just what you
need to do to manage the business as well. So we'll continue to focus on capital and making sure we're using the capital
as efficiently and effectively as possible. All these things are just part of daily life.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay, got it. And then just maybe on the same topic or somewhat related to it, just in terms
of your Tier 1 common ratio going up to 12.2%, just if you can, give us the components. It looks like RWA shrunk in
the quarter, but I just wanted to know what drove that. And then going forward, is there anything else in the pipeline?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So in the third quarter, if everyone remembers, it was 11.8%. It went up to 12.2%,
as I referenced. So if you really want to break that down into the molecules, give or take roughly 10 basis points came
from just growth in capital. Another 10 basis points came from various steps we're taking in terms of managing the
capital better. And then the balance really was about risk reduction, and it was as much driven by the drop-off in client
activity towards the end of the quarter than anything else, so you could see this bounce back.
In terms of stats, again, we're going to continue to adjust all the capital rules. And as I said, we've invested heavily in
getting the tools out. And as we discussed at your conference, we now have a uniform framework that were deploying
across the firm in terms of how we think about best utilizing that capital, ensuring that we position it most effectively
for all of our clients. And so again, that's going to be – I don't know if you want to call it part of the new world, but
that's part of the world that we live in now.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Got it, and then last one. Just given the volatility that we're seeing both in the oil markets,
more recently in the FX markets, I just want to get your guys' perspective of – obviously, you mentioned on the
commodity side, that can present some opportunities in terms of more activity. On the flip side, there's a lot of risk
associated with that depending on what happens. I just wanted to see how you guys are managing that risk. And in the
quarter, was there anything significant, particularly in FICC, just because it was maybe a little lighter than expected?
Did that weigh on any of the segments?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So as I said, in the quarter it really was a tough quarter in the credit business, also
in mortgages on a relative basis but more pronounced in the credit businesses. In terms of the commodity businesses, I
think it's almost worth taking a step back. If you think about it, over the last couple years we've often been asked the
question. Hey, it seems like everybody else is getting out of the commodity business. How come you're not getting out
of the commodity business? And for sure, commodities had been quiet for a little while.

But we got -you remember we got that question pretty frequently. And the answer we gave was a pretty straightforward
one, which is when we dealt with our clients, we knew the business of hedging, managing their risk, investing in
clients. We knew that was an important part of what they did. And it ties very nicely into our Investment Banking
franchise, where we provide advice and capital to all those clients.
And so I know it's a bit of a reminder when you see the fourth quarter when you see a pickup in performance that it
reinforces that you really need to listen to your clients when you're thinking about your strategy in terms of the
businesses that you invest in and those business that you protect across the cycle. And so part of the consistency that
you've seen from us is the investment in these various businesses across a long cycle. It might be commodities. A
couple years ago people were talking about the fact that mergers were never coming back. And so from a client
perspective in terms of risk, our risks are quite manageable for the sector. You had asked that also, so I just wanted to
finish with that.

Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for dialing in.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Thank you. Just on the outlook for 2015, in your press release earlier this morning, [ph] a lot of
(33:08) rather optimistic tones speaking to seeing evidence of a pickup in the global economy that will improve the
opportunity set for 2015. Could you be a bit more specific and speak to how you see that improved opportunity set
evolving on a business-by-business basis?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I'll give you my perspective on that. When you talk to the economists inside
Goldman Sachs, the general view, whether you're talking about the U.S., which clearly they have a more optimistic
view in terms of growth, Europe, Asia, is generally positive. And as I said, it's more of a continued grinding forward.
And so if we see continued stability in terms of markets, normalization of interest rates, and really fundamentally
steady growing GDP, those are the things that historically over cycles have translated well for us because it contributes
to global confidence, and global confidence contributes to activity. And so it gets back to the theme I started with
earlier, which is over the last couple of years, we ourselves have made adjustments in an environment which has been
choppy, as I said, and also a bit uneven. And what we've needed to do is we've needed to replace significant revenues.
And so you see what we're doing, the extent of which we hopefully will have fewer revenues to replace in the future.
Hopefully, this will translate into growth. But again, it's all going to be driven by the environment. That's the one thing
we can't control. We can just respond to it.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. On the equities business, I probably just I missed this in your prepared remarks, but just
curious as to what drove the strength in the equity client execution line.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So for a couple quarters. I know you were focused on it. It looked a little lower. In
this particular quarter, there were some very solid opportunities to provide capital to clients and volumes. But again,
when you look across the equity business, when we see uptick in client activity and when you see trending prices, the
strength of the franchise really comes to the front, whether it's in client brokerage, client execution, or commissions and
fees.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay, it sounds like it's a little more lumpy than you normally expect for the quarter.

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: There's some seasonality in there. There are some rebalances that we participated in
and some other things. But again, these aren't one-time events. They're just annual events. They happen throughout the
course of the year.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay, and then just lastly for me a quick cleanup question. On the sale of Metro, the $325
million in revenues last year, what kind of costs came with those revenues?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's a very small contributor to pre-tax. You shouldn't think of it as meaningful at all
in pre-tax terms.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Given the big move in the Swiss franc, there are some reports that banks lost some big money.
Specifically to what's happened this week, can you comment? And then more generally, how does this impact your
move towards electronic trading of FX?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: First of all, in terms of Goldman Sachs, immaterial from an economic perspective;
so you don't need to worry about that. There's nothing there. I will say what we all witnessed here I'd say is pretty
extraordinary. I haven't confirmed any stats. But just going through with some of the folks, the single largest move in a
day of any developed country; I think it was something like a 20-plus standard deviation move, and I think it was after
three-plus years of 2% volatility. So you're right to call it extraordinary; but again, no issues here. For us, it really is an
opportunity really for very high-level engagement with clients who both need liquidity and then the longer-term
questions about working with local corporates who have had an immediate shift in competitiveness and what does it
mean. So there will be obviously a long-term focus.
In terms of e-trading, there are always things you take away from these. I'm sure there will potentially be some lessons
learned, but I don't necessarily have any major takeaways. It certainly doesn't change our investment philosophy in
terms of when you think about e-trading.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then one other question. You mentioned the 300 basis point pre-tax margin improvement
since 2012. I have to imagine it might get tougher if revenues don't grow more. What are some additional levers you
have for pre-tax margins? You've done a lot on non-comp. You certainly have done a lot on comp. Is there any more to
go?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: First of all, Mike, I appreciate you acknowledging our efforts on expenses because
it has been really a multiyear effort in terms of being disciplined. Again, it's going to be environment driven. Right now
when we look at the global footprint, we feel really, really well positioned in terms of our geographic footprint and our
product footprint.
But look, we're committed to staying very focused on expenses. You're not going to see us take the foot off here, and so
we'll see. The big thing that we've been trying to achieve in the last couple years, as we've talked about a lot, is putting
in operating leverage. And while we've replaced the $2 billion-plus in revenues over the last couple years, it would be
great. We'd all like to see the environment being one that provided another couple billion dollars in revenues. And we
think we have that operating leverage, so we feel well positioned.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: If I could first follow up on the expense question, maybe just trying to get a little
more detail in terms of the opportunity from here, I think you and a lot of other firms have a relocation strategy trying
to bring down some of the, especially back office and non-sales facing of costs. Maybe you could just frame it, the
opportunity there. I think a lot of people also look at the Street overall and think those opportunities become less
top-heavy. And then obviously, there has been a structural reduction in comp that has contributed; so maybe just
pushing a little bit on where you can go from here on expenses.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So as part of the expense [ph] opportunities (39:55) over the last couple years, it's a
great question. As you know, we've been diversifying ourselves geographically in places like Salt Lake City,
Bangalore, and others, and they represent about 25% of the firm's head count at this stage give or take. I think there's
continued opportunity.
One thing I'll say, which is something at this stage which is hard to quantify but we're looking to take a leadership role
in, which is over the next several years, as you really get all of these rules in place around all of the various trading
venues around the world, there certainly will be a need for scale consistency across the various market participants and
the way things are processed, the way information is managed, the way transactions are confirmed, and things are
reported. And so the short nut of that is internally we're going to continue to lever technology anywhere we can, and
that's been a big part of what we've done. But we're also going to try and do that as much as we can, working with other
folks in the industry and our clients to make sure we're all being as efficient as we possibly can as we all work in the
same rule set.
Now you didn't specifically ask about it, but obviously we're going to stay relentlessly focused on the balance sheet and
how we deploy our capital.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: I got you. That brings me to the next question. Earlier it was asked about, looking
at maybe businesses or areas to get out of or swap. But as you just think about your current business mix and the
opportunity to adopt to the new capital rules, how much opportunity is there to refine the balance sheet and have those
ratios increase more than you would think, just based on say the net income less capital deployment?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I think when you look at our ratios now, we think they're in quite a good place.
We'll see what happens when the final rules are done. I guess I would say we start again with the client businesses. And
given the strength of all of our businesses at this stage, equities, fixed income, Investment Banking, Asset Management,
our Investing and Lending business, we look at the strength of those businesses and our competitive position, it really
feels at this stage it's very, very tactical, and it's about fine-point execution. Of course, that could all change and again
we'll stay nimble, but that's where we would stand today.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then I guess just to push on that, it was just a year and a half ago that
the supplement leverage ratio was even proposed. So I would assume it's hard to be completely efficient in adopting
that throughout the businesses.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sorry, I think you'll continue to see improvement in things like that. That's not what
I was saying. What I was saying is it's going to be tactical. We'll continue to work at it because you're right, we're new
and we're just living with it. But I don't see it at this stage, given the adjustments, the business we've sold, the things
we've done, the balance sheet. I don't see us making their decision in terms around our business commitment and our

commitment to our clients. That's what I meant. So you're not going to see the sale of another reinsurance business
soon.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. But just adopting these – basically the question is, how much optimizing is
there out there for you to do, maintaining your current strategy and the strengths that you have?

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: I just wanted to ask a couple questions on VaR. I was intrigued by the straight VaR,
which came down Q-on-Q, and obviously we had the Flash Crash in October. So does this represent maybe a VaR that
went up early in the quarter and then, as folks moved to the sidelines, that came back down, or am I thinking about that
wrong?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So if you look at the VaR quarter over quarter, it went from $66 million down to
$63 million, and you see the rate category move down. Currencies is up. It followed more the flows and levels of
activity. In some businesses, it was the result of position changes. But I don't think there's any major takeaways. Market
volatility was a bigger driver, and position changes was really a net reduction.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: [ph] Represented (44:42) volatility, you had the ostensibly bad volatility in rates, so I
suppose that's why it came down a bit. But should we expect it as – if you get some slightly higher volatility, I would
expect it would move higher. Is that accurate, or no?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I think maybe the best way to answer this question is to think about it in terms of
average volatility across the quarter. And so, the way we look at it because, as we've discussed before, from a risk
perspective, VaR is an important risk measure, but obviously, it can be influenced by market volatilities. So if you
actually, if you look at the change in terms of how it moved, the market volatility was an increase. It was more or less
offset by position reductions during the course of the quarter, and that's what drove the change. In rates specifically,
volatility was up, and our positions were down. That probably gives you a really good roadmap in terms of how the risk
moved during the quarter.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Got it, okay. And then separately, just could you give us a sense as to how you're
thinking about the Asset Management business and opportunities to expand that inorganically? If there's any sense of...
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yes, sure. So you've seen us do small bolt-on acquisitions over time. We're
constantly looking at things. Obviously, Asset Management has been a very important driver of growth over the last
several years. And this is – we're really, I think, in the early stages of what you're seeing, a strategic initiative to grow
Asset Management. And the team has done a great job, and I highlighted the three-year and the five-year returns. So
we're open to really looking at anything, and so it really all – will all be driven by whether or not we think we can
improve our performance and deliver better results for our clients. So I would say we're very open-minded. But again,
these things have to be accretive, and we look through them at a very careful lens.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And distribution, is that something that you could potentially add to?

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: We feel quite good about – we really do feel like we have a significantly
differentiated Private Wealth franchise, and our institutional team is great, and we get a lot of value out of our
third-party distributors. And so again, Betsy, look, we're the leading M&A firm in the world. So I think if a good idea
walked in the door and one of our bankers had it, we'd be the first firm to talk about it. It would be a little inconsistent
with our whole philosophy not to talk about it, but it's not a priority right now for us. It's really about performance and
delivering for the clients.

Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Good morning, Harvey, a couple things. One, we've seen volatility spike on and off for a number
of months now. Do you have a sense for how this is impacting client risk appetites and their willingness to transact?
And I'm thinking corporate and investing clients in Investment Banking, as I suppose – as well in Trading.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So look, I think when you think about Investment Banking clients and CEOs and
boards and CFOs in terms of how their making long-term strategic decisions, that's really – that will be influenced by
day-to-day volatility. And obviously, every informational fact is digested, but those long-term strategic decisions are
really based more on long-term competitive drive and global growth and that kind of stability, and so it's a factor. But
as I said when we went through the call, we come in with our backlog at the highest point it's been since 2007, and that
should give you some indication of what we think the momentum is in the Advisory business. It could always change,
but that's where the momentum stands today.
In terms of the investing clients and those involved in the capital markets more directly, it's an interesting question. In
periods where there's less friction and ease of liquidity, liquidity begets activity. And maybe the language we should be
using is less about volatility and more about volatility and liquidity. Volatility with an absence of liquidity is maybe
that unfriendly version that people are looking to try and find language to describe. And when you have volatility but
you have liquidity, you can then react and you can execute on the new information you receive. So I'm not sure I got to
your questions, but I tried.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. You talked on the M&A side. Is it similar for some of the underwriting businesses, that
maybe you're not seeing the volatility cause corporate clients to maybe pull back on plans there?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I don't know if I'd necessarily say it's pulling back on plans in terms of the – it's
really more whether the market's more receptive or not. If you really just wanted to contrast underwriting activity in the
fourth quarter of 2013 with the fourth quarter of 2014, you just saw capital markets that kind of thundered through the
end of the year last year, and this year, the capital markets just had a lot more to digest. I would say that was more
driven by the investing side basically saying hey, look, let's take a pause and let's reassess, versus issuers' desire to
issue at low yields. And obviously, there was spread pressure on the high-yield as people digested the lower energy
prices, but we'll see how the year goes. I think at these rate levels and these equity market levels, activity levels could
be robust during the course of the year. But again, we'll have to see what the market delivers.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. Expenses have been hit on a couple times, but I think more directly my question would be,
have we hit a point where we need to see revenue growth to see further profit margin expansion?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It will depend on what happens in the environment. Again, we're going to stay very
focused on both lines. And so again, I guess I could add to that question, at the risk of sounding a little bit cute. We've
actually grown it and revenues have been flat, and they haven't really been flat because we've been growing other
businesses. So we've displayed the ability to do it for the last couple of years. Look, we're going to be very, very

thoughtful, as we have been, about the balance of investing in the businesses where we see long-term growth. But
again, we're not going to stop our relentless focus on efficiency.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. And finally, we're starting to hear again some talk of some competitors at least exiting
some of the trading businesses. Do you see that as a competitive opportunity? Does it help you to maybe expand wallet
share, improve pricing, or is it just some of the businesses aren't as profitable and the whole pie is going to shrink? Are
you seeing some of that?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So we're certainly seeing in various businesses, we feel it at least. Again, we don't
have full transparency, but in our dialogue with our clients, we felt it in commodities this year. We've seen it in other
parts of the business.
I guess what I would say is, in an environment like this, in terms of the competitive dynamic, I think if you want to be
in these businesses through the whole cycle, I think some of the takeaways are, you have to have scale. It's very hard
just to be in cash equities or to be in a very small component of the foreign exchange market, and you have to be able to
leverage that scale really across the full franchise. It's not really just about the equity business, the prime brokerage
business, or the commodity business. You need technology scale to really be effective through the whole cycle. And
then you need the diversity because, as we've seen, some pistons will fire sometimes and sometimes they won't at other
points, as we go through this. And so that's why we feel good about our competitive position, because we know our
clients still want to trade bonds and we know they still want to hedge FX, and we know they still want to manage their
commodity risk. As we work through this part of the cycle, it's just about us being well positioned and having that
scale, and we feel like we have it.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hi, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. Just to follow up on the VaR question but to ask it in terms of the change for
the full year, can you give us a sense just as you walk through the different asset classes of how much of the change
over the course of the year was position reduction versus volatility change?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So you're saying last year versus this year?
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yes, so for example, if we look at rates, over the course of the year it fell from $62 million to
$41 million. And I'm just curious how much of that change was reduction in positions versus change in volatility, what
are the components.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Dane can get it to you. I don't have the line-by-line in my head in terms of that. But
I can tell you on the year-over-year in aggregate – what I mean line by line, I don't have the specific categories in my
head. But year over year, basically position changes were a reduction that was about three times the increase in terms of
the volatility levels, so it's real risk reduction.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it, okay. That's exactly what I was trying to get to. And maybe I will follow up on the
others, but that's real helpful. Just a housekeeping question on the core Tier 1, the 12.2% advanced approach
transitional, right? Can you update us on the fully phased?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Sure. So it's 11.1% under the fully phased. Do you want me to give you the
standardized as well while we're talking about it?
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yes, exactly.

Page 14 of 26
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: That's fine. Okay, so 11.3%, as I said, under the transitional for standardized, and
then 10.2% under fully phased. Now just a reminder on this, fully phased for us is really a conservative expectation, all
other factors being equal. In other words, if we just stood here today with exactly the same balance sheet and nothing
changed except for the retirement of funds as we comply with Volcker and do these other things, you should probably
add back call it 40 basis points, 50 basis points to those fully phased numbers. Okay?
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that's also really helpful. The question has been asked a couple of times, but maybe I'll
take a slightly different crack at it in terms of the volatility that we've seen since the first of the year, not just in terms of
what happened yesterday in the currency market but more broadly with rates, long rates. I know we're only a couple
weeks into the year. But do you expect a significant rethink in terms of the amount of risk that you and peers will be
putting on the desks between now and the end of the quarter, the middle of the year?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So it's a great question because it allows me to just underscore a very important
point. We scale our risk deployment to our client demand, not the other way. And so it will really depend on what
happens in terms of the clients and their perceptions in the marketplace. And again, I think it goes back to if you
compare the third quarter to the fourth quarter, if we see more Septembers, then I think you'll see increasing amounts of
client activity and opportunities for us to provide liquidity to our clients and deploy capital. I think if you see more
Octobers and more Decembers, I think you might see less. Again, that's why we run these businesses for the long term.
I think importantly, one of the takeaways around these businesses is that there are times when things do change
structurally. One of the structural changes has been a decade-plus shift to electronic trading and the need for
technology. But people still wake up every morning and they want to trade bonds and they want to hedge foreign
exchange. Nothing about that has changed; it's just where we are in the cycle.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. One final question, and this isn't something that you frequently disclose, but there was
a disclosure a number of years ago that in the period between 2006 and 2009, about half of your FICC revenues had
been in some derivatives. And now that we've been through a significant period of regulatory change in terms of
derivatives and cost of carry and everything, I was wondering if you could comment for 2014. Roughly what
percentage of FICC revenues would have come from derivative transactions?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I don't have that data handy, but we could dig into it. And if it's meaningful, we can
certainly share it with folks.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: I guess the follow-up would be is it meaningfully less than it used to be?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: The one thing I would say is that – and maybe these are good things. But post the
crisis, lots of things had built up in 2006 and 2007 like clients' trading correlation and other things which during the
crisis proved to be less liquid than other thing. That certainly looked like business that may be gone forever. I hate to
say that, but it feels that way for now, and maybe they should be. So there are certainly elements of the derivative
market that appear structurally changed since the crisis, but we don't track that specifically from an audited perspective,
so I don't have that data.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, thanks for the color though. I appreciate it.

<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Sorry, can you hear me?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yes, no worries.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Sorry, I was having problems with my phone. Can you talk a bit about – I think you said
that in the fourth quarter the derisking helped the RWAs. But historically you've talked about mitigation going forward.
So can you talk about your plans for Basel III RWAs? And also I know it's early days, but there were some new
proposals out of Basel before Christmas. Do you have any thoughts on those on how they would or could affect you as
a U.S. bank?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: On the new proposals, obviously, we'll do what we've done in the past. We want to
be an active and constructive participant in the dialogue with the regulators, but it's pretty early days on lots of those
discussions. But again, we'll just participate in that dialogue and you'll see our comments and things like that.
In terms of – I think there's an important thing to highlight here. There are no businesses here that we're looking to shut
down in terms of driving, improving capital ratios. We feel quite good with the significant progress our teams have
made over the last couple years. Now having said that, again, this is something that I just think of this as standard
operating procedure for any regulated financial institution in terms of having technology, tools, education, and a
process towards making sure you deploy your capital in a way that's most impactful for your clients and provide your
shareholders with the best return. And so I think that's a standard operating procedure for us. So you'll continue to see
us mitigate. But at this stage, we've made a huge amount of progress. There's a whole host of things I can highlight. I
think the balance sheet reduction exercise you saw in the second quarter was a real demonstration of responsive
nimbleness.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Jim.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Just quickly maybe, if you can, talk about some of the other – the more liquidity ratios. Do
you have any update on where you guys stand on the LCR and NSFR? Have you done any back of the envelope stuff
with respect to those?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So in relation to the LCR [ph] exercise (1:01:32), we're in excess of the
requirement.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: In terms of the NSFR, that's an interesting one because, obviously, if you take a
step back on the NSFR, obviously, any rule that's supportive of good thoughtful industry-wide asset/liability
management, we're supportive of.
It will be very interesting to see how the rule evolves in its discussions with the local regulators because, as you know,
in the proposed rule that came out, there really are – there are some interesting things in there, one being obviously this
notion of how transactions get linked. So we'll have to see what the final determination on that is when we get that from
local regulators; and also, obviously, the treatment of deposits where different geographies have different legal and
regulatory regimes. And in the U.S., obviously, we have a restrictive regime in terms of how deposits can be utilized.
So I'd say on the NSFR, it's a bit of a wait-and-see.

<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. I would imagine with you guys given your structure that the TLAC is probably not a
problem. Is that a fair statement?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Again, where we stand today, again a preliminary rule, so I'd probably lump that
with all the facts that we'll have to see where it goes, but that would be our takeaway and our early read.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, and then maybe just broadly on the pipeline, record levels. It sounds like one area,
advisory, is clearly strong. Can you comment on the other areas where you're seeing? Is debt still holding in there given
the financing needs for the M&A environment? How is equities doing? How do we think about the pipeline and the
different components?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So as I said, the advisory side of the line was really the biggest driver. That's
probably not a surprise for you given all the announced transactions in the marketplace. If you looked at it year over
year, equity was down, debt was up a little bit. But it does feel like at least if the marketplace and asset prices can stay
here, it feels like a reasonable environment to me for the coming year, but again these things can change on a dime.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right, okay. That's all I've got. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: Yes, good morning. Every quarter we go through this in looking at the Capital
Markets business. Rates and credits zigged and currencies and equities zagged, and you talk about the environment in
October versus November and so on. But when I look at the industry revenue totals on an annual basis, they're
incredibly stable. My peer group is probably the same as yours, but it's been somewhere between $110 billion and $120
billion of revenues on an annual basis ever since 2011 and were probably like 7% or 8%, below 11% now. And it just
seems to me like the explanation must be that the buy side is becoming increasingly concentrated, larger entities, more
resourced. And just like you're able to measure client profitability, they're able to measure what they pay all the
brokers. Isn't the issue more that there's a fixed wallet that the buy side has on an annual basis and that there's not going
to be an environment in the future where they pay a whole lot more than they are now?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I guess this is why you have a long philosophical conversation that probably
requires having a glass of wine or a beer or something. But I think that you have to really look at these businesses over
very, very long periods of time. And so, for example, when there was growth, let's just take it from the period of like
2002 to 2007. I don't think clients were looking to pay more. I think they were always very, very obsessed around
transaction costs. As a matter of fact, the vast reduction in transaction costs, for example, in the equity business actually
occurred during that period of growth.
And so we assume that our clients as fiduciaries are always going to focus on transaction costs. I think that's less the
issue. I think it's much more environment driven. We've been in a period of near zero global interest rates for an
extended period of time post the financial crisis. And so I think our clients are in some respects as a result struggling
for their own output production in some cases, which translates again into reduced activity. But our clients have always
been focused on minimizing transaction costs, as they should be.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: Okay, fair enough
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's a philosophical conversation.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: Okay, fair enough. If I was right, would you manage your business differently than
you are?

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's hard for me to imagine any of our businesses and say look, they're going to stay
exactly the same for the next 10 years. But frankly, that would be a nice way to live. But our businesses are just much
more dynamic than that. We think it's part of the competitive dynamics of going to [indiscernible] (1:06:36) just
responding to the changes. So I think it's going to be dynamic.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: All right, fair enough.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I think we have an opportunity here today to predict like it was a couple years ago.
No one would have predicted the wave in M&A that we're experiencing. But now of course it feels very natural, and
now people feel like it will extend. I do think this is a case of all of us. There's just a natural inclination to extend the
most recent set of data that we have. Now if it was going to stay like this for the next 10 years and you promised me
that, yes, there maybe we would even push harder on efficiencies. But again, we're positioning for operating leverage
and growth.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, Brennan.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So first a quick one on Banco Espírito Santo, lots of inquiries given what happened this
quarter and your involvement in the initial deal. Did that have any impact on results this quarter at all?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So in terms of firm-wide results this quarter, it's immaterial; and I guess I would
add in terms of the FICC side of the business, not the primary driver. But for us, obviously, as you've seen in our public
commentary, we were very surprised by the Bank of Portugal's unexpected and very surprising reversal of its prior
written decision on this matter. And so for us really, this is really – this is about our clients. This is not about Goldman
Sachs. And so we have clients that relied on those representations, and so we remain in active dialogue with the Bank
of Portugal, and obviously it's a very fluid situation.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. But is it fair to characterize it as maybe small, but in your view, immaterial impact?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I'd say not a primary driver of FICC, but obviously in FICC.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's obviously part of the revenue decline.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Got it. And then thinking about your physical business on the commodities side, you guys
are one of the few left. We're seeing, given some of the dynamics there in that market, an improving bid for storage.
How are you seeing that play out in your physical business as we move forward from here?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So we always think of our focus in commodities as really – and what you should
think about it is divided into two things, investments that we make in terms of things like Metro, which we sold during
the course of the quarter. When we purchased Metro, it was always purchased with the notion that we would add value
to the enterprise and then ultimately sell Metro. That was always part of the strategic design.
In terms of our commodity franchise, which we're, as you know, very committed to, the focus there is on the hedging of
commodity price exposures and working with all those clients globally, whether they be corporates or investors. And so
that's really how we think about the strategy. Obviously, ownership of physical commodities is getting what we think is
actually a good review by the Federal Reserve. We're very focused on safety and soundness. We think it's perfectly

understandable that they're doing the same, but that's our strategy in commodities.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then last one, also just on oil, thinking about the drop here in oil and your M&A
franchise, energy has been a pretty meaningful part of the M&A market the last few years. What sort of near-term and
then maybe a bit longer-term impact do you anticipate the drop in oil would have to M&A activity from here?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I think big picture, the drop in oil really started in June, but obviously started
getting a lot of attention in the fourth quarter. I think at the highest level, a lot has been written about the trade-offs
between near-term impact on markets, but obviously a big tailwind in terms of expense reduction and a benefit to the
consumer. And so we talked to our economists. Net-net, as you've seen from us, we think the price decline, if it stays
here, is a tailwind for global economic growth.
As it relates specifically to the industry, if we go through a period of sustained declined prices around this level, then
clearly it's going to put certain parts of the industry under stress. There will be opportunities to help those clients work
through those stresses. There will be opportunities to deploy new hedging strategies. There will be potentially merger
opportunities as the organization works through what is really a case of excess supply. So again, it's very early days and
these things tend to play out over months and years when you get these kind of price declines. But clearly clients will
be looking for advice from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, but no specific commentary as far as the M&A outlook is concerned and the impact
there?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No, I think it's a bit early. And I think it will be very specific to certain situations in
terms of how we work through the cycle.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, thanks for the color, Harvey.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hey, Harvey. Good morning.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey, how are you?
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Doing well, thanks. I just had one follow-up question on the capital discussion. Maybe
looking at it from a different angle, the presentation you guys had given a couple of months ago was extraordinarily
informative. It certainly helped us think about all the differing constraints that you're managing to. But from your
perspective, given that the business adjustments that you plan on making are merely going to be tactical at this juncture
and given our understanding of the constraints and the final rules and where they sit today, what do you believe your
spot or required capital levels are at the moment to support your business?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I don't think we should under-emphasize the word tactical. I think tactical really
means there are no big strategic challenges over here in terms of businesses that we need to dispose of at this stage.
Really, we're quite pleased with the strength of our franchise businesses. And so I wouldn't underestimate, I wouldn't
mistake tactical for a lack of focus or a lack of opportunity. As I said, I think it's really a prerequisite to running the
businesses now in terms of having a very focused tactical strategy, and I appreciate your comments about the
presentation we gave.
In terms of how we think about long-run capital levels, obviously the capital rules aren't finalized, so maybe we should
just talk about today's context. In today's context, and we'll see what happens with the finalization of the GSIB buffers,
but in today's context, we would be at a minimum of 8.5% and we had a stated buffer of 9.5%. We've been spending
time looking at the buffer. I think the 1% probably seems on the high end to us. We're not going to spend a lot of time

on it until we see the final rules. Did I get to your question?
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: It does. But presumably given what we know today, whether it's about CCAR being binding
or the Fed's latest proposal, recognizing that there could be additional changes going forward, that 8.5%-plus whatever
buffer you deem appropriate is probably not where your required capital target is ultimately going to shake out.
Presumably, it will be higher than that, and not just for you but for industry peers as well.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yes, I would agree with that. You didn't ask the question but again this is a very
early read of the proposal that's out and so subject to change, so caveat it accordingly. But our early read and
interpretation of the documents out there is that it would add 1% for us. And so what you said earlier I think is the more
important thing, which is in terms of the binding constraints, the binding constraint for us is CCAR. And so we'll
continue to focus very much on all aspects of the capital ratios, but for us the binding constraint has proven to be
CCAR.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, maybe just one quick follow-up. Is CCAR risk-based or leverage-based ratios because
I thought in the last exam it was leverage? I didn't know if you felt that that would potentially evolve as CCAR changes
over the next couple of years.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So look, I think that the Federal Reserve had said CCAR is going to be dynamic,
and so we'll see how they make changes, and their test has proven to be dynamic. We can only tell you it was
constraining last year, as you saw publicly, because of the leverage test, and then you saw us subsequently take certain
actions. That obviously influenced our activity around the balance sheet and how we had to think about repricing that
capital.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: All right, Harvey, that's really helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good to hear from you.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my question, just a couple of quick
administrative follow-ups. Just following up on the prior discussion, have you provided, or given any thought to, the
short-term wholesale funding buffer and how that might affect your future ratios, and if there is any meaningful
consideration being given within that calculation for the maturity, even within the short-term bucket?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So as I said before, just so we're clear with everybody, so our preliminary
expectation, and again, I caveat that because this rule is very fluid and it's in formation only, would add an incremental
100 basis points to our GSIB buffer.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: In terms of how we're – again, I think it's really most important for a takeaway for
everyone to understand the framework for how we think about managing the capital against multiple constraints. So, in
a new regulatory regime, anytime we're deploying our balance sheets, you have to be able to think through multiple
lenses and view things through multiple lenses. That's why we created the framework that we discussed at the
conference in November, which basically ascribes a weighting system to that. And that gives us a consistent lens to
look at things like the use of balance sheet and the supplementary leverage ratio, stresses from CCAR, Basel III
standardized, Basel III advanced, and you have to look at all those things individually at the same time. So capital
management, the regulators have done an immense amount of work to increase capital levels and make the system
safer. And as a market participant, we need to develop technologies and a philosophy and an approach to basically
work within that framework, and that's what we've done.

Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Hey, good morning, Harvey, just a couple quick follow-ups from me as well here. So just on the
Investment Banking backlog comments, glad to hear that the backlog is where it is. But with debt underwriting
specifically, can you speak to maybe some of the puts and takes of the high bar in recent years in corporate issuance
that may be tough to match, versus the opportunity that you're speaking about with M&A-related financings, and how
much of an offset that could represent?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So of all the things that I've been, I think, really bad at predicting over the last
couple years, it's been the annual question about what we think debt underwriting is going to do in the next year. I think
you can easily take a position, after the last two years, that maybe debt underwriting will be low, lower than the
previous year, but the markets have remained robust. M&A activity can be a significant driver of financing activity. I
think if rates stay low and the markets are stable and spreads are tight, I think you could see a very reasonable
environment. I think if you see the contrary, then obviously it would have an impact on activity. Very difficult to
predict from here, rates are very low, so for many issuers, it's going to look quite attractive over the course of the year.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay, thanks for the color. And then just on comp, some of your peers are talking about
changing their methodology around deferred comp. And I know you don't specifically disclose the level of deferred
comp. But in a roughly flat year for reported comp, is it reasonable to assume that deferred comp is also roughly flat, or
is there any additional qualitative detail you can provide around how you guys are thinking about the mix there?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So I think the better way to think about that is, we've been consistent in our
compensation philosophy for a number of years in terms of really ensuring that our employees – and it goes up as you
go up through the seniority of the firm through to the partners, that you hold a significant amount of equity. And there
has been no change in philosophy over the last several years. So your assumption is correct.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.

<Q - Doug C. Sipkin>: Thank you, good morning, two questions. First on FICC, I'm just curious for your guys'
perspective and opinion, Harvey. Given the change in liquidity that's come to these markets in the last, let's call it, five
or six years since the credit crisis, is your guys' position that credit is maybe a little bit more vulnerable to smaller
shocks given the lack of liquidity? I.e., I guess energy feels like it was the catalyst really for credit to weaken, but it's
still only – I mean it's bigger, but it's only like 14%, 15% of high yield. So is it more pronounced now, credit events,

given the lack of liquidity? Is that your guys' perspective, or it was just kind of a tough quarter?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No, it would be very difficult to anticipate whether or not this is kind of a new
credit regime in terms of liquidity trading, or these are one-off factors. It's always hard to assess that when you've had
multiple years of tightening credit spreads, very low default rates. I will say, when you look to the data, I don't have it
off the top of my head, particularly in Europe, where liquidity was really challenged in the third quarter and then got
worse in the fourth quarter. I think [ph] because we had (1:21:48) market moves in terms of price movements, they
were pretty significant, more significant than you would have thought in terms of the underlying credit itself. And so
clearly liquidity played a role in terms of the degree of price movement. But I wouldn't say at this stage you could draw
any firm conclusions from that, in terms of any long-term structural changes.
<Q - Doug C. Sipkin>: Okay, great; and then shifting to Asset Management, obviously a great year for you guys. I was
a little surprised to see the fixed income bucket on the flow side a little flattish for the fourth quarter, and I was
wondering. Did you guys close some strategies or did something change, just given how strong you guys have done
obviously with performance, and some of your competitors struggling throughout the year? And it still looked like
fourth quarter, industry-wide that phenomenon has still played out. So I was just curious as to why you guys didn't have
the same flow dynamic you had throughout the first three quarters.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I haven't had a chance to dig through competitor results and maybe get more
transparency over time than we do. But when we look at it over the course of the year, which is really how we think
about it, we took in $74 billion of long-term flows, of which you highlighted $58 billion came into fixed income. This
could be just the timing of how various mandates that are awarded arrive. We feel quite good about our performance
and our ability to continue to gather assets on the back of that performance.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay, thanks. I just wanted to call out that you had mentioned that you had $754 million
of litigation and regulatory expense in the period. I just want to make sure that that's all related to investigations and not
compliance cost in there.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So, those are litigation-related reserves that we assess every quarter, and we take it
quarterly, based on information we have on individual and specific cases. That's not a compensation build or an
expense related to additional compliance people or something. I'm not sure I understood the question, so I'm just trying
to clarify it.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Yes, that's the question. So if those investigations go away, is that what the expense
savings would be, or it's more of a normalized level of litigation?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: As we work through legacy costs, ultimately that is the case.
<Q - Brian M. Kleinhanzl>: Okay. Will you be able to put most of the major investigations behind you in 2015, do
you think?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So in terms of litigation, you've seen us obviously make progress in the third
quarter. We settled with the FHFA. I would encourage you to really dig through our disclosure, where we give very
vast disclosure around all facets of litigation and status.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning.
Operator
Eric, please check your line to see if you're on mute.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Hey.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Sorry.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No problem.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi. How are you? That's only like the fifth time I've done that in this earnings cycle. I just
wanted to follow up on the RWA discussion and see, Harvey, if you could just help me understand what the puts and
takes of it might be over the course of this year?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Are you saying on a going-forward basis?
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Correct.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Yes, on a going-forward basis, again, I would say there's two things I'd underscore.
The first is, we're going to continue to be very focused on further rule compliance and being efficient about the capital.
But a lot of it will be driven by client activity. Obviously, we're well positioned from a capital perspective, and so we
really want to stay front-footed, as we are, to the extent to which clients demand our capital. And so we feel
well-positioned. Hard for me to tell you what those demands are going to be as we sit here in January, but we feel very
well positioned.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And in terms of the very broad-based reduction in assets that you undertook over the course
of this year, should we view that as being largely completed, or is that something that is still under consideration for
you over the course of this upcoming year?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So immediately, we have no immediate plans to reduce the balance sheet from
here. But again, that's going to be subject to review continuously, and so again it will be dynamic. If we feel like we are
not getting the proper returns, then we'll look to reduce. It's really just going to be about discipline, at the same time
making sure that we invest strategically for the long run.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. And then if I could just transition for a moment and in terms of the M&A pipeline,
could you give us any sense of the complexion of it? Is it primarily in-country? Is it more cross-border? Are we seeing
any changes? I guess the real question is, are we seeing any changes in terms of the complexion of M&A activity
relative to what we've seen over this past year?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No. Look, in terms of year over year, as you would expect, the growth specifically
in terms of the backlog, it really came more from Americas and Europe, and it was really down in terms of Asia. That's
how I would describe the geographic mix, which probably doesn't surprise you.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: What is the – I guess I'm trying to understand. Is the strategic rationale changing at all
among corporate boards in terms of growth orientation versus cost savings orientation, or any kind of that
strategic-level discussion?

<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: I think when we talk to our M&A team, what they'll tell you is it's very
industry-specific. It can be geographic, but the momentum level is quite high. And so I guess when you look back at it,
as I said earlier, there were a number of folks who were saying look, we'd never see M&A again a couple years ago,
and that was just where we were in the cycle. But I think that in a world which generally is increasingly stable, low
growth but stable, CEOs and boards will look to grow revenues and if there is strategic opportunity. The one thing that
we've seen as part of this past cycle, driven by strategics, is large transactions tend to spin off lots of activity in
particular sectors. So I don't know. If you talk to our M&A team, I don't know that they'd say look, this is all
cost-driven or this is all top line driven. It's a mix of factors that will drive action. But momentum feels quite good.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning, Dick.
<Q - Richard X. Bove>: Hi, good morning. This is a broad question, so I apologize after a very long call. But over the
past couple of days, having gotten questions on both sides of Goldman Sachs's, if you will, long-term structure, one is,
given everything that you've mentioned about capital and the constraints on the business placed by the regulators,
should in fact Goldman Sachs be broken up? And if not, why should it be kept together?
And on the other side of being asked, given the high level of cyclicality in the two main businesses of the company,
should Goldman Sachs make a major acquisition of either an asset management company or a wealth management
company, which would give the company a recurring stream of revenue to eliminate some of the issues of volatility in
its revenues and earnings? I don't know. It's the same question basically, which is what should the structure of Goldman
Sachs be over the next four to five years.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: So it's a good question, Dick, and obviously there has been a lot of focus on this.
So I'm guess first we have to say to ourselves, if anything, what's changed today because I think prior to the crisis, there
was a belief that obviously there are benefits to scale and you can get scale and you can have synergies. I think the
change that people are focused on now is obviously there's a cost, a capital cost that the regulators are putting on size,
and so it's very natural the question that you're asking.
Now for GS, I've highlighted a couple things. First of all, we're just significantly smaller than many of the other firms.
With our balance sheet at $850 billion-plus, many of our competitors are more than twice our size. And we have 34,000
employees, and they may have hundreds of thousands of employees, and so we're smaller and we're less complex, and
as a result we're somewhat simpler.
And so what I would say is when we look at the collection of businesses that we have, the way we answer the synergy
question is first and foremost through the eyes of a client. Do we think we provide more value to our clients by having
a collection of businesses together or not? It doesn't matter to us whether in any given quarter the stock markets may be
not valuing one of our businesses as perfectly as we would like it to be. It's really a question of over the long run can
we drive shareholder value by having that benefit to our clients.
So let's take fixed income and equities as one example. In an environment where it's technology driven and the clients
increasingly get larger, you need scale across those businesses. We started running those businesses as a collective
shortly after 2000 I think. And so the ability to deliver one technology platform across those businesses, have one risk
management system, all those things provide us with scale and we think we're able to execute better. It then feeds into
our ability to adapt and develop technology tools around capital, and hopefully we're able to perform more in terms
deploying the firm's capital.

When you think about investment banking, you bundle it in. Think about the merger business today and what we're
able to do for our clients by having the ability to commit the capital and actually deliver it to the capital markets and
connect investors with issuers. All these things are very synergistic. Our private wealth business with our banking
business, with our asset management business, these are all things that we think we have synergies in.
Now in terms of smaller or bigger, I think it's going to be environment-driven for us. You've seen us shrink the balance
sheet pretty dramatically. Dick, you've known this for a long time. We used to run at $1.1 trillion – $1.2 trillion. We've
been around $900 billion and now well below that for quite a while, and so you're going to see us be dynamic about
this. If we thought we could drive more value for our clients and get more scale, then we would consider things. I will
say now it's harder obviously because there is the explicit pricing and, if you want to call it, tax of incremental capital.
You have to be very confident that you can get those synergies and that scale. Is that the right – is that answer okay
given the breadth of your question?
<Q - Richard X. Bove>: I think it makes a great deal of sense. What about the flip side of the question, which is where
can you come up with a recurring revenue stream that would lower the volatility in your current business mix?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: It's funny, so I can't help myself, Dick. I know you said there's a lot of volatility in
our current revenue mix. But we've actually produced $34 billion in revenues for three years running and we've grown
the ROE and we've shrunk the balance sheet and we've increased the pre-tax and we've replaced $2.5 billion of
revenues that didn't disappear because of volatility. They disappeared because we sold them. So I'm not telling you it's
going to always be this stable, but touch wood, it feels pretty stable the last couple years.
<Q - Richard X. Bove>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Andrew Lim with Société Générale. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Hi. Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Good morning.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Good morning. I've got a question on the trading book review that obviously the Basel committee
is undertaking and whether you could give any more color on what kind of impact it might have on the industry on an
absolute basis, and also how you stack up relative to your peers,
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: On the trading book review, we think it's very important obviously, and we're in
active dialogue. There have been the QISs, and so again but it's very early on that. So I don't have any specific
comments on the trading book review. I think what I would say is that – and again, I think you have to give credit and
kudos to the regulators. They've been incredibly productive over the last several years. If we parse the list out, all the
regulatory changes, it's incredible in terms of the impact on capital liquidity, trading, swap execution facilities. And so
one of the things I think we all need to consider as market participants, and when I say that I mean clients, folks like
ourselves and regulators, is we need to maybe at least think about pausing a bit and digesting the impact of these rules.
There's no doubt that these rules make the system stronger and safer, as I said before. I do think there's a benefit to
observing how they interact over long periods of time because you can't get all those benefits without some cost. We
can't necessarily always identify those costs immediately. And so that would be my very high-level comment on that,
but I don't have any specific comments on any proposed revisions to the rules.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Is it something that you're running internally just to see what the impact is at the moment, or is it
too early to do that?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: We're very consistent in our philosophy in this in terms of proposed rules. It
follows a very normal course protocol for us. We work as constructively as we can with the regulators in terms of

trying to provide them with data and dialogue on the impact of a rule. So we're always active participants, and we
dedicate a lot of time and people and system and mass to the QISs that come out with any rule. And we always try and
be an active participant in terms of giving good balanced feedback to the regulators in terms of the benefits and costs of
any proposed rule. We're just very early in this potential rewrite. It's just too early to comment on it.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Okay, and then just going on, say, another regulation to that NSFR. I know you said that was
early as well, but any thoughts about how that might impinge on your prime brokerage business in terms of
encumberment of your balance sheet assets?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Again, too early to tell. We'll see how it ultimately evolves when we get a local
regulation. As I said, a big part of the discussion will be around the treatment of deposits. But look, I think what you're
going to see the world do as they address is all firms, not just Goldman Sachs, all firms will look for what we'll call net
stable funding ratio funding, whatever that ends up being defined as. And so we'll see how the rule evolves, but look,
we'll adapt. You've seen us do it, whether it's the Basel III ratio, the supplementary leverage ratio, all these things. We
still need to see a rule.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Okay, and just one final question. Is there a target SLR that you're aiming for heading into the
CCAR at all?
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: No, at this stage not. As you saw – you said the SLR, right? At this stage, as you
saw, we're at 5%. That's up about 80 basis points in the course of the year, so now we're compliant with 2018. One of
the things is we'll continue to review this. There are a whole host of factors that could improve that ratio from here. But
again, we'll be assessing all of our buffers as we get the final capital rules. Again, they all interact, so you really want to
get to a point of stability of rule-making, and then you can really set the parameters and dial them in more tightly.
<Q - Andrew Lim>: Great, thanks a lot.
<A - Harvey Mitchell Schwartz>: Thank you, I appreciate you dialing in.
