Martin J. Schroeter
Thank you for joining us today. As we get into the first quarter results, you'll see that our performance reflects the
actions we talked about in our last call. We're transitioning to key growth areas and transforming parts of the business.
In the quarter we announced a $1.2 billion investment to globally expand our SoftLayer cloud hubs. We launched
BlueMix, our new platform-as-a-service to speed deployment of hybrid clouds. We acquired both Aspera and Cloudant
to extend our capabilities in big data and cloud. We're expanding our ecosystem around OpenPOWER, and we created
an integrated business unit around Watson and announced $1 billion investment to bring cognitive capabilities to the
enterprise.
As we move to these growth areas, we're also taking portfolio actions to divest businesses that no longer fit our
strategic profile. In January we had the initial closing for the divestiture of our customer care BPO business, and we
announced the sale of our industry standard server business to our partner Lenovo. This quarter, as expected, we took a
substantial charge to align our resources and skills to the demand profile we see. This charge impacts our results this
quarter, but it will pay back within the year. So we got a lot done this quarter. Many of these actions impact our top and
bottom line in the short term, but have long-term benefits.
For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $22.5 billion and operating EPS of $2.54. Our Software performance was
driven by 5% constant currency growth in Key Branded Middleware. We're continuing to see strong client demand and
great results in areas like mobile, cloud and security, where we've been targeting our investments.
Our Services business was up 2% at constant currency with growth in both Services segments, adjusting for the sale of
the customer care business. The growth reflects our expanded cloud offerings, the ramp in some of the large
outsourcing contracts we signed last year and good performance in both Consulting and Systems Integration.
Looking at hardware, as expected, the combination of secular and cyclical challenges continued. Last quarter I talked
about business model challenges specific to Power, Storage and System x. Let me tell you about some of the actions
we've taken.
As I mentioned, we're selling our industry-standard server business to Lenovo. We are repositioning Power and
building an ecosystem around OpenPOWER, and we've taken actions across Power and Storage to rightsize the
business to the market dynamics. Our System z performance in both revenue growth and margin reflects that we're six
quarters into the product cycle, though on solid ground secularly.
Looking at the financial metrics for our operating results this quarter, IBM's revenue was down 4%, or 1% at constant
currency adjusting for the customer care divestiture. That's a 2-point sequential improvement from our fourth-quarter
rate. We had constant currency growth in software, services and financing, which was more than offset by a decline in
Systems and Technology. The currency impact to revenue growth was about a point and a half. Currency was also a
headwind to our profit performance, reflecting impacts from the yen and the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.
This quarter we improved gross margin by 90 basis points driven by services and our ongoing mix to software. The
profit dynamics below the gross profit line are impacted by the charge of nearly $900 million for workforce
rebalancing, as well as a gain of about $100 million for the sale of our customer care business, and so are not
representative of our future run-rate. Our pre-tax income was down 19%, and net income down 22%.
Within net income, our tax rate was worse by 2.7 points year-to-year. The 20% rate in the quarter reflects our view of
the annual operating tax rate for 2014. This quarter we returned significant value to shareholders including over $8
billion of gross share repurchases, and $1 billion in dividends. We generated free cash flow of $600 million, which was
down $1.1 billion year-to-year.
In January, we highlighted a substantial cash tax headwind for 2014. This was skewed to first-quarter and cash tax
payments were up $1.4 billion year-to-year. So without the cash tax increase, our free cash flow was up $300 million.
So now I'll get into the details of the quarter, starting with revenue by geography on a constant currency basis.
America's revenue was down 2% year-to-year, consistent with last quarter's performance. We had strong growth in

software, but hardware performance, especially in the U.S. remains challenged. Once again we had good performance
in Latin America, led by Brazil.
EMEA was up 1%. The improvement was driven by a return to growth in both Germany and Italy. In Asia-Pacific,
revenue was down 6%. Within that, we had another good quarter in Japan. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of
revenue growth in Japan. Asia-Pacific outside of Japan declined. In total, major markets were down 1% with
improvement from last quarter's performance driven by EMEA.
The growth markets were down 5%. And within the growth markets we had high single digit growth in Latin America.
But revenue from the Asia-Pacific countries declined at a double-digit rate with continued weakness in China. Our
revenue in China was down 20%. So pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. We expect it will take some time
for our business in China to improve. Because we view the bulk of the challenges in the growth markets as cyclical,
and we still see good opportunity over the long term, we're continuing to invest in these key markets to capture that
opportunity.
Turning to the segment perspective. I've already commented on the revenue drivers and will address those further in the
services, software and hardware discussions. Looking at the gross profit, in total, our operating gross margin improved
90 basis points. We expanded margins in both Services segments, and the relative strength in our Software business
drove an improving mix. The improvements are mitigated by a 5-point decline in Systems and Technology. The
Systems decline is driven by a combination of margin degradation in Power and Storage, and a mix away from
higher-margin z due to the product cycle. Consistent with these product cycle dynamics, our margin in System z is up
year-to-year.
Our total operating expense and other income was up 8% year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2
points of expense growth while currency was fairly neutral to expense performance. So what we've labeled as base
expense on the chart, which is total expense less the impact of acquisitions and currency, was up 7 points.
There are a couple of larger items that are impacting this base expense. First, SG&A includes the workforce
rebalancing charge of about $870 million, nearly all of which is a year-to-year increase. We expect this to pay back
within the year.
The workforce rebalancing activity impacted the SG&A base performance by 16 points. So without the charges in both
years, our SG&A base expense would have been better 3 points year-to-year. And second, within other income and
expense, you see the gain of nearly $100 million from the sale of our customer care business. We anticipate a gain of a
similar amount in the second quarter, as we complete the country closings. Adjusting for both of these items, our total
base expense would have been better by 4 points rather than worse by 7 points. The 4-point improvement is more
indicative of the productivity in the base expense we delivered in the quarter.
I want to comment on another dynamic in our base expense. Within the base, we're continuing to shift our spending. So
for example, the $1.5 billion of R&D spending this quarter reflects the shift of development priorities to where we see
future growth. Our recent launch of BlueMix is a great example. We will be investing $1 billion to deliver unique
platform-as-a-service capabilities to connect enterprise data and applications to the cloud.
We'll talk more about how we're shifting investments in our investor briefing in May. Now let's turn to the segments,
and we'll start with Services.
This quarter, the combined Services segments generated $14 billion in revenue, which was down 2% as reported and
modest growth at constant currency. Adjusting for the Customer Care divestiture, total Services were up 2% at constant
currency, the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Services pre-tax profit was down 14% and margin
declined by 1.9 points. Without the workforce rebalancing charges in both years, profit was up 7% and margin
expanded by 1.5 points. Total backlog was $138 billion, which includes a reduction of $3.8 billion for the customer
care divestiture. Backlog was up 1% at constant currency when adjusted for the divestiture.
Turning to the two segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% as reported and down
1% at constant currency, but up 2% at constant currency adjusting for the divestiture. Within GTS our SoftLayer

platform provides a highly differentiated solution for clients looking to deploy across public, private or hybrid clouds
unified on one platform. The range and scope of production workloads has been expanding, we have good growth in
Enterprise Transformation projects and the introduction of BlueMix has generated broad interest with application
developers.
This quarter, SoftLayer contributed about 1 point to GTS' revenue growth. As I mentioned earlier, we're spending $1.2
billion to expand our global cloud footprint. We'll double our SoftLayer centers and with 40 cloud datacenters in 15
countries, IBM will have cloud centers in every major geography and key financial center.
GTS Outsourcing returned to growth at 1% constant currency adjusted for the divestiture. Growth was driven by the
substantial new contracts we brought on during 2013. GTS pre-tax profit declined 15% in the quarter. This includes a
20-point year-to-year impact from work force rebalancing charges. GTS pre-tax profit also includes a gain of about
$100 million for the divestiture. Keep in mind that GTS profit is impacted by the divestiture of those operations. In
addition, we're continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as mobility, security and cloud, and these
initiatives are gaining traction but are not yet at scale.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.5 billion, flat year-to-year as reported and up 2% at constant
currency. Consulting and Systems Integration grew 5% at constant currency, driven by the practices that address the
digital front office. We delivered growth across cloud and business analytics, and we had good success in projects for
clients on systems of engagement and helping clients connect these new front-end capabilities to their back-end
systems and processes.
In fact, we are ranked number one in overall business consulting and cloud professional services by IDC and number
one in mobility consulting services by Forrester, a good indication of our success in front office transformations. We're
continuing to invest strategically and, in March, we committed $100 million to expand our consulting services
capability with 10 new IBM interactive labs and 1,000 employees to address client experience, design, and
engagement.
Application outsourcing was down 8% at constant currency. Our performance reflects increased pricing pressure and
client contract renegotiations, as well as a reduction in elective projects.
Turning to profit, GBS declined 11% year-to-year. Without the work force rebalancing charges, profit would have been
up double-digit reflecting improved productivity in the base. Software revenue was up 2% to $5.7 billion. Key Branded
Middleware grew 5% at constant currency. Our enterprise clients continue to rely on IBM's middleware solutions to
transform their infrastructure and handle their business-critical transactions. We deliver this through a combination of
on-premise and SaaS solutions. Our SaaS offerings span our software brands, and this quarter our SaaS revenue grew
more than 25% year-to-year.
Looking in our results by brand, WebSphere had another strong quarter, up 12% year-to-year led by app server and
mobile solutions. We continue to have strong growth in MobileFirst, our comprehensive portfolio of mobile software
and services that enables our clients to manage, integrate and leverage mobile devices. We've been building capabilities
to address this space and we now have over 3,000 mobile experts. Across software and services, IBM's mobile business
doubled from the prior year.
Our application server business delivered strong growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. This is an example of our
clients utilizing on-premise software to manage the infrastructure workloads driven by mobile, big data, and analytics.
This is the 13th year in a row that Gartner named IBM the market share leader in application infrastructure and
middleware software, and with 30% market share we're nearly double the size of our closest competitor.
Information Management software was up 2% at constant currency. Growth was led by distributed database and master
data management, which are key elements of our big data and analytics solutions. This quarter we added
Database-as-a-Service capability with the acquisition of Cloudant. Cloudant extends IBM's mobile and cloud platforms
by enabling developers to easily and quickly create next-generation mobile and Web applications.

Tivoli grew revenue 7%. This quarter we had growth in all three of Tivoli's product segments, systems management,
storage and security. Security grew double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our results are being driven in part
by incremental requirements for security as clients expand into cloud and mobile computing. Our portfolio of security
offerings across IBM grew more than 20% this quarter.
Workforce Solutions declined 4% at constant currency. Strong growth in our SaaS offerings were more than offset by a
decline in our on-premise Notes business. We are transforming our business and building up the recurring strains from
SaaS.
I mentioned earlier that in the first quarter, we launched BlueMix, which will make all of our middleware accessible via
the cloud. With BlueMix, developers can efficiently build cloud applications with reusable pieces of code tied to their
enterprise systems. This enables businesses to leverage the flexibility that cloud applications provide.
Systems and Technology revenue of $2.4 billion was down 23%. This reflects both the product cycle of System z and
the secular challenges in Power, Storage and System x. In January, we entered into a definitive agreement with Lenovo
to divest our System x business. And in the first quarter, we continued to reposition offerings in other parts of our
hardware business to make them more relevant and we took actions to align our structure to the demand profile we see.
Looking at our results this quarter, System z revenue was down 40%, with MIPS down 19% year-to-year. We're in our
sixth quarter of the product cycle and gross profit margin was up year-to-year, consistent with this point in the cycle.
System z is a core franchise which provides mission-critical infrastructure for our customers, and we continue to invest
in the platform. It's worth noting that earlier this month, we celebrated the mainframe's 50th year.
Power revenue declined 21% at constant currency. We are aggressively repositioning this platform with a couple of key
initiatives. First, the OpenPOWER consortium makes power technology available to an open development alliance.
This quarter we expanded our OpenPOWER ecosystem. And second, we are expanding our Linux capabilities through
our POWER8 launch this year. POWER8 is the first processor built for big data and delivers better cloud economics.
Storage hardware revenue was down 23%. Our Flash solutions contributed growth again this quarter. However, we saw
substantial weakness in high-end storage. As we've discussed, our focus for STG in 2014 is to stabilize the profit base.
The repositioning of the Power platform, the announcement of POWER8, new announcements in Storage, and the
rightsizing of the business will all contribute as we move through the rest of the year. This, together with the divestiture
of System x, will result in a smaller and more profitable hardware business going forward.
IBM will remain a leader in high-performance and high-end systems in storage and in cognitive computing, and we'll
continue to invest in R&D for advanced semiconductor technology.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $600 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which is down $1.1 billion
year-to-year. As you can see, our CapEx was up nearly $200 million year-to-year, which includes investment in
additional SoftLayer capacity. But the real driver of the year-to-year decline was a $1.4 billion increase in tax
payments, driven by audit settlement payments and other prior-period discrete tax impacts that settled this quarter.
Excluding the increased tax payments, free cash flow would have been up $300 million year-to-year.
Looking at the uses of our cash, we spent almost $300 million on acquisitions, acquiring Aspera and Cloudant. We
returned $9.2 billion to shareholders, including $1 billion in dividends, and we bought back over 45 million shares for
$8.2 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had $6.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
I want to remind you, that our free cash flow generation is always skewed to the back end of the year. In fact, if you
look over the last 10 years, the average free cash flow generated in the first quarter is less than 5% of our full-year total.
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $9.7 billion, which was down $1.4 billion
from December. Total debt was $44 billion, which includes $28.3 billion to support our financing business. The
leverage in our financing business remains at seven to one. Our non-financing debt was $15.7 billion and our
non-financing debt-to-cap was 55%. Given the skew of free cash flow, we expect our debt-to-cap to be in the 50's for
the next two quarters and roughly flat year-to-year at year-end.

So now let me wrap up the discussion on the quarter. There are major shifts in our industry driven by data, cloud, and
changes in the way individuals are engaging. This quarter, we had good performance in our offerings that address these
shifts. Our business analytics revenue was up 6% at constant currency on a large base. Our cloud revenue was up over
50%, with doubling of our cloud-as-a-service business, and we had strong growth in mobile and security.
Just as importantly, we continue to take significant actions to move to these growth areas. I talked about some of the
targeted investments we're making, including SoftLayer capacity, BlueMix and Watson. We're focused on allocating
our capital efficiently and effectively, which means investing in the right places, as well as moving away from areas
that don't support our shift to higher value. This is an important part of our model. In fact, over the last few years,
including the recently announced sale of our industry standard server business, we've divested over $6 billion of
revenue. The result is a stronger, more relevant business.
As we look to the balance of 2014, we continue to expect good performance in the key growth areas, though our overall
revenue growth will be impacted by the challenges in our hardware business and the customer care divestiture. The
currency impact to revenue moderates at current spot rates, but we do expect currency to continue to impact profit. Our
margin will reflect the ongoing productivity initiatives and actions to improve our cost base, as well as the relative
strength of software. And as always, we reinvest some of the productivity savings to drive our growth areas.
I mentioned earlier that our annual effective tax rate for 2014 is 20%, and that's before any potential discrete tax items.
And of course, we'll continue to return value to our shareholders.
For the year, we expect to deliver at least $18 of operating earnings per share. This does not include any gain from the
sale of our System x business to Lenovo, because of the uncertainty of the timing and the amount. But it will ultimately
be included in our operating EPS results, and we'll update you later in the year.
Like always, we manage our business and allocate capital for the long term, and along the way we still expect to deliver
at least $20 of operating EPS in 2015.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Martin. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts
at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part
questions.
Chris, please open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may
ask your question.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you, Martin. I was hoping that you could confirm that you still expect to meet
your free cash flow goal for this year of $16 billion.
And secondly, in terms of goal-setting, you now have a much lower tax rate for the full year than you anticipated three
months ago. I think that's going to add about $0.70 to EPS that was not anticipated three months ago. You also
mentioned there may be discrete items. So I'd like to understand on that; A, why the tax rate changed so significantly in
three months? And secondly, do you have anticipated discrete items over the course of the year, and can you share
those with us?

<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Toni. I guess, first on free cash flow, as we noted in the prepared remarks, our free
cash flow was $600 million in the quarter and down about $1.1 billion year-to-year. Now, as we noted, the first quarter
always represents a fairly small amount.
I'm going to go through some math in a second, but to answer your question, we still do expect to grow free cash flow
year-to-year even though we do have a tax headwind this year. So the short answer to your question is yes, we still
expect to grow free cash flow.
When we look at our free cash flow on a year-to-year basis and we start to put in a more normal, like a model tax rate,
if you will. So we had, as you can see in our data big tax headwind, but in total we paid about $2.6 billion of cash taxes
in the year, so that's an 80% rate in the quarter. Obviously, that's not a rate driven by our model, it's not driven by the
way the business runs, but it just reflects really the tax audit that we finished in the fourth quarter and the related
payments around that. So we had a very high rate in the quarter.
Last year we had a rate of about 30% and so that $1.4 billion year-to-year, which we identified as driving – would have
driven $300 million year-to-year. The fact is on kind of a rate adjusted or a model basis, we would have grown faster,
again. So I'm very comfortable with the free cash flow generation in the business, and I think we're on track to deliver
the full year in a cash flow growth. Again, we do have a headwind this year and the bulk of it was in the first quarter.
On the tax rate, we were able to improve our expected full-year operating rate to 20% with a more favorable mix of
geographic income, and our income intercompany dividend plan resulted in higher usage of foreign tax credits for the
year. So that's our operating tax rate. The rate, however, as you noted and as we put in the prepared remarks excludes
any potential discrete tax impacts, which may occur, and those are, as you know, generally for non-recurring items. So
two examples that could affect our rate from here: First, we did announce the sale of our xSeries business. Now that has
been closed, but that could affect the rate, so the rate could be higher from the sale of the Lenovo business.
At the same time, I'm sure you're aware that there are bills being discussed in Washington; tax extender bills, which
could lower the rate further. So our operating rate of 20% is ultimately going to reflect not only our mix of geographic
income in the intercompany dividend plan which rolls into that operating tax rate, but it's also ultimately going to
reflect the discretes.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Toni. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. I just wanted to get a clarification on Toni's question for the full-year
guidance. I mean, given the lower tax rate as Toni mentioned, you're still offering the same EPS guide. So without the
lower tax rate it is a net guide down, so could you comment on what exactly has changed above the tax line versus your
prior expectations in the expectations you gave us in January?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, sure. We got a lot done in the first quarter. I mentioned some of those in my
prepared remarks, right? And roughly speaking, if I were to net it down, we continue to move our investments and our
resources to where we see the needs of our enterprise clients, and we continue to – we've divested a pretty substantial
business in xSeries that didn't fit our high-value model. So we did get a lot done in the quarter.
Now we also, as you would expect, look at the trajectory we see coming out of the quarter in order to get the right
guidance for the year. And I guess I'll go through it by segment. But first I think it's important to note that we did not
see much improvement in the trajectory in the GMU in the quarter. We were down 5% in the first quarter. We were
down 6% in the fourth quarter. So we are not seeing a trajectory improvement. GBS, as an example, just within the
GMU, went from high single-digit growth to low single-digit growth. So we are not seeing the trajectory improve in the
GMU as an example.

Now looking at the segments at a higher level or the complete segment view, in Services when you adjust for the
charge we took because again, we'll earn that charge back through the year, when you adjust for that charge we did
expand margin in the first quarter and we would expect that to continue. So in services, relative to last year when we
grew profit in low single digits, we're really only counting on kind of mid-single-digit growth across those businesses.
In software, we continue to see an improving growth rate in software and revenue, which obviously drives profitability.
And then in hardware, hardware was down 23% constant currency, and we expect both a cyclical and the secular
challenges that we see in that space to continue. So as we said in the last call, our focus in hardware is really to stabilize
that profit base on a year-to-year basis. So we do see the shifts we're making into the growth areas are absolutely the
right things to do. We are being successful in growing that part of the business, and our 1Q trajectory really reflects, I
think, no real improvement in the GMU.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Bill. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore. You may ask your question.
<Q - Rob G. Cihra>: Hi. Thank you very much. If you look at the hardware losses and with divesting the x86
business, I mean, that will help margins, but it won't necessarily change your cost structure that much. I'm wondering, I
mean, is it that this business is now just subscale, particularly including the microelectronics business? Or do you think
it's – you're just unfortunately at the bottom of mainframe and power cycles, and when you include the POWER8 and
you include the PowerLinux, you think you can sort of grow your way out of it? Or do you think it's a sort of an actual
cost structure that's now just too high for the business? Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Yeah, I'd say a few things, Rob. First, the mainframe revenue growth absolutely reflects
where we are in the cycle. There is not a secular challenge in mainframe at all. So the mainframe growth rates are
absolutely cyclical and it's not a scale issue when we get to announce a new mainframe that will absolutely turn.
In Power, as we said last time, we did have too much structure. There is a secular issue in Power, particularly at the low
end. Now we've said we were going to address that with a few different actions. First, we said OpenPOWER will be a
tremendous benefit to opening up that technology and getting more users on that platform, and we think OpenPOWER,
over the long term, will have a pretty solid impact in improving that platform.
Secondly, we said that we have POWER8 coming. We had this in the prepared remarks, and POWER8 is highly
relevant to big data workloads, relevant to the cloud. And so the secular move from low-end power onto industry-based
servers, we will battle back with POWER8 at a much better offering in that space. And then thirdly, we did have too
much structure in Power, and we did manage to get a fair bit of structure out of the business to set a cost base and get a
cost base into the Power platform.
In total on STG, let's go back to the total for a second. There is, obviously, a GP margin impact in the first quarter
down year-to-year. Some of that is, obviously, driven by the mainframe cycle and its lack of contribution, if you will,
lack of mix to the high end. Some of it's driven by the cost base. None of the improvements that we've made are really
felt in the first quarter.
And relative to what's going to come next in second through fourth, it is the lowest transaction volume quarter, so there
is just a high fixed cost base relative to what we have coming forward in the rest of the year. So I think the STG
business is on a path that we will achieve what we set out to achieve at the beginning of the year, which was to stabilize
that cost base and the profit base.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Rob. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Yes. Thank you. Talk about a couple financial measures. First, your share repurchase
was very large this quarter. Could you talk about what you anticipate going forward? I'm assuming it was pretty
front-end loaded but kind of what do you see for the full year? And perhaps related to that, you've roughly doubled
your non-finance debt over the last year. Did you say that you would take that ratio from 55% down to roughly 39% by
the end of the year, which is where you ended last year?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Steve. So on share repurchase we did front-end load this year's share repurchases, so
we would expect on a full-year basis to finish probably a little bit less than where we were last year. So we'll continue
to return capital to shareholders through the rest of the year, but it will be at a reduced rate relative to the first quarter.
And then on a debt-to-capitalization ratio, which you noted was 55%, we'll probably run in the 50%s the next couple of
quarters, but we will be back down to about where we started the year again by the end of the year.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let's go to the next question, please.

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Hi. I think investors are focused on this, so I'm going to just try to clarify it on the free cash
flow side. What I'm really confused about is that the charge was about $100 million lower than I thought. Then we have
the tax rate impact and the accelerated buyback, which was probably more than I think you guys probably modeled in
January. So with all that, you could have almost $1 billion taken out of the net income the street had and still guide to
$18. And I wanted to know, on cash flow, you said in your 10-K that you would grow cash flow by $1 billion
year-over-year, and we just took out almost $1 billion of the net income versus where we were in January. So I actually
don't understand how we get to the free cash flow numbers previously guided in that taking it in that light. If you could
just explain it that way, that would be really great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure. So, Ben, just to clarify again, we said at the beginning of the year we would grow
free cash flow by $1 billion, and we still feel that we'll grow free cash flow by $1 billion given where we started the
year. Again, the first quarter of the year is typically quite light in terms of cash flow. So when we look at the rest of the
year, in terms of free cash flow, obviously, we have a pretty substantial transactional business that picks up from first to
second quarter, and also sticks with us then in the third. And then the fourth is also a pretty substantial fourth quarter
transactional flow, which drives a lot of free cash flow for the year.
So in the first quarter you're seeing a substantial impact to the in-quarter free cash flow numbers simply because of the
size of the cash tax payments that we had to make in the first. Those do not replicate for the rest of year.
In terms of the $18, we said we would get to at least $18. We said in the first quarter that we would do about 14% of
that and that's where we came in, at 14%. Now we said about $1 billion of restructuring plus or minus $100 million,
and that's kind of where we came in. Now we had fewer shares, so on an EPS base the EPS impact was, I think, right in
the middle of where we would have put the original number, and we did get everything done that we wanted to get
done in terms of setting the right cost base. So I think that's fairly consistent.
And then, when we look at how the rest of the, at least, $18 rolls out, we had a big charge in our results in the second
quarter of last year. And obviously, we are not going to recreate that this year, so you're going to see big growth in the
second quarter. Now given that quarterly phenomena, a charge in the first of this year, but none in the second versus the
prior, we would think that the first half then, given that quarterly phenomena, that first half is going to look a lot like
last year and we'll probably get about 38% of our full-year EPS done by the end of the first half.
And then when we look at the second half, we'll see kind of consistent growth with what we need on a full-year basis at
[ph] 10.5 (37:16) and given the transactional nature and the momentum in some of our businesses, we would say it'd
probably be a little bit faster in the forth than in the third.

<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Ben. Let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. You may ask your question.
<Q - Louis R. Miscioscia>: Okay. Thank you. Switching over to the Services business. You talked about it a little bit.
It seemed like GBS did slow down somewhat. Maybe Consulting and Systems Integration was okay with growth rates
comparing last quarter to this quarter. But maybe you can go into more detail about the GBS Outsourcing business?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Lou. So a couple of things, GBS, 2% growth, it is slower quarter-to-quarter. As I
mentioned earlier, we saw a trajectory in the GMU that went from high single to low single-digit growth, as an
example. The bulk of the slowdown that we noted in the prepared remarks, was in the Application outsourcing
business, which was down year-to-year.
Now we have seen pretty substantial price pressure in that space. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, clients are
absolutely focused on cost takeout projects, and less focused and have decreasing volumes for what I would consider to
be more elective kind of projects. So we are seeing a shift in focus.
Now underneath that though – that's the revenue side. Underneath that, we do have a robust delivery platform that
allows us to manage even in that environment. And so from a GP perspective, gross profit perspective, we're
comfortable that we can continue to deliver profit even in that environment.
So you are right, as you saw in the data, our GBS did slow quarter-to-quarter. We're not expecting that the environment
changes dramatically. We're not counting on it to change dramatically, and we do have a pretty robust – as I mentioned,
a pretty robust delivery platform underneath that. And then in total as you saw, even with slower revenue growth, our
profit still grew 12% when you take out the charge. And I think it's important to take out the charge because we're
going to earn it back during the year, so that's more indicative of the kind of growth we can still deliver. Even on low
kind of profit growth, we can deliver even on a lower revenue trajectory.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Lou. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott. You may ask your question.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Hi. I was wondering, the growth markets seem to be continuing or continue to be a little bit
slow for you. I know that most of your projects there are larger projects and perhaps more profitable than some of your
other businesses. How do you plan to make that up in your plans going forward? And any color you can give on a
return to steady growth in either the Services business or the aggregate business would be great.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Joe. So a couple of things. Growth markets, as you know, they were down 5%. Now
we've been – experiencing a pretty tough environment in the growth markets for a few quarters now. Down 5%, as I
said earlier, is not the kind of trajectory improvement we're looking for in that business. Now when you look at it by
region, however, it's not a homogenous answer here. So in Latin America we had another good quarter of growth. Our
Latin America business for us is going really, really well. We were up 8% at constant currency.
In the Mid-East and in Central Europe we're about flat. Now that's down from growth we had seen before, but about
flat is at least hanging in, and our challenge areas have been in China, which was down double-digit, and in
Asia-Pacific, which was down in the mid-single digit.
So I think there are a blend here of issues. There are cyclical issues, there are secular issues, and they are not consistent
between the regions. We've talked in the past about China needing time to return to growth. We've talked about across

the growth markets that we still believe there is a very attractive region for us to invest in, so we're going to maintain
our investments. But there is a – both a mix of secular and cyclical.
Now we do have very heavy – a heavier concentration in the growth markets in our STG business than in other parts of
the world. And so while the growth markets are certainly impacted by the mainframe cycle like we are in other parts of
the world, that is not the bulk of the challenge in the GMU even though, again, STG is a bigger proponent. So the
GMU business does get impacted by this secular shift in our Power business as an example. There is a very difficult
price environment in our industry standard xSeries business. And I noted earlier that even our GBS business, from
quarter-to-quarter, slowed down a bit. So mix of secular and cyclical issues, some related to our own hardware issues,
others related to what the countries themselves see in terms of economic environments. But not a single answer across
the region.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Joe. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. In addition, the Software revenue, the constant currency growth was a little
bit weaker than we were thinking. I was wondering if you could talk about what were the forces that impacted that.
And more broadly, as you look at exiting the year on a constant currency basis and excluding dispositions, assuming
the x86 business goes, do you think IBM can get to a position whereby revenue growth is flat on a constant currency
basis? Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure, Keith. A couple of things. So in software, we grew 2 points at a segment basis. Our
Key Branded Middleware was up 5%.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right.
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: We would expect both of those to accelerate as we go through the year. We still see very
good software opportunity for our solutions, and we see very good software opportunity for the platforms that we're
building. In fact within the Key Branded Middleware, you probably noted on our software chart that WebSphere grew
12%. That's a pretty healthy double-digit growth within our core software business. So we do expect that to accelerate
as we go through the year.
Operating systems, particularly Power do impact that overall Software business. Power operating, the AIX operating
system is sold on as a one-time charge. So as those hardware sales decline for the reasons we talked about, that does
impact the overall software segment growth. Now, I don't think we're relying on. I'm not relying on Power to be
coming back strongly. But one, as it becomes a smaller part of the overall revenue stream, it has less of an impact. Then
quite frankly as I mentioned earlier, first quarter is our smallest transactional quarter, and so as we see improved
transactional flow in the rest of the year, that impact to the overall software revenue growth will decline.
In terms of overall revenue growth for the year, so I'd say a few things. One, we did have an impact from currency in
the first quarter, which was about 2 points, and we do see that now being flat for the rest of the year. Now interestingly,
at least I find it interesting, this was the first time since – I think it's 11 quarters, where we have not had a currency
headwind at current rates. So as currency moves, at least, to neutral for us, we won't be battling that headwind. And
again, at current rates we see that through the rest of the year. Obviously, we don't know where we might be in 90 days.
Customer care, and I know you said without the dispositions, customer care was about 1 point in the first quarter, but it
will be between 1 and 1.5 points for the rest of the year, so we will be dealing with that. And then I cannot predict when
the xSeries business, the xSeries divestiture may occur, and so I don't know what the overall impact will be to the top
line.
Now when we look though at the rest of the year on more of a segment basis as I mentioned, software we would expect
to improve the growth rate. The hardware declines though will continue. And we did set our cost base at a rate that we

can achieve our goal of stabilizing the profit on a year-to-year basis, but we do not expect that, and we're not counting
on those hardware revenue declines to stop. And then GTS and GBS, now services, we don't see dramatically different
rates of growth than we saw in 1Q, which is fine for our model.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Okay, Keith. Thank you. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.
<Q - Brian J. White>: Yeah, Martin. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mainframe cycle and just
remind us how often the mainframe and IBM is refreshed. You talked about it getting a little long in the tooth. It's a bit
of a drag, so how should we think about a refresh?
And also, Power Systems, how should we think about that in terms of improving the performance. I mean, you talked
about some things I think on the January call, but where are we in improving that performance. Will we see it this year?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Okay. So a couple of things, Brian. I don't think I said the mainframe was long in the
tooth. I cannot imagine those words coming out of my mouth. So I think the mainframe is as where we would expect
six quarters into the cycle, this is a very powerful platform for our clients. This drives a lot of value, and I would say
we are right in line with where we would expect it to be. I'd say there are three metrics to look at when we look at
where are we in the mainframe cycle. One, we do typically see this magnitude of a decline in revenue. So that is
absolutely consistent. The other thing we see at this point in the cycle is an improving margin. And we saw that as well
in the first quarter. That margin continues to improve and should through the rest of the cycle.
And then the other thing we look at is program to program MIPS growth. And we see as we have in prior cycles, at this
point, we see MIPS growth up about 26% relative to the previous cycle, so very good usage of that platform in
customer environment. So the mainframe is, as I said, exactly where we'd expect to be in the cycle.
On the Power side, Power is, as we've said before, Power has a secular challenge here, particularly at the low end. And
we said that OpenPOWER will certainly help and we have a few new members that we announced in OpenPOWER in
the quarter.
Now that is not going to have a profound impact on our Power business in the year. So I don't think you should be
looking at Power, and I don't think we'll be saying that Power is going to get better in the year because of
OpenPOWER.
We also have moved and made that Power platform much more relevant in the Linux space, which we've talked about
in the past as being a key driver of growth down the line but, again, that takes time. You have to get the ISVs on to
your platform and we're doing that. We have over 800 ISVs now in that space, writing applications for Linux on Power.
And then, the third thing that's important, from an ecosystem standpoint is to have the most competitive processor in
play in the space that you're targeting. And for us, we think POWER8, which is going to target that low end certainly
initially, is a very powerful processor that is really well suited to both big data applications and cloud environments.
So those three things will all help. Now Power is not going to turnaround right away. In fact, I think 2014 is going to be
a difficult year for Power if all you were to do is compare year-to-year revenue growth. But we are absolutely taking
the right actions to make that Power platform a sustainable and highly attractive economic model for us. We've taken
cost out of that base, and we are getting the right both technology and ecosystem around it to make sure that it has a
long-term future.

The last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. You may ask your question.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: Thank you. Martin, sorry to revisit the cash flow question. But I'm still confused about
the reconciliation of free cash flow growth and your net income growth. It seems that your EPS guide for the year, if
my math is right, implies flattish maybe even down net income this year.
And last quarter, I believe you indicated that some combination of operational performance and working capital
improvements would help drive that $1 billion increase year-over-year despite the $2 billion headwind from cash taxes.
So I understand the working capital comment. I understand what happened in the first quarter. However, could you
elaborate on the contribution from operational improvement given what appears to be flat to down net income in 2014?
<A - Martin J. Schroeter>: Sure. Well, let's look at this, I guess, from a – I'll try to do it from a pre-tax income flow
and then we'll talk, obviously, to that then we would add the impact of taxes, which we know is a headwind later in the
year, and then our capital allocation policy and the EPS driven from share repurchase. So in the first quarter, we had
$3.3 billion of free tax income. That had a charge in it, as we've talked about, that $900 million. And I'm going to use
kind of big round numbers. It'd be too hard to do this in millions, so I'll just use billions. So we had about $3.3 billion.
We had about a $900 million charge in that. So on a base level, that gets us to about $4.2 billion of pre-tax income.
Now we have that for, obviously, as a starting point for three more quarters and I add back the $1 billion in the charge
we took, which we are going to earn back in savings, and the $16 billion then goes to $17 billion. So let's use $17
billion as a base, in terms of – from starting from the first quarter.
Now I also noted that the first quarter is our lowest transactional skew and that what we see as we go through the year
is we add about $1 billion in profit growth from transactional business, as well as overall volumes in the second
through the fourth relative to what we did in the first and that again was our starting point. So another $3 billion from
that transactional growth, as we go through the year, so $17 billion as a base. Take the base of transactional growth that
goes from first to second and carry through fourth, that gets you to $20 billion.
And then in the fourth quarter, which was our biggest transactional quarter, we see transactional growth and we see this
across the businesses. We see it in software – especially the heavily transactional business. So obviously, we see it in
software and we see it in hardware as well. But across the businesses, from third to fourth, we add another – typically
about $3 billion of pre-tax income into the business.
Now we have different dynamics this year than we did in the fourth quarter of last year. For instance, our hardware
business was a much greater drag last year than we would expect it to be this year, given the momentum that we expect
out of parts of that business, i.e., momentum being described as less revenue declines, right? And we see pretty good
momentum, as I noted, in our Software business.
So that profit base, that PTI profit base of about $23 billion, with using 1Q as a starting point, again, we have a tax rate
headwind in the fourth quarter, but we also have a share repurchase benefit here, so that $23 billion of profit growth
drives our free cash flow for the year. And as I said, we still feel like we're going to grow free cash flow by about $1
billion for the year even with the tax headwind.
Martin J. Schroeter
So let me wrap up the call. As I said in the beginning, we did get a lot done this quarter. We did transition more of our
business into big data and analytics. We continue to move into the cloud. Our cloud platform is very powerful in the
marketplace. Good growth in mobile and security. And we have our Investor Day coming up on May 14, and we're
looking forward to sharing with everyone more about the capabilities and the investments we're making to drive those
businesses. Thanks very much.
