Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of
factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC
filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
Mike L. Corbat
Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today we reported earnings of $3.2 billion for the third quarter.
Excluding CVA and DVA and a tax benefit, net income was $3.3 billion or $1.02 per share. Our results reflect the
challenging operating environment, including a slowdown in client activity based on uncertainty regarding Fed
tapering, concerns about the effect of the U.S. government shutdown and forecast for slowing economic growth,
particularly in the emerging markets. Although I think we've performed relatively well in this challenging uneven
environment, we cannot and are not satisfied with these results and we'll be focusing on areas where we need to
continue to improve.
Turning to our individual businesses, the macro environment had the biggest impact on our markets businesses and in
particular, fixed income, where the typical slowdown in third quarter activity levels was exacerbated. We also pared
back some of our risks in emerging markets. That impacted trading opportunities, but it was the right thing to do for the
firm. We have more work to do in equities where our derivatives performance was not where we want it to be, but
year-to-date, we continue to make progress.
As for Investment Banking, although there were some transactions we would have liked to have participated in, we've
increased our share of wallets so far this year. Our Transaction Services businesses are still being affected by spread
compression, but we continue to work hard to offset that through volume growth and increased market share. In trade
loans, one of the several areas where we leverage our unique global network to a competitive advantage, new
originations grew 23% year-to-year.
In Consumer Banking, as expected, we faced significant revenue pressure as U.S. mortgage originations were sharply
reduced and we continued to adjust to regulatory changes in other markets such as Korea. We did see strong revenue
and volume growth in other markets, several of which we've designated as invest to grow. And importantly, our credit
trends remain favorable as we focus on our target segments around the world.
Although we can't control the revenue environment, we certainly can control our expenses. And expenses for the
quarter were $11.7 billion, 4% below the second quarter and the prior-year period. We achieved this while making
investments and bearing the brunt of increased regulatory costs. We remain on track with the repositioning actions we
announced late last year, which have helped reduce our head count by over 10,000 people year-to-year.
We're working on a variety of different efforts to improve our productivity. Some center on optimizing our global real
estate footprint and have resulted in reducing our portfolio of sites by 73. Others seek to reduce the turnaround time for
transactions and improve the client experience. More importantly, we're instilling the need for these efforts to be
business as usual, and not episodic.
We also continue to make progress in two critical areas, which I've identified for you before: reducing the drag
earnings caused by Citi Holdings and the utilization of our deferred tax assets. We reduced our assets in Citi Holdings
by $9 billion during the quarter. Holdings assets now total $122 billion and are 6% of our GAAP balance sheet. And
even without the benefit of an incremental loan loss reserve release, Holdings net loss was reduced for the third
consecutive quarter.
While legal costs associated with Citi Holdings will likely remain elevated in the near term, we took another significant
step to get past legacy issues with our agreement with Freddie Mac that following onto our agreement with Fannie Mae
during the second quarter.

Regarding our deferred tax assets we consumed $500 million of DTA during the third quarter. This modest amount
brings the 2013 total year-to-date to $1.8 billion. As you know, I want Citi to be known as an indisputably strong and
stable institution and again, we made progress towards this goal. The capital we generated this quarter primarily
through retained earnings and DTA utilization resulted in our Tier 1 common ratio increasing to an estimated 10.4% on
a Basel III basis. Other key metrics also strengthened, including our supplementary leverage ratio which increased to an
estimated 5.1%.
Looking towards the end of the year, we believe it's going remain a challenging environment, and growth uneven. As
has been the case historically, transitioning from a lower to higher rate environment doesn't happen without causing
disruptions especially in the emerging markets and we're clearly seeing evidence of that. In addition, the ongoing
uncertainty regarding the Fed tapering is keeping many investors on the sidelines and that may be for an extended
period of time.
In the U.S., the twin impact from the government shutdown and dangerous flirtation with the debt ceiling are clearly
impacting the economy and the financial markets. The housing market is still in recovery mode, but we expect
refinancing volumes to continue to decrease. We'll continue to take steps to make sure our mortgage and other
consumer businesses are sized correctly.
Internationally, emerging growth has slowed and will likely remain uneven but we still believe these markets will
outpace developed market growth. That being said, we manage our risk prudently and continue to adjust our appetite
based on the latest trends and conditions.
John will go through the debt, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?
John C. Gerspach
Great. Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. To start, I'd like to highlight some significant items affecting
our results this quarter. First, CVA and DVA were a negative $336 million pre-tax and $208 million after tax in the
third quarter for a negative impact on EPS of $0.07. We also recorded a tax benefit of $176 million related to the
resolution of certain tax audit items, which had a positive impact on EPS of $0.06 per share.
For comparison purposes, in the third quarter of 2012, CVA and DVA were negative $776 million pre-tax or $485
million after tax for a negative impact of $0.16 per share. We also had a tax benefit last year of $582 million or $0.19
per share. In addition, in the third quarter of 2012, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.7 billion related to the Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, which had a negative impact on EPS of $0.94 per share in that quarter.
Adjusting for these items, we earned $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2013 or $1.02 per share as compared to $1.06
per share on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2012. Throughout today's earnings presentation, I will be
discussing our results excluding CVA DVA, the tax benefits, and gains or losses on the sale of minority investments to
provide comparability to prior periods.
On slide 4, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter. We earned $3.3 billion in the third quarter, roughly flat to
last year as lower operating expenses and lower credit costs were offset by a decline in revenues and a higher tax rate.
Earnings per share declined 4%, including the impact of higher preferred dividends in the recent quarter. Citigroup end
of period loans were flat year-over-year at $658 billion as growth in Citicorp was offset by the continued decline in Citi
Holdings and deposits grew to $955 billion.
On slide 5, we provide more detail on revenues in constant dollars which declined 4% from last year and 8%,
sequentially. As Mike discussed, we faced a challenging operating environment across many of our businesses in the
third quarter. In Consumer Banking, revenues declined sequentially by roughly $350 million primarily driven by lower
U.S. mortgage refinancing activity, as well as the absence of $180 million gain in the second quarter. Securities and
Banking revenues declined by nearly $1.3 billion sequentially, as the seasonal decline in activity in the third quarter
was exacerbated by uncertainty around the timing of Fed tapering, the pending government shutdown and other
geopolitical events.

We also incurred losses on loan hedges as compared to gains in the prior quarter as spreads tightened versus the end of
the second quarter. In Transaction Services, revenues declined sequentially from a seasonally strong second quarter
which also included a $50 million gain. Year-over-year, revenues increased as growth in volumes and fees more than
offset the impact of spread compression. Holdings revenues were up versus prior periods, mostly driven by the absence
of rep and warranty reserve bills this quarter. Finally, foreign currency translation accounted for roughly $200 million
of the recorded revenue decline versus prior periods.
As we show on slide 6, we maintained our focus on expense discipline in the third quarter. Excluding legal and
repositioning costs, core operating expenses were roughly $10.8 billion down over $400 million year-over-year and
over $250 million sequentially in constant dollars. At the end of the second quarter, I said we expected to see about
$200 million of incremental repositioning savings by the end of 2013. We achieved about half of that amount in the
third quarter, or roughly $100 million.
The incremental $150 million of expense savings this quarter was comprised of lower performance based compensation
and lower transaction costs, both of which were driven by the more challenging revenue environment in the third
quarter. Legal costs remained elevated at nearly $700 million mostly reported in Citi Holdings, and repositioning costs
totaled $133 million for the third quarter mostly in Citicorp. Year-to-date, repositioning costs have averaged around
$125 million per quarter.
Naturally, there will be some variability quarter to quarter in these costs, as we continue to pursue our efficiency
efforts, but we do not anticipate taking another very large repositioning charge similar to the fourth quarter of last year.
On slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp generated third quarter revenues of $17
billion and net income of $3.4 billion. Year-over-year, revenues declined 7% and expenses were down 6% driven by
repositioning savings, lower performance based compensation, lower legal and related expenses and the impact of FX.
Credit costs in Citicorp increased year-over-year. Net credit losses continued to improve. However, reserve releases in
North America cards continued to decline and were partially offset by reserve bills in Latin America consumer. We
also built reserves in our unfunded corporate portfolio driven by an increase in commitments, as well as certain credits
migrating to lower risk ratings in the quarter. Year-to-date, Citicorp revenues grew 1% and expenses declined 3%
partially offset by the higher cost of credit resulting in 5% growth in pre-tax earnings.
Turning to Citi Holdings, revenues were nearly $1.3 billion and the net loss declined to roughly $100 million in the
third quarter. Citi Holdings ended the period with $122 billion of assets or 6% of total Citigroup assets.
Turning to Citicorp on slide 8, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. On this basis,
revenues grew 2% year-over-year while expenses declined 1%. In Latin America, revenues grew 6% and expenses
were up 4% from last year; while in Asia, revenues declined 2% and expenses were down 4%. Revenues were down in
EMEA, reflecting market exits in Turkey and Romania.
International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression as well as the impact of regulatory changes in
certain markets, including Korea. However, most underlying drivers showed sustained momentum in the third quarter.
Total average loans grew 5% from last year, and card purchase sales were up 8%. Credit costs of $836 million in the
third quarter were up 34% from last year. Net credit losses increased in dollar terms, but remained relatively stable as a
percentage of loans.
We also built loan loss reserves, including nearly $170 million in Latin America, roughly half of which was related to
our exposure to the top three homebuilders in Mexico with the remainder driven by continued portfolio growth as well
as potential losses from recent hurricanes in that region. I mentioned last quarter that we continued to monitor the
performance of our clients in the home building industry in Mexico, as well as the value of our collateral. At the end of
the third quarter, our loans outstanding to the top three builders totaled less than $300 million. The loan loss reserve
build in the recent quarter was driven by further deterioration in the financial and operating condition of these
companies and decreases in the value of our collateral, resulting from the breach of certain of these clients' credit
agreements with us as well as lower valuations. We will continue to monitor the performance of our homebuilder

clients, as well as the value of our collateral to determine whether additional reserves or charge-offs may be required in
future periods.
On slide nine, we show revenue details for Asia consumer. Lower revenues in the third quarter reflected spread
compression in retail banking, as well as the continued impact of regulatory changes in certain markets, most
significantly in Korea. Sequentially, the decline was also driven by lower investment sales revenues, which tend to
fluctuate more in line with retail investor sentiment and the broader capital markets environment. Card revenues
improved both year-over-year and sequentially, with continued growth in purchase sales across the region. And we saw
strong revenue growth in certain markets, including Hong Kong, India, Thailand and China.
Turning to Korea, we are in an ongoing process to reposition our consumer franchise in that market to improve its
operating efficiency and returns. And upon completion, Korea should better reflect our consumer franchise elsewhere
around the world with a footprint more concentrated in the major cities and a focus on high quality consumer segments.
We believe revenues in Korea could begin to stabilize in early 2014, but we expect this market to continue to present a
drag on year-over-year revenue comparisons for Asia through at least next year.
Slide 10 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues were down 12% year-over-year and
6% sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.1 billion declined by 35% from last year and 29%, sequentially,
reflecting lower mortgage origination revenues as well as continued spread compression on deposits, partially offset by
growth in deposits and commercial loans. Also, as we mentioned last quarter, our mortgage revenues in the second
quarter included a gain of roughly $180 million on the sale of an on-balance-sheet mortgage portfolio.
Cards revenues of $3.6 billion were roughly flat versus last year, as an improvement in net interest spreads was offset
by lower average loan balances. On a sequential basis, revenues grew 4% as average loan balances stabilized in
Citi-branded cards and net interest spreads continued to improve. In Retail services, spreads were lower, driven by a
higher mix of deferred interest promotional balances, but loan balances grew due to the acquisition of the Best Buy
portfolio.
Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were down 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower legal and related
costs and repositioning savings. Third-quarter results reflected a portion of the benefit we expect from actions we have
taken to reduce the expense base in mortgages in light of the lower origination activities. However, we also saw higher
expenses in Cards as a result of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.
The net reduction on expenses quarter-over-quarter was mostly driven by continued repositioning actions as well as
reduced marketing expenses. Credit costs increased year-over-year as net credit losses continued to improve. But the
loan loss reserve release also declined to just over $200 million, driven by Cards. Overall, while we faced significant
mortgage and spread related headwinds in North America this quarter that are likely to continue, we also saw some
progress in our core franchise. Average deposits continued to grow, up 8% year-over-year including 15% growth in
checking account balances. Commercial market loans were up 15% and card purchase sales grew year-over-year in
both portfolios.
Slide 11 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit quality in North America continued to improve
in the third quarter, with a decline in the NCL rate reflecting both underlying improvement in the portfolio as well as
the impact of purchase accounting for the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. In Asia and EMEA we also saw stable to
improving credit trends. And in Latin America, the net credit loss rate has remained fairly flat for the past several
quarters. We expect the fourth quarter NCL rate in Latin America to remain roughly flat to third quarter levels.
However, as we've stated previously, the rate could be higher if we incur any material losses on our exposures to
homebuilders in Mexico.
In addition, as I mentioned, we took reserves this quarter for estimated potential losses resulting from the two recent
hurricanes in Mexico. Any such losses may increase our NCL rate in the coming quarters. However, we would expect
these losses to be charged against the reserve and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit.
Slide 12 shows our Securities and Banking business. Revenues of $5.1 billion declined 10% from last year and 20%
from the prior quarter. Investment Banking revenues of $839 million were down 10% from the prior year and 19%

from last quarter, mostly in line with the overall market. While revenues declined in the third quarter, our franchise
continued to show momentum year-to-date with revenues up 10% year-over-year and wallet share gains in most major
products.
Equity market revenues of $710 million were up 36% from last year, reflecting market share gains as well as
improvement in our derivatives trading performance. Sequentially, equity market revenues declined 25% as cash equity
revenues declined broadly in line with overall market volumes and trading performance was weaker in derivatives.
While our derivatives results were lower this quarter, we continue to make progress in building this franchise, which
contributed to the 24% growth in equities revenues year-to-date.
Fixed income market revenues of $2.8 billion declined 26% from a particularly strong third quarter last year when we
benefited from an environment with strong liquidity, more robust client activity, and significant credit spread
tightening. By contrast, the recent quarter reflected a general slowdown in client activity, exacerbated by uncertainty
around the timing of Fed tapering, the pending government shutdown and other geopolitical events.
Sequentially, fixed income revenues declined 17%, reflecting the slowdown in activity as well as actions to pare back
risk given volatility in the emerging markets. Private bank revenues of $614 million were up slightly from last year,
and down 5% sequentially driven by lower capital markets activity.
Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $377 million in the
third quarter, down 10% from last year on lower volumes and down 16% sequentially on lower spreads as well as
losses on loan sale activity. Total operating expenses of $3.4 billion were down both year-over-year and sequentially,
reflecting the impact of head-count reductions and lower performance based compensation. For the first nine months of
2013, total revenues increased 6% over last year driven by Equities and Investment Banking, while expenses declined
3%, resulting in 13% net income growth.
Moving to Transaction Services on slide 13, revenues of $2.6 billion were up 2% from last year in constant dollars, as
strong fee income growth more than offset a decline in net interest revenues. Treasury and Trade solutions was up 1%,
as volume and fee growth was partially offset by the impact of spread compression globally, and Securities and Fund
Services revenues grew 3% as higher settlement volumes in fees more than offset lower spreads.
Sequentially, revenues declined 4%, reflecting seasonally strong client activity, and a one-time gain of roughly $50
million in the prior quarter. Spread compression continued to dampen revenues this quarter. However, the volume
drivers for Transaction Services showed sustained momentum. Trade loan originations grew 23% year-over-year.
Average deposits were up 4%. Assets under custody grew by 9% and SFS settlement volumes grew 11%. Expenses of
$1.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year in constant dollars driven mainly by higher volumes, partially offset by efficiency
savings.
While expense growth outpaced revenue growth in the third quarter, we continue to believe the business can achieve
positive operating leverage in total for the second half of 2013, even when excluding the repositioning costs incurred in
the fourth quarter of last year.
Slide 14 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were up versus the prior year driven by hedging activities,
partially offset by lower AFS sales while expenses declined mostly reflecting lower legal and related costs. Assets of
$313 billion included approximately $119 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $139 billion of liquid available for
sale securities.
Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with assets of $122 billion in Citi Holdings or 6% of total
Citigroup assets. The $9 billion reduction in the third quarter reflected $4 billion of asset sales, and $5 billion of net pay
downs. On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings' financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.3 billion were up
year-over-year and sequentially, primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve bills this quarter.
Citi Holdings' expenses increased 16% year-over-year to $1.4 billion driven by higher legal and related costs.
Excluding these legal costs, core operating expenses declined 16% to roughly $790 million. Net credit losses continued
to improve in the third quarter driven by North America mortgages and we released $679 million of loan loss reserves

including a release of roughly $725 million in North America mortgages, partially offset by losses on asset sales.
Regarding the mortgage reserve release, roughly $425 million of reserves were utilized to offset net credit losses in the
third quarter, and the incremental $300 million reserve release was driven by continued improvement in delinquencies
and home prices year-to-date. Looking to the fourth quarter, assuming the U.S. economic environment remains
favorable, we expect to utilize loan loss reserves to offset virtually all of our mortgage net credit losses, but we do not
currently anticipate additional reserve releases beyond that level. We ended the period with $5.7 billion of loan loss
reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans and Citi Holdings or 40 months of NCL coverage.
Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings' results on slide 17, the pre-tax loss in Citi Holdings improved again
this quarter, even excluding the incremental $300 million reserve release in mortgages. However, while the adjusted
operating margin on the upper left panel on this slide increased significantly in the past two quarters to roughly $500
million, it will likely trend lower as each of the last two quarters included some level of positive marks or episodic
gains. We expect mortgage net credit losses to continue to improve with reserve releases trending in line with NCLs.
And legal costs will likely continue to be elevated and somewhat volatile in the near term.
On slide 18, we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends. We ended the quarter with $76 billion of North
America mortgages in Citi Holdings, down 20% from a year ago while net credit losses declined 50% and the loss rate
improved by over 130 basis points. These mortgages include approximately $12 billion of loans originated in our
legacy Citi Financial business, the vast majority of which are residential first mortgages.
While the NCL rates on Citi Financial loans have improved, the loss rates on these loans tend to be higher at just over
5% in the third quarter as compared to less than 1% for residential first mortgages originated by Citi Mortgage. We
sold roughly $500 million of mortgages this quarter, most of which were non-performing for a total of $6.4 billion of
mortgage sales year-to-date.
On slide 19 we show delinquency trends, including both residential first mortgages and home equity loans. 30-plus day
delinquencies continued to improve, down 9% sequentially to $5 billion. FICO and LTV trends also remained
favorable through the third quarter, and we provide these details in the appendix on slide 38.
On slide 20, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenues totaled $11.5 billion in
the third quarter. In constant dollars, net interest revenue was roughly flat to the prior quarter and down slightly versus
last year. Our net interest margin in the third quarter decreased by four basis points reflecting lower loan yields and an
increase in cash balances, partially offset by an improvement in funding costs. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect
NIM to remain roughly flat.
On slide 21 we show our key capital metrics through the third quarter. Under Basel III our estimated Tier 1 common
ratio increased to 10.4% driven by retained earnings and DTA utilization. Citigroup's estimated supplementary leverage
ratio was 5.1%, up from 4.9% last quarter. And the supplementary leverage ratio for Citi Bank remained above 6% for
the third quarter.
In summary, we clearly faced a challenging environment in the third quarter with a slowdown in client activity, a
continued low rate environment, and declining mortgage originations all posing significant headwinds. But against this
backdrop, we managed our business well with a continued focus on efficiency and growing our loan portfolio in a
disciplined manner. We are on track to meet the repositioning targets we announced at the end of last year. And
underlying credit performance remained favorable.
We also continued to make significant progress in winding down Citi Holdings, which is now just 6% of total Citigroup
assets. Year-to-date, the quarterly drag from Citi Holdings is down significantly from last year, even excluding the
incremental mortgage reserve release this quarter. And finally, we continued to grow our capital, benefiting from a
combination of earnings and further DTA utilization. We ended the quarter with an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common
ratio of 10.4% and an estimated supplementary leverage ratio of 5.1%, one of the strongest capital positions in our
industry.

Looking to the fourth quarter, in North America consumer, we expect continued headwinds in mortgages. Although,
some of this pressure should be offset by additional revenues from the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio. Net credit
loss trends in North America should remain favorable, although we expect net loan loss reserve releases to moderate,
given the need to build reserves for new loans originated in the Best Buy portfolio.
In international consumer, in total, we expect continued volume growth, albeit somewhat offset by ongoing spread
compression globally. Growth will likely be driven by Latin America, as we expect our repositioning efforts in Korea
to continue to present a drag on year-over-year revenue comparisons in Asia in the near term. And international
consumer credit costs should generally trend in line with loan growth.
Turning to our institutional businesses, our Securities and Banking results will likely continue to reflect the overall
market environment, with a goal of steadily gaining wallet share over time with our target clients. And in Transaction
Services, we expect continued volume and fee growth to help offset the ongoing pressure of the low rate environment.
So in total, we see a continued challenging operating environment in the near term, but we remain focused on those
aspects of our business that we can control.
Our results year-to-date reflect the strength of our franchise, and our progress towards our key priorities: gaining share
with our clients, generating consistent earnings and building our capital base.
And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering how you're feeling about some of the 2015
financial targets. If we look at the ROA target of 90 basis points to 110 basis points in 2015, we look at this quarter,
you had 69 basis points; year-to-date, around 80 basis points; what do you see as the key drivers to getting towards the
2015 goals?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, John, as we've talked about, reducing the losses in Citi Holdings is certainly one of
the key goals that we see in driving us towards the goal of generating ROA of between 90 basis points and 110 basis
points in 2015. And we'd also look for some modest amount of net income improvement coming out of Citicorp as
well.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: On the Citicorp side, John, I guess the efficiency goal is part of those 2015 targets,
around mid-50%s. I'll just call it 55% or so. You had 61% this quarter on the efficiency ratio, 57% year-to-date. So I
guess that implies some additional savings to be realized or revenue growth? Could you talk about getting to those
efficiency goals?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, as we've said when we – when Mike laid out those efficiency goals back in March,
the environment that we anticipated was low single-digit growth in revenues, and I think that's pretty much the
environment that we've seen and certainly might expect to see in the near term. So we do anticipate most of the
contribution towards those efficiency targets to come out of the expense line.
And I think as you've seen, we've been delivering on the repositioning savings that we talked about after that fourth
quarter reserve that we took last year, and we continue to try to find additional efficiency savings throughout the
businesses.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And just on that, could you remind us, you mentioned the incremental efficiency
saves this quarter, could you just remind us if you tally up what you are shooting for with last year's I think it was $900
million, this year, where are you on that cumulatively?

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, as we've said, at the end of the second quarter, I walked everybody through where we
were, and we said – our estimate was that you'd see $300 million of the savings in the run rate in the fourth quarter. The
$300 million therefore representing exactly what we had said we would get, which is a total annual save of $1.2 billion.
And we had about $200 million of additional run rate savings to generate from the end of the second quarter. And as I
mentioned, we generated about half of that, say, $100 million, in the third quarter. So we've got about $100 million
more to bake in to our fourth quarter results.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. So we should look for that to kind of come off the $10.8 billion adjusted
expense number, assuming a similar revenue environment?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I'd say that if you look at – if volumes and the environment stays the same, you'll see
the repositioning savings come through maybe partially offset by some incremental seasonal marketing expenses. So I
don't want you to just take the [ph] $10.843 billion (39:37) and take an even [ph] $100 million (39:39) off and get [ph]
$10.743 billion (39:41). The roundings could end up leaving us at rounding at $10.8 billion. But you should see the
expenses come down.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Again, John, assuming that the environment stays where it is.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: No. Understood. Understood. But I guess, John, thinking about next year as we go
from 2014 to 2015, it seems that you would – if revenues aren't going get better, you would need to do more than $10.7
billion, $10.8 billion, or beyond the repositioning saves you've announced for this year to get that efficiency ratio
towards the 2015 targets, are we – seems reasonable to expect more saves whether you announce them or not in 2014?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, as I said, we're going be committed to delivering the efficiency targets as we laid out
for 2015. And as you noted John, year-to-date, we've already got an efficiency ratio of 57% in Citicorp. So I think that
we've already made a fair bit of progress this year in going from where we ended up in 2012. So I think that we'll
continue to make progress towards the 2015 goal in 2014.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator
your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi. Thanks very much. A two-parter quickly on reserves. One, I just want to make sure, the
reserve build that you spoke about, especially on the international side, is a function of growth and not some concerns
on credit?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The two particular areas of "credit concerns", Glenn, that we had in the quarter were the
homebuilder loans that I mentioned, and the impact of the hurricanes, those two hurricanes that hit Mexico during the
month of September. So when you think about the $170 million reserve build that I mentioned for Latin America,
three-quarters, maybe a little bit more of that build were really associated with those two items...
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I got you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And the rest is portfolio growth.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Good. Good. That's just a clarification. And then you also said inside Holdings, I think
this quarter you had the $725 million, you broke down the portion related to losses and portion related to just overage
and led us to not more than just losses in the fourth quarter. Just curious, you follow that up with 40 months of
coverage, what's holding back a little bit more? Because the trends on credit seem great.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, the trends on credit are great. And like with anything else, we'd like to see where the
environment is going into the fourth quarter. There still is a bit of an unsettled environment out there, as you may

know, and you may see yourself. But in general, when you look at 40 months of coverage, and I'm not saying we're
always going stay at 40 months of coverage, but it won't be unusual or shouldn't be unusual for us to have a fairly high
months coverage ratio on NCLs.
When you think about the fact that TDR, troubled debt restructurings, represent just under 20% or so of our first
mortgage portfolio in Holdings. And as you think about it, Glenn, the LLR that you need to hold for a TDR is in all
intents and purposes, it's a discounted value of a life of loan reserve. So as such, I just think that you're going to – you
should expect that our LLR is going continue to represent a fairly significant months of NCL coverage for some time.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. I got you. Anything you could help us with on the mortgage revenue runoff will happen
quickly as we've seen and typically, there's an expense lag of a quarter or two quarters. Is there anything material you
can point to that over the next of couple quarters, as you adjust on that lag, that even in no change worlds, you'll get
some efficiencies just from running through the normal process?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: In that – Glenn, it's Mike – you're referring in this instance to the mortgage business in Corp
not the Holdings run-off?
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Correct, correct.
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Yeah. In there, so what we've spoke to is we've clearly – as the company clearly as an industry
seen the slowdown coming out of the change of stance in May from the Fed, and we started very quickly, in
anticipating that, to take actions in the second quarter. We've taken more actions in the third quarter. You've probably
read in the press some of those actions we've taken. Unfortunately, there's a lag to that because in the area of
fulfillment, we've got commitments that we need to process and get through the pipes. But we're focused on it and
clearly making sure that our mortgage business fits what we see as the future capacity, future necessity and demand of
that sector.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. I think that I get that loud and clear. Last one is just in FICC, I understand the
choppiness, and you referred to it a couple of times on the macro stuff that delayed the quarter or it impacted the
quarter. Just curious if it was particularly acute within emerging market FX or within credit, just so we can adjust for
ourselves because we're well below something like a 12-quarter average number.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, and Glenn when you think about the impact of – on the FICC revenues, it certainly
had the largest impact – the largest product that was impacted quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year was certainly our
rates and currencies business. And you wouldn't be wrong in thinking about the fact that there was a fair degree of that
impact that was concentrated in the emerging markets. And that's really due to the fact that in the third quarter, even
towards the end of June, we saw a high amount of volatility in certain emerging markets.
And in some cases, we saw spreads widening between 50 basis points and 250 basis points. So as a result, we pared
back our risk in many of those markets while still providing liquidity to our customers during this period of turmoil. So
I'd say that the combination of the high volatility and our intentionally running a lower risk in many of the markets
made for a more difficult trading – a more difficult environment for us to capture trading opportunities.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I'm with you. All right. I'm good. Thank you very much.

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Gerard, you're fading in and out. Could you just either get closer to the speaker, I want to
make sure I hear your question.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Sure. How's this?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's great, sir.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: On the $300 million of Mexican loans that you identified, what types of loans to build – are
they raw land loans or are they working capital loans? What type of loans are they?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: They're development loans. They're building loans as far as people are building. They have
the land and they're looking for construction type of loans.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. And in terms of your Transaction business, you've talked about the challenges that
you're having with the spreads and it's been like this for some time because of the low rate environment. Can you share
with us what kind of interest rate environment would be ideal for that business to start seeing wider spreads?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't want to be short rising rates, but particularly rising rates in the, I'd say in the current
to five-year area. So far, to the extent we've had any sort of rising rate environment, it's been more out towards the
10-year and higher. And we really need the shorter tenors to begin to rise to really benefit that business.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Would you benefit more for the rates here in the U.S., or in the EU, or is it 50-50? Which
rates may work better once they start rising?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, U.S. rates would definitely have a faster and certainly more impactful hit on us.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: You, like your peers, I presume, have made comments to the Federal Reserve about the
SLR that they've proposed. What's your folks' view on the possibility of them easing up or giving you guys some relief
in the way they're defining the assets that you're going use in the denominator for that equation, such as cash at central
banks? Do you think they might pull that out of the equation or are they really focused on just keeping it the way it is?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Now that's a little difficult to answer. The comment period only ended a brief time ago, and
so we'll have to see how the Fed and others take a look at the various comment letters that were submitted. And I'd say
that, as I normally do, we continue to have constructive dialogues with our regulators, and so we'll have to see how
they react.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Coming back to Citi Holdings and talking about the loan loss reserve releasing, if we were
to see housing prices appreciate in 2014 in the mid to high single digits, down from where we've seen low double
digits, would that give you more confidence to release more reserves?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I don't want to think – I don't want you to think that the amount of loan loss reserves
that we need to hold – that we think we need to hold is solely linked to home price movements. I mean it's that, it's also
a bit of the overall economy. So there's a lot. There's what's going on with delinquencies. And as I mentioned to one of
the prior callers, it also has to do with the amount of TDRs that we have in the portfolio where you're really then
dealing with, like I said, almost a discounted life of loan reserve. And that's not necessarily going to get influenced
tremendously by movements in HPI.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And then finally, John, if on Slide 31, you guys give us good detail on the consumer credit
delinquency trends, and obviously, they're going in the proper direction from the total portfolio. Are there any in those
sub-sectors, whether it's Mexico or Korea, that concern you the most or what we should kind of keep an eye on?
Because again, the total numbers are good but some of the sub-sectors are going the opposite direction.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I'd say that the ones that you would think about are the ones that we're focused as
well, which is I mentioned Mexico, not that we've got a tremendous worry in Mexico, but we called out a couple of
things with the homebuilders and we'll have to assess the impact of the recent storms. Mexico is also going through a
period where they're still absorbing the change in administration, and a lot of the reform work that is going on with the
new administration. And so we think that long term, that's beneficial, but it's certainly had a slowdown in growth in the

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: How are you? Just a quick question. You're down to 6% of assets out of Citi Holdings, but
the RWAs are still at 20%. Is that all a function of the mortgage side or some idiosyncratic or large RWA assets in like,
say, SAP that we could see some more progress on the RWAs on the Basel III side?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, it's a combination of both things. I mean there are, as you put it, some idiosyncratic,
but they're somewhat small as well. I mean the largest impact that we're going to have on driving down RWA over time
will still be resident with the mortgages. But there are a few things that are in SAP, such as we got a lot of the
hold-to-maturity securities, and that's going to certainly impact us.
And the other one that is sort of – it exists below the surface is op risk. Don't forget op risk also forms – when you get
into a Basel III environment, there's a decent chunk of your RWA that is constituted by op risk, and that is a much
longer term part of your capital base to try to get rid of. So it's largely mortgages. There's a couple of things in SAP that
could give us a pop, but op risk is also going to take some time to work our way out of.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Should we expect any pop from the sale of some of the hedge fund and private equity assets
that looks like will close in the fourth quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not really.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. And maybe another question on the SLR, it seems like there's been more effort to use
compression trades and it's unclear on the benefits of OTC clearing, but I would assume that would also be positive on
notional values. Have you got any sense on whether you think that's a big item, a small item? Obviously, you can't give
any numbers, but do you think that could have some positive impact on SLR going forward?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I clearly think it could have a positive impact on the SLR going forward. I think the
magnitude of the impact is something then that we'll have to see over time, just to see just how much of that we can
actually accomplish.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. And last question just on – I'll ask a question on CCAR. You guys obviously, with
one of the strongest Basel III ratios, the new stress test will partially use Basel III. How do you -- and your SLR's above
5% already. Do you guys feel a lot better, still cautious? How do we think about your approach to CCAR next year or
the end of this year?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Well, I think versus a year ago, Jim, I'd say we certainly feel better. And we feel better by a
few things. We laid out that we wanted to get the right result in terms of last year's submission. I think we got that and I
think importantly, it just wasn't the quantitative piece, it was the qualitative piece. And since then, I think we've shown
the ability to generate capital in a meaningful way when we kind of get the right things working; the combination of
Corp earnings, reducing the drag in Holdings, the utilization of DTA, and I think we've started to build a track record of
that.

But I think we've got more work to do. We continue to be in a challenging operating environment, and as John and I
have described, I don't think that's going change. At this point, we really don't know the scenarios and what they're
going be, so we'll take those onboard, we'll see how the fourth quarter shapes up, and then we'll start to make some
decisions in terms of what our submission might look like.

Your next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hi. First question is on one of the items that you signaled broadly that you can control which
is your expense structure. Obviously, Securities and Banking saw a pretty significant decline in revenue and we know
that expenses could be sticky, but it seemed as if they were very sticky when you assess the efficiency ratio there even
ex the DVA issues. And I was wondering is there some high level of litigation reserve build maybe that's encompassed
within the expenses there this quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, there's a minor amount of litigation expenses but I don't think it's anything that would
be driving the expense [indiscernible] (56:56) in Securities and Banking, otherwise, we would have called it out for
you.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: I think you might have mentioned in a press interview earlier today that you guys saw
private label securities as still an open issue, and I wasn't sure what you – exactly what you meant to say with that but
maybe you can give us a sense for whether we should be expecting more litigation reserve build as a result of that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think the question was more in terms of what issues remain open from a litigation point of
view relating to mortgages, and it was in context to – again, it was more on the dealing with Holdings and the litigation
expenses that we had in Holdings, and the fact that with the agreements now that we had reached with Fannie and
Freddie, we had pretty much put the repurchase risk with those two – with the GSEs behind us. And my comment was
that the only area – the largest remaining area of mortgage litigation that I think the industry still faced had to do with
private label securitizations.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And if you were building reserves for the private label litigations that did affect you
for underwriting and originations that you had done prior to 2009, would that reserve build be in Holdings?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, it would.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's helpful. And then the final question, since we're talking about Holdings,
expense levels is, as you called out, ex all that stuff, your expense levels in Holdings were down about 16%
year-over-year, which is obviously the trend that we all want to see. But I was wondering if you could give us a little
bit more guidance over the next one year to two years. How should we see the expense that's in place for managing all
those Citi Holdings assets come down as the assets do?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Yeah, I think – Guy, it's Mike – is that it's tough to predict what asset sales will look like.
Clearly, we've been in a transitioning rate environment, and John had talked about our ability to sell or our desire to sell
reperforming mortgages and, obviously, not only shed the asset but take the expense out. So I think in this
environment, it's tough to know and have a crystal ball looking forward in terms of what sales will look like. And
therefore, I think it's difficult to judge what expense reductions will look like.

But as we've been, we're going to continue to be focused on trying to manage those expenses down. And again, as we
look at asset sales, it's not just about the asset sale, the capital release, the risk reduction, it's also about the expense
reduction. We look at those things in aggregate, and we're going to continue to do that and take advantage of those
things that are out there, but really tough to predict.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And then maybe just a follow-up on that, maybe you can give us update on how you're
managing OneMain?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Sure. OneMain is a business that we put through a pretty sizable restructuring. Probably today
one of a few, if not only, of scale, branch-based sub prime consumer lending businesses. Not a business as we've said
that fits long-term with us, but again, I think things that have gone on from a regulatory and a credit dynamic, there's a
real part of society that needs to be served, we think OneMain is very well positioned to do that. And at the point in
time where somebody comes along and is willing to pay us a price that we think the business is worth, then we'll be
happy to consider that. But until that, we're going to continue to run the business and have it best positioned for that
day.

Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Just a follow-up on the difference between RWAs and assets in Holdings. You mentioned
that a big portion of the difference is operating risk. And I'm just – most of Holdings looks like a mortgage company
now. And I'm wondering to what extent is there still an operating mortgage company there? I thought of it mainly as
just basically holdings of loans and assets as opposed to an operating company.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, you do have to service those assets.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. But it's purely a servicing, it's not an origination and...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Correct. And you may think about the fact that certainly in the last couple of years, a lot of
the expense that has been incurred by people in the industry, including elevated NCL rates, including some of the
additional expense dollars that people have had to put in it, have been associated with what has been determined to be
operating deficiencies for these mortgages. So there is still a certain amount of op risk that we need to account for in
our Basel III risk-weighted asset determination.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. But should one expect over time that the RWAs will track down roughly in line with
the assets decline? Because...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: We didn't see that this quarter, though.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Let's see. On Holdings, the GAAP assets came down $9 billion, and the risk-weighted assets
in Holdings came down about $13 billion. So it's...
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: More or less in...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: More or less in line. I mean I wouldn't want you to – again, it has to do with mix and
everything else. I don't think you're going be able to just look always and say it's exactly in a ratio of x:x.

<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: To the extent I'm servicing a loan, I still have op risk.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And then another question, just on the Best Buy acquisition, should we expect that
to have roughly the same profitability of your other partner cards, or is it theoretically should be disproportionately
better impact in that supposed – I would assume there's some – that you'd get efficiencies on the expense side and
managing that in your existing business.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I would say that, over time, you should expect it to contribute to increased
profitability in retail services. But in the near term, it's likely to actually be a drag on profitability growth, only because
of the mechanics that are involved in calculating now the loan loss reserves that we need to put up on Best Buy.
Under purchase accounting, the acquired portfolios now, we bring them on our books at fair value – fair market value.
And so then as you – which means they come on without any loan loss reserve. Therefore, as you build each new loan,
as each new incremental loan comes on your books, you need to start putting up loan loss reserves for the estimated
inherent losses in those loans. And there's no benefit from old loans rolling off your books, so you don't see any
reduction in LLR because you've got old loans rolling off. So the first 12 months, maybe the first 15 months of the
acquisition, you're going to see an accelerated build of LLR just resulting from the mechanics before everything
smoothes itself out.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And the tax books work the same way?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, the tax books won't reflect – the tax books – the tax return won't reflect, but I think
what you're interested in is the DTA aspect.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Correct. Do acquisitions help the DTA?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: They do over the longer term.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: But they say I have to provide – I take tax benefit for the LLR just as I do with any other
business. So again, it's a – the first year or so, it'll be less beneficial than you might otherwise think.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And then finally, just to just ask Guy's question a different way, in Securities and
Banking, we saw revenues go from $6.4 billion to $5.1 billion, so down $1.3 billion but expenses only came down
$100 million. And should one just not look at it on a linked-quarter basis? Or – I mean it just didn't seem like they came
down in line with revenues.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I actually agree with your comment. I think that quarterly – quarter-on-quarter
expense variations in that business can be a bit misleading. I personally believe that to really get a true picture of how a
firm is managing its expense base, you need to look at its performance over a full year. And I think if you do the
analysis and if you look at the expenses in that business, just take out our fourth quarter 2012 repositioning reserve, and
you look at those expenses on a trailing 12-month basis for a run of quarters, what you're going to see is that expenses
both in the ICG and Securities and Banking have been steadily declining since the first quarter of last year. So on a
trailing 12 months basis, the efficiency ratios in both ICG and Securities and Banking have also been steadily
improving during that same timeframe.
And I think that if you take a look at that and you compare our efficiency ratios on a trailing 12-month basis over that
timeframe with our peer institutions, using the ICG ratios for the universal banking peers and the Security and Banking
ratios for our more pure-play investment banking peers, I think you're going find that we hold up pretty well. And
almost every quarter, our trailing 12-month expense efficiency is better than each of our peers.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I wanted to follow up on that last question and it's been asked several times. So if we were
to accept that your trailing 12-month expense efficiency looks good but still I think the issue is the quarter-on-quarter
decline, you said it could be misleading in the bigger picture of things, but at the same time what we've heard is macro
still has headwinds, markets are still unsettled, it's a challenging operating environment, and you only have $100
million of expense savings left. So I think the concern is, is this potentially an inflection point from what's been a
decent trailing 12-month record, but now we're going into an area that's maybe not going to get us positive operating
leverage?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Well, I think, Mike, I'll start and John can chime in. When we laid out our public targets in
spring, we laid out an efficiency ratio which we then went on and spoke to what portion of that's Consumer versus
what's ICG, and we spoke to mid to high 50%s for ICG. And so clearly, those businesses have taken that on. And
again, we've talked about tepid top-line growth in terms of low single digits, and the businesses have to onboard that,
and they have. And they've got to obviously – they've got to work to achieve that.
So I don't think there's a mystery or there's any surprise to what needs to be done. And again, I think those metrics were
designed without looking at overreaching revenue targets. And so again, I think they're in line and we'll continue to
adjust. And I think you've seen, away from the significant repositioning charge in the fourth quarter, you've seen us at a
run rate somewhere, plus or minus, $100 million, $125 million a quarter. Again, going at it in that BAU we described
and obviously some of that's coming out of ICG, and we'd expect them to continue to keep doing that in their business.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So how should I think about this? For the firm as a whole, revenues from the second quarter to
the third quarter were down $1.6 billion and expenses were down roughly $300 million. So that's a $1.3 billion gap
linked-quarter. You get the other $100 million of savings, it's still a $1.2 billion gap. So either revenues need to
improve or stabilize in certain areas or expenses have to go down a lot. Where is the extra leverage?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Mike, I still think you're focused on the quarter-to-quarter. And again, the targets that we set
out were targets for a full year. And I think that when you take a look at performance, you want to judge the
performance over a full year. Now granted if you want to take a look out a full year, that's okay. So judge us by how we
perform then over that full year when we get there.
But the targets specifically that we set out for Securities and Banking back in March is we said that in 2015, we would
be able to run Securities and Banking with an efficiency ratio of between 55% and 60%. And people at that point in
time thought that that was a pretty good target to aim for. Well, in fact, if you take a look at our Securities and Banking
business on a trailing 12-month basis, we're operating that business at a 57% efficiency ratio.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. Yeah, I guess the test will be a year from now as we look back. And are you as confident
as you were before that you'll have positive operating leverage looking ahead?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We're still committed to getting to the efficiency ratios that we laid out for 2015 as well as
the ROA targets that we laid out for 2015.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. If I can shift gears, on Citi Holdings, what were the losses on the asset sales of $4 billion?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't have that number in my head, Mike. I'm sorry.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: But it was a loss?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't even know. It could have been a slight net gain. I actually think it was a slight
positive this quarter. That's one of the reasons why I called out the fact that the $0.5 billion in the upper left quadrant of
that one chart is something that I think will likely come down, just because there were some episodic gains in that $0.5

billion.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So how should we think about pre-tax earnings in Holdings? I mean the last four quarters, it's
gone from negative $1.7 billion, negative $1.3 billion, negative $900 million, negative $500 million, so that's a nice
trend, but you said don't read too much into home price appreciation. So if we were trying to model that, what would
you point us to?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, our target is still to drive Holdings to breakeven – to close to breakeven by 2015. And
I think that we're still on a path to do that, but I don't want you to think that that path is going to be linear. There's likely
to be some ups and downs in that. But in general, the trend is moving towards breakeven by 2015.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Since you're getting so close to that target now, why wouldn't you revise that projection from
2015 to, say, late 2014 even?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I mean the target that we put out was in March, so we're seven months into achieving
a target that we said we would do over – you do the math – I guess it's somewhere around 33 months. So we still have
26 months to go till the end of 2015.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then as it relates to emerging markets, you said revenues in Korea should stabilize
early next year. With all the regulatory and other changes taking place there, what gives you that confidence?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's the way that we're looking at the business. And again, when I throw things out like that,
that's what we think should happen, and it's based upon how we see the runoff in existing portfolios that we think are
going to come down and based upon the environment that we see. If there's a significant change in the environment,
then, as we always do, we will update you on our new views.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Can you remind us how long you've been repositioning Korea? It's been, what, a couple years
now?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It certainly has been in excess of one year, yes.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And last question, going from what you can control to what you can't control, as it relates to the
government situation in the U.S., have you been selling treasuries to help protect yourself?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: As a matter of fact, I got that call earlier today – that question earlier today on the media
call, and yes, we no longer hold any U.S. treasuries that have a maturity date prior to November 1. And quite frankly,
have a very de minimis amount that have maturities prior to November 16.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. Most of my questions actually have been asked and answered. But on the
card business, as you're seeing now kind of stabilization in the branded card business and you've got the Best Buy
assets, there was a mention of actually reduced marketing. Could you talk a little bit about your plans both for the
branded card business and whether there are opportunities out there to grow or acquire in the private label business?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: You just went back and forth, Moshe. So I want to make sure that I answer the exact
question that you've put out. And I thought I heard you first ask about the branded cards business with marketing. And I
think what you'll see is that we are still in the process of repositioning the branded cards business. We did delay – we
didn't have much to talk about with branded cards quite frankly in the third quarter. You're likely to see some additional
advertising and marketing as we move into the fourth quarter. And hopefully, what I think you'll see over the course of

the fourth quarter and then into 2014 is some new product offerings and some revitalized product offerings that we
should have in branded cards.
Your question on retail services, that's much more of an ongoing operation with retail services. And the big change
there, of course, is the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio.
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: And I would say to that point, it's been asked before, we're absolutely open to more portfolio
purchases, but those portfolio purchases need to make sense from a yield, from a returns, from a resource deployment
perspective. People have often said, well, do you rationalize it from a DTA perspective? One thing we look at, but the
underlying fundamentals of the portfolio purchase have to make sense before we consider the DTA benefit. But if there
are things out there that make sense, we'll certainly take a look at them.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got you. Kind of on a slightly separate topic, questions about Citi Holdings have been
asked several different times, but you've got $1.2 billion of revenues and $1.4 billion in expenses. So your pre
provision is a couple hundred million negative. But embedded in that expense is $600 million of legal. Is there kind of
a run rate that you would expect, kind of irrespective of all of those volatile items, of legal? And then something on top
of that that we should expect or is that kind of not a way that you can look at it at this point?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, Moshe, exactly what you've just pointed out was the exact point that I was trying to
make by having you focus on the upper left quadrant of that slide that we had earlier, the four panel slide dealing with
Citi Holdings. And you're right. When you move out the litigation expenses, we have $0.5 billion of PPNR – adjusted
PPNR in that number. The issue there is, as I mentioned, there's some element of episodic gains that is built into that
number and asset marks, and so I don't want you to think that that represents a run rate.
As you can imagine, Holdings is a collection of some businesses, a lot of different portfolios, couple of different assets,
and so I don't want you to think in terms that now we've hit a run rate of $0.5 billion of adjusted PPNR in that business.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It will fluctuate.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Right. Although, I would assume that OneMain was alluded to before, that that's a big
driver of that and that's something that is – should be stable and, if not, actually growing, right?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Spot on.
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Yeah.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Okay. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning, John. A question for you just to follow up on your guidance in terms of
operating leverage trends specifically within Korea. You mentioned that you expect revenues to stabilize early in 2014
and that operating leverage would be positive in your forecast for the full year. Is...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, no, Matt, Matt, hold on. I just want to make sure – I think you're linking two different
comments that I made. The comment that I made on Korea as far as revenue stabilizing, that is particular to the Global
Consumer business in Korea. The comment that I think I made as far as positive operating leverage in the second half
of this year was on the Transaction Services business.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Then I guess just – what is your outlook for operating leverage trends within the Korea
Consumer business over the course of the next 6 months to 12 months? I mean it was – Asia more broadly had slightly

lower revenues year-over-year but your expense control was – more than offset that within Asia. I guess I'm just
curious as to how you're thinking about the revenue trends within Korea could affect the overall Asia operating
leverage trends.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, and it has a dampening effect on that trend. And that's one of the reasons why we
talked about the fact that Korea could be a drag on Asia performance over time and so it'll be a drag. But I didn't, nor
do I want to, comment specifically on operating leverage in Korea itself or in any other specific country.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Just moving onto your – to the slide on corporate loan details within Brazil, India and
China which was very interesting. I guess I'm just curious, given how low the loss rates are in those countries, and I
appreciate a lot of that is due to the loan mix. Are the loan mixes in some of your smaller exposures within EM markets
similar in terms of the CTS and TF composition, or are they more varied across the smaller exposures you have in EM?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, the loan composition in each country will be slightly different. You can see how the
loan composition inside China, India and Brazil are somewhat different. But the trend is still going to be much more
towards loans for either local market champions, in other words, those really high quality emerging market
headquartered companies, or to subsidiaries of companies that are headquartered in the developing markets, and then
with a fairly decent dose to where we have it of trade related. So the mix will vary but it's going to look something like
this, if you think about the way these three countries are portrayed.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then just one final question on the domestic mortgage portfolio. In the North
American home equity portfolio within Citi Holdings, the credit performance has obviously gotten a lot better. I guess
I'm curious as to how you think about a higher rate environment potentially affecting the home equity portfolio
specifically, and the ability of those homeowners to continue to make payments, or what the effect of a higher rate
environment on that portfolio might be in terms of credit performance.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, Matt, I think that you've hit on the single largest risk that does impact the home
equity book in Holdings, and it's something that we think a lot about and it drives a lot of our thought as far as what
level of reserves that we need to have. We've also given you some additional disclosure in our recent Qs as far as what
percentage of that portfolio begins to hit resets in 2015, 2016 and 2017. I don't have all those numbers in my head, but
if you go to our most recent Q, and we'll do it again on this upcoming Q, we'll actually – we'll lay that out for you as far
as the reset risk that we have in that portfolio.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good morning. I just had one follow-up question. Hi. On the four-panel slide that you
referred to, I mean the message is clear that adjusted PPNR may be lower than we've seen over the past few quarters
but still positive. And when you said you're utilizing reserves to absorb future charge-offs, that implies to me a zero
provision. I guess, is it fair to conclude that when you get to breakeven to Holdings has to do with your legal and
related costs at this point?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I would say that, again, there'll be some variability as you just laid out in that – the
upper quadrant. I'm not going to say that it could never go negative. I don't want you to think that that's always going to
be positive. There's a chance it could go slightly negative, depending upon how low the asset volumes get in the
business, et cetera. But you're absolutely right. The single largest driver of when we are able to get to Holdings to be
consistently breakeven really has to do with the legal and related costs.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Hello.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, good morning or afternoon.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Wanted to kind of go back to the CCAR question and just focus on dividends. As you're
going through the reinstitution of your dividend, how do you think about that when you kind of look at the volatility of
earnings that have been anywhere from a quarterly run rate of close to $1 this quarter or at the top end was close to a
$1.30. Given the Fed gives you about a 30% kind of leeway, how do you think about that when you go to establish this
dividend level going into next year?
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: I think, Marty, when you look at it, I think the corporate finance math clearly points you
towards a preference of buyback versus dividend as your stock trades below book. And so I think that'll be the first
bias. But at that point, we also understand that we, to some degree, need to be mindful and, over time, continue to
address the dividend issue. So we'll look at those tradeoffs as we approach. But again, I think as has been very clearly
signaled by the Fed, the bar around dividend is higher than buyback just based on the nature of what a dividend is, and
so we'll have to take that into account.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then just briefly touching on the expense versus revenue, the way you're looking at
that trailing 12 months, is that just because the composition is more kind of maybe fixed with salary and bonus versus
variable expenses, so that over time you kind of work your way through the ups and downs of revenue and can create
traction and efficiencies but you're not going be able to move as quickly to the quarterly fluctuations?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. I'd say – I still think that the best way to measure your efficiency is over time.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Yes.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And therefore, as you look at something over a trail 12-month basis you would have
captured a full year performance. And I really think that's the best way to judge how a firm is evidencing expense
discipline.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And I wasn't disagreeing with that as much as I was trying to just get at is that just a
difference in the way of the composition is set up now and structured? And looking at it over that time really is a better
way to do that because of the way the composition is structured now?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I think it's a matter of how compensation is structured between deferrers of incentive
comp. Much more is deferred now and recognized over three or four years and so I got a lot of the compensation
expense that you have in a year actually relates to performance in other years as well as the operating performance
maintenance that you have in the current year. Plus, there's different methodologies that firms employee and how they
accrue compensation expense and when they accrue compensation expense. But when you get to year end, you have to
have the expenses accrued for that year's performance in that year. So that's why I continue to think that at any given
point in time, you really want to measure people on a trailing 12-month basis.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And lastly, on Page 38 you're showing the loan-to-value for mortgages and Citi Holdings,
and you've seen a market improvement in those that have loan-to-values over 100% to the point now that your reserves
cover basically 100% of those balances when you start looking at those that have greater than 100% and FICOs less
than 660. So when you're talking about home prices and the difference it makes, it does make a difference on this
particular page in that you've seen migration in the more stable and better performing buckets. That would still be a
positive you could see rolling forward, I would think.

Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: I think that was me, Derek De Vries of UBS. Good afternoon. You just sort of opened the
can of worms on deferred comp. And I'm wondering if you can help me understand it a little bit? As we get to the end
of the compensation year within Securities and Banking, can you just give us the amount, broadly in hundreds of
millions or billions or whatever, the amount that would be awarded but not yet expensed? So that will help us
understand the ability to flex down the cost base. So I was wondering if you can give us the awarded but not yet
expensed at the end of the compensation year.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm not prepared to do that at this point in time.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay. Then maybe just a slightly more generic question then. I'm trying to sort of reconcile
the comments you made in the beginning, the sort of challenging and uneven operating environment against more of an
upbeat backdrop on loan growth, particularly in emerging markets. And just as we go forward, should we think about
the kind of growth rates that you've been able to deliver recently? Or do you see some things that make you think that
could slow down a little?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I would take a look at the overall environment. And I do think that it does remain
challenging. We have been able to grow loans in a challenging environment, although that loan growth has been a little
bit less this year than it had been in years before. And even though you can continue to grow loans, then the – you have
the other issue as far as spread compression. So you can continue to grow loans, but if you're growing loans at lower
spreads that's not exactly going be beneficial towards your revenue. So I think that you need to sort through how you
think about both. I think that we've evidenced that we can certainly grow the volumes, but I think what you also see is
that we have been impacted by a certain amount of spread compression as have most other people in the industry.
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: And Marty, as I think about it...
<A>: It's not Marty.
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: Sorry, Derek. As I think about it, I think there's two things in some ways in competition. As
you look at growth estimates as we look forward for 2013, we've seen off of downward revisions in 2013 actually some
uplifts in 2014. But I think at the same point when you go back and you look historically, and you can look at several
points of history, 1994, 1995 certainly easily being one of those. Any time in particular out of the U.S., you're
transitioning into a higher rate environment, the EM economies don't come through that cleanly.
I think in many ways today, those economies are much better positioned to come through the shift towards higher rates
and whether that's a rise in foreign exchange reserves, whether that's floating exchange rate mechanisms, external
liquidity, and you can go on and on through those. But again, I just think a transition in U.S. interest rate is certainly
going have an impact on trading volumes, capital flows, new issuance calendars. And so I think we've got to try and
strike a balance between those things.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much.
<A - Mike L. Corbat>: You're welcome.

Next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Hi, Mike. Hi, John. I won't beat up on the Securities and Banking efficiency ratio question, even
though that's up 10 percentage points linked quarter. Let's turn to the other two businesses that are almost two-thirds of
your revenues, GTS and Global Consumer Bank. Following a little bit of your trail of thought, John, looking at it
year-to-date, GTS efficiency ratio is up from, I believe from your numbers, up from 52% to 54%. And Global
Consumer Bank is up a little also from 53% to 54%. So even though you're more than halfway through your cost
restructuring, your efficiency ratios are going the other direction. Can you talk to that a little bit and especially given
your confidence about GTS for the second half?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, and I think what you're going to see in Transaction Services, and I said it before, I
think you'll start to see improvement beginning in the fourth quarter and that improvement should begin to then roll
forward through next year's results as well. And I have no doubt that Transaction Services will meet the efficiency
targets that we set out for them for 2015.
Consumer has been bumping around at, as you mentioned, 53%, 54% probably as I look at it on a trailing 12-month
basis for the last five quarters maybe. But there's still work to go there. They have not fully completed the rollout of
Rainbow yet. And obviously we're still in the process of readjusting the mortgage business, so they've got that running
through the top line and we haven't quite gotten the expenses out in mortgages yet. And the commitment was that we
would get consumer to 47% to 50% by 2015. And so I still think that we're on track to do that.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Even though you have – but so far you've gone the other direction. So you'll perhaps have
a lot in 2014.
Okay. Let me move, a couple of little ones. Private label, I just want to come back to that. Did you add anything for
that in the third quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It was a very small amount, because don't forget, we only had the Best Buy...
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: No, sorry. Private label MBS reserves. I – my apologies.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Oh, I'm sorry, private label. I thought you said – I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: I have a question on Best Buy. I'll come to that in a second, but let's start private label MBS
again.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I was reading down your list, Vivek. Just looking over your shoulder on that camera that's
over there, but don't worry about that. When it comes to private label securitizations, I'm not going to comment about
any specific reserving in the quarter.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. And then turning to Best Buy, did you take on any delinquencies with that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Again, when it comes to the Best Buy, we did take on delinquencies, and so the
delinquencies do end up in our statistics. It's just that from a reserving point of view, we don't pick up loan loss
reserves.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. And those are not marked down; the loan portfolios.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The loan portfolios come on our books on a fair market value basis.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Yep. Okay. Okay; great. Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem, Vivek.

<Q - Adam Hurwich>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I'm referring to slides 21, 26 and slides 41. You've
managed to keep your risk-weighted assets pretty flat, actually declining on a Basel III basis. And at the same time, you
seem to be growing your regulatory capital at a 15 – currently – at a $15 billion rate and rising. I'm just wondering --
how do we think about capital adequacy going forward? And given your capital build rate, at some point we have to
think a little bit more holistically about what you do with that. Could you just give us at least a basis to understand that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, yeah, you've got a lot of questions wrapped up in there. Let me try to parse through a
little bit of that and you come back in where I've failed. From a capital build rate, certainly the capital is building as a
result of the earnings as well as the DTA. And so this quarter, the earnings themselves were a little over $3 billion, the
DTA was a benefit of $500 million and then we also had a benefit of OCI, which of course from a Basel III basis ends
up in that as well. So over the course of the quarter we actually built about $4.5 billion worth of regulatory capital from
those three components. What we've said is that we want to – our expectation is that over time we would target running
at a 10% Basel III ratio. Now we need to think about how we may change that as the supplemental leverage ratio rules
begin to finalize, but that's where we are right now. So what have I failed to answer?
<Q - Adam Hurwich>: There's – you didn't fail to answer anything, John. The only reason I'm asking this is because
there seems to be a lot of focus on GAAP numbers, but there's a large discrepancy between GAAP and regulatory
capital measures, and there seems to be a benefit that you will accrue due to that differential. Am I missing anything, or
in fact when regulators are comfortable with the bank, will we be able to see a benefit from the discrepancy?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Adam, I think you're right. As a matter of fact, one of the things that we talk about is the
fact that as we think about the strategies for our Citicorp businesses, we think that those Citicorp businesses operate in
a very Basel III friendly way. We're focused on real high level credit-worthy customers in both the consumer business,
as well as in the corporate business and we think that we can run the business, as I say, in a very efficient manner under
Basel III. You might take a look at – and maybe you referenced it one of the slides that we have in the appendix that
shows the returns that we get on a Basel III basis. So that's where we're headed with the strategy.
As far as how the regulators view us and what might be the future, again, we think that we're in fairly constructive
dialogues with the regulators.
<Q - Adam Hurwich>: Thank you very much.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem, Adam.

Your next question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Afternoon, guys.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Couple ticky-tack questions, just a follow on that last question in terms of capital. Can
you help us understand; is there a material difference in terms of Tier 1 common Basel III under the standardized
approach versus the advanced?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: There's a very large difference between the way those two calculations work, and under the
terms of Dodd-Frank, what large banks in the U.S. are supposed to be doing is – are directed to do – I shouldn't say
supposed -- are directed to do is report the lower of the two ratios. So currently, we are reporting our ratios under the
advanced approach.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Which is the lower of the two?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, by definition. I couldn't report it if it wasn't.

<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Okay. Thank you. And then separately, you had mentioned in terms of unfunded
commitments there was a reserve build partly due to growth in commitments as well as some risk migration
downward? Can you help clarify exactly what was going on there in terms of the risk migration and maybe...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, we...
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: ...how we should think about that going forward?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: In our commitments book when we took a look at some of the commitments we had to our
clients, especially clients that are in countries where the country itself ends up being risk weighted lower, we therefore
rerate the company and therefore ended up building a bit more reserves.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Should we expect continued build in unfunded commitment reserves or was this a
one-time adjustment?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I wouldn't call it a one-time adjustment, but it's another one of those episodic adjustments. I
don't anticipate that level of migration repeating in the fourth quarter, but I can't tell you that it absolutely won't either.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Thanks. And then lastly, just bigger picture in terms of the margin on a consolidated
basis. You had mentioned – expected maybe flat-ish in the fourth quarter. But then beyond that, is it fair to assume that
there will kind of still be this gradual grind down in terms of the margin on a consolidated basis given the global spread
compression that you've referenced?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think as long as we stay in a low interest rate environment you're going to have as you put
it that grind down approach. I would think at some point in time we would begin to see some level of interest rate
increase and then you could get a bit of a benefit. Until then, it's going be really a matter of how the calculus works out
between your ability to grow loans and how they – and lower your cost of funding. How those two factors offset the
impact of the continued spread compression.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: And lastly, just to wrap it maybe back to the first question. On this long call of getting to
your longer term ROA goal, what would be your view of a normalized interest margin over the cycle to get into that
90%, 110% ROA basis?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We didn't really talk about that at that point in time and I don't really have a longer-term
NIM goal that I care to share at this point in time.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hey. Thanks. Just one quick question on TSO, you indicated that the operating leverage
you're expecting second half to be positive. Could you just give us a sense as to – is that versus first half? Is that
year-on-year, and the major drivers there?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It would be year-on-year, Betsy. In other words, it would be the second half of 2013
compared to the second half of 2012.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, and the drivers?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The drivers would be revenue growth being larger than expense growth. No, I'm only
kidding you, sorry. I apologize.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yeah, no. I mean I get what operating leverage is. I'm just saying, it's really you're banking
on it being more revenue related than expense related?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, actually I think you're going to see some good expense performance coming out of the
fourth quarter.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then in retail banking ex the mortgage on the revenue margins there, got the
message that it was competitive environment and you need to be competitive to get the volume growth. Is there – that's
been a trend over the past couple quarters, so we should continue to expect that going forward? Just asking for some
color from the field as to how you're thinking about...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: On mortgage revenues?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: No. No, excluding mortgage revenues. So retail banking mortgages are down excluding
mortgage related...
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I think you're still going see pressure in retail banking just due to again that low interest rate
environment, and the impact there for that low interest rate on the deposit taking business that we have in the retail
bank.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yep. Okay. Thanks.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay?
