President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research and Development,
Norbert Bischofberger; our new Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations, Paul Carter; and our Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington.
Before we begin our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements,
including plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates, financial projections, all of which involve
certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ
materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and
recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements
made during this call.
We will be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The
GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release, as well as on our website.
I will now turn the call over to John Martin.

Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter of 2014 was an important step towards
realizing a number of milestones for the business, particularly in hepatitis C. Earlier today, we reported product sales of
$4.9 billion, an increase of 104% year-over-year. This increase was driven by the launch of Sovaldi. Sovaldi's profile
has the potential to transform the treatment of hepatitis C and the rapid uptake speaks to a significant unmet medical
need. I couldn't be more proud of the teams at Gilead who rapidly brought this product to market, supported by a robust
data package of data from many clinical studies. Paul Carter will discuss the launch in more detail.
Moving to other advances in hepatitis C, FDA granted a PDUFA date of October 10 for the single-tablet regimen of a
once-daily combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in adults
and also advised us that an advisory committee would probably not be necessary.
In addition, the European Marketing Authorization Application for ledipasvir/sofosbuvir has been validated and has
been granted Accelerated Assessment by the European Medicines Agency, a designation for new therapies and
medicines of major public interest. If approved, this STR could be available for marketing in the EU by the end of
2014.
On April 2, in a press release, top line data were disclosed from a Phase III study of sofosbuvir ribavirin dose for 12
weeks in genotype 2 hepatitis C infected patients in Japan. In this study, 98% of treatment-naïve and 95% of
treatment-experienced patients achieved SVR12. The study will support regulatory submission in Japan by mid-year.
Earlier this month, at the 49th annual [indiscernible] (03:51) of the European Association for the Study of the Liver,
EASL, was held in London. At this meeting, new data on Gilead's products and liver disease programs were presented
in 15 oral talks and over 40 posters, including results from three Phase III studies, ION-1, ION-2, and ION-3 on the
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir fixed-dose combination. Concurrently, the results of these three studies were also published
online in the New England Journal of Medicine. Other presentations at EASL show that both sofosbuvir PEG/RBV and
sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with and without ribavirin are viable regimens for the retreatment of patients who had failed
previous regimens, including sofosbuvir-containing regimens. In the studies, retreatment would result in SVRs of 74%
to 100%.
In addition, results from a Phase II study evaluating GS-5816, the next generation pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor were
presented. Treatment of patients with genotype 1 through 6 with GS-5816 and sofosbuvir for 72 weeks resulted in
SVR12 rates of 86% to 100%. Initiation of Phase III studies of a fixed-dose combination of GS-5816 and sofosbuvir
are expected later this year.

Earlier this month, WHO published guidelines on screening, care and treatment of persons with HCV infection. This
quick action by the World Health Organization signals recognition of the recent advancements in the treatment of
hepatitis C.
Now turning to HIV. The two Phase III studies comparing the single-tablet regimen of ECF TAF and Stribild in
treatment-naïve patients are fully enrolled and we expect data to become available in the fourth quarter of 2014. In
addition, this STR is being evaluated in a number of studies, other studies, including in treatment-experienced patients,
patients on stable therapy who are switched to ECF TAF, patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and also in
adolescent patients. We currently anticipate filing for U.S. and European approval on ECF TAF in the first quarter of
2015 for naïve, experienced and switched indications.
In oncology, we continue to prepare for the potential approval and launch of idelalisib. The relapsed CLL application
was assigned a Priority Review with a PDUFA date of August 6 and the relapsed/refractory iNHL application was
assigned a Standard Review with a PDUFA date of September 11.
As I mentioned earlier, I am proud of what the team has accomplished with the launch of Sovaldi and I also want to
acknowledge the contributions on the other important activities by the more than 6,000 employees at Gilead.
I will now turn the call over to Paul Carter.
Paul R. Carter
Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter of 2014, our worldwide total net product revenue
increased to $4.9 billion, representing growth of 104% over the first quarter of last year. U.S. sales exceeded $3.6
billion. And for the very first time, European sales exceeded $1 billion in a single quarter. This performance has been
driven mainly by healthy demand in our core HIV business and the launch of Sovaldi, which itself had sales totaling
$2.3 billion in the quarter. Of that number, $2.1 billion represents U.S. sales and most of the remaining revenue came
from Germany and France. We had Sovaldi sales in 13 countries worldwide and that number will continue to increase
as regulatory approvals and reimbursements are achieved.
Beginning with the United States and HIV, underlying demand was healthy for all products. Nine out of 10 patients
new to treatment were prescribed a Gilead medicine with Gilead single-tablet regimens being used by 7 out of 10
patients new to treatment. Stribild continued to be the leading HIV regimen for patients who are beginning therapy,
capturing 3 out of 10 starts. Prescription growth of Gilead single-tablet regimens including Stribild, Complera and
Atripla is just under 20% year-over-year. ADAP purchasing in the first quarter was strong, consistent with expectations
for the last quarter of an ADAP fiscal year.
During our first – sorry, our fourth quarter call, we highlighted that approximately $130 million to $150 million of our
fourth quarter revenues were related to inventory build across the supply chain to year end. In the first quarter, as
expected, we saw a draw-down of this inventory. At the big three wholesalers, inventory levels declined to near the
bottom of established ranges. In addition, we also saw a draw-down by sub-wholesalers. This is, in fact, a similar
dynamic to that which we've seen in first quarter of the past several years. This collective inventory draw-down
resulted in a sequential decline in HIV net product revenue. The underlying demand for Gilead HIV product is,
however, strong and growing, especially for our newer single-tablet regimens Stribild and Complera.
Moving to U.S. hepatitis C performance. Sovaldi sales of $2.1 billion show strong patient demand and the increased
inventory levels necessary to support this demand across the supply chain. Since launch, approximately 30,000 patients
have begun treatment for hepatitis C with Sovaldi, and these have come from all the main peer groups.
The first patients who began 12 weeks of treatment around the time of approval last December have yet to reach the
time point when they can achieve an SVR12, which occurs a further 12 weeks after completing treatment.
Nevertheless, we continue to hear positive reports from physicians about their experience with Sovaldi. The prescribing
of Sovaldi in the U.S. is being driven mainly by hepatologists and gastroenterologists, but internal medicine specialists
and primary care physicians, many of whom also treat HIV patients, have also prescribed.

Despite this broad spectrum, we estimate that only half the physicians visited by our therapeutic specialists have
prescribed Sovaldi today. This leaves us optimistic about the opportunity that lies ahead. In fact, with an estimated 1.7
million diagnosed patients in the U.S. and around 400,000 undertreated care, we have to date reached just a small
fraction of those who can benefit from treatment in the future.
The genotype distribution of patients that have received treatment is representative of the U.S. HCV population, with
around 70% usage in genotype 1, and the majority of this usage has been with the so-called NEUTRINO regimen or a
12-week regimen in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. On the payor front, access to Sovaldi has
been as we expected, with its formulary status consistent with our experience in HIV reimbursement. Most commercial
Part D and State Medicare – Medicaid plans take a full six months to review new drugs.
Turning to Europe, we are very pleased with our strong HIV performance, which like the U.S., is underpinned by our
belief in the benefit to patients of single-tablet regimens. Eviplera is the most prescribed regimen for treatment-naïve
HIV patients and also continues to extend its lead over Atripla as the regimen most commonly switched to in the big
five European Union markets. By the end of the first quarter, we had launched Stribild in 19 countries across Europe.
This includes, recently in France, which represents the biggest single HIV market in the E.U. It is also just this month
been launched in Italy, so is now available for patients in all of the European Union big five markets.
I would like to highlight that in early-launch countries like Germany, the performance of Stribild has been
approximately double that of Eviplera at the same time point. Regional reimbursement in Spain and Italy is expected to
continue to roll out during the rest of the year.
Moving to hepatitis C, the European sales for Sovaldi totaled $164 million in the quarter. While Sovaldi has regulatory
approval in the European Union, full pricing and reimbursement is a country-by-country process, with some countries
completing that process more quickly than others. Today, we have reimbursement in Germany, Austria, Sweden,
Finland, and to some extent, France. As mentioned in the prior earnings call, we have filed health economic dossiers
with all the major reimbursement agencies, and we are following the normal process that leads to price and
reimbursement approvals.
In France, after completing or completion of the temporary authorizations to use or ATU program, the
prior-to-completion of full reimbursement status, we continue to provide Sovaldi to patients who are pre and post-liver
transplants and also patients with advanced liver disease who've failed other HCV treatments or are interferon
intolerant. This is in line with the ATU scope and will widen when full reimbursement is agreed.
In the U.K., the National Health Service in England has recently issued a statement confirming that they have approved
the funding for Sovaldi for approximately 500 patients. Notably, this is funding pre-NICE approval and recognizes the
urgent need for Sovaldi for sicker patients.
The European Association for the Study of the Liver or EASL, just last week published their Clinical Practice
Guidelines on the management of HCV infections. Sovaldi is recommended in combination with other agents across all
genotypes, as well as in several difficult to treat groups. These EASL guidelines come soon after newly-issued
guidelines in Germany and France, which also both recommend Sovaldi.
Outside of North America and Europe, we continue to expand our geographic footprint. I would like to highlight that
we are making good progress building out our Gilead organization in Japan in the anticipation of sofosbuvir approval
during 2015.
In closing, I'd like to provide an update on our commercial readiness for oncology. As John mentioned, we have filed
for regulatory approval in both the U.S. and the E.U. for idelalisib for use in high NHL and CLL. We have completed
hiring the U.S. therapeutic specialist team, and they are fully trained and in market. So we are ready and excited to
launch idelalisib. A similar process is being followed in Europe, consistent with anticipated regulatory and
reimbursement timelines.
I'd now like to hand the call over to Robin.

Robin L. Washington
Thanks, Paul and good morning, everyone. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for our first quarter 2014 were $1.48.
Total revenues for the first quarter were $5 billion, up 97% year over year. As Paul mentioned, similar to prior years,
strong wholesale and sub-wholesaler purchases in anticipation of January 1 price increases for HIV and
cardiopulmonary products resulted in inventory draw-downs in the first quarter of 2014.
Non-GAAP product gross margins were 87.4%, up from 74.5%, largely driven by Sovaldi sales and the favorable HIV
product mix. Sovaldi's impact to gross margin is a combination of Sovaldi revenues as a percent of total net product
revenues and the geographic mix of these revenues, which were 92% U.S. sales in the first quarter. Product gross
margin for our HIV franchise was favorably impacted, primarily by lower Atripla revenues.
Turning to expenses year over year, non-GAAP R&D expenses were up $98 million, reflecting the progression of
clinical study activity, primarily in oncology and HIV. Non-GAAP SG&A spending was up $167 million, to support
the ongoing launches of Sovaldi in the U.S. and internationally, as well as the anticipated launch of idelalisib.
Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we raised $4 billion in debt financing for general
corporate purposes, including repayment of debt, working capital and share repurchases. We also repaid $840 million
in debt from previous finances and purchased $450 million in shares.
Finally, we are reiterating full-year 2014 guidance, which excludes Sovaldi product sales and is outlined on slide 45.
The metrics we provided in February for the impact of Sovaldi product sales still applies to our full-year results and
include the following estimates: non-GAAP product gross margin will increase by approximately 0.75% to 1% for
every $1 billion of Sovaldi sales; and non-GAAP effective tax rate will decrease approximately 0.75% to 1% for every
$1 billion of Sovaldi sales. In closing, we look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the coming
months.
We would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Meacham with JPMorgan.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and a big congrats on the quarter and on Sovaldi.
<A - John C. Martin>: Thanks, Geoff.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: So there's been a lot of peer noise, obviously a lot lately, so I just wanted to get you guys
perspective on how you think you could change kind of the conversation from cost benefit to sort of the value of a cure
and this would be – for public and private payors, are there any sort of formal economic studies that you guys are doing
coming out? Or just help us a little bit with how to deal with a lot of the headlines that we've been seeing almost every
day from commercial payors and government.
<A - John F. Milligan>: Hi, Geoff, it's John Milligan. Thanks for the questions. So yeah, there's a number of things
that I think it's important that we talk about. First and foremost, the value of a cure, I tend to think it's underestimated in
terms of the overall advantage that the healthcare system receives from it. And I do know that as we have talked to
doctors – and certainly the tone coming out of EASL has been one of a greater understanding of the value that this
provides to patients and healthcare systems – is that in fact, HCV patients cost a lot of money.
The all-cause mortality. The overall healthcare costs for an HCV patient is very high, and we're seeing more and more
papers now being written on this as there is the possibility of curing a larger number of patients. And so we do think
that's an important part of the dynamic of talking about this and also talking about the priorities the healthcare system
will likely make as they do choose to treat certain patients now and defer certain patients to later. And these will be

difficult conversations but important ones for doctors at the payor community and public health officials to undertake
as they understand the benefit that they get and try to outline the timeframe from which they wish to tackle this very
difficult problem of trying to eradicate HCV from as much of the population as we can.
And so we will be talking quite heavily about these things. There are publications out there, not by Gilead but by
respected people in the field who understand this very well and who can start these conversations in kind of a more
academic, collegial way.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Great. That's helpful. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. Let me echo Geoff, congratulations on the best launch of any
drug of all time. That I'm aware of, at least. I was just wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about, there has been
this conversation out there about perhaps restricting over time, the access for the drug, the patients that are perhaps the
most at need. People have talked about certain levels of fibrosis. I'd love to get your perspective on that, if you think
that that is medically – what your view on that is, if you think that's medically appropriate.
And then on the commercial side, the same question, by the way, do you have any statistics on the market that might
help us understand what percentage of patients are F3 and F4? So that we can sort of run those scenarios through our
models. And thanks again.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yeah, hi, Mark. I'm going to try and answer the first question. So with regards to
the price and volume and the overall cost, there are four points to make. The first one is that the regimen costs of
Sovaldi PEG/RBV 12 weeks is not dissimilar from standard of care, either simeprevir or telapivir PEG/RBV with the
respective period of time. Number two, Sovaldi provides shorter treatment durations, higher cure rates and is better
tolerated, so there's the value. But the value goes beyond just treating hepatitis C. There is value, as John Milligan
mentioned – there is more disease in HCV that is non-hepatic, so if you look at the extrahepatic mortality, non-HCV
related, it's much higher than the HCV-treated – in the HVC-infected population than the control group.
Thirdly, curing somebody for hepatitis C has benefits that go beyond the liver. It's recognized now that hepatitis C is a
chronic inflammatory condition that over time leads to more diabetes, more heart disease, more CNS disease, even and
you could certainly reasonably argue that curing somebody of their hepatitis C infection has collateral benefits that go
beyond the liver.
And we've actually shown that in our own Phase III studies. It's a result that's somewhat under-appreciated. We have
looked at PRO, patient reported outcomes, and we have shown in a blinded fashion that the people in the studies that
achieve an SVR, they had much better outcomes than those that didn't. And the better outcomes were they felt better,
they had less bodily pain and had a better mental health status.
And we're working, as John Milligan said, in putting all of this together into a bigger pharmacoeconomic argument. But
to make it, to summarize, a short answer to your question, I do not believe it's justified medically to prioritize and
restrict the cure of hepatitis C. It may be necessary economically and that's what Paul is going to address.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yes. Hi, Mark. So Paul here. Actually, this launch is absolutely unprecedented as we've already
sort of agreed, I think. The data coming in and the kind of patients that are being treated is not absolutely clear yet. I
mean, we've got a sense of the genotypes, but we don't have a good sense of the severity of the fibrosis scores. We
have, in a qualitative sort of qualified – qualitative anecdotal comments coming in, but I don't think I'm in a position
really to say the proportion of F3 and F4s. I would guess it's about maybe 30% or 40%, but that's just a personal guess.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: [indiscernible] (25:09) very much and similar congratulations, really remarkable. So I
suppose I better change the direction just a little bit, Robin. Given the cash flow that you reported in the quarter and the
new debt you've taken on, you are in the position to be pretty aggressive about either share buybacks or anything else
that you would like to do. And yet the share buyback in the quarter was relatively modest. Could you give us some
sense of your thinking about how that might play out? What you would like to be doing with their cash? How you view
the stock here for the balance of the year? Because I think there's certainly something that people are starting to ask.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Yes. Absolutely, Geoff. Thanks for the question. Our plan has always been to accelerate
our repurchases post the launch of Sovaldi. So you could definitely expect to see larger share repurchases during the
remainder of 2014. I think clearly, given our increased cash flows and recent debt raise, we have the liquidity to be able
to do that. And as you mentioned, just given our current stock price, it's something that we would be able to take further
advantage of and reduce the number of shares outstanding.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Robin, do you have a sort of goal in terms of percentage of cash flow or amount of
cash that you'd like to deploy?
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Not at this point, Geoff. We haven't recalibrated to that. We haven't provided guidance.
Again, as I said, definitely it will be north or higher, but we haven't necessarily rethought our capital strategy where I
can give you a percentage of free cash flows at this point in time.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Okay. Thanks very much. I look forward to hearing that later.

Your next question comes from Matthew Roden with UBS Securities.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Thanks very much for taking the question, and congrats on a wow number. So I also want to
change directions. Norbert, it may be a pipeline question for you. When I look at across your pipeline programs here on
your slides, it's really striking how many indications may be addressable with Simtuzumab. So I was just wondering if
you can review why you think that that's a drug, what the cadence of readouts will be across the indications? And then
lastly, if there are any of these Phase II readouts could possibly form the basis of an early filing in any of the
indications? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yeah, Matt. Thanks for the question. So, Simtuzumab was always – the pre-clinical
data strongly supported both fibrosis and solid tumors. And LOXL2, as you know, is involved and necessary in both
and expressed to high levels in both. So we decided to enter solid tumors. We chose pancreatic and colorectal cancer,
and we chose to go into fibrosis and we chose IPF and liver. And I have to say, all of these studies were done so that
when – if we see a spectacular effect that we could potentially file with the Phase II data.
For instance, the liver study, as I stressed many times, it's powered on HPVG, hepatic venous pressure gradient, that's
an approvable endpoint according to FDA and NASH, under accelerated global guidelines. And the IPF study is
similarly powered that it could get – that we could file with the Phase II data, if the data is good. So we feel very
comfortable with the program. I know it looks like a lot when you look at the slide, but it's certainly a risk worth taking.
You know, this Simtuzumab, if it works, could be a really big drug, a successful drug for us.

<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I did want to circle back onto the payors just
for bit. Could you give us some more of a sense of how the negotiations are going? So how many of your target
accounts are currently under contract? And how does the progress compare to kind of where you thought you would be
at this point in time in the launch?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Phil, hi. It's Paul here. Yes, well, we can't tell you too much, is the honest truth because we're in
negotiation. But everything is pretty much in line with our expectation and our experience with HIV and other drugs.
So we're in negotiations, we're making good progress. And that's really all I can say at this point.

Your next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hi. Thanks. Congratulations as well. My question is, as it relates to sustainability. First part of
the question is in Europe, I think some of the feedback was that based on the way the budgets are obviously run that
one way to control it under a line item annualized budget is to limit it to more the sicker patients. I guess the first
question is do you expect that to happen and should that be our expectation for our revenue models? But the second
part of that is that also creates a longer tail. Do you expect that that could at some point happen in the United States,
and does that create a longer tail? How should we think about sustainability and as it relates to what you're going to see
in Europe?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Michael, this is Paul here. I think you've got it in one there. It's either going to be big and
short-term or it's going to be longer-term and less each year. And I think the European markets, market by market, have
their own economic circumstances. A lot of the Southern European countries, as you're fully aware, have really tight
squeezes on their healthcare budgets and they will have to probably prioritize patients at this point or significantly
increase the amount of money going into hepatitis C.
So I think we're very confident in our clinical position and the science and our pipeline. So to us, we're very, very
comfortable about it. But I think you're right, it's going to be spread out in Europe, particularly some of the southern
European countries over a longer time period.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Michael, I would like to add something here also in this pharmacoeconomic debate,
and that is that there was a paper published in 2012 in Hepatology that looked at the cost of caring for a hepatitis C
infected person, and what is apparent from that paper that the cost of not treating is fairly substantial. And actually that
paper claims it ranged from $7,000 for a non-cirrhotic early disease patient to $42,000 per year for somebody with
end-stage liver disease. Those are the annual costs of just doctor visits, tests and other care. So that clearly has to be
entered into this debate also, although I'm not sure how much of that is applicable to Europe. The cost might be
different there. This was a large U.S. study.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Thanks for taking my question and my congrats as well on the great launch. Coming out
of the full data presentations and publications for ION-1, ION-2, and ION-3, what's your sense as to how physicians
might be thinking about optimizing duration of therapy for [ph] the all-oral (32:39) across different patient groups? For
instance, how much eight-week usage might you expect amongst treatment of genotype 1s? How much longer than
12-week usage amongst the treatment-experienced cirrhotics? And I'm curious how this as well as some of the current
reimbursement buzz we're hearing about factors into your pricing decisions for the fixed dose combo? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yes. So, Brian, let me answer the first question, then Paul can talk about the pricing
issues. So we have proposed in our regulatory filing that eight weeks treatment duration should be for everybody who
is treatment-naïve and non-cirrhotic. People who are treatment-experienced and/or cirrhotic will get 12 weeks of

treatment. And this is really based on the thought process – it follows the thought process, we asked ourselves, if we
gave everybody 12 weeks, how many of the patients would be overtreated, would get more than they need? And there
were way too many. It was north of 90%, depending on which population you looked at.
And if you were in London, you may remember [indiscernible] (33:44), who did one of our ION presentations, he
actually mentioned this at the podium. And given the fact that you can't justify, not medically but certainly, not
economically overtreating patients that for one-third of their duration, they need only 8 weeks but they get 12, that I
think is a reasonable proposal. And of course, it has to be agreed upon with regulatory authorities, but that was our
proposal in the filings that we made.
<A - John F. Milligan>: And I guess I'll take the second part of it. It's John Milligan again. So just thinking about –
your question was, what do we take into account when we were putting in together the price of Sovaldi? And Sovaldi
was, I think, priced appropriately based on the benefit that it provides today. But we were aware that a significant
percentage of patients, particularly those with low risk factors and new to therapy could benefit from eight weeks of
therapy in the future with the combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.
So we did think about this very heavily as we weighed in to our debate on what the final price of Sovaldi would be.
And of course, it will weigh into our thinking on the next generation of pricing as well, as we mature to no ribavirin, no
interferon, simple regimens for shorter duration still. And so we will provide additional benefit through those
medications. And we have taken all this into account, as we think through pricing strategies.

Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citigroup.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and also congrats. Two questions; one, give us a little
bit of a sense if you look at the IMS data, which we know underreports, I mean you've sort of beat the top end of that
handedly, so was there any stocking? And then two, give us a little bit of a sense, what's going on in the VA and in the
prison systems? Sort of how much usage are you seeing in those verticals? And if you don't mind, what's your strategy
how to deal with pricing in those verticals, especially as it gets more competitive? Thank you.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: This is Paul here. I think there's three questions there. Shall I – Robin, do you want to talk about
stock first?
<A - Robin L. Washington>: I'll take the inventory, and then I'll turn it over to Paul. So we're only 17 weeks into
launch at this point. And our IMA agreements are not totally into effect. As we've previously communicated it takes us
about nine months or so to fully get through that process. So while we know that inventory was built this quarter, it is
difficult for us to fully quantify it at this point of time in the launch. But I would say, as we continue to get more clarity
around demand, et cetera, going forward, we'd be better able to provide that in the future. But I would say there is
inventory but unfortunately we're not able to quantify it at this point.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Okay. And maybe I'll add a couple of comments then on the VA. So Sovaldi was added to the
VA National Formulary during the first week of April. And as you know, the VA is potentially the largest federal
purchaser of healthcare for hepatitis C in the U.S. We haven't seen a huge amount of orders from them yet, but this is
really because it's very, very early days for them. In the prison system, the Federal Bureau of Prisons is updating its
HCV treatment guidelines and we understand those are going to be released imminently and we do anticipate that
Sovaldi will be included in those guidelines.

<Q - Ying Huang>: Thank you very much for taking my questions as well. Firstly, can you give us a little bit idea in
terms of payor mix you saw in first quarter? How many patients or percentage of patients taking Sovaldi are insured by
commercial insurance and then how many coming for Medicare, how many coming from Medicaid? And then also,
would you mind giving us also the so-called gross net adjustment for the first quarter of sales of Sovaldi?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yeah, Ying, it's Paul here. So I'll take the first question and then hand over to Robin. So again,
it's very early days and our data, to some extent, is reflecting that. We think about 90% of our business so far in the first
quarter has come from both the private and the Medicare sector. And I think that, that probably splits roughly half and
half. Medicaid is about 7% and the rest, the small balance left over. Robin?
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Yeah, Ying, so relative to gross to net again, similar to Paul's response, still very early in
the launch. And as he previously described, we're still in the midst of the contracting process. So I would say our gross
to net percentage now is not necessarily predictive of what it would be going forward, but it is lower. It's lower than
HIV and kind of lower than we project the full year to be.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Yeah, the mix will change over time. Yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So on this whole concept of prioritizing patients
by fibrosis, how would that be implemented? Would it be implemented by the doctor potentially? Or could it be forced
by the payor? And in conjunction with that, how do payors and doctors view 8 weeks versus 12 weeks? And is 8 weeks
an advantage if you're in that situation where you have prioritization by fibrosis score? Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: It's Paul and I'll take the first bit and then maybe hand over the Norbert. So there is a healthy –
I'm not sure it's healthy, actually tension between payors and clinicians, I think at this point. And it's clear that some
payors are trying to restrict or prioritize patients with, say higher fibrosis scores or sicker patients. And I think
clinicians are sometimes taking a different view of that. And it's very hard for us to see how that's worked out from
here, but we do hope that the clinicians and the clients prevails over time. We're pretty confident that will be the case,
as payors start to get used to and to predict better the volumes of patients that require treatment. And perhaps I can
hand over to Norbert...
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: The other question is an interesting one and maybe I could summarize it by
something that a well-respected thought leader told me. He said he would prefer 12 weeks of treatment over 8, simply
because it is something that's really safe, well-tolerated, why not go for the safe path and give them 12 weeks? It's not
that much more. But then he went on to say that he is ultimately not the one that will make that decision, but that
decision will probably be made for him by the payors. And how that exactly works operationally, I'm unsure, but that's
probably where we're heading.

very different league from a sales perspective, a market cap perspective and actually, a future pipeline needs
perspective in the long term. Concomitant to that, you've got one of the lowest R&D budgets, yet the highest operating

<A - John F. Milligan>: Ravi, it's John Milligan. So it's a very good question. Our R&D as a percentage of sales went
down fairly dramatically this quarter, as you know, which means you can't grow that up to a level that might be more
appropriate for a company with the sales levels we're seeing in a very short period of time. It takes a long time to hire
the people and to put thoughtful programs into place.
So with regard to R&D, our philosophy is simple, it would be to continue to grow but to grow at a reasonable,
sustainable pace as we add more programs and as things mature from research into development. We're seeing quite a
number of those happening this year in a way that I think is quite exciting for us.
In terms of BD, it's somewhat of a similar issue. We're looking to licensing programs, but we can only grow so fast
based on the number of people we have, the complexity of the business and also just the capability of bringing in and
bringing programs in and then doing a very good job on them. So I think we've got a very full pipeline right now. I
think it's going to be a thoughtful way forward as we grow the company. And I think we have most of what we need to
continue to grow this company for years to come. So it will be very, what I call very targeted kinds of transactions that
could help further us along.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: And if I may add something, John, we were going to continue to be disciplined
about all of this. Just because we have more money available doesn't mean we're going to spend it. The science has to
be right and the medical need has to be right. That's when we're going to do it and not under any other scenario.

Your next question comes from Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: [Inaudible] (43:19) on the fast launch. I had a question regarding, again on the pricing front
on the hep C. Just wanted to revisit maybe some prior comments that you have made in terms of how we should think
about pricing for the combination, specifically that most of the value felt was being derived from Sovaldi and that's the
way we should think about it from a pricing perspective, that most of the contribution from price would be from
Sovaldi and there would be some incremental value or costs associated with the second drug. So I wanted to get your
thoughts on that, whether that still holds.
And a related question is the conversations that we have with payors are not really focused on Sovaldi on its own.
They're focused on the combination. And the price point they all seem to have in their mind, whether we think about
the U.S. payors or European, is the off-label usage of Olysio and Sovaldi and the $150,000-odd price point. So if you
could just sort of comment on those things, it would be really appreciated.
<A - John F. Milligan>: Ian, it's John Milligan. It's always difficult to talk about pricing. And let's not forget, we don't
have approval for those products. But you know, as you think about it, there are natural limits on what I think is
appropriate for next-generation products. And for example, with GS-5885, we're essentially replacing pegylated
interferon ribavirin, which over a 12-week duration is much less expensive, for example, than Sovaldi. So it's clear
Sovaldi is the driver, the value in that combination. And then I tend to think about it in that sort of way. And so I think
you're right, people are concerned about the combinations of things like Olysio and Sovaldi, and that's really not how
we're thinking about next-generation products.

percentage are on a 24-week Sovaldi-ribavirin regimen as opposed to the 12-week combinations? I mean, what would
we expect for the trend in that duration over the next couple of months?
<A - Paul R. Carter>: It's Paul here. I mean, the data we have is only for the U.S. We think about 70% of patients are
genotype 1. And of those 70%, we think about 65% to 70% are on the so-called NEUTRINO regimen, 12 weeks,
sofosbuvir plus PEG/RBV. That's the 12-week piece, the 24-week piece we're not at all sure on.
<A - John F. Milligan>: Yeah, it's a combination of patients who are on genotype 2 taking 12 weeks and genotype 3
who are taking 24 weeks. But any way you do the math, with a shorter duration and a high percentage of patients now
taking non-interferon-based regimens, it's not surprising that the interferon sales are declining.

genotype 3.

Your next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.
<Q - Jim W. Birchenough>: Hi, guys. Let me add my congratulations. Just a question as we think about potential
competitors coming in later in the year and into next year, is there anything you can do with payors right now to try and
preempt what could be price competition and aggressive discounting, just to preserve some level of pricing in this
market?
<A - John F. Milligan>: Well, Jim, it's not generally prudent to talk about strategies in public so that others know what
you're doing. So I'm going to decline making any comments on that. Although, I do note that it looks to us, based on
today's filing of the AbbVie regimen with the five-drug regimen that they're putting out there, that we should have a
considerable lead to market from where they are, since they're over two months behind us in terms of their filing. So
that could be an advantage for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much and congrats. Just can you talk about, with HCV, there's some chatter out of
EASL that your data set in cirrhotic patients is not as thick as AbbVie's. Do you have a plan to do a cirrhotic study?
And then also, what's the next regimen you'll take to Phase III in HCV?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: All right, Howard, I'm not sure that I understood all your question. You were
asking about the comparability of AbbVie's cirrhotic population results with ours?
<Q - Howard Liang>: And whether – is that a – you've got a big enough – do you need another study dedicated to
cirrhotic patients?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: No. I think we've answered the question. AbbVie chose to do a separate cirrhotic
study. We've included our cirrhotic patients in ION-1 and ION-2. And by the way, the results were in that population,
AbbVie had 88% and in our sub-population of treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients, it was 86%. So a similar
number, the only thing to remember is AbbVie didn't have experienced patient, [indiscernible] (49:02) experienced
patients in their study, we did. So comparing those two studies is a difficult thing to do. You will have to do a
head-to-head study.
If you ask about what's next on our table, it would be 5816, so what we have now filed, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for
genotype 1, and we're repeating this now with a pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor in GS-5816, which would be the one

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted ask a little bit back on
the payors side. We've heard some commentary out of some of the payers that have already reported about patient
volumes. And UNH was one of them and they had suggested that they thought patient volumes were actually peaking
for them in the first quarter. So I guess I was wondering, A, if you agree with that, and then B, sort of as related to that,
what kind of information do you need where you feel like you'll be in a position to give us Sovaldi guidance? Thanks.
<A - John F. Milligan>: Yes. So, Matthew, it's John Milligan. In terms of the patient numbers, you see the prescription
rates as much as we do. We don't necessarily know where those patients come from, so I can't speak to the
UnitedHealth population, whether that is an accurate portrayal or not. I assume they know more than we do about those
patients in their system. But as Paul had talked about, we have less than 50% of physicians who can prescribe Sovaldi
who have prescribed Sovaldi. And so we also look at the fraction of patients who've been treated relative to the total
patients and it's relatively small.
In a typical year, about 60,000 patients are treated. There were about 30,000 last quarter and so that put us certainly at a
faster pace than the last few years. But certainly far below some of the peak years and well over 100,000 and 140,000
patients were treated. So I, for one, believe there are many, many patients out there who will continue to seek some
Sovaldi therapy or who might be looking forward to the combination therapy as we get later into the year. So I think
there's plenty of opportunity out there for us.

like that to happen and how the mechanics of that might work? Any insights that you have to share would be very
helpful. Thanks.
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Thomas, it's Paul here. I think this is a wonderful idea and if it could work, it will be great
because we could have one price and access at the same time across Europe. But as we've often said, you can't change
1,000 years of history, and if Europe ever managed to get its act together on this, I would be absolutely amazed. So

number of patients that are out there, do you have any sense that there's a warehousing going on ahead of all oral
approval? I mean it just seems with six months to go before interferon's totally out of the equation that there will be
little bit of a, there wouldn't be much rationale for starting non-symptomatic naïve patients. So do you anticipate a dip

in new prescriptions in the coming months in anticipation of that? And do you have any kind of guidance on what sort
of acceleration we might anticipate post the launch of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir?
<A - John F. Milligan>: Yes, it's John. It's very hard to determine if there's warehousing, except by talking to
physicians. And we've talked to some of the top KOLs and it's clear that they are thinking they would like to hold back
some of their less sick patients to put them on all oral therapies later on in the year. But as I mentioned, there's a whole
host of the middle-tier physicians, people who don't attend EASL, who are just now becoming Sovaldi prescribers, who
seem to be having a very good experience. And we don't get any sense that they're all that aware of the next generation
coming out or that they wish to slow down their own practices in order to wait for business later on in the year. So I
kind of doubt that those physicians would have significant amounts of warehousing, when in fact, they'd likely
accelerate their use of Sovaldi as they get into the second part of this year.

Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. Just two quick ones from me. John, I was just wondering on the
prescriber mix, you mentioned you had reached out to about 50% of the targeted audience that prescribed. Can you tell
us what historically they represent in terms of volumes for those 50%? And then the second question was just any early
feedback on the DTC campaign and what metrics are you guys using there to evaluate the effectiveness of that
program? Thanks.
<A - John F. Milligan>: Yeah, these are getting to the middle-tier, the middle deciles, excuse me, of the doctors
represent that mix. We'll exclude the lower tiers because we tend not to hit those decile one and two doctors very
frequently. But it's the real middle mix of these doctors who are geographically difficult to get to in some cases and
sometimes can be difficult to see. So – but that is a really good piece of business for us as well.
And the second question was the...
<A - Paul R. Carter>: Was the DTC campaigns.
<A - John F. Milligan>: DTC campaigns. We really don't have any idea if the unbranded campaign of awareness has
had an impact other than a few anecdotes of patients calling their physicians. I think given the, I think stronger than
expected early demand, those campaigns, of course, are being rolled back very substantially and you'll see less and less
of that in the coming weeks and months.
