James L. Robo
Thanks, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn the call over to Moray to discuss our first quarter results,
I'd like to take a moment to update you on an important topic. As you all know, for some months now, we've been
assessing the possibility of forming a so-called yieldco. After extensive analysis and careful thought, we've made the
judgment that it is in the best interest of our shareholders for us to take the next step in this process. And on April 4, we
filed confidentially with the SEC a draft S-1 registration statement, which would allow us to move forward with the
yieldco structure following the SEC review process and subject to market conditions.
Unfortunately, having given you this information, we're now very restricted from offering you the additional
information that I know you'll all be looking for. As you may know, there is a concern that conveying information
about the yieldco at this time might be construed by the SEC as a prohibited offer of securities under the SEC rules,
which in turn could lead to delays in our ability to move forward with the transaction.
Accordingly, we've concluded that it will be best to wait until after the S-1 is public before providing more detail. Thus,
we'll not be able to discuss with you today such matters as the exact projects or megawatts involved over time, or the
financial performance of the assets that we expect to make available for purchase by the yieldco or many other things
that I know you will have questions about.
Further, while it is our present intention to move forward with this transaction, there can be no guarantee that we will
be able to execute it successfully on terms that we believe will create long-term value for our shareholders, which
remains our objective. We will continue to work diligently to ensure that we remain focused on this fundamental goal.
While there is much that we cannot discuss at this stage, there are a few points that I can make.
First, we had previously said that we would want to be sure that the introduction of a yieldco structure would not be
negative to credit since our credit position is an important underpinning of our competitive strategy. The fact that we
are moving forward obviously implies that we've developed comfort that this objective is achievable. While the
principal control on this will be the integration of the yieldco into our overall financing plan in such a way that our
credit metrics are maintained or strengthened, we will also be sensitive to the impact on our portfolio mix going
forward. We expect to continue to place emphasis on developing new, high-quality contracted projects at Energy
Resources. Our view of the credit impacts of our proposed transaction is based not only on our own assessment, but
also on our discussions with the rating agencies.
Second, we've also previously stated that one area of focus for us would be to ensure as close an alignment of interests
as possible between our existing shareholders and investors in the yieldco vehicle. We believe we've developed a
suitable structure to support the same, and I look forward to sharing details with you at a later date.
Third, many of you have previously heard me say that an area of concern for us would be the costs and other
implications of ongoing reporting and compliance obligations for two publicly-traded entities. We now feel
comfortable that we will be able to manage these effectively. And while there will undoubtedly be extra costs, we do
not believe they will detract meaningfully from our ability to create value for NextEra Energy shareholders through the
transaction.
Finally, let me reiterate that while our decisions are based on extensive analysis and careful consideration, in the end,
we're making judgments about future value creation and there can be no guarantee we are correct.
With these comments aside, I'm also pleased to be able to tell you that we had an excellent first quarter overall,
notwithstanding some challenges associated with the harsh winter in the northeast. And we're off to a good start for the
year.

I'll now turn the call over to Moray to fill you in on the details.
Moray P. Dewhurst
Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. As Jim said, we had an excellent first quarter overall. Our financial and
operating performance was very strong and we continued to make good progress on our capital projects and other
strategic initiatives, consistent with the strategies we discussed at our investor conference over a year ago. We continue
to believe we are well-positioned to deliver against the financial expectations we shared with you out through the 2016
timeframe.
At Florida Power & Light, we continue to drive value for our customers through low bills, high reliability and excellent
customer service, and for our shareholders through strong earnings growth. For the fifth year in a row, our typical
residential customer bills are the lowest in the state and are currently about 25% below the national average. Our major
capital projects remain on track and I'm pleased to note that the second of our three generation-modernization projects
at Riviera Beach entered service just after the end of the first quarter about two months earlier than originally
anticipated and slightly below the cost estimate submitted to the PSE in 2008.
Construction has begun on the Port Everglades modernization, which we expect to come online in mid-2016. During
the quarter, we invested another $1 billion dollars of capital in FPL, consistent with our strategy of steadily improving
the long-term value we offer our customers.
At Energy Resources, our development and construction programs remain on track and our backlog of contracted
renewables projects continues to develop with a PPA for roughly 250 megawatts of U.S. wind signed since the last call.
Increased contributions from our contracted renewables portfolio continued to drive earnings growth. The extreme
market conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, particularly here in January, caused parts of our customer supply
business to underperform, but this impact turned out to be less than we had expected and was offset by other favorable
impacts, many of which were driven by the same factors that caused the underperformance in customer supply. Overall,
we were pleased with the quarter.
Now, let's look at the results for FPL before moving on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For
the first quarter of 2014, FPL reported net income of $347 million, or $0.79 per share, up $0.11 per share
year-over-year. We continue to focus on deploying capital productively in ways that have long-term benefits to
customers.
As I mentioned, FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion in the quarter and we expect our full-year
capital investments to be roughly $3.3 billion. Regulatory capital employed grew 6.7% over the same quarter last year,
which combined with an increase in profitability, resulted in very strong net income growth.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes is estimated to be 11.22% for the 12-months ended March 2014. This
includes the impact of the Project Momentum transition costs incurred late last year. You will recall that Project
Momentum is our enterprise-wide productivity initiative that we started last year. Absent these costs, regulatory ROE
would have been 11.5%. As a reminder, the impact of the 2013 transition costs will roll off our reported regulatory
ROE as we move through the year since the regulatory ROE is measured on a 12 months trailing basis.
Based on the progress we've made thus far in our cost position, the continued improvement in the Florida economy, our
current capital investment program and the amount of reserve amortization we've taken to-date, we are now
comfortable targeting a regulatory ROE at 11.5% for the full-year 2014.
As we noted last quarter, under the current rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries
to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each 12 month trailing period, in this case, the 11.5% that I just
mentioned, excluding special charges, such as the Project Momentum transition costs.

We utilized $125 million of reserve amortization during the quarter in order to achieve this predetermined ROE. As we
mentioned before, we always expect to use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year than the second half,
given the pattern of our underlying revenues and expenses. In fact, over the remainder of the year, assuming normal
weather and operating conditions, we would expect to reverse the reserve amortization taken in the first quarter and end
the year with the balance roughly equal to where we started or possibly even a little better.
Looking beyond 2014, we believe that our reserve balance, when combined with our weather-normalized sales growth
forecast of 1.5% to 2% per year, and our current O&M expectations, as well as the commitment of a four-year total of
roughly $7 billion in infrastructure CapEx, will allow us to support regulatory ROEs in the upper half of the allowed
band of 9.5% to 11.5% for the remaining period of the current rate agreement.
Furthermore, we expect that we can do this while keeping typical residential customer bills the lowest in the state and
among the lowest in the country and improving on our already excellent reliability and customer service records. If we
are successful in meeting our expectations, by 2016, we will have further improved our already outstanding customer
value proposition and we'll be well-positioned for 2017 and beyond.
The Florida economy continues to strengthen, and since 2010, most of the indicators we track continue to improve,
particularly in the areas of job growth, business expansion and businesses that have relocated into the state. This is due
in part to our focused effort of the state on economic development and an overall improvement in the business climate,
including reductions in taxes benefiting businesses and individual taxpayers alike. The state's relative economic
position compared with the U.S. overall has improved significantly since 2010.
Florida's seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in March was 6.3%, down 1.4 percentage points from a year ago. The
number of jobs in Florida was up 225,100, an increase of 3% compared to a year earlier. And March was the 44th
consecutive month with a positive job growth in Florida, following more than three years of job losses.
Nationally, the number of jobs was up 1.7% over the year. Florida's annual job growth rate has exceeded the nation's
rate since April 2012. Florida's private sector continues to drive the state's job growth, and more than 550,000 private
sector jobs have been added since December 2010.
The housing market in Florida also continues to show signs of resiliency as the accompanying chart shows new
building permits have dropped from their recent peak, although they remain at a healthy level, and mortgage
delinquency rates continue to decline. The Case-Shiller Index for South Florida shows home prices up 16% from the
prior year. Other positive economic data across the state include continued improvement in retail taxable sales, as well
as bankruptcy declining on an annual basis. Overall, Florida's economy continues to progress well.
FPL's customer metrics showed solid improvement this quarter. Underlying usage per customer increased 0.4%
compared to the same quarter last year, which is consistent with our long-term expectation of approximately 0.5% per
year, net of the impact of efficiency and conservation programs, at least through of the period of the rate agreement.
However, as we've often pointed out, usage growth tends to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter.
Another encouraging development during the quarter was a decrease in the percentage of low usage customers. The
12-month average of the low usage percentage has fallen to 8.1%, its lowest level since May 2007. The number of
inactive accounts has also continued to decline, reaching its lowest level since April 2004.
During the first quarter, we also saw the largest average increase of customers since late 2007 with approximately
87,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter of 2013, representing an increase of 1.9%. However, roughly
0.9% of the increase can be attributed to the rollout of our remote connect and disconnect capability, enabled by our
smart meter program that we highlighted last year.
As a reminder, these new customers, which are disproportionately low usage and residential, had a lower impact on our
sales. We estimate that customer growth accounted for about 1.1% of the increase in sales during the quarter. Good
usage and customer growth combined with a favorable year-over-year weather effect of 2.9% to yield overall retail
sales growth of 4.4%.

Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2014 GAAP earnings of $86 million, or $0.20 per
share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $211 million, or $0.48 per share. During the quarter, we reversed our
prior decision to sell our fossil assets in Maine. As a reminder, the Maine fossil assets are a combined 796 megawatts
of oil-fired power plants operating within the NEPOOL market.
In last year's first quarter call, we announced plans to adjust our portfolio by selling these assets, and we conducted a
competitive bid process during the fall and winter. However, the bids we received were not consistent with our view of
the fundamental value of the assets, and recent developments in regional market conditions have reinforced this
assessment. While these assets are not called upon to run frequently, they do play an important role in supporting the
reliability of the electric system and this has real economic value. Accordingly, we have decided to retain these assets
as an integral part of our New England portfolio. As a result of our decision to retain these assets, we have recognized
an after-tax gain of $12 million during the quarter based on the current estimated fair value of the fossil assets, and we
have reclassified from discontinued operations to income from continuing operations the after-tax loss recorded during
the first quarter of last year.
The gain in 2014 and the loss in 2013 are both excluded from adjusted earnings. The financial impact from operations
of these assets for both periods is included in both GAAP and adjusted results.
Energy Resources' adjusted EPS contribution increased $0.06 from the prior-year comparable quarter. New wind and
solar investments added $0.06 per share, reflecting continued strong contributions from growth in our contracted
renewables portfolio. Across the balance of the portfolio, the aggregate of other impacts was flat. However, because
there were individually significant ups and downs and some of the elements were interrelated, let me provide a few
more details.
As discussed earlier in the call, our results suffered from the adverse effect of extreme winter volatility on our full
requirements business in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. This negative effect on the full requirements portfolio was
much larger than the positive impacts on other parts of the customer supply and trading portfolio, and the overall
contribution from all these businesses was down $0.11 per share.
Despite this challenge, and in some cases as a result of the same extreme market conditions, there were opportunities in
other parts of the portfolio. Contributions from existing assets increased $0.14 per share, including $0.05 from existing
wind assets net of PTC roll-off as a result of favorable generation. The same weather system that drove the challenging
market conditions in the Northeast also resulted in above-average wind resource for many of our wind sites. The same
market conditions also meant that the contribution from our main fossil assets increased $0.03. Finally, there were a
number of smaller favorable impacts across other parts of the portfolio that collectively added up to $0.06.
Increased corporate G&A and other costs contributed negative $0.04 of the year-over-year change, including share
dilution of negative $0.02. All other effects were minor, as reflected on the accompanying slides.
For the full-year, we expect to elect CITCs on roughly 265 megawatts for our Mountain View solar project and the
portions of Genesis and Desert Sunlight solar project that are expected to enter service in 2014. This equates to roughly
$60 million in adjusted earnings, down from roughly $70 million in 2013 on 280 megawatts of solar projects.
The Energy Resources team continues to execute on our backlog and pursue additional contracted renewable
development opportunities.
In Canada, we continue to expect the 466 megawatts in our backlog to enter service by the end of 2015 with the
majority expected to come into service in 2014. Our contracted U.S. solar backlog remains on track, and during the
quarter, we brought roughly 165 megawatts of solar into service with the commissioning of Mountain View, the
balance of Genesis and partial commissioning of Desert Sunlight.
We continued to expect to bring the remaining roughly 650 megawatts of our backlog into service by the end of 2016.
In addition to our existing contracted backlog, we continue to pursue additional solar opportunities, including possibly
one large 200 megawatt to 250 megawatt project and the development pipeline of smaller 10 megawatt to 40 megawatt
projects.

Turning to our U.S. wind program, we commissioned roughly 75 megawatts during the first quarter. Additionally, the
team recently signed a PPA for a roughly 250-megawatt project, which is expected to come into service in 2015,
bringing our total contracted U.S. wind development program for 2013 through 2015 to approximately 1,675
megawatts. Based on everything we see at the moment, we continue to believe our total 2013 to 2015 U.S. wind
program could be 2,000 to 2,500 megawatts.
Turning now to the consolidated results for the first quarter of 2014, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $430
million, or $0.98 per share. NextEra Energy's 2014 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $557 million
and $1.26, respectively.
Adjusted earnings from the Corporate and Other segment were down $0.03 per share compared to the first quarter of
2013, primarily due to consolidating tax adjustments. As we noted last quarter, financial results and project updates for
the pipeline projects will be reported as part of our Corporate and Other business segment. Both pipeline projects, Sabal
Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection, continue to progress well through their respective development
processes, and we expect to submit necessary filings with FERC later this year.
We expect to receive FERC approval sometime in 2015, and we expect the projects to be in service by mid-2017.
Spectra Energy Partners, majority owner of Sabal Trail Transmission, continues to lead the effort to market additional
available capacity on the upstream pipeline to potential shippers and detailed siting and environmental activities are
underway on both pipelines.
At this point early in the year, we're very pleased with our progress. Our first quarter results ended up being a little
better than we had expected, but we see nothing to cause us to change our view of the full-year.
Second quarter comparisons will be challenged by the fact that Seabrook has an outage this year, but we expect the
second half of the year to show solid growth, supporting a full-year 2014 adjusted earnings per share range of $5.05 to
$5.45. In the Appendix, we've provided a number of sensitivities around our 2014 expectations.
Looking ahead to 2016, we see nothing that would change the ranges of earnings expectations we provided you in
March 2013 for 2016. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share for 2016 to be in the range of $5.50 to $6,
which is consistent with EPS growth at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2016 off a 2012 base. As
always, our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and operating
conditions.
And with that, we'll now open the line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. I wanted to ask just quickly if you could, I know you can't comment
specifically on the yieldco, but as you think about your broader renewables commitment, how does this change your
view on what is possible from a development perspective? And I suppose, could you address that both from a utilities
scale and from a smaller scale perspective on solar and wind?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, as Jim said in the prepared remarks, we're always limited in what we can say. All I
can really say is that we continue to believe that we will see long-term growth in demand for renewables in this
country. We continue to believe that we will be well-positioned to compete to gain share of that demand and that that
demand will be seen both on the wind and the solar side varying by geography. But beyond that, I really can't help.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. And I suppose just in thinking about what is within the context of eligible,
is it fair to say that your prior comments still apply?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Again, I can't really say anything more than we've said to date.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Okay, fair enough. Just trying to get that out there. And then just secondly, as you
look at the expectation for renewables here, we've heard, I suppose, a little bit on the PTC extension. What are your
thoughts? What are you seeing out there in the market as a result of that? Does that mean that clients potentially are
pushing out their desire to lock up contracts given the potential for an extension? Or how has that changed the
dynamics as best you see it?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, I'll ask Armando to offer some more details, but just generally, I would say there
continues to be good interest. We're in active dialogue with a number of customers. But as always, the uncertainty
about the extension of the PTC does play in. So at this point, I think there's very good odds that we will see another
extension of the PTC, but obviously, the uncertainty does affect how about plays out in the marketplace. Armando?
<A - Armando Pimentel>: I don't have anything to add to that, Moray.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: All right, great. Well, thank you.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Thanks, Julien.
Operator
And we'll go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: I wanted to just talk about the growth in solar and from a strategic point of view how you
think about the approach. We're seeing more distributed solar done, both residential and commercial, and there the
economics, you really, under net-metering rules, there's potentially very good margin in the sense of as solar
installation costs drop, you're really able to arbitrage most of the utility bill, whereas in large solar projects, it's often
still done under RFP and somewhat competitive in that regard. How do you think about the growth in solar in terms of
let's take for example in commercial solar? Do you see potentially going down market in the sense of smaller projects
over time? Or do you think you'll likely remain fairly a large scale in terms of as you think about solar?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, Stephen, we're certainly going to continue to have a concentration on large-scale
solar projects. As I think you know, we have had now for some time a relatively small development effort in the
distributed C&I space. So we do think that there will be some opportunities there. But I guess the main comment that I
would make on this subject is that in sort of broad strategy terms, we want to try and be aligned with what we perceive
to be the long-term fundamentals of our economics. And even regardless of power pricings coming down, we continue
to see the fundamental economics of larger-scale solar projects dominating those of small-scale solar projects,
particularly the very small-scale solar projects, such as residential rooftop. So we recognize that there is a market
opportunity for some folks driven by, I would say, specific market rules. But we are a little leery when those market
rules really don't match up with the underlying economics. So for the long-term, we want our development activity to
be aligned with the fundamentals of the economics.
<A - James L. Robo>: And I would just add, Stephen, this is Jim, that I think it's really dangerous to assume that from
a rate design standpoint across the utilities across the country that they're not going to very aggressively address the fact
that there is effectively a net-metering subsidy in non-solar rooftop. Residential solar rooftop users are effectively
paying the grid costs of the solar rooftop users through as a result of the net-metering subsidy. And I think it's very
dangerous to assume that utilities aren't going to aggressively address that through rate design over the next several
years.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: That's excellent color and very fair points. Understood. And just in Florida, as we look, we've
seen a lot of potential legislative activity on solar. Are there any things in particular we should be most focused on as
we watch? It's honestly hard to tell the noise from the substance in terms of just the variety of potential legislative

activity. Any further color you can add on solar legislative activity in Florida?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, I'm going to ask Eric to comment specifically, but what's going on in Florida here, at
least from our perspective, is that we believe there are some opportunities to introduce more solar into the system. And
we want to come forward with proposals that are the most economic for our customers. But on the political, Eric, do
you have any thoughts?
<A - Eric E. Silagy>: Yeah. What I would add is that this week is the last week of the legislative session for 2014, so
it's going to end on Friday. There's no pending legislation with regards to any type of solar or renewables at this point.
And as Moray said, we're exploring opportunities where it makes economic sense. But there has been a real focus by
the legislative body to make sure that primarily power prices stay affordable and customers have the lowest bills
possible.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Thanks, Stephen.

And we'll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hey, guys.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just I'm sorry if I missed this. Did you guys – and can – or can you guys say when the S-1, the
public one, will be filed?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, the timing obviously depends upon the SEC review process. I would hope that we
would be talking a matter of several weeks rather than several months.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Great. And then just to make sure, just wanted to follow up on the main merchant stuff
and the change reversal. Are you guys – has there been any strategic change with respect to merchant exposure
strategically because of changes in the markets or anything? Or is this just simply because of this one asset and what
you were being offered and what have you?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: It's really specific to the asset, and also to be fair, how the asset fits in to our portfolio. It
has a distribution of outcomes that is not at all symmetrical, but when it does well, it offsets other parts to the portfolio
that may not be doing so well. But it was fundamentally a question of the value that we were receiving in the bids
wasn't consistent with our view of the fundamentals. And, obviously, the fundamentals of that market have
strengthened a little bit relative to this time last year when we originally made the decision to put it up for sale.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. But there's been no change in your move to more contracted and what have you assets. Is
that correct?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: That's correct. In terms of new development activities, you're going to see pretty much
everything we do will continue to be in the contracted space.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just finally on the weather impact, I just wasn't clear on a normalized earnings
basis what the – I saw the $0.11 that was negative, and I saw the 2.9% sales growth. I just wasn't clear about what – and
I'm sorry if I missed it – what the net-net sort of weather impact was for the quarter on an EPS basis.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah, you really can't look at a net weather impact for us as an enterprise. You have to
look at the two businesses separately. Because of the accounting for the rate agreement, the weather impact at FPL is
absorbed into the overall calculation and effectively is adjusted out by the use of surplus depreciation because we are
effectively managing to the predetermined ROE. So it has the longer-term impact, but it doesn't have a direct impact in

the short-term.
On the Energy Resources side, wind – on a year-on-year basis, wind resource contributed about $0.09. So it was $0.09
up versus the year. So the pure resource component was about $0.09.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Versus the $0.11 negative, right?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Right, right.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: If you net those two – okay. Okay, great. Thanks so much.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah. Okay, to be fair, I mean not all of the $0.09 can directly be attributed to the weather
that was associated with the $0.11, if you understand what I mean.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.

Okay. And we'll take our next question from Stephen Fleishman from Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: First, Moray, congrats on warning of eight of the last two quarterly earnings misses now.
That's a joke. No. First, just wanted to ask on the utility, the – so just so I understand, the 11.5% ROE is what you
expect to earn within the guidance for this year, and it's just a matter of how much is kind of the amortization moves
around to kind of get you to that, and the more you can do, yeah.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah, that's a fair characterization. So for this year, we'll be at 11.5%. And as I said in the
prepared remarks, looking forward, based on where we are at the moment, we think we can continue to be in the upper
half of the 9.5% to 11.5% allowed range.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. Okay. And on the SEC process, maybe you could just make sure we understand the
way the private filings work. So you file it, we don't know when you filed it; we don't know when it will come out. But
once it comes out publicly, that's a fully-amended, ready-to-go S-1? So we just see kind of the end game?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No, we've said that we filed the confidential version on April 4. So now, we're in the
review process. Obviously, it depends upon the degree of the SEC's review and the comments that come from that and
our responses to that. So it's a variable time. But at some point, we will be we hope through with that process and then
the filing will become public.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: But is it only public once we're at the final version that will actually be used on the
transaction, or – ?
<A - James L. Robo>: So, Steve, this is Jim. If it does become public ultimately and market conditions are there and
we move forward, all versions of the first S-1 that we filed and then the final S-1 that gets filed will all be available in
public. So everything will be available.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: First on FP&L, I just want to make sure I understand on the regulatory [ph] amor (35:57),
you're basically assuming that you're not going take any during the course of 2014 because what you took in the first
quarter you'll just reverse out gradually during the rest of the year.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: That's correct, broadly speaking. [ph] Part of it just depends (36:12) what the summer
weather is.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Totally understood. Second, what's your latest thought about timing of next rate case?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, first of all, just to remind everybody, the current rate agreement goes through the
end of 2016. Clearly, we are aiming strategically to put ourselves in a position for whatever comes beyond that,
whether it's a formal rate case or whether it's another rate agreement to continue the track record of delivering value to
the customers. In that vein, I would simply point out that Project Momentum is a very important part of our ability to be
in a good position come the end of 2016 to continue to offer both customers and shareholders a very attractive value
proposition. Beyond that, it's still only the early part of 2014.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Understood. And I was just trying to think through the longer-term scenario of do you have
to file or can you – if you manage your cost really well and you get a little bit of demand recovery, can you stay out of
potential rate proceedings for beyond 2016 or so?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah, I think it's premature to speculate on the specifics of that. But certainly, we are
doing everything we can to put ourselves in a position to go for as long as we can without filing a rate case.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it, understood. And finally on the near side, I want to make sure, can you walk through
just the amount of megawatts of U.S. wind and U.S. solar you expect to come online, meaning not the stuff that's
already online or COD but that you expect to come online in both 2014 and 2015? You made some comments in the
prepared remarks about the specific amount in 2014. I just want to make sure we're understanding what's coming when.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Okay. The risk of – well, in order not to confuse it, I'm going to point you to Slide 11. I
think that has the basic information, as well as Slide 25 has the details of individual projects that go into each of the
buckets in Slide 11. So I think the information is there.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. I can follow up offline. Thank you, Moray.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Okay.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And congrats on a good quarter.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Thank you.

And we'll go now to Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Thank you. So I wanted to actually follow up on the regulatory plans for FP&L and from
two aspects. One is recent polls in Florida are suggesting that the kind of former Governor Charlie Crist could be
coming back, and how should we think about it of the potential impact on your regulatory affairs in Florida.
Secondly, on FP&L, could you give us an update on the upgrades to your gas peakers? And thirdly, are you seeing any
increased interest in potentially contracting new renewable projects from regulated utilities as they anticipate the new
carbon emission rule from the EPA?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Angie, on the first, I would just say that we have operated very effectively through many
different political and regulatory environments and we have simply focused on doing the best job we can to deliver
value for our customers. We think that's the best strategy for putting ourselves in the best position in the regulatory
environment.

On the peakers, we are in the midst of an in-the-field testing program where we're monitoring the actual emissions. We
don't know exactly how long that will take but should certainly be completed by the end of the summer. Based on that,
we will then have a better sense of how we'll move forward. I think it's likely to be something along the same lines as
we had outlined before, although it may not require as much capital as we had originally anticipated. And I would think
that we would still be looking at the bulk of that activity being in the 2016 timeframe. You're going to have to remind
me what your third question was [indiscernible] (40:45).
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Yeah. I was asking about utilities being more acceptable to or willing to sign PPAs for
renewable projects in anticipation of the carbon rule from the EPA, basically attempting to offset the carbon emissions
with some more renewables, either in the portfolio or on the PPAs.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Okay. I understand now. Yeah, I haven't heard of that being a – I think that motivations
are otherwise, but Armando, if you want to comment?
<A - Armando Pimentel>: Yeah, let me give just a brief update of wind development. Moray mentioned this before.
Clearly with the PTC extension out there and discussion on the PTC, there's a bit of uncertainty with customers,
whether they're going to sign PPA contracts in 2015 or try to push it out. But I think that uncertainty will be cleared up
really by the end of the year when we understand what's going on on that front.
We have a very large and active pipeline of potential opportunities at this point. We've talked about that pipeline before
over the last year, both in the U.S. and Canada. And a fair number of the PPAs that we've actually signed in the last 18
months to 24 months have actually not been driven by renewable portfolio standards and the states have not been
driven by EPA concerns. They've actually been driven just by the pure economics of the long-term wind contracts. I
think it still a bit early to understand what some of the EPA rules might mean for us in beyond 2015, but it certainly
can't be a negative and I would expect it to be a positive.
And I guess the last comment I would make is because we are getting towards the end of the PTC extension, which
because of IRS guidelines, essentially expires at the end of 2015, there are several acquisition opportunities in the
market that we and others are looking at.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Perfect. Thank you.

And we will take our last question today from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Good morning. Thank you, guys.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Is there an update on your latest thoughts on the plans around potential utility investment
in the upstream nat gas business? Anything you can share on that?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Not a lot new that we can share at the moment. Just to remind folks, we continue to pursue
the potential opportunity to help the FPL customers by reducing the potential volatility of the fuel component of the bill
and possibly lower its average cost over time by investing directly in gas reserves. We need to find the right set of deals
that will make that a reality. We are in the midst to pursuing that. And I would certainly hope that we'd be in a position
to come forward with something specific within the next 12 months. But that's – I've said that before. There's really
nothing new there.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So then we shouldn't be necessarily expecting the sort first sort of trial on this this
calendar year. It's more a 12-month?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah, not necessarily. I...
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Could be as soon as this year, Moray?

<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: It could be as soon as this year, but we'll have to see. The only other thing to say is that
anything we do to start with will be fairly small. It won't have a huge impact. Obviously, we want to establish a
framework and show that these kind of things could be a good deal before we start to scale up.
