MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Brandi, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Costco Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Year End Conference Call. All lines have been
placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer
session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference, sir.
Richard A. Galanti
Thank you, Brandi. Good morning to everyone. This morning, we reported our 16-week fourth quarter and 52-week
fiscal year 2014 operating results, both which ended on August 31. These results are compared to the similar 16-week
and 52-week periods in the prior fiscal year of 2013, which ended last year on September 1. In addition, we're reporting
this morning our September sales results for the five weeks ended this past Sunday, October 5.
I'll start by stating that the discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks
and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time
to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.
To begin with, our fourth quarter earnings results for the 16-week fourth quarter, earnings came in at $1.58 a share, up
$0.18 or up 13% from last year's fourth quarter earnings of $1.40. In terms of sales for the fourth quarter, total sales
were up 9%. Comp sales were up 6% on a reported basis and excluding gas and FX impacts were up 7%. For the
quarter, gas prices year-over-year were essentially flat, so no impact on the 6% U.S. comp figure. However, foreign

currencies overall weakened relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year in the fourth quarter, with the biggest impact in
Canada. Such that our reported 6% international comp figure, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates, would've been up
8%.
In terms of sales for the five-week September period, total sales increased 7% year-over-year and reported comp sales
increased 4%. And again, excluding both gas and FX impacts, comp sales would've been up 6%.
In terms of comparing our $1.58 earnings for the fourth quarter this fiscal year to last year's fourth quarter of $1.40,
there are five items I'd like to point out. First, FX. In the fourth quarter year-over-year, currencies in the foreign
countries where we operate, on an overall basis, weakened versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in our reported foreign
earnings in Q4 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $14 million pre-tax, or $0.02 a share, than these
earnings would've been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year.
Second point, LIFO. Last year in the quarter, we recorded an $8 million pre-tax LIFO credit, or a pickup of a little over
$0.01 a share. This year in the fourth quarter, we had a LIFO charge of almost $11 million, or about $0.02 a share
charge.
Third point, income taxes. Our income taxes this year in Q4 included several discrete items that, in the aggregate,
increased our income tax line by about $8 million. The $8 million of additional taxes included a few positive items that
benefited or lowered our taxes by about $7 million in total. However, these positive items, in total, were more than
offset by a $15 million income tax charge related to our decision to repatriate from Canada back to United States, about
$1.2 billion or CAD 1.3 billion of our Canadian cash – operations cash balances in the near future. In all, the $8 million
net income tax increase from these discrete items, a negative impact to earnings of about $0.02 a share.
Fourth item, our company bonus accrual. I discussed in last year's earnings call that our fourth quarter 2013 quarter
results benefited by reversing or bringing back a portion of the company's bonus accrual, as our fiscal 2013 results
caused us to pay bonuses at a lower level than we had accrued throughout the year. This year in the fourth quarter, our
accrual for the year-end bonuses was not reduced in the fourth quarter as it was – as it had been last year. Overall, this
represented a $0.04 a share negative swing year-over-year to our bottom line. Mind you that the bonus program impacts
a little more than 4,000 people who participate in it throughout the company.
And last item I'll point out is gas profits. This year, our gas profits in Q4 were quite strong, representing an additional
$0.05 a share to earnings year-over-year. Overall, $1.58 earnings figure for the year's fourth quarter was reached
despite several discrete items representing $0.05 or $0.06 shares in the aggregate that did not go our way.
Now to the subject of new openings, for all of fiscal 2014, we opened 30 new locations, 17 new openings in the U.S.,
three each in Canada and Australia, two each in Japan and Korea, and one each in the U.K., Mexico and Spain, that
being our first unit opening in Spain. And we ended fiscal 2014 with 663 locations operating worldwide. For the
current fiscal year, fiscal 2015, our plans are to open 31 new warehouses and also relocate four existing locations. 19 of
the planned 31 new locations will be in the United States with the remaining in international markets. Inevitably, up to
a few of these will get delayed, so I'd estimate that the number of new units in fiscal 2015 will most likely be either in
the very high-20s or up to 30 units, plus the four relos [relocations].
During the first four months of fiscal 2015, basically September through this coming calendar year-end, we plan to
open eight of our fiscal 2015 locations, six in the U.S. and one each in Australia and Mexico. As well, we'll complete
one warehouse relo in Wayne, New Jersey. This will occur in two weeks from tomorrow, on the 23 October.
This morning I'll also review with you our membership trends and other activities, our e-commerce activities,
additional discussion about margins and SG&A, our stock repurchase activities during the quarter. I'll also comment on
the recent switch in Canada of our co-branded credit card offering that's going on right now.
Okay. For the fourth quarter results, sales, again, for the 16-week fourth quarter were up 9% to $34.8 billion, up $3
billion from $31.8 billion a year ago in the fourth quarter. On a reported comp basis, Q4 comp sales were up 6%. For
the quarter, our 6% reported comp was a combination of an average transaction increase of a little under 2% for the
quarter, and this included an FX detriment about 0.5% and an average frequency increase of 4.2%.

In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, in the U.S., with a 6% fourth quarter comp overall, most U.S.
regions registered in the mid single-digit comp increases with the Midwest and Southeast being even stronger.
Internationally, within the plus-8% local currency comp, Australia and Japan were the weakest due in large part to
cannibalization, with Taiwan, Korea, Canada and Mexico all coming in strong in terms of comp sales increases.
In terms of comp sales by merchandise categories for the quarter, both food and sundries and hardlines comps were
both in the mid single-digits range for the quarter and both softlines and fresh foods comps were in the high
single-digits range for the fourth quarter. Within fresh foods, of course, we're still experiencing inflation in the low to
mid single-digit range on average.
For our September sales results, sales for the five-week September month, which ended October 5 were $10.57 billion,
up 7% from last year's September reporting period. Again, on a comp basis, reported, plus 4%. For September, our
plus-4% reported comp sales results were a combination of a slightly positive average transaction, notwithstanding
almost 2 percentage points impact from FX and gas deflation, and average frequency increase of right at 4%.
Cannibalization for the month negatively impacted our sales by just under 0.5 percentage point. Excluding FX and gas
effects, comp sales for the month of September, as I mentioned, were up 6%.
In terms of sales by geographic region, most U.S. regions were in the 4% to 5% comp sales range, with the Midwest
and Southeast being even stronger. Internationally in local currencies, Japan and Australia, being impacted by
cannibalization, were the weakest performers, while Canada and Taiwan were the strongest in terms of comp sale
increases.
In terms of sales by category for this September, food and sundries and softlines both enjoyed mid single-digit comps,
hardlines low single-digit comps, and fresh foods high single-digit comps, again, having a little bit of extra inflation
there as well. And ancillary business comps overall in the mid single-digits led by optical and food courts. Gas comps
were in the mid single-digits range, despite average sale price of gasoline during the month being down 4 percentage
points year-over-year.
Moving to the line items on the fourth quarter income statement. Membership fees, we came in at $768 million, or
2.21% of sales. That's up 7%, or $52 million, year-over-year from $716 million. It's down 4 basis points as a percent of
sales. Again, we had strong sales in the quarter. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates,
coming in at – rounding up to 91% in the U.S. and Canada and a little over 87% worldwide. We continue to enjoy
strength in our Executive Member program with continued new signups. New member signups in Q4 overall, a little
over 2 million new signups in the company. This was about a 7% increase year-over-year. This was helped, of course,
by strong new signups in a few overseas openings in Australia, Korea, and Spain over the past year.
In terms of members, number of members at Q4 end, our last reported number, of course, was a fiscal quarter ago in
mid-May, we had Gold Star members at the end of Q3 at 30.6 million. At the end of the fiscal year, it was up 1 million
to 31.6 million. Primary business was up 100,000 from 6.8 million to 6.9 million. Add-ons remained at 3.5 million. So
overall, total paid member households, 40.9 million at Q3 end, and up 1.1 million to 42 million even at Q4 end. And
excluding extra cards, 74.6 million at Q3 end, up 1.8 million to 76.4 million at the end of the fiscal year.
Also at the end of the fiscal year, Executive Memberships stood at just under 15 million, an increase of about 450,000
just in the 16-week quarter, or about 28,000 increase per week of new Executive Members. In terms of membership
renewal rates, they too continue strong. Again, at the end of the third quarter, business renewal rates were 94.4%. They
remain there at Q4 end. Gold Star renewal rates ticked up a little bit from 89.7% to 89.8%. Overall, we remained at
90.6%, or rounding up to a 91% and again, worldwide we continued at 87.3%.
Now as I've touched on the last couple of quarters' conference calls, we continue to try a few new things to drive both
sales and new member sign-ups. In early September, this would be the first couple of weeks of the first quarter of the
new fiscal year, for eight days, we ran a nationwide membership promotion for new members on LivingSocial. With a
purchase of a full price $55 membership, the new member received a $20 Costco Cash Card, coupons for three free
items. As you might expect, they include a Kirkland Signature Bath Tissue, an Apple Pie and a Rotisserie Chicken.
Also a free three-month membership for identity protection and a bonus coupon of $25 off of any Costco.com offer of

– purchase of $250 or more. These types of promotions, we believe, will allow us to get in front of younger
demographics and with an appealing offer. This one worked well, and we'll keep you posted.
Lastly, I want to mention that in Canada, it was announced last week that the Costco Canada's co-branded credit card
offering is being switched from a Costco American Express co-branded card to a new co-branded Costco Capital One
Platinum MasterCard. This will be exclusive to Costco members. We've already begun to issue the new MasterCards
and we will continue to accept all Amex cards through December 31 of this year. Our new no annual fee credit card
doubles as the membership card and allows our members to earn cash rewards on all purchases made both inside and
outside of Costco, with no cap on the amount of rewards that can be earned.
All right, getting back to the income statement, our gross margin in the fourth quarter was quite strong, coming in up 15
basis points year-over-year, from a 10.55% a year ago in the fourth quarter to a 10.70% during the fourth quarter of this
past fiscal year. As usual, I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers, we'll do four columns. This time, the four columns –
the first two columns will be for Q4 2014, both as reported and without gas inflation. And then for the entire fiscal year
2014 reported and without gas inflation – or deflation.
First line item is core merchandise. In the fourth quarter, we have, year-over-year, the core was up 6 basis points, both
with and without gas, because gas year-over-year was essentially flat. For the year, plus 6 basis points reported and a
plus 3 basis points without gas. Ancillary and other businesses, a big contributor in Q4, plus 15 basis points, the first
two columns there. And for the year, plus 6 basis points and plus 6 basis points. The 2% reward, no impact in the Q4,
both of those two columns; a minus 1 basis point impact in the next two columns. LIFO, as I mentioned of course, it
was a charge this year versus a credit last year, [ph] 6 (14:19) basis points year-over-year, both in the fourth quarter
columns. And minus 5 basis points year-over-year for the entire fiscal year in both columns.
Other, no additional items in the fourth quarter. In the last two columns for fiscal 2014, minus 2 basis points
year-over-year, that related to a lawsuit recovery over a year ago that benefited us, and of course, we didn't have any
unusual item offsetting that benefit from a year ago. If you add it up, we reported margins up 15 basis points, both with
and without gas. Our reported total for the year was up 4 basis points but taking out gas, it was up 1 basis point. So
again, a good showing overall in the fourth quarter in terms of margin improvement.
Now as I mentioned, the core was up 6 basis points. Two of the four core categories, food and sundries, and fresh foods
showed higher year-over-year gross margin percentages. While year-over-year in Q4, softlines margins were
essentially flat year-over-year and hardlines margins were slightly lower.
Ancillary business gross margins were up over 50 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter based on their own
sales, with gas, optical and hearing aids coming in better year-over-year in Q4. And LIFO, again in the fourth quarter,
we recorded just under an $11 million or 3 basis point pre-tax charge compared to an $8 million 3 basis point pre-tax
credit last year, for a 6 basis point year-over-year swing in the fourth quarter.
Next, our SG&A percentages. Year-over-year in the fourth quarter, they were lower or better by 2 basis points, coming
in at a 9.73% as a percent of sales compared to a 9.75% last year. Again, we'll do the same four columns, two for the
fourth quarter, with and without gas, and two for the full fiscal year within reported and without gas.
In terms of core operations, we have a plus 7 basis points and a plus 7 basis points for the quarter, and a minus 2 basis
points and a plus 1 basis point for the fiscal year. So plus 7 basis points, of course, would mean that it was lower or
better by that many basis points. Central was a minus 7 basis points and a minus 7 basis points for the quarter, and a
minus 3 basis points and a minus 3 basis points for the year. RSUs, a plus 2 basis points and a plus 2 basis points, and
for the year, a minus 2 basis points and a minus 2 basis points, and no quarterly adjustments. So total, for the quarter,
both on a reported basis and without gas, we again, we were better by 2 basis points, so a plus 2 basis points. For the
year, we are higher by 7 basis points on a reported basis, so a minus 7 basis points, and without gas, a minus 4 basis
points.
In terms of our SG&A performance, the core operations again was lower or better by 7 basis points. Within core,
payroll and benefits expenses were lower, better year-over-year by 8 basis points, again, helped by leveraging sales
strength. Similarly, other operating expenses as a percent of sales in the core were better by 4 basis points. So total

between those three items, really, would be 12 basis points. The change in the bonus accrual year-over-year, as I
discussed earlier, hurt the core component by about 5 basis points.
In terms of central, it was higher again by 7 basis points, about 5 basis points of that is SG&A variance, is related to the
ongoing IT modernization efforts. And another [ph] 3 (17:27) basis points is the increased SG&A expense resulting
from the year-over-year swing in bonus accrual. That's split between core and central. And lastly, our equity
compensation, which is now an important component of compensation to, again, to about 4,000 people, this represented
an improvement of 2 basis point positive in SG&A, benefiting from both timing of certain vesting provisions when
employees hit 25 years, 30 years and 35 years of service, as well as from the strong sales denominator in the fourth
quarter.
Next on the income statement line, preopening, not a whole lot to talk about, $17 million last year the quarter, $15
million of charges this year in the quarter. Last year, we opened seven units, this year 10 unites. No major surprises
there. All told, operating income in the fourth quarter increased 14%, or $137 million year-over-year, from $954
million last year in the fourth quarter to almost $1.1 billion, $1.091 billion this year in the fourth quarter.
Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was $1 million lower year-over-year, coming in at $36
million last year, and coming in this year at $35 million for the quarter. Interest income and other, it was lower
year-over-year by $6 million; $36 million last year in the fourth quarter compared to $30 million this year. Actual
interest income for the quarter was up $3 million, coming in at $17 million compared to $14 million last year. The
other component of interest income and other was lower by $8 million, primarily related to various FX items being
mark-to-market at fiscal quarter-end.
Overall, pre-tax income was up 14%, or $132 million, to $1.086 billion this year, versus last year's fourth quarter
pre-tax earnings of $954 million. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate for the quarter came in at a 35.1%, up 0.3%
from a 34.8% tax rate all-in last year, so slightly higher this year, and as I explained it – the reasons for that earlier in
the call. Overall, net income was up 13%, or $80 million, to $697 million versus last year's fourth quarter of $617
million. And as I discussed earlier, this figure being achieved notwithstanding several items that, in the aggregate, did
not go our way.
Now for a quick rundown of other usual topics. A condensed balance sheet is included in this morning's press release,
but a couple of items on the balance sheet and a couple cash flow items I'll point out here. Depreciation and
amortization for the quarter totaled $321 million and for the year, $1.029 billion. In terms of accounts payable as a
percent of inventory, on a reported basis, both last year and this year's fourth quarter, it was right at 100%. Payables, of
course, include things other than merchandise payables, like construction payables. If you look at just merchandise
payables as a percent of inventory, in both fiscal quarters, we were at 89% year-over-year, so almost 90% of our
inventory is being financed with trade payables.
Average inventory per warehouse, last year, fourth quarter-end, $12.5 million; up a tick this year in the fourth quarter
to $12.8 million, or up about $300,000 or 2%. The $300,000 increase, about 80% of that is in four of our merchandise
sub-departments. Majors was up about $91,000. Some of that is the reintroduction of Apple products. Men's apparel
was up about $55,000. Foods was up $61,000, and meats were up $39,000. The latter two being somewhat related to
inflation.
In terms of CapEx, in the fourth quarter, we spent $567 million. For all of fiscal 2014, total CapEx was right at $2
billion. Our estimate for fiscal 2015 CapEx is quite a bit higher, probably in the $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion range. The
year-over-year increase in CapEx represents our plans for more openings this year, that of course includes the four
relos versus last year; increased spending for remodeling activities and expanding ancillary business operations;
planned expansion of our cross-dock depot operations; anticipated spending later in the year for some additional
openings earlier in the subsequent fiscal year; and increased level of IT spending for the modernization efforts.
In terms of Costco Online, we're currently operated in four countries: U.S., Canada, UK and Mexico. We'd expect to be
in at least one, probably two additional countries by the end of calendar 2015. For the fiscal year, total e-commerce
sales came in just under $3 billion. For both fiscal fourth quarter and the fiscal year, sales and profits were up. Sales in

e-commerce were up in the high teens for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. And the comp sales in
e-commerce were up in the 18% to 19% range for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year.
Over the past two years and, as I mentioned, we re-platformed our site, we've introduced new apps. We've combined
some e-commerce merchandising efforts with in-line efforts. We've added new categories, including areas like apparel,
health and beauty aids and some sundries. And we've improved distribution and delivery time.
In addition, outside of e-commerce, as you know, we've continued over the last – much of this past calendar year,
testing Google Shopping Express, that continues with a great partner with Google. The trending is positive in terms of
member spending and also signing up some new members, but again, it's still a test. We continue to add items to that
delivery process. Currently, it's in three geographic areas, the Bay Area, Los Angeles, and New York, and more to
come, I'm sure.
Next discussion, in terms of expansion. Again, for fiscal 2014, [ph] that ended (23:05), we opened 30 warehouses.
Acapulco was closed due to weather-related destruction, so ended up a net of increase last year of 29 warehouses. This
year, assuming we open the planned 31 warehouses – we opened 35 warehouses but four of those are relos, so a
planned net new of 31 warehouses. Eight warehouses would be in the first quarter, none in the second quarter, two
warehouses in the third quarter, and 21 warehouses in the fourth quarter. We've got a lot going on. I think that, again,
we'll probably see at least a couple of – one or two of those perhaps speed up a little bit but a few be pushed into the
next – early the next fiscal year. So in fiscal 2014, we added 29 warehouses on a base of 634 warehouses, or about 5%
square footage growth. In fiscal 2015, assuming 31 warehouses, it would be about 4.5% to 5% square footage growth.
In terms of the 31 warehouses this year, if we get all of those open, 19 warehouses would be in the U.S., one warehouse
each in Canada and the U.K. In Asia, overall, six warehouses; three warehouses in Korea, two warehouses in Japan,
and one warehouse in Taiwan. One additional warehouse in Australia; that will be our seventh warehouse in Australia.
Two more warehouses in Mexico. And one more warehouse in Spain. As of Q4 end, total square footage stood at 95.3
million square feet.
One last comment regarding openings and operations in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Costco, like many other businesses,
was the victim of the recent hurricane on September 14 and the subsequent looting that took place, and that we're
currently closed. We plan to be back up and operating by early November.
In terms of common stock repurchases, we began our recent repurchase activities on March 7, the day after our second
quarter earnings release was released. In Q3, we purchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $113.14 for a total
expended of just under $184 million. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 1.3 million shares at an average price of
$116.11, or a total dollar amount of about $150 million.
In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.355 a shares or annualized at $1.42, that's up 14.5%
from the previous year's dividend rate. This $1.42 per share dividend represents an annual cost to company of about
$625 million.
Lastly, our fiscal 2015 first quarter scheduled earnings release date will be Thursday, December 11, for that will be for
the 12-week fiscal first quarter ending on November 23.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brandi for Q&A. Brandi?

Operator
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And your first question
comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So Richard, a few things. The gross margin being up in the food categories, is that cost of

coming from?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Without looking at the detail, I would guess most of its cost of product driven. The
examples, of course, would be, I've mentioned before poultry prices to us have come down a little bit as we locked in
versus where they had been. We didn't change the price, needless to say, of those items upward. I think we've had a
little bit of [ph] hit (26:37) in the food court similarly for that reason.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Do you think – as Kirkland gets bigger and gets more scale, do you think there is – can
that move the needle on gross margin either in terms of margin on the product or mix?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it does a couple of things. Generally, the answer is yes. It also – as KS product
takes share from a branded product, it generally moves the branded product to come down in price to us, which again,
gives us even more competitive loyalty with our members. So there's a lot of good things there. Certainly, the needle –
the low-hanging fruit occurred many years ago. You've heard the examples of whether toilet paper or disposable
diapers where you have items that are very, very competitive branded items, we can come in with a great value, great
quality item and make a fairer margin to us but still a great savings to the customer. So it works, but it moves the needle
slightly.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: All right. And one of the countries you didn't talk about, good or bad, was the U.K., [ph]
or I would assume (27:45) there's a lot going on there. Just generally speaking, how do you find you're performing in
the U.K. top and bottom line today?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, two things. To finish something I thought about after I finished the first answer. The
other benefit, of course, is not just KS but the increase in organic sales. That's something I think that competitively
gives us a leg-up because it's where more margin, historically, has been made in retail on organic. We can provide
better savings and it has other positive attributes in terms of the type of member that shops for that stuff. In terms of the
U.K., it was still positive. It was at the lower end – low-single digits. Actually, U.K. has shown some improvement.
And [indiscernible] (28:32) -
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: You mentioned organic. Two things. What's happening to assortment there? And then
secondly, it does look like on a variety of levels in terms of just product placement, marketing, you're trying to drive
that significantly. So that's got to be one of the – still one of the fastest-growing departments in food. Do you think that
– is that helping you much with the Millennials, or is that yet to come?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, it's helping. It's probably a bigger percentage now because it's on a small base.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Yeah.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: You look at – I think a couple of quarters ago, I talked about like fresh ground beef,
organic ground beef. It's an infinite percentage increase, from $0 million to $25-million-or-so that first year. As I
mentioned earlier, what we're finding in a lot of these items is that it's incremental sales because it was loyal members
that didn't buy ground beef from us before, and now they are. This year, organic ground beef sales were up dramatically
because the supply is up dramatically. So yes, again, they're big numbers on – it's one of those good things, but it's lots
of little things.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, Richard. A couple questions. First, just the membership promos you're doing with
LivingSocial, how are those funded? Are the vendors contributing any of that or are you guys funding all that?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think an example of – I think we're doing most of the funding of that. Certainly to
the extent that there's identity protection, we have some vendor support, I'm sure. I don't know exactly, but I'm sure we
do. The other item, on the food items, they're our items, the KS Bath Tissue, Rotisserie Chicken. I'm not sure if there's a
little support from the manufacturers, but I would assume it's part of the member procurement costs on our side.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Right. Okay. And then the plans for the Canadian cash that you're bringing in?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's really just moving it down here. As we read about every day in the paper, money is
stuck, multinational companies outside the U.S. We have the ability, based on when the monies were earned over the
last 20 years; years ago, basically, the marginal federal corporate tax rate in Canada versus the U.S. was a lot closer
than I think the roughly 13 percentage points difference now, roughly 26% versus 39%. These first billion dollars, if
you will, $1.2 billion as I think I mentioned, translated into U.S. dollars, is an effective rate of about 1.25% tax rate. So
we opted to move it.
Canada, of course, is very profitable. It has its own column in the segment analysis. You can kind of figure that out.
While we are still adding two units or three units, our CapEx is dwarfed by our earnings up there. And so we'll continue
to make money, we saw this as an opportune time to be able to start that process.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. Perfect. And then last question. Just how do you guys think about the timing of
introducing the Executive Membership option into new markets? What are the main considerations, and how should we
think about that for getting in some of these markets where you're not in? I'm thinking of Asia.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think there's two things. One is, is how big is the country in terms of how many
units we have. And secondly, can we get a – I guess there are three things. That was the first one. Second would be
putting a menu of services together that we can do. And, of course, as we get bigger – relatively bigger in a given
country, that buying power allows us to do that, and then what else we have going on. Using Japan as an example,
we've gone from, what, 9 units to 23 units or 24 units in about two and a half years. So I think we like it. We like the
Executive Member program, and long term, we'd like to see it in other countries. But those are the types of factors.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Mike D. Otway>: Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Mike Otway in for Scott. Thanks for taking the
questions. Richard, in terms of SG&A, you'd laid out the buckets. As we think about next year, is there any – are there
any buckets that are likely to move SG&A a bit higher than this year, perhaps a little lower? I know you mentioned
you're spending a bit more on IT modernization. How does that flow through the P&L? Any color there would be great.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I mean, first and foremost, it's sales growth. I mean if we can get good sales growth,
that helps a lot of things. Certainly, increased penetration in some of our overseas markets actually helps quite a bit
because of various things; healthcare expenses as a percent of sales are much lower in virtually every other country
than United States. Labor costs are different and generally lower than in other countries as a percent of sales. So I think
those things will probably help us.
In terms of IT modernization, as I've kind of laid out over the last couple of years each quarter, incrementally, we
expect that to be in the low to low mid-teens, incremental over three years or four years. I think we're probably up to 10
basis points or 11 basis points – or maybe 9 basis points or 10 basis points over the last couple of years, and we'll
continue to see that this year.
I don't think it's going to help us anytime soon. It probably is a slight negative impact certainly in fiscal 2015, maybe a
little in fiscal 2016 before it flattens out and hopefully starts to go the other way a little bit. Beyond that, healthcare is
always an unknown in the U.S. And again, as I mentioned, I think to the extent that the healthcare continues to be the
inflationary aspects of healthcare in the U.S., and where, as you know, we haven't and aren't going to make major

changes like cutting a bunch of people out of it. That's an expensive cost to us, and we're proud of the ability to be able
to do that.
Notwithstanding that, even if that continues in its slightly greater than sale – top line sales rate of growth, increasing
penetration of healthcare costs outside of the U.S. will help mitigate any damage there. So I don't think there's anything
new to add to this process than those kinds of things.
<Q - Mike D. Otway>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just in terms of the consumer, have you seen any real change
there in the last few months? And then specifically with your business in the Midwest and the Southeast, maybe what
you're seeing in those regions relative to – it's clearly strong – what's going on there versus some other places in the
country?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think with the Midwest, certainly, it's a newer region, relatively speaking. We're
getting – we seem to have – I think are hitting our sweet spots in some of those cities. Same in the Southeast. We've
opened in areas like Louisiana and Alabama and Georgia and Florida, some additional units, and South Carolina.
They're generally tending to do pretty well. So I think a few extra years there have helped us frankly.
I can't tell you much more than that in terms of a little color on the consumer. Some of the usual suspects, good
suspects, if you will, in terms of merchandise categories, some of the nonfoods, softlines and hardlines categories, like
apparel and housewares and domestics, those have all done well, in part because of our commitment to them, our
increasing commitment to apparel area would be one example.
Clearly, having the demographic [ph] or a (36:29) member, I think, helps. Having strength in gas. I mean gas sales
were up I think I mentioned up, I think, 4%, notwithstanding – 3% or 4%, notwithstanding a 4 or so percent decline in
the average sales price per gallon. So gallons were up nicely and that's driving – no pun intended – but driving people
into the Costco parking lots.
<Q - Mike D. Otway>: Great. Thanks, Richard. Appreciate the color.

Your next question is from Meredith Adler with Barclays.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thanks for taking my question. I would just like to talk a little bit about as you think about
international growth, I noticed that there's – you didn't mention opening anything in France, I think, in this coming
year. Are you looking just to continue to fill out the markets where you already operate, or are you considering moving
into another new market? I mean obviously Spain is still very new, but...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. Well, both Spain and France, I think we probably started talking about those two
countries three years ago. And at the time, we felt that it could be three or more years based on the permitting and
appeal processes in various, not only countries, but cities and communities, and that's certainly why we keep at this
point pushing out France. We'll continue to look at that. And again, we'll have our second opening in Spain later in
calendar 2015. We haven't mentioned any other countries beyond that. If I was a betting person, absolutely, in the next
few years, but not in the next year, year and a half.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: And maybe you could just comment a little bit about real estate in the U.S. Are you finding
any changes in the environments, harder to find locations, working with developers, anything different?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I don't know if it's anything different. In some markets, it becomes – it's ever –
increasingly more difficult. In the Greater L.A. where we've got 40 units or 50 units, many, many units, we feel that
over the next 10 years, we could open another 10 units or 15 units, but they're all very pinpointed locations based on
where other locations – other Costco locations are. And it's densely populated and it's difficult, but that's what we do.
And we've got a lot more people in the real estate area over the last few years, and we've got a lot more in the pipeline,
and we think we'll get there.

I think also, and we're fortunate in a sense that many of the markets, be it Texas, Midwest, Southeast, some of the
markets that we are newer in over the last 10 years, not the last 30 years, we're able to go into – and again, given our
demographic, we're able to find some locations. Certainly, we also get some calls, as you might expect, from
developers. But it's probably an increasingly difficult effort, and that's why we've added more infrastructure to pursue
that.
Overseas, every country's a little different. I think, as I mentioned, in Asia this coming year, we have I think six units
planned: three units, two units and one unit. Of course, we've opened a bunch in Japan in the last two years already.
And so again, it takes a lot longer, but we've got a lot in the pipeline, too, and so we'll continue to see some growth
there.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Your next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Good morning. It's Joshua Siber on for Simeon Gutman. I'm curious, if you guys are seeing
areas of the store where customers are more or less sensitive to price increases and how much room you have to further
pass through greater costs in these categories.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, we're most sensitive to us. We haven't seen any major change in the level of
competition out there. I mean, everybody's tough, and we're pretty tough ourselves. So no, I don't think so. I mean, I
think it's continuing as it goes. I think we're – some of our margin improvement of late has become, as we've not raised
prices, but some of the underlying costs have come down, and some of that hurt's behind us, but tomorrow's another
day.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We – yeah.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Sorry. Go ahead. I didn't mean to interrupt.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We've taken – no, we've – the list of price increases is not a big list around here.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Okay. That's helpful.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Relatively speaking.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Sure. For the members that you picked up on LivingSocial, do these customers shop online
more frequently? And is there a noticeable difference in basket in terms of pricing or content?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: They're so new I can't really tell you. This most recent program was early – about three
weeks ago. And the processes is, is they redeem their coupon and they come in, and a lot of them are coming in. But I
would guess, generally speaking, compared to the first test we did on a regional basis with LivingSocial a few months
earlier, you do have a higher percentage of millennials. But like any new member, millennials or otherwise, when a
new member first starts to shop, they're generally shopping smaller basket sizes and a little bit more food-oriented to
start with, and that's been historically a typical pattern. So it's too early to tell.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Okay. And then just one more, a housekeeping question. Is the $150 million buyback that you
guys spent in fourth quarter a good run rate to go forward?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I can't really respond to that. I can tell you that we – historically, when we have bought, we
have bought through blackout periods using 10b5-1s. Our longest blackout period of the year, which is six weeks or
seven weeks long, stretching from early – I guess from late July, early August, all the way to today, you have to
basically put in place something. Well, if you go back that many weeks, the stock at the time was in the mid to high,

like $115, $117, and so we hadn't bought for the last few weeks of the quarter. But that would imply a little bigger

Your next question is from David Schick with Stifel.
<Q - David A. Schick>: Hi. Good morning. You talked in the call about the high teens growth of online, and you
talked about the success of the Google partnership, and you said profit growth was I think at a similar pace. But going
back to what you said, if you could just give any more details on how the profitability or the growth thereof is trending
in online, that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The profitability is very good. I don't think we really give out profit growth numbers there
in that 3% piece of our business. The good news, it's growing, and it is more profitable. E-commerce is definitely quite
a bit more profitable than the rest of the company. And so 3% of sales implies a greater percent increase of earnings.
<Q - David A. Schick>: Is it more profitable on a flow-through basis than it was at this time last year?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Let me correct that, 3% of sales, a higher percent of sales profitability than the company
overall. So every time we can grow those sales, you'll see earnings grow nicely, too.
<Q - David A. Schick>: And then is the operating margin of it – if you don't want to detail that, that's fine, but is it
growing beyond the revenue, is it levering or is it expanding the total loaded margin?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, the problem you have is, is we've opened recently in a couple of new countries in the
last year and a half, and so we're spending a lot of money on that. We've spent a lot of money on apps, on upgrading,
and so I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I know it's growing, and it's profitable.

Your next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks. Richard, a couple questions. Love to start on membership fee income. So it was up
7%. What was it in local currencies? And in terms of membership growth, how much of that you think is driven by the
new clubs?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Let me answer the first question. It was up 8% without FX, in dollars. And what was the
other question?
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: So I think you said memberships were up 7%. I was trying to get a sense of how much of that
was driven by the new openings, particularly in these markets where you have been very successful and you've had
huge membership growth with some of the new clubs.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I don't have it in front of me. I'm sure that made it healthy. I can remember over the
years when sometimes we – it's a little down, year-over-year, it's because a year ago we had some foreign operations
with those outsized new signups and fewer international the next year. I don't know off the top of my head.

<Q - Greg S. Melich>: All right. So [ph] – but use (45:51) 8% is the local currency number?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. And then second, I wanted to understand a little bit more about the gross margin in
ancillary, I guess that was up – you said up 50 bps in ancillary, which was...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, ancillary – if you took total ancillary gross margin divided by total ancillary business
sales, it was up a little over 50 basis points. Different ancillary businesses were up or down differently.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Right.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That in addition to strong sales in those areas, so a combination of increasing penetration
and increasing margins was a higher-level benefit to the total company gross margin. Gas being the outsized one there.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And how should we think about the sustainability of that on gas? Like are we now at what
would be a normal run rate there? And also is dot-com – where's that show up in your nice little bridge you do?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, dot-com is in the core. [ph] It's not ancillary, is it (46:50), dot-com? No. In terms of
sustainability of gas profits, I only wish. We've probably been on a little longer run of good gas profitability the last
several months. Generally speaking, when gas prices are, year-over-year, are flat or declining, as they are now, that's
good news. We save the customer more, and we make more. When they're going up fast, we save the company – the
customer a little less, and we make less. And so we've been blessed by having a positive run here for several months.
But it's a volatile area.
Now that's just looking with [ph] both blinds (47:28) on of just gas operation. That doesn't take into account the fact
that every time we can get somebody to come in and get gas, that's incrementally a potential positive shop in the
warehouse as well, and so that we, of course, don't consider as part of that.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Is it fair to say that the 15 bps that you cited that gas was half of that? I think you listed it first
when you talked about optical and hearing aids and gas.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know off the top my head. I bet it's half or more. It's not all.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay, great. Got it. And then lastly, just on the inventory increase, it sounded like you gave
those four areas, which is all very clear. Was there anything unusual about that other than restocking Apple that you
wouldn't use that as sort of a trend going forward in those categories?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Actually, the trend, this is I think probably the lowest year-over-year average increase in
merchandise inventories. For a few years there, we've been running up 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% year-over-year in the
inventory levels. In the last couple of quarters, on a year-over-year basis, we've been down in the 2% or 3% range. So
actually, it's come in better in my view. I mean a 2%, whatever, a 3% increase in inventories on a – 2% increase in
inventories on a 7% or 8% or 9% increase in total sales. Yeah, I think the anomaly there would be adding some product
on that side, and the anomaly, of course, with inflation in fresh foods, but that's going fluctuate as well. So I think
overall, probably, this is – we looked at this as being a little bit better level of increase in average inventories per
warehouse [indiscernible] (49:09).
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And it sounds like you think it's sustainable at this rate.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: At this point? Sure.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Yeah, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That could change tomorrow. You never know.

Your next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot and good morning. A couple of quick ones here. First of all, I know that you
essentially mark-to-market for LIFO at the end of any given quarter, so your expectation is that you're probably going
to be clean as you go into next year. That being said, with the trends that you're seeing in pricing in key categories,
what's your initial thinking on the direction that might move in, in 2015 relative to this past year?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's hard to know. The only person I've actually talked to is in the area of fresh foods, and
there's anticipation of continuing overall inflationary trends there. Although some of it, when it's deflationary, it's
because it – I think butter had skyrocketed and now it's coming down a little. I might be wrong on the commodity there,
but probably still a little bit of inflation.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Okay. A quick second question here. You mentioned in your gross margin discussion that
hardlines was down a bit year-on-year. Just interested in any color in terms of the drivers there.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I think for the quarter it was flat, and was it – nothing really stood out. I mean,
majors, which is electronics was up slightly. Nothing really stands out there.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Okay. And then finally, you had a question earlier about some of the membership deals
that you're running, for example, the one with LivingSocial, about really who bore the economic cost. I guess my
question is, and I know that this is pretty small potatoes for the moment, how do you account for those subsidies? Does
it reduce the membership fee income or does it show up in some other line item?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's allocated between sales and membership, but it's mostly membership.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Okay. So for the year...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And...
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Sorry, go ahead.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That's over the year. I mean for the – and it's amortized over the year. It's – I'll have to find
out. It's so small. It's less than a rounding error.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Fair enough. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Is that it?

Your next question comes from Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Thanks. Good morning, Richard. Nice quarter. Just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit
about Google Express. What's the ultimate goal of that program? Is it to drive increased memberships? Is it for you to
get younger? And I guess what's holding you, guys back on rolling it out to more than just the few regions where it's
being tested today?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, we're talking about us and Google partnering on this. They're partnering
with a number of other retailers as well. You can go to Google Shopping Express in each of those three key geographic
markets and see what other retailers. We're certainly, I think, a big component of it, but we're a big component of every
– anything we do. And it's been good so far. I think you really have to ask them that. I would assume they are looking
at additional markets but as they're announced, you'll find out as well.
Generally speaking, ultimately, we're always asked about all the concerns with delivery and e-commerce and all that
stuff, and we recognize we're not going to be the guy that drops off Fruity Pebbles cereal and a quart of milk before

your kid wakes up in the morning for breakfast if you ordered it before 10:00 p.m. the night before. But we are and we
started our business being a wholesale supplier. In this case, it's kind of a, hopefully, a win-win, not only for Google
Shopping Express but for us. We are seeing incremental business from it, but there's, again, there's a lot of nuances to
it. So far, so good.
But again, it's – the biggest test, it's been around for seven months or – eight months or nine months I guess since
January in the Bay Area, and a lot fewer months in L.A. and in New York. We like it because it's our member, and
there's that positive aspect of it. You can't get Costco items through Google Express unless you're a Costco member.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Right.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And we have seen incremental sign-ups because of that. And, look, we appreciate the fact
that it's a way to sell merchandise, as well it's a way to get some members over time, as well, it's a way in our view to
have – ultimately, we want to get you into the store or into warehouses more frequently also, and we think there's
avenues to do that. But it's really too early to know other than as it's likely rolled out to other cities, we'll be part of that
at this point in time.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Okay. So another initiative you guys have to get younger is this organic offering. I'm just
wondering if you could just put things into context of where you guys are today there at number of SKUs or percentage
of sales to where you were a couple of years ago.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Organic was about $3 billion, I'm told, by one of the many people in my office right now,
last year, and growing dramatically. Part of that's supply, and part of that's us pushing it more. I don't think we sat
around a number of years ago and said let's do organic to get millennials. I think what happened is, is we sell items and
as those items grow, and we see that it's got great attributes for us, one that we didn't even realize until we saw it.
We can generally provide a better savings than others because other retailers sometimes will use it as an ability to get
more margin. So we'd show greater savings. It's a higher price point item than the substitute item. And again, the added
benefit was, in some instances, I've used the ground beef example, we had existing loyal members that 80%, I know in
that first year, I assume it could be a little lower now, but a large percentage of the – were incremental sales because
those were existing members that didn't buy their ground beef at Costco.
So to the extent that you have, be it millennial or otherwise, but the extent you have somebody that is an organic buyer,
they may love Costco, but if we don't have an organic alternative, they're going to shop elsewhere for that item. Now,
so that helps, hopefully, get them in more frequently to Costco, but we're doing it because we're selling those items.
And as it increases – we've had organic milk for a number of years, and certainly, we're able to use our buying power
and our sourcing to continue to drive that.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Okay. And just switching gears a little bit. It's been a while since I've heard you guys
articulate a longer term store goal. And I'm just wondering if you're willing to share one now. And as a follow-up to
that, 19 clubs in the U.S. this year out of, say, roughly, 31 clubs, when does the pendulums shift to more international
locations where you're doing 19 clubs international, say, as opposed to 19 clubs in the U.S. for this year?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think in over the next five years, if you look back a year ago, I think we talked about the
fact that over a five-year period, we'd expect to open roughly 30 clubs a year, maybe starting at 28 clubs or 29 clubs
and ending up at 33 clubs or 35 clubs. And we're kind of in that right, I guess year two or two and half of that five
years. I think the fact that we're opening a few more, if you asked me three years ago, I would have guessed it might be
more evenly split right now. I think that's simply a function of availability and speed at which you get things done here.
When you're looking in a 20 million population city in Asia, there's all kinds of issues. And again, as I've mentioned,
we've got more people in real estate on the ground in each of these countries compared to very few on the ground five
years ago. So the pipeline is definitely more filled. And I guess from looking at it a positive way, the question of when
are you going to slow down in the U.S. because of anticipated saturation, I'm happy to report that that's not happening
yet. It will happen at some point but, if anything, it's probably – that pendulum has probably swung the other way a
little bit in the last couple of years, in part because of some of the strength in those markets where we've been in 10

years to 15 years or less, not 25 years and 30 years.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Interesting. And any thoughts on the longer term store goals that you guys have?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Other than more, I think if you asked Jeff and Craig and the heads of operations, [ph] if
over this current might (58:04), as I've defined it, five-year period, it's 30 clubs – a little over 30 clubs a year. I think
we'd like to get up to 35 clubs a year in the next five years, maybe a little more. So we'll continue to try to push that a
little bit. We feel we have the capabilities to do that. That depends, of course, on continued success in these markets.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Okay. And this is the last question, just on the margins, as a follow-up to, I believe, Matt's
question. I just wondered if you could speak to the degree of improvement on food and sundries and fresh, relative to
the third quarter, which I believe your food and sundries was up 20 basis points and then fresh was down a couple of
basis points. I know you said it was positive. I'm just wondering if you could give us the degree of improvement.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it's in the – I don't have it right front of me, but it was less than up 50 basis points
and more than up 10 basis points. I don't have it in front of me.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Less than up 50 basis points and more than up 10 basis points.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think somewhere in the high teens or 20s basis points. I don't have – I could be off a little
bit. But there wasn't – one of them wasn't up 1 basis point, the other up 80 basis points, they were both up.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Okay. Okay, great. Thanks again.

Your next question is from Michael Exstein with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Charlene S. Wong>: Good morning. It's Charlene Wong on for Michael Exstein. What's your initial experience
in Spain been like?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'm sorry. [ph] Europe, (59:25) what was the question?
<Q - Charlene S. Wong>: What has your initial experience in Spain been like?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, so far, it's fine. I mean, our member sign-ups are strong and continuing. As we
expect, when we go into a completely new country, you generally see smaller baskets to start with. We haven't –
needless to say, we've only been there for three months or four months, so we haven't anniversaried anything in terms
of seeing any type of renewal rates. But we're pushing forward. We're working on our site in Spain. So no major
differences of expectations.
<Q - Charlene S. Wong>: Got you. Thank you.

And your final question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Robert S. Drbul>: Hi, Richard. Just got a couple of questions for you, though. On the fourth quarter, what was
the percentage of sales to the total? And I'm not sure if you gave it, but can you talk a little bit about in September, the
impact on gas and FX were to the month of September sales?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I can. Gas was – well, let's see. FX was 120 basis point drag and gas was about 0.5
point, just 48 basis points.
<Q - Robert S. Drbul>: Okay. Great. And then just the last question that I have is, on the openings for the next fiscal
year, I guess the timing of them, why are they so back-half weighted?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, the biggest reason is we try to open everything as soon as we can, other than when
there's some craziness because if it's up in Minnesota and it's in the snow and the ground's frozen, you might lose four
months if you can't get the foundation – the ground dug and the foundation set. But it's just timing of when they are.
We would love to push a few of them sooner. That's generally our best guess of where they are. It's really – I mean, the
impact is – and I'm sure by Q3 as we know more specifics about how many will open, we'll have a little color on
pre-opening expense. But other than that, it's a manageable process.
<Q - Robert S. Drbul>: Great. Thanks very much.

And there are no additional questions at this time.
