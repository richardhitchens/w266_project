MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Devon Energy's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a
listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This call is being
recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.
Sir, you may begin.
Vincent W. White
Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Devon's second quarter earnings call and webcast.
Before we get started, I want to make sure that everyone's aware that we have prepared a handful of slides to
supplement today's script. These are integrated with today's webcast, and they're also available for download in PDF
form on Devon's homepage, devonenergy.com. For those that are not participating via webcast, we'll make sure to refer
to the slide numbers during our prepared remarks so that you can follow along.
Today's call will follow our usual format; I have a few preliminary items to cover. Then, I'll turn the call over to our
President and CEO, John Richels, for his comments. Following John, Dave Hager, our Chief Operating Officer, will
provide the operations update. And we'll wrap up the prepared commentary with a financial review by our CFO, Tom
Mitchell. After our financial discussion, we'll have a Q&A session, and we'll conclude the call after about an hour, and
of course, a replay will be available later today on our website. The Investor Relations team will also be available this
afternoon should we have any follow-up questions.
On the call today, we're going to update some of our forward-looking information. And in addition to the updates that
we're providing on the call, we'll file a Form 8-K later today and it'll have the details of our updated 2014 estimates. A
copy of this updated 8-K will be available within the Investor Relations section of the Devon website as well.

The guidance we provide today includes plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates which are forward-looking
statements under U.S. securities law. These are of course subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties,
many of which are beyond the company's control. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we'd
invite you to see the discussion of risk factors relating to these estimates in our Form 10-K.
Also on today's call, we'll reference certain non-GAAP performance measures. When we use these measures, we are
required to provide specific related disclosures. Those disclosures can be found on Devon's website.
As many of you know, I'm retiring from Devon at the end of this week. I can honestly say that being a part of this
organization for the last 21 years has been both a pleasure and a privilege. I'm truly grateful to all my friends at Devon
and in the investment community and the industry for making my time here so rewarding, so thank you.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to John Richels. John?
John Richels
Well, thank you, Vince, and on behalf of the company and the many people you've positively impacted over your
career, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you. You've done a terrific job through the years and you've been a
great friend, and we wish both you and [ph] Marty (3:19) a very happy and healthy retirement.
Now, as many of you know, with Vince's retirement, Howard Thill has joined our team as Senior Vice President of
Communications/Investor Relations. Howard has a long history in the business with over 30 years of experience, the
last 12 in much the same role at Marathon Oil and previously at Phillips Petroleum. We're very fortunate to have an
individual of Howard's experience join our team, and we welcome Howard to Devon. I'm sure that many of you will
have the opportunity to meet with Howard over the coming months.
So, let's move to the results for the quarter. The second quarter was another outstanding one for Devon, both
operationally and financially, as we continued to successfully execute on our strategic plan. As we point out on Slide 3,
during the quarter, we announced the sale of our non-core U.S. assets, the final piece of our portfolio transformation.
Since announcing this planned transformation just nine months ago, we have taken three very significant steps to
reconfigure our portfolio: the accretive Eagle Ford acquisition, the unique and innovative EnLink transaction, and the
sale of our non-core properties at very attractive prices.
Also during this time, our drilling program has delivered impressive oil production growth through our focus on our
reconfigured portfolio. This oil-focused effort helped to deliver a 47% increase in cash flow this quarter compared to
last year's second quarter. And during the period, we also completed a number of major projects that we'll discuss in
more detail during the call.
So, let's take a look at some of these highlights in a bit more detail. Looking at Slide 4, in the second quarter, we
achieved year-over-year oil production growth of 34% from our go-forward asset base, reaching an average daily rate
of 205,000 barrels per day. This growth was driven entirely by light oil production from our retained U.S. assets, which
increased an impressive 79% compared to the second quarter of 2013.
This dramatic increase in U.S. oil production is largely attributable to growth from our world-class operations in the
Permian Basin and in the Eagle Ford. With the aggressive transformation of our North American onshore portfolio,
total liquids production is expected to approach 60% of Devon's go-forward production by year-end, and that's up from
just over 30% a few years ago.
As shown on Slide 5, our focus on high-margin oil developments increased our companywide oil revenue 42% in the
second quarter, compared to the previous year, and accounted for more than 60% of our total upstream revenue. This
strong revenue growth, combined with our low cost structure, has expanded our pre-tax cash margin per barrel by 40%
year-over-year.
As shown on Slide 6, and as I mentioned earlier, we announced the $2.3 billion sale of our non-core oil and gas
properties in the U.S. during the second quarter. This transaction valued these gas weighted assets at approximately 7

times EBITDA, significantly above our current trading multiple, thereby making it immediately accretive to Devon's
shareholders.
Combined with the sale of our Canadian conventional gas business earlier in the year, which is also at about 7 times
EBITDA, pre-tax proceeds from our non-core asset divestiture program totaled more than $5 billion. We're applying
these proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing the debt taken on to fund our Eagle Ford acquisition.
This portfolio repositioning provides Devon all the necessary attributes to deliver superior per-share growth. Our
go-forward assets are generating excellent full cycle returns, we have a strong investment-grade balance sheet, and we
have a deep inventory of highly economic, low-risk development projects in some of the most attractive basins in North
America.
As you can see on Slide 7, this formidable and balanced portfolio consists of three world-class oil development plays in
the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford, and the Canadian oil sands and two of the best liquids rich gas areas in the U.S., the
Barnett Shale which is nearly 30% liquids production, and the Anadarko Basin which is about 45% liquids. We also
have two emerging oil plays which could further bolster the depth of our portfolio, and we have a majority ownership
in EnLink Midstream, one of the premier midstream companies in North America.
Turning to Slide 8, with the first six months of 2014 results now in hand, our retained asset portfolio remains on track
to deliver companywide oil production growth of more than 30% year-over-year. This exceptional oil growth rate is
driven entirely by the 70%-plus increase we expect in U.S. light oil production. This should drive about 10% top-line
production growth on a 6:1 energy equivalency basis; and on a value or a price equivalency basis, applying a more
realistic oil to natural gas price ratio of 20:1, expected top-line production growth in 2014 would be approximately
20%.
Moving to Slide 9, I'll remind you that about 80% of our 2014 E&P capital budget is focused on our core and emerging
oil development opportunities, which will continue to drive our oil production growth in the second half of 2014 as
well as next year. As you can see on the table to the right of that slide, year-to-date we have spent just under half of our
2014 capital budget.
With large, high-quality acreage positions in each of our core assets, we're positioned with a deep inventory of
repeatable investment opportunities. In fact, as we discussed on our call last quarter, one of the most exciting
operational developments over the past several months has been the significant expansion of our drilling inventory and
our resource potential in these high-margin core areas. Led by the tremendous results that we're seeing in the Delaware
Basin, our gross risk undrilled inventory has now increased by more than 5,000 locations year-to-date. These
5,000-plus locations have been rigorously risked based on historical well performance, in-depth technical evaluations,
and disciplined economic expectations based on the current price and cost environment, just to mention a few.
As we continue to de-risk and develop the opportunities within our portfolio, we fully expect our inventory to further
increase over time. In fact, with the technical work that we've done over the last quarter, we have increasing confidence
that we can materially grow this inventory in the near future, and Dave will speak to this in more detail later.
Not only do we have a very large resource base, but we also have the financial capacity to efficiently convert this
resource into production and cash flow. Our balance sheet is in terrific shape and our operating cash flow continues to
accelerate, thanks to our rapid oil growth, driving margins higher. And don't forget that another potential source of cash
for Devon is the ability to drop down additional midstream assets to EnLink.
As seen on Slides 10 and 11, two potential drop down candidates are the Access Pipeline in the Canadian oil sands, and
the Victoria Express Pipeline in the Eagle Ford, both of which were recently completed. These strategically located
assets have exposure to two of the fastest growing oil plays in North America. While no decision has been made, these
high-quality pipelines could be dropped into EnLink within the next year or two.
Given the visibility of our significant cash inflows, coupled with a high-margin asset base ready for development, we
expect to accelerate drilling activity in 2015 across several of our core and emerging plays.

As you can see on Slide 12, Devon is positioned to deliver organic oil production growth in excess of 20% in 2015
while delivering a healthy top-line production growth in the mid single-digits. The Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin
will once again lead our oil production growth in the U.S., and we will also see significant oil growth from our Jackfish
3 project in Canada, where we recently started steam injection.
In summary, we're very pleased with the execution and outcome of the transformative steps that we took over a
relatively short period of time to high-grade our portfolio and meaningfully improve our growth trajectory in margins.
When you combine the growth potential of our top-tier oil development projects with our high-quality natural gas
optionality, we're very well positioned for competitive growth for years to come, and as we execute on our growth plan,
Devon's shareholders will continue to benefit from improving margins, higher cash flows, and further value recognition
through EnLink.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed operations review. Dave?
David A. Hager
Thank you, John. As John mentioned, our solid execution in the quarter resulted in strong oil production growth,
driving an impressive increase in our operating cash flow. We are laser focused on the key drivers of outstanding
operational performance, including driving down drilling times, optimized completion designs, and very efficient
production operations. Continuous improvement in each of these areas, and others, will provide incremental value in
each of our operating areas.
Now, let's take a closer look at some of Devon's key operating highlights in more detail. In the Permian Basin, we
increased production 25%, compared to the same quarter last year, to 95,000 BOE per day. The solid execution of our
development programs in the Permian plays is firmly on track to grow 2014 production by 20% compared to 2013.
Importantly, wide oil production accounts for nearly 60% of our total Permian volumes.
Shown in the green outline Slide 13 is the Bone Spring playing in the Delaware Basin, a key driver of our Permian oil
growth. In the second quarter, we brought 22 new Bone Spring wells online with average 30-day IP rates of 660 BOE
per day, once again exceeding our pre-drill expectations. At an average cost of just over $6 million per well, our Bone
Spring program is delivering some of the best returns in our portfolio.
We also have an ongoing Delaware Sands program that is beating expectations. In the second quarter, we commenced
production on two high-rate oil wells targeting the Delaware Sands in Lea County, New Mexico. Initial 30-day
production from each of these two wells averaged about 1,000 BOE per day, 70% of which was light oil.
As we discussed last quarter, the tremendous results from our Delaware Basin drilling programs, coupled with the
ongoing reservoir characterization work, allowed us to substantially increase our risked undrilled inventory. The stack
pay nature of our position in the Delaware Basin provides us with exposure not only to the Bone Spring and Delaware
Sands, but also the Leonard Shale, Wolfcamp, and several other oil zones. In aggregate, our multi-zone potential in the
Delaware Basin provides us with exposure to more than 5,000 risked undrilled locations.
Turning your attention to Slide 14, I want to be clear. This inventory of 5,000-plus locations is not simply acreage
divided by an arbitrary well spacing. We screen these locations based on multi-variant analysis that takes into account
geologic, geophysical, completion, and production data that characterize and predict reservoir performance. This
disciplined methodology is utilized across our entire portfolio, including the Delaware Basin, to identify and quantify
undrilled inventory.
Slide 15 provides a summary of the risking applied to each of our prospective zones in the Delaware Basin. In the
second column, our technical teams have identified net prospective acres in each formation in the Delaware Basin.
Next, the multi-variant analysis I just described was performed by our technical teams, which risked these prospective
acres by as much as 50%.

Now there is insufficient data to do a multi-variant analysis on downspacing. So, you can see we conservatively
assumed only four to five wells per drillable section in each formation. Given that, we believe there is meaningful
upside to our inventory. For example, we are currently implementing a program in the Delaware Basin that utilizes a
much larger and more focused frac design to deliver a more complex fracturing network closer to the well bore.
We believe these larger, more complex frac designs will more effectively drain the reservoir, increase recovery factors,
and further enhance rates of return. In conjunction with these larger, more complex, focused fracs, we are evaluating
the concept of a staggered lateral development scheme that can further tighten well spacing across our entire
prospective formations in the Delaware Basin, and thus could significantly increase our risked undrilled inventory. We
will continue to update you on our progress in the coming quarters.
Converting this massive and growing opportunity in the Delaware Basin into production and cash flow is a top priority
for us. While not finalized, our preliminary plan is to increase our operated rig count, from the 12 currently running in
the Delaware, to as many as 20 by the end of 2015. We plan to ramp activity in an orderly fashion as we secure
gathering and processing capacity high-quality rigs, completion services, and manpower to support the higher rig count.
This increased investment in the Delaware Basin will allow us to continue aggressively developing our highly
profitable Bone Spring inventory and accelerate the development and appraisal of our Delaware Sands, Leonard Shale,
and Wolfcamp inventories. This sets up the prolific Delaware Basin position for significant high-margin growth in
2015 and for years to come.
Shifting to the Midland Basin, we delivered another quarter of strong results from our oil development program in the
Southern Midland Wolfcamp Shale. We increased average net production in this play to 12,000 BOE per day,
representing a significant year-over-year increase of 9,000 BOE per day.
In the Northern Midland Wolfcamp trend, we spud our first horizontal well in Martin County, targeting the Wolfcamp
B Formation in the third quarter. We have approximately 14,000 net acres in the prolific Martin County area
prospective for multiple Wolfcamp zones. In aggregate, we have identified about 200 undrilled locations in the
Northern Midland Wolfcamp trend, and this is an area we're likely to see increased activity as we head into 2015.
Shifting to the Eagle Ford in Slide 16, while we have only owned these assets for a handful of months, we could not be
more pleased with the performance we have seen from this world-class asset, and we have already identified several
promising opportunities to further enhance well economics and boost our drilling inventory. I'll speak to this in more
detail shortly, but let's begin with a review of the second quarter results.
During the quarter, we had 17 rigs running across our Eagle Ford position, with the majority focused on developing our
DeWitt County acreage in the economic heart of this top-tier oil play. We brought 60 new Eagle Ford wells online,
with average 30-day IP rates approaching 1,200 BOE per day. These high-impact wells drove our average Q2
production in the Eagle Ford to 65,000 BOE per day, in line with the guidance range we provided last quarter.
Notably, we achieved this strong growth in spite of production interruptions, primarily related to third-party gathering
constraints in DeWitt County. In aggregate, these gathering constraints reduced production by about 8,000 BOE per
day in the quarter. Even with these infrastructure limitations, we were able to bring approximately 30 wells online
around mid-quarter that helped accelerate our average net production in June to 73,000 BOE per day. This ramp-up in
June represents an impressive increase of nearly 50% compared to the first quarter exit rate. It is also worth mentioning
that our Eagle Ford production is also delivering the highest pre-tax cash operating margin of any asset in our portfolio,
at around $60 per BOE.
Looking ahead to the second half of the year, our drilling and completion programs in the Eagle Ford remain on
schedule, keeping us on track to deliver outstanding production growth rates. As we have said before, this production
could be somewhat lumpy due to the timing of pad drilling and third-party midstream infrastructure.
At June 30, we had 108 drilled wells not yet producing. We expect this inventory to continue to trend downward over
the coming months as a number of pads are scheduled for tie-in and the necessary transportation system improvements
are completed in DeWitt County. As a result, for the remaining six months of 2014, we are forecasting our net Eagle

Ford production to average between 80,000 BOE per day and 85,000 BOE per day.
We expect both the third and fourth quarter to generate solid sequential quarter production growth, with volume growth
weighted more toward the fourth quarter due to the timing of pad tie-ins that I just mentioned. Overall, this second-half
outlook keeps us on pace to deliver on our previously announced guidance of 70,000 BOE per day to 80,000 BOE per
day for our 10 months of ownership this year.
As I touched on earlier, we are also excited about a number of potential upside opportunities we have identified across
our position in the Eagle Ford. In our development activity in DeWitt County, we are currently closely working with
our partner BHP to enhance various aspects of our well completions, as well as areas on the production operations side
of the business.
While it's premature to discuss any specific details, the technical teams have identified opportunities to optimize
completion designs that could increase well recoveries, and at the same time, reduce well costs. Teams have also
identified potential opportunities to improve the rates of return to optimize choke management. As we continue to
pursue these promising initiatives, we will continue to update you on our progress.
Moving to Slide 17, another leg of upside is in Lavaca County. In the second quarter, we tied in our first operated well
in Lavaca County targeting the lower Eagle Ford formation. As seen on the blue on the map, the initial 24-hour
production from the Ronyn 1H was approximately 1,600 BOE per day, of which 70% was light oil combined with
announced wells by industry represented in gray, lower Eagle Ford results to date in Lavaca County have exceeded our
initial expectations.
Turning your attention to Slide 18, perhaps one of our more exciting potential upside opportunities is in the upper Eagle
Ford. As shown by this isopach map, the majority of our DeWitt and Lavaca County acreage is highly perspective for
this emerging play. This is further supported by the encouraging industry results in Lavaca County, seen in gray on the
map. It is worth noting that these Lavaca County well results are not in the thickest part of the Upper Eagle Ford, which
as you can see from the map, bodes well for the prospects of our DeWitt County acreage where the Upper Eagle Ford
net pay is the thickest.
We have just spud our first operated Upper Eagle Ford well, the Medina 2H on 100% working-interest acreage in
Northeast DeWitt County. This can be seen in blue on the map. This is the first of a handful of tests planned this year.
If the Upper Eagle Ford formation is commercially successful, this could expand Devon's resource and further deepen
our drilling inventory.
On Slide 19, at our Jackfish Thermal Oil project in northeastern Alberta, gross production from our Jackfish 1 and
Jackfish 2 projects increased 3% year-over-year to a combined average of 60,000 barrels of oil per day, or 52,000
barrels per day after royalties. Further enhancing results, the significant improvement in the Western Canadian select
benchmark pricing increased price realizations at Jackfish by 22% compared to the year-ago quarter to $65.88.
At Jackfish 1, gross production averaged 36,000 barrels per day, or 29,000 barrels per day net of royalties, in the
second quarter. The success of our ongoing efforts to improve our steam/oil ratio once again resulted in gross
production exceeding the facility's nameplate capacity of 35,000 barrels per day.
In the third quarter, we will bring the Jackfish 1 plant down for a scheduled two-week maintenance turnaround
beginning in September. Accordingly, this maintenance downtime and subsequent ramp-up will reduce Jackfish 1
production by 5,000 barrels per day to 10,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. Keep in mind, this has been built into
our third quarter and full-year production guidance.
At Jackfish 3, we began steaming on July 13 and expect a steady ramp up of production over the next 18 months to a
sustained rate of 35,000 barrels a day. Jackfish 3 will provide multi-year oil production growth beginning in 2015, with
net oil production from our Jackfish complex expected to be between 62,000 barrels per day and 67,000 barrels per
day. This represents production growth of about 30% compared to 2014.
Furthermore, as seen on Slide 20, the completion of Jackfish 3 will begin an era of free cash flow from our Jackfish
complex with the potential to generate around $1 billion annually for many years, even after accounting for

maintenance capital requirements.
Shifting now to the Anadarko Basin in Western Oklahoma, where our operations continue to deliver great results. In
the second quarter, we have once again set a production record, reaching 93,000 BOE per day. With drilling focused on
our most liquid-rich acreage, oil and NGL production increased 26% year-over-year and is now about 45% of
production in the Anadarko Basin.
The Cana-Woodford play was the most significant contributor to our strong second quarter production growth in the
Anadarko Basin. This growth was driven by the strong performance of several new well pads brought online that
employed our new redesigned completions, as well as rejuvenated performance from existing wells as a result of our
ongoing acid treatment program.
Slide 21 shows a meaningful increase in sand per well along with more frac stages and tighter perf clusters. This new
frac design was utilized on the 20 Cana-Woodford wells we brought online in the liquids-rich core of the play during
the second quarter. Initial 30-day rates from these wells averaged 1,250 BOE per day, including 700 barrels of liquids
per day, exceeding our type curve by more than 35%. These are among the most productive wells ever drilled in Cana,
with average EURs trending in excess of 1.5 million equivalent barrels per well.
As you can see on Slide 22, for the 20 wells we brought online in Q2, the redesigned completions dramatically
enhanced IPs, boosted EURs by more than 15%, and with well costs essentially flat. This translates into strong rates of
return that are competitive with many U.S. oil plays.
Our asset team at Cana have also done some outstanding work to revitalize production from existing wells with acid
treatments. We have now treated nearly 200 operated and non-operated Cana wells, and the results have been
exceptional. In most cases, this inexpensive procedure, around $250,000 per job, took production per well from about 1
million cubic feet equivalent per day up to 2 million a day or more.
As seen on Slide 23, these acid jobs have improved our gross operated wet gas production at Cana by roughly 40
million cubic feet a day. We expect about 1 Bcf per well of additional recovery, with a payback period of less than
three months. We have around 140 additional operated and non-operated wells that can be treated in the core area, and
we expect to have most of these treated by year end.
Moving to Slide 24, given the success of these recent efforts at Cana, we opportunistically bolstered our leasehold
position in May by acquiring an additional 50,000 net acres in the core of the play. This transaction closed in late June,
increasing our total Cana-Woodford position to approximately 280,000 net surface acres with stacked pay potential,
including about 30,000 net acres of exposure to the stack oil and condensate window. The new acreage further
supplements the thousands of undrilled locations we have in this high-quality liquids-rich play.
Due to the highly competitive economics at Cana, we plan to accelerate activity in 2015. If you were to include the
non-operated activity of our partner in the play, our total rig count at Cana could be around 10 rigs by the first quarter
of 2015. This increased activity puts Cana in a position to deliver strong growth for many years.
Moving to Slide 25, we have approximately 150,000 net surface acres in the Powder River Basin prospective for
multiple formations, including the Parkman, Turner and Frontier. To date, we have identified approximately 1,000
risked locations across our Powder River Basin position, with roughly 75% of these locations associated with the
Parkman formation. Our recent drilling activity was highlighted by two wells targeting the Parkman formation in
Campbell County, Wyoming. Initial 30-day production at each of these wells averaged 950 BOE per day, of which
95% was light oil.
At an average well cost of only $5 million per well, our Parkman program is generating attractive rates of return. We
expect to add a fourth rig later this year and more aggressively develop the Parkman focus area in the second half of
2014 and 2015.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for the financial review and outlook. Tom?

Thomas L. Mitchell
Thank you, Dave, and good morning to everyone. To reiterate John and Dave's comments, the second quarter was one
of strong execution. We delivered operationally by successfully exploiting the high-margin production opportunities
within our portfolio and we also delivered solid financial results as well.
Our strong growth in oil production, combined with improved oil price realizations, drove our E&P upstream revenue
to $2.7 billion in the second quarter. These factors increased oil sales to more than 60% of our total E&P revenue in the
quarter, pushing overall upstream revenue 20% higher than the year-ago quarter.
Not only are our upstream revenues growing rapidly, but our midstream profitability is expanding as well. In the
second quarter, our midstream business delivered excellent results, generating $224 million of operating profits. This
result exceeded the top end of our guidance range and represented a 90% increase compared to the second quarter of
last year.
The year-over-year increase in operating profit was driven by the consolidation of EnLink Midstream and improved
marketing margins. Based on our outstanding results in the first half of the year, we are increasing our full-year forecast
for midstream operating profit to a range of $775 million to $825 million, an increase of roughly $80 million from the
midpoint of our previous guidance.
Moving to expenses, in the second quarter, total pre-tax cash costs were well within our guidance range for the quarter,
coming in at $1.1 billion. Excluding the costs associated with the consolidation of EnLink, pre-tax cash costs for our
upstream business were 7% higher than the second quarter of 2013. Of this amount, a third of the cost increase was
attributable to higher operating costs associated with Devon's rapidly growing high-margin oil. The remaining increase
was driven by higher production taxes related to our strong revenue growth. Looking to the second half of the year, we
expect modest upward pressure on our pre-tax cash costs, and this is reflected in our 8-K guidance that will be filed
later on today.
Overall, the benefits of our high-margin oil production, improved price realizations, and low-cost structure significantly
expanded our pre-tax cash margins. In fact, our pre-tax cash margins improved by 40% year-over-year to our highest
level in recent history.
Moving to the bottom line, our strong second quarter performance delivered adjusted earnings of $574 million, or $1.40
per diluted share, a 16% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This improved profitability also translated
into higher cash flows as well, and we generated cash flow from operations of $2 billion, a 47% increase compared to
the year-ago quarter. Combined with $2.8 billion of pre-tax proceeds received from the sale of the company's Canadian
conventional gas business in April, Devon's total cash inflows for the quarter reached $4.8 billion.
In late June, we repatriated the $2.8 billion sale proceeds from Canada. We utilized these funds of free cash flow
generated during the quarter and cash on hand to reduce debt by $3.2 billion during the quarter. At June 30, our net
debt declined to $10.8 billion, of which $1.7 billion was attributable to the consolidation of EnLink Midstream and is
non-recourse to Devon.
If you were to pro forma the balance sheet for the closing of our U.S. divestitures, which should occur in the next few
weeks, our net debt, excluding EnLink's debt, decreased to around $7.5 billion. So, to put this in better perspective, this
is only around 1 times 2014 expected EBITDA and this positions our go-forward Devon with a strong
investment-grade credit rating across the board and one of the better balance sheets in the E&P space.
Moving to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect our go-forward asset portfolio to continue to demonstrate
excellent year-over-year growth in oil production. With average daily oil rates ranging from 200,000 barrels per day to
210,000 barrels per day, this guidance implies an expected 30-plus per cent increase in oil production from our
go-forward properties compared to the year-ago quarter.
We expect to achieve this excellent growth in spite of the planned turnaround at Jackfish, which will limit production
by 5,000 barrels per day to 10,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. Overall, we expect our go-forward asset portfolio

to deliver total production in the range of 603,000 BOE to 627,000 BOE per day, and this represents a top-line growth
from our retained assets of more than 10% compared to the third quarter of 2013.
Based on our solid execution during the first six months of this year, we remain very comfortable with our previous
full-year guidance ranges for production. For the full year, we're on track to average more than 600,000 BOE per day
from our go-forward business, driven by a full-year oil growth rate in excess of 30%. And finally as a reminder, we will
file an 8-K later today containing detailed estimates for the upcoming third quarter and for the full-year 2014.

Thank you. Operator, we're ready for the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Your first question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open.
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: Good morning, guys, and congratulations, Vince, on a great career.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Thanks.
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: I wanted to look at Slide 15, Dave, and just talk about each of the objectives you
highlighted to get to the risk factors. Can you just give us, like, what was the number-one or the number-two objective
in the Delaware, Leonard, Bone Spring, and other, just to get to the 30% to 50% risk factors?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, it was – the primary things you have to look at, David, we looked at everything. But you
look at the prospectivity of the area based on all the well results you have, and then you also apply what we call a
drillability factor. Can they physically be – can the locations physically be accessed with our acreage inventory. Those
are the two primary things we look at. Now, we also are looking at, obviously, historical production data to help it out,
and we all put it into what we call in a multi-varied analysis to remove bias. And this is a statistical analysis where
we're looking at, basically, trends in an unbiased manner that correlate with prospectivity. Now, it doesn't totally
substitute for good technical work, but it's an additive to that. But the – those are the main things you're looking at,
traditional things you're used to, David. It's just good geoscience work combined with reservoir work and production
history.
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: And I guess where I'm going is, you get more production history in the Leonard than
in the Bone Spring Sands. Do you expect those risk factors to move up with well performance? Or how do things trend
over time?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, the way this table is constructed, we hope the risk factors move down actually.
Because--
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: Yeah, fair enough.
<A - David A. Hager>: The lower is the better, the way we constructed the table. Yeah, absolutely, as we get more
data, we expect these risk factors to go down. And I think the biggest thing we expect to move up, perhaps, is this
column that's risked wells per section, because that's where we simply don't have enough data to do this kind of
multi-varied analysis because there hasn't been a lot of wells that have been drilled, six wells per section or eight wells
per section, in order to get a good history on. So, in this case, we didn't really do that detailed statistical analysis. We
just made what we think is a very conservative assumption. And as we conduct these pilots, which we're doing right
now, we think there's great opportunity that we may increase from the four to five wells per section to more wells per

section. But we just want to get some pilot information before we do that.
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: And then, just thinking about that and leading to the 5,000 that likely grows, what's
the optimal kind of inventory life as you think about the Basin? Like, relative to the number of wells you drill per year?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, the way we think about it is we generate as many as we can, obviously. Then we try to
click as many rigs to work as we feel that we can and maintain the quality of our drilling results. So, if there's – if we've
identified a huge new resource inventory, that's great news. But then we've got to think about it, what can we actually
execute and deliver the results with the risk that we perceive in the Basin. So, I don't know if there's an optimum. I
mean, I would love to have 100 years' inventory than a totally theoretical standpoint. But what we're trying to do is
increase the pace of our drilling commensurate with our ability to de-risk the area. And we're confident we're going to
be able to get somewhere around 20 rigs next year and we're thinking higher than that internally, but we've got to walk
before we run, and so, we'll see where it goes.
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Vince, congratulations, and also welcome [indiscernible] (44:14); we're looking
forward to having you back in the saddle again.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Thanks.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: If I could take two question, please. First of all, Dave, on the Eagle Ford, just to be clear, I'm
assuming you had no inventory in the Upper Eagle Ford in your initial analysis when you acquired GeoSouthern. And
if that is the case, can you give us some ideas based on those [indiscernible] (44:38) number of third-party wells that
have been drilled in the Upper Eagle Ford? From what you know today, what would you say about – at what proportion
of your acreage is prospective and anything you could say about how that might change the inventory count? And
another follow-up, please.
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we had none of this in the inventory at the time we did the acquisition. We gave zero
value to the Upper Eagle Ford, so this is all additive from a value standpoint. As you can see from the isopach map that
we included in the presentation, we think the bulk of our acreage is prospective for the Upper Eagle Ford. The key is
that there is an ash zone that develops that we think that will contain the fracs that have been done in the Lower Eagle
Ford from penetrating into the Upper Eagle Ford and when we talk Upper Eagle Ford, there are a couple of different
Upper Eagle Ford intervals, just so you guys know. There's an Upper Eagle Ford shale and there's an Upper Eagle Ford
marl. What we're really talking about is the Upper Eagle Ford marl, which some might call the Lower Austin Chalk,
but it's a marl zone. It's very mappable.
We think the bulk of the acreage is developable for that. How much that adds at this point – or we think it's potentially
is developable, we need to get more well results before we can quantify it too much. And frankly, where we're drilling
right now in Lavaca County, may or may not be the best part of it. The best may be in DeWitt County.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks for that. My follow-up is I guess kind of a Cana question, but it's also kind of an activity
question: 5,000 locations with ten rigs; obviously, I'm missing something here. What proportion of those 5,000
locations falls into the category of the enhanced frac that you described obviously yourselves and Cimarex? And how
does this basically change capital allocation as you move forward in terms of future activity level? I'll leave it there.
Thanks.
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, this is a – we may go higher than that. That's a fair enough point, Doug. There's a recent
development with these improved completion designs that are really enhancing the Cana economics. So, we are
allocating rigs back out there. We obviously want to see that we've been drilling in what we think is some of the best
part of the play. Not all of it is going to necessarily quite as good as this, but we think it's still going to be very good, so

we're going to see where these results are, where they take us. It's possible that we may continue to ramp the rigs up
well beyond the 10 that I mentioned in my previous comments.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thinking more about the overall portfolio, Dave, in terms of given the strength of the balance
sheet, is there a point – I mean, how do you see acceleration generally across the portfolio? It seems like your inventory
is building on pretty much every play now.
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, John may want to answer to this, too, but we obviously every year put together a
long-range plan where we try to balance our ability to execute on the portfolio and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
And so, this is part of the capital allocation process that we're going through right now as we speak about where we
want to end up on that. And I think the good news is we're in great financial shape after these transactions. John, do you
want to add to that?
<A - John Richels>: And, Doug, the one thing, as Dave said, we're in great shape, and we'll have to see – we haven't
reported our budget for next year, we're still going to be working on that. I think the really important thing is with the
transformation that we've undertaken over the last while, we have put ourselves in the position to be able to live within
cash flow and still grow at very, very competitive rates. Whether we choose to do that or not is another question. We
may well, based on our outlook and based on industry conditions and basin conditions, choose to accelerate that in the
future as well.
What's important is we've got the financial capability to do it. In some of the areas, we – or in all of our areas, we want
to make sure that we don't get ahead of the science, we don't get ahead of the geology, we don't get ahead of
infrastructure, organizational capacity, availability of rigs and services and all of those kinds of things. Those are all
other items that factor into the pace that we can accelerate at. But I'll tell you, we're all real excited. We're in a position
that we haven't been in for a while of being able to significantly grow the really high-margin products and generate
high levels of cash flow. So, we feel pretty good about where we are right now.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: That's a good story. Thanks, John.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Operator, next – go ahead.
Operator
Your next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - David A. Hager>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: I wanted to follow-up on the CapEx point you were just discussing. Can you just talk to how
you're thinking about CapEx for the remainder of the year? And then, since you did provide some preliminary oil
growth expectations for 2015 within the context of cash flow and your 2014 budget, how should we preliminarily think
about 2015 levels of spending needed to achieve 20%-plus oil growth?
<A - John Richels>: Well, just for the – this year, we haven't changed our guidance for the year, Brian. I think we're
on the Street at 5% to 5.4% for our E&P capital spending and that's assuming costs remain the same, but we'll see how
that all sorts out. But – and here we are halfway through the year and we've so far spent about 47% of our total CapEx
budget for the year. So, we're kind of – we're on track for this year.
When we talk about 20% growth in 2015 between – the 20% growth in our oil production in 2015, we've done that
based on our expectation for cash flow for next year. So, again, as I said earlier, whether we – as we finish developing
our budget and take all of these other factors that I mentioned when I was replying to Doug into account, where we
actually end up with our capital budget in 2015 remains to be seen, but that 20% number is assuming that we're living
within) cash flow.

<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Got it. Thanks. And then, shifting back to the Delaware, the acreage position that you have
through New Mexico and Texas probably puts you in a very good position to comment on the quality of the oil and the
impact of condensate as you continue to drill in various zones in various parts of the play. Are you seeing any increased
condensate coming out of your wells? Is it impacting your realizations? And what are you expecting there going
forward?
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Yeah, Brian; this is Darryl. In the Permian Basin, what we have seen pretty consistently is a
quality of crude between 38 degrees and 42 degrees. The vast majority of that is less than 0.005% sulfur, so it's
classified as weak crude. There have been individual wells that we have drilled where we have seen the gravity go up
as high as 45% to 46%, which has not been consistent throughout all of our wells. There have been some other industry
players that have also seen gravity that high. Depending on the volume from industry that comes out at that 45 degrees
to 46 degrees gravity, it's pretty well blended in the other crude out there that's in the 36 degrees to 40 degrees, so we
really don't see at least in the foreseeable future that we're going to have any condensate problems coming out of the
Permian Basin.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Great. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Thank you. Dave, I wanted to see if you can elaborate on your plans to increase your rig count
in the Delaware from 12 to 20, and maybe you could just opine on where your technical understanding is of the play
versus a year or two ago, and just your confidence in executing a program of that size?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah. Well, I think our technical understanding has increased pretty significantly. As we have
appraised across our entire acreage position, that has now put us into a position now that we have a pretty good
understanding of what the prospectivity is across our entire acreage position. There's always a risk when you drill
wells, so it's not an absolute. But I'd say our technical understanding, because we have been appraising across the entire
acreage position, certainly in the Bone Springs is there.
Now we may still need to drill additional wells and we haven't listed an inventory in the Wolfcamp and there haven't
been many drilled on the New Mexico side in the Wolfcamp, so that's an area that still takes some additional maturing.
But there's no question that overall, and in some of the other formations such as the Leonard obviously, we haven't
drilled that many wells. We're drilling our first one right now. But the industry has, so we've got a pretty good handle of
what's going on there. So, from a technical standpoint, most areas are maturing. That is – it's really a little bit less on
the technical side.
It's more just getting – making sure we have several factors working together to execute, and we're confident we're
going to get there. But the issue would be to make sure that we have the high-quality rigs and services that are
available, we have the gas takeaway capacity, and we have the infrastructure in the field from just a pure manpower
standpoint to manage this kind of rig capacity. And so, we're working through all those issues, and we're confident
that's going to allow us to do 20 rigs next year, sometime next year.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Okay. And just my follow-up, John, what are your longer term thoughts regarding the Pike
development and the regulatory approval process on that project?
<A - John Richels>: Well, we filed the application for a 105,000 barrel a day project with BP about the end of last
year. So, we've been going through the process, and it's moving along very well. We have some consultations with
some groups that are left, but it's moving along really well, and it's our expectation that we'll get the regulatory
approval for that project probably late this year or early in 2015. So, it's moving along really well.
And of course, we still have, as you know, we haven't made the final sanctioning decision on that yet, but it's something
we'll have to do this fall. But it's moving along. And Pike is – that was an area that was always appealing to us because

it's directly adjacent to Jackfish, and Jackfish is in what looks to be the sweet spot of the oil sands for SAGD
development. So, it's a pretty good looking lease.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Well, John, just a quick follow-up. Given the Delaware Basin opportunity, Cana-Woodford,
Rockies Oil, how would Pike now compete for capital relative to your U.S. Onshore growth potential?
<A - John Richels>: That's a good question. It's a project that has very, very different characteristics. So, if you just
wanted to compare it strictly on a rate of return basis, it doesn't compete as well because you'll be putting some capital
up front, you get this long stream of cash flow over a longer period of time. So, they're very different projects. The
good part of it is there's very, very low geological risk, very low engineering risk. You've got this flat production
profile for 20 or 25 years, and an extremely high cash flow stream that comes with that. So, really, the characteristics of
it are quite different.
And we've always thought that having a portfolio that's balanced in some way, not only between natural gas, natural
gas liquids and oil, we kind of like that balance between light oil and heavy oil, too, because they trade very differently
over time and because they have these different characteristics. So, those are all things that we have to take into
consideration in making that decision. It's kind of balancing the near-term versus the longer term aspects of those two
kinds of – or two different plays.
<A - Vincent W. White>: We've got time for one more question.
Operator
Your next question comes from Subash Chandra with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Subash V. Chandra>: Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of questions. I guess first on Pike again.
The Access Pipeline, is that sized for Pike, or does it have to go through additional expansion for Pike?
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: This is Darryl. And, yes, it is sized for Pike; actually, it's sized for both Jackfish and Pike.
And it does have the ability with additional pump stations to increase capacity significantly. We currently have about
270,000 barrels a day of capacity on the blended stream, and like I said, with additional pump capacity, we can increase
that volume for that pipeline. So, all of those things have been taken into consideration.
I might just add, the Access Pipeline looping the 42-inch line was completed end of the second quarter early third
quarter, and we're now in the process of line filling that line. So, it should be operational towards the end of this year.
<A - John Richels>: So, Subash, those volumes that Darryl was talking about, that's really much more than we – I
mean, that expansion capability with the extra pumping is actually much more than we need for Jackfish and Pike.
<Q - Subash V. Chandra>: Okay. So, it's in excess of those as well. Okay. And then, in Cana, the 10 rigs, is that – are
we still six to eight operated and the balance non-op?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, the six to eight – if we do the six to eight operated, we really said around 10 by the first
of the year. If we do the full six to eight, which we – as I was explaining to Doug Leggate, we may do that and we may
do more. That would actually be – get us above the 10 rigs if we do that, given how--
<Q - Subash V. Chandra>: Okay.
<A - David A. Hager>: Cimarex is doing. And we – and there's a good chance we will do that. We're just saying by
the first of the year we'll be around 10.
<Q - Subash V. Chandra>: Okay. But combined op, non-op?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes. That's right.
<Q - Subash V. Chandra>: And any commentary just if you can refresh me on the status of the drilling carries and
where you sort of see the intercompany rig movements take place over the next six months?

<A - David A. Hager>: Well, I'll start off with the rig movements. There's not a lot of rig movement going on. We are,
as we described, increasing our activity a little bit in the – already in Cana, and so, we're dropping down the activity a
little bit in the Mis for that. We'll be adding a little bit on the – in the Powder, as I described. But overall, not a large
movement in rigs in the last half of this year. We will be ramping up, though, as we go into 2015.
Now, on the carries, on the Sinopec side, as of June 30, there is about – just over $500 million remaining of the $1.6
billion carry. And on the Sumitomo side, there is $345 million remaining of $1.25 billion total drilling carry. At around
the end of the year, we think we'll be down to the point on the Sinopec side where we'll be about a little over $150
million left, and just under $150 million left on the Sumitomo side if we utilize in 2015.
<Q - Subash V. Chandra>: Perfect. Great. Thank you very much.
<A - David A. Hager>: Thank you, Subash.
John Richels
Well, folks, I'm showing the top of the hour here. But before signing off, let me leave you with a few key takeaways
from today's call. First, we have dramatically improved our portfolio in a short period of time. Devon emerges with a
formidable portfolio that's on track to deliver attractive high-margin production growth for many years to come.
As evidenced by our second quarter results, our pursuit of high-margin production is significantly expanding our
margins and profitability. And finally, the commitment to our top strategic objective that you've heard us talk about
often, which is to optimize long-term growth and debt-adjusted cash flow per share, has never been stronger. As we
deliver on our growth expectations, we're poised to create significant value for our shareholders in the upcoming years.
So, we look forward to talking with you again on our next call, and thank you for joining us today.
