MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Q4 2012 ConocoPhillips earnings conference call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator
for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. You may
begin.
Ellen R. DeSanctis
Thank you, Christine, and good afternoon to all our participants today. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year
2012 conference call.
Today, you're going to hear from three of our executives. Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO, will make some brief
opening and closing comments to cover the full year 2012 results and some priorities for 2013. Jeff Sheets, our EVP
and CFO, will review the fourth quarter and the full-year financial results, including our segment financials. And he'll
be followed by Matt Fox, our EVP of Exploration and Production. Matt will review our year-end reserves performance
and provide some color on E&P activities for the fourth quarter for each of our segments.
Please note that today's presentation materials can be found on our website. A transcript of this call will be also posted
later today, we hope, if not by tomorrow.
And then as a final reminder, on page two of our presentation deck, you'll find our Safe Harbor statement. We will be
making some forward-looking statements this morning. Results could differ materially from the expectations we share
today. And we've described those uncertainties and risks to our future performance in our Safe Harbor statement and in

our periodic filings with the SEC.
With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to Ryan Lance.
Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me kick off the meeting today
with a review of our key 2012 highlights and accomplishments.
And certainly, the strategic highlight of the year was the spinoff of our downstream business, Phillips 66, which
occurred in May. And following that transaction, we emerged as North America's largest independent E&P company.
And we set out to combine our world-class assets, technology, financial strength, and workforce with an intense focus
on the E&P business. And we laid out an ambitious goal to achieve both growth and returns while offering a
compelling dividend, and we remain committed to that goal.
Achieving this goal depends not only on executing our identified growth programs, but on executing a major divesture
program to high-grade our asset base. And during 2012, we made significant progress on this program. We completed
asset sales of $2.1 billion and recently announced agreements for an additional $9.6 billion of dispositions. These
proceeds will give us the flexibility to fund our significant growth programs over the next few years.
And a key part of our ongoing value proposition is to maintain a focus on our shareholders. We achieved strong
shareholder returns during 2012, especially combining the performance of ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66. That
strategic performance was matched with strong operational results. We met our volume targets in 2012, achieving a
total annual production rate of 1.578 million BOE per day, with growth on a continuing operations basis. And we're on
track to deliver the plans we laid out in April of last year.
We recognize that 2013 would be a low point in production, and we expect growth in the fourth quarter due to major
project startups and continued ramp-up in our North American drilling programs. And this sets us up for our long-term
3% to 5% growth objective.
We grew our reserve base to 8.6 billion BOEs, and organic additions this year were 942 million BOE, and that
represents a 150% reserve replacement rate, a significant achievement for a company our size.
Throughout the year, the business ran well. Our major projects and drilling programs performed as expected. And
importantly, we built momentum in both our conventional and unconventional exploration programs, and these are key
to creating long-term value in this business.
For the full year, we generated $6.7 billion of adjusted earnings, or $5.37 per share from continuing operations. And we
generated $14.7 billion in cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital.
We returned over $8 billion to our shareholders, $5.1 billion of share repurchases and $3.3 billion in ordinary
dividends. Our per-share performance for the year reflects roughly a 10% reduction in share count compared to 2011.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, let me take a moment to acknowledge the hard work and the dedication of our
ConocoPhillips workforce. Despite a year of major change, they maintained their focus on the business and they
delivered on all fronts. And I'm very proud of their performance and their commitment to our strong start as an
independent company.
So I'll come back with some concluding remarks, so let me now turn it over to Jeff for the financial review.
Jeff W. Sheets
Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a review of our fourth quarter financial results on slide
four.

We reported adjusted earnings $1.76 billion, or $1.43 a share, for the fourth quarter of 2012. The special items this
quarter that we excluded from our reported earnings in the determination of adjusted earnings included some asset
impairments, certain tax items and legal settlements, as well as adjustments for discontinued operations. These
adjustments totaled $329 million. And the details can be found in the supplemental data that we provided with the
earnings release.
As a result of the announced agreements to sell our interest in the Kashagan field and the Algeria and Nigeria business
units, we have treated earnings and production associated with these assets as discontinued operations for the current
quarter as well as previous quarters. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter from these assets would have been $27
million during the quarter, or $0.02 cents a share. And our adjusted earnings per share would have been $1.45 without
this change.
The earnings chart and realized price data on this slide now reflect continuing operations for all the periods. And except
where we specifically noted, this is going to be our convention as we go through today's call.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, adjusted earnings were down by 14%, primarily due to lower liquids prices
and higher heating expense, which was offset primarily by higher volumes. Per share earnings in this year's fourth
quarter benefited from a 7% reduction in share count compared to last year's fourth quarter.
Compared to the third quarter, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were up 3% due to higher volumes and a slight
improvement in realized prices. Production volumes for the quarter met our targets. We achieved solid performance
across most of the portfolio and resumed production in several segments following the third quarter planned
maintenance. So year over year, our average realized prices for the quarter were down about $3 a barrel but up about $1
third quarter compared to fourth quarter.
Bitumen and NGL prices declined during the year and remained weak. In the fourth quarter, bitumen represented about
7% of our production in North America. NGLs also represented about 7% of our worldwide production. Clearly there
has been a significant amount of volatility in price markers through the year. But if you look across our overall
portfolio, realizations were relatively stable.
Finally, operating costs came in about as we expected them for the year.
Now turn to slide five, and I'll review fourth quarter production performance. This waterfall takes you through the
changes in production from the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the current quarter. You can see the split here of
production from continuing operations and from discontinued operations. And I'll step through the key items here, and
Matt is going to provide some additional details in his material.
Total production from continuing and discontinued operations was 1.607 million BOE per day in this year's fourth
quarter, which was in line with our expectations. So starting at the left of the chart and stepping through the waterfall,
dispositions reduced production by 55,000 BOE per day compared to the fourth quarter last year. And those 2012
dispositions included Vietnam, the Statfjord and Alba fields in the North Sea, some Western Canadian assets, and the
NMNG [NaryanMarNefteGaz] joint venture in Russia.
Down time accounted for 40,000 BOE per day of lower production compared to the downtime experienced in last
year's fourth quarter. And the downtime primarily occurred in Nigeria, the UK, and some in the Lower 48.
Natural field declines were about 152,000 BOE per day. And finally, shown in the green wedge on the chart is a growth
wedge of 257,000 BOE per day of incremental production compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The largest
component of this growth wedge is new production from our Lower 48 Eagle Ford and Bakken plays and new
production from our Canadian oil sands developments; improved drilling programs and performance across our
portfolio; the resumption of full production in Libya; and some incremental volumes from the Peng Lai field in China
also contributed to growth in production.
On a continuing operations basis, production for this year's fourth quarter was 1.566 million BOE per day compared to
1.483 million BOE per day in last year's fourth quarter when you adjust that quarter for dispositions. So this represents
6% growth overall. Additionally, liquids as a percent of our portfolio from continuing operations increased between the

two periods.
So if you turn to slide six, we'll cover some production guidance for 2013. On the left of this chart is our 2012 total
production of 1.578 million BOE per day. I want to take you through some of the adjustments that will result in a
normalized 2012 production number, reflecting production from only the assets that we expect to be in our portfolio for
the entirety of 2013. First, we back out 51,000 BOE per day for discontinued operations, which again are the assets in
Algeria and Nigeria. Next, we remove 17,000 BOE per day, which is the 2012 production generated by the dispositions
that were closed during 2012.
And earlier this month, we also announced the sale of our Cedar Creek Anticline assets, which we expect to close late
in the first quarter of 2013. So in our analysis, we back out a final 13,000 BOE per day, which represents the
production from this asset during 2012. So the resulting 2012 production of 1.497 million BOE per day represents the
normalized view of the production performance of our go-forward assets.
So our 2013 outlook for production from these assets that will remain in our portfolio is a range of 1.475 million to
1.525 million BOE per day. Now in the first quarter, we expect to still have Algeria, Nigeria, and Cedar Creek in our
portfolio. Therefore, we have provided you with an all-in first quarter production outlook 1.58 million to 1.6 million
BOE per day, which includes about 40,000 BOE per day for discontinued operations.
The second and third quarters of 2013 will be negatively impacted by both normal seasonality and planned
maintenance. But additionally, with some new projects coming on later in the year, we'll have downtime associated
with project tie-in. And then we expect fourth quarter 2013 production to return to levels near the first quarter total
production, as new projects coming online make up for the removal of production from discontinued operations. Now
this is consistent with prior guidance that we've given around hitting a production low point in the second or third
quarter of 2013.
Now I'll turn to the segment slides and begin with the Lower 48 and Latin America, which is on slide seven. Production
in this segment was 475,000 BOE per day this quarter, an increase over prior periods, as we continue to ramp up
production in our Lower 48 shale plays. Segment production increased 13,000 BOE per day, or 3% sequentially, and
31,000 BOE per day or 7% compared to the same period a year ago. But more importantly, liquids production grew
20% versus the fourth quarter of 2011.
We reached a significant milestone during the quarter in the Eagle Ford. Production exceeded 100,000 BOE per day on
a peak daily basis, and averaged 89,000 BOE per day. In addition to the Eagle Ford, year-over-year growth was
achieved from unconventional drilling in the Bakken, new wells in the Permian, and improved well performance and
optimization in the San Juan Basin.
While natural gas prices have recovered to levels closer to those in the fourth quarter of 2011, the weakness in crude
and NGL prices drove earnings lower year over year, and fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $157 million.
Next, we'll move to the Canada segment on slide eight. In the Canada segment during the fourth quarter, production
was 281,000 BOE per day, up 1% sequentially. And production was up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, and
this reflects five consecutive quarters of growth from our oil sands assets.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, liquids in this segment increased 23%, and natural gas production declined
7%. And overall, the portfolio mix shifted to 51% liquids from 44% liquids a year ago.
This segment generated positive earnings of $32 million during the fourth quarter. Earnings benefited from both higher
production and stronger natural gas prices, and these factors more than offset the impact of lower bitumen prices when
compared to the third quarter. The weaker bitumen prices were the key driver in lower year-over-year earnings. We
expect bitumen prices to remain weak for another quarter or so until additional heavy refining capacity comes online.
So now let's move to the Alaska segment on slide nine. Production in Alaska was 222,000 BOE per day, up 46,000
BOE per day compared to the third quarter. And this increase was primarily due to production coming back online
following the completion of the major turnarounds in the third quarter. Production volumes were down about 6% from
the fourth quarter of 2011 to 2012, primarily just due to normal field decline.

Sequentially higher production resulted in higher sales volumes, and this earnings benefit was partially offset by higher
production related costs, including petroleum production taxes and DD&A. Segment adjusted earnings for the quarter
were $595 million.
So for segments like Alaska that are subject to lift timing differences between sales and production in any given
quarter, we've now added a red line on these charts, which represents quarterly sales compared to quarterly production,
so this should help illustrate these timing differences. While these timing differences net out over time, they do create
quarterly earnings volatility. So in this quarter, there was virtually no impact, no timing impact for lift timing in Alaska,
but prior quarters have been impacted.
So for example, if you look back in the fourth quarter of 2011, sales were nearly 40,000 BOE per day less than
production, which resulted in lower earnings relative to the production level. Then we had the opposite effect in the
third quarter of 2012, when sales exceeded production, and that contributed positively there to earnings.
I'll turn now to slide 10 and talk about the Asia-Pacific and Middle East segment. Asia-Pacific and Middle East
continued to perform well during the quarter, providing important diversification to our portfolio. Production in the
segment was 322,000 BOE per day, up 16,000 BOE per day or 5% sequentially and up 32,000 BOE per day or 11%
compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily due to the resumption of Peng Lai production, but
we also had new production from the Gumusut project in Malaysia and the Panyu growth project in China.
As you can see from the production chart, production exceeded sales this quarter. This impacted segment earnings, as
earnings reflect sales volumes rather than production. We should also see a positive impact to the first quarter of 2013
earnings from the reversal of these timing effects, all other things being equal.
Sequentially and year over year, earnings reflect the impact of lower realized LNG prices, which are linked to the
Japanese Crude Cocktail, or JCC, prices. And these price impacts were partially offset by the benefits of higher sales
volumes.
Europe is the next segment, found on slide 11. Production from the Europe segment was 216,000 BOE per day, an
increase of 25,000 BOE per day. This increase primarily reflects the resumption of production following planned
downtime at Britannia and J-Block during the third quarter. This quarter's volumes were negatively impacted by
unusually high unplanned downtime in the southern North Sea and the East Irish Sea during the fourth quarter.
Compared to the fourth quarter of a year ago, production declined due to normal field decline, unplanned downtime,
and dispositions.
Sequentially adjusted earnings of $388 million benefited from improved sales volumes and continued strong pricing in
the segment.
As a reminder, like the Asia-Pacific segment, this segment provides important pricing diversification in our portfolio,
and future earnings should benefit significantly from major project startups that are underway. These projects will
mitigate declines and bring attractive margins with the growth.
And I'll cover our final geographic segment, the Other International segment, on slide 12. This segment is presented on
a continuing operations basis; so it excludes Kashagan, Algeria, and Nigeria, which were previously reported in the
segment. So the assets that are now in this segment include Libya, Russia, and our activities in Angola.
Fourth quarter 2012 production from continuing operations was 50,000 BOE per day, up 26,000 BOE per day from the
same period last year. Now this increase is driven primarily by Libya coming back online, which more than offset the
impact of the NMNG divesture.
The final reporting segment I'll cover is Corporate and Other, which is on slide 13. Adjusted corporate expense during
this year's fourth quarter was $177 million, resulting in a full-year adjusted corporate expense of $813 million. the
full-year performance was a little better than our expectations. As you recall from our update last quarter, the third
quarter benefited from licensing revenue as well as from favorable FX impacts.

During the fourth quarter, we issued $2 billion of debt at attractive interest rates, and we used the proceeds from this
issuance to pay down commercial paper and other maturing debt.
If you turn to slide 14, I'll cover our operating segment margins and returns. The previous charts have discussed
segment results on a quarterly basis, and on this slide we show annual results for some key financial metrics.
Adjusted earnings declined from $8 billion in 2011 to $6.7 billion in 2012, primarily the result of lower prices,
particularly for North American natural gas and NGLs and Canadian bitumen. And also we were impacted by lower
production levels, which were primarily the result of our ongoing asset sales program.
On a per-share basis, adjusted earnings declined to a lesser extent, from $5.75 to $5.37, as a result of the lower share
count due to the $5 billion of shares repurchased in 2012.
Our return on capital employed, or our ROCE numbers, trended lower along with adjusted earnings, with capital
employed growing slightly from 2011 to 2012 as we make significant investments to generate future production and
margin growth.
Cash contribution per BOE and income per BOE were also impacted primarily by changes in commodity prices. And
we expect to see these cash contributions per BOE numbers to grow significantly over the next several years as we add
production from assets with higher cash margins than the average of our current portfolio.
And next I'll step through the company's 2012 cash flow on slide 15. So just a quick comment about this waterfall; it's
shown as if Algeria and Nigeria and Kashagan were part of continuing operations to provide some better comparability
to analyst cash flows and our CapEx guidance.
On this basis, we generated cash from operations of $15.2 billion excluding work from capital changes in 2012, which
were a $1.3 billion use of cash. And we also generated $2.1 billion of proceeds from asset dispositions. We funded a
$15.7 billion capital program, and about $800 million of that was capital associated with Nigeria, Algeria, and
Kashagan. The $5.5 billion source shown in the waterfall is discontinued operations related to the spin of Phillips 66,
which includes a special distribution and all the other cash flows related to Phillips 66.
Moving to the right on the waterfall, we repurchased $5.1 billion of our shares and paid $3.3 billion in dividends, so
over $8 billion in total distributions to shareholders in 2012. And debt and other of $600 million includes some deposits
we received from our recently announced asset dispositions.
So summing it across, we ended up 2012 with $4.4 billion of cash and restricted cash. And also just to note on the slide
on the upper right inset box, our year-end debt was $21.7 billion, which represents a debt to capital of 31%.
So that concludes the review of the financial results. And I'll turn the call over to Matt now for an update on our
operations.
Matthew J. Fox
Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone.
I'll begin the operations section with the company's 2012 reserve replacement performance. We ended 2012 with just
over 8.6 billion BOE of reserves, up 3% overall compared to 2011. Importantly, we added 942 million net BOE of
reserves organically, resulting in an organic reserve replacement rate of 156%.
Of the total reserve additions, 497 million barrels came from Canada as a result of project sanctions in the oil sands.
The Lower 48 was the second largest source of organic reserve additions, with 293 million barrels, and these were
principally added from our Eagle Ford and Bakken unconventional programs and our Permian conventional programs.
Over 100 million barrels were also added across the Asia-Pacific segment.
Our all-in reserve replacement rate was 142%, and this takes into account the impact of dispositions completed during
the year that reduced reserves by 83 million BOE.

We'll provide more detail on the reserve performance, including the costs incurred, in the forthcoming 10-K. But
suffice it to say we are really pleased with these results, and we believe that our 40-plus billion barrel resource base
holds significant future potential to be converted from resource to reserves over the coming years.
Now I'll review our operating segments and provide some detail on our drilling programs, growth projects, and
conventional and unconventional exploration activities. I'll cover some highlights from the fourth quarter and also
update you on current activities and what to expect in the near future.
Overall, our plans remain on track, and the business continues to run well, so please turn to slide 17 for a review of the
Lower 48 and Latin America segment. Performance in this segment is dominated by our ongoing success in the
unconventional plays, especially the Eagle Ford. In 2012, the Eagle Ford achieved 70,000 BOE per day of annual
average production and averaged 89,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter. As Ryan and Jeff already mentioned, we
also achieved a milestone of over 100,000 BOE per day of peak daily rate in the fourth quarter. This is a tremendous
accomplishment and a credit to our entire Eagle Ford team.
During 2012, we had up to 17 rigs drilling the play. Late in the year, we began to adjust the rig count due to improved
drilling efficiencies and a growing backlog of uncompleted wells, and we exited the year with 11 operated rigs.
We drilled 211 operated wells in 2012, and we now have a total of 313 wells online. In addition, we have 87 wells
drilled waiting on completion and 40 wells completed and awaiting tie-in. Completing and connecting this backlog of
wells is a key focus on 2013 along with achieving held-by-production status. We expect to complete the drilling phase
of acreage capture by mid-2013, and we will reach full held-by-production status by year end. During the year, we'll
gradually phase into 100% pad drilling in the play, with full pad drilling expected in 2014.
On the infrastructure side of the business, we currently truck virtually all of our light crude barrels from Eagle Ford, but
we're working diligently to access connections to pipelines for direct sales. In addition, we're actively adding
infrastructure such as stabilization facilities that will remove light ends, allowing us to get our light crude barrels to
pipeline spec and maximizing our captured NGLs.
Recently in the Eagle Ford, we and the industry have been experiencing inconsistent and higher than normal back
pressures in the gas gathering systems, which have created variability in our daily production rates. We expect these
constraints to be significantly reduced over the coming months.
Moving to the Bakken, we produced 24,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter, and we exited the year with nine rigs
operating in the play. In 2012, we completed a total of 187 operated and non-operated wells. We have 34 operated
wells waiting on completion and 14 wells ready to tie in, and we continue to be excited about the future of this play.
In the Permian, we hold a really strong legacy conventional position. In 2012, we averaged 50,000 BOE per day from
our conventional assets, and we added 98 operated wells and 50 non-operated wells to production.
In the Permian, we're also testing several unconventional plays in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Notably, in 2012
we drilled nine wells in the Wolfcamp with encouraging results. We also completed a 3D seismic survey across our
Midland Basin acreage, and we expect to continue drilling and testing Permian unconventional plays in 2013.
We haven't talked much about our activity in the Niobrara unconventional play, but we now hold about 130,000 net
acres in what we believe is a sweet spot comparable to the Wattenberg area. About half of this acreage was added in the
fourth quarter. And as shown on the map, there's a contiguous position that provides scale benefits and development
flexibility going forward.
We drilled six Niobrara wells in 2012 and recently completed a new 3D seismic survey across our existing acreage.
This is a developing play and production results to date are encouraging, and it will be an important part of our
exploration and development program going forward. We'll provide more detail at our analyst meeting in February.
Moving to the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to grow our deepwater possession there. During the quarter, we were
awarded 28,800 acres in the central Gulf of Mexico lease sale. And we were also apparent high bidder for 348,000

acres in the western Gulf of Mexico lease sale. These additions bring our current deepwater possession to over 1.9
million acres, making us the sixth largest acreage holder in the Gulf. I'm not sure everyone recognizes just how
substantial a possession we have developed here.
Currently, we're drilling two partner-operated wells in the deepwater, Coronado and Shenandoah. Hummer, a low-cost
fireman, was declared a dry hole in the fourth quarter. We expect to spud our first operated well in 2013, the Thorn
prospect, which will be an exciting milestone for the company.
Finally, we announced the sale of our Cedar Creek Anticline asset for over $1 billion. This was an opportunity to divest
a declining conventional asset that didn't compete for capital in our portfolio. We expect this transaction to close in the
fourth quarter.
So please go to slide 18 and we'll talk about the Canada segment. Our Canadian oil sands assets continue to operate
extremely well. Weaker bitumen pricing this quarter has impacted margins, but operationally these assets are delivering
strong volume growth. Our oil sands production exceeded 100,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2012, making
us the second largest SAGD [Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage] producer in the oil sands. Currently we're executing
seven major projects across our FCCL joint venture and Surmont. We recently sanctioned Narrows Lake Phase A and
Christina Lake Phase F while progressing construction on the large scale development of Surmont Phase 2.
Moving to our Western Canada business unit, we continue to focus our drilling activities on the liquids-rich and light
oil plays in our portfolio. Currently we're running 16 rigs, drilling on our held-by-production acreage that are focused
on liquids proven plays such as the Montney, Glauconite, and Cardium. We're also testing other unconventional
exploration opportunities within and outside our core areas in Western Canada. For example, we're currently drilling in
the Duvernay play, where we have 112,000 net acres. We drilled and completed one horizontal well recently and are
currently drilling a second well. We have three additional wells planned for this year.
We also have drilling underway in our 120,000 net acre position in the Muskwa play in the Horn River area.
Finally, in the Canol play in the Central Mackenzie Valley, we have 216,000 net acres. We plan to drill two vertical
wells early this year to test the significant potential of this oil shale play, and we have two additional horizontal wells
identified for drilling next year.
In summary, our Canada segment continues to operate extremely well.
So let's finish out the North American segments with Alaska on slide 19. Full Alaska production resumed in the fourth
quarter following successful third quarter turnarounds, and this segment continues to generate steady performance for
the company. And it's benefiting from development innovations using coil tubing drilling, or CTD, and 4D seismic that
are helping to offset natural fuel declines. For example, in the fourth quarter we drilled what we believe is the first-ever
octo-lateral CTD well. That's a well with eight different horizontal sections that was guided using a high-quality 4D
seismic survey.
In the fourth quarter we sanctioned the Alpine West CD5 project and expect production to start up in 2016.
As we've mentioned before and you've seen in the press, we're working with other producers in Alaska to evaluate
LNG exports from the North Slope. The producer group has been evaluating development concepts and assessing the
cost of major project components for various alternatives. And completion of this phase of work is targeted for the first
quarter.
We continue to invest around $1 billion a year of net capital for maintenance activities and infield exploitation
programs across the North Slope. And we could make other significant investments in Alaska, but they will require
more competitive state fiscal terms.
Let's move to slide 20, the Asia-Pacific and Middle East segment. Our Asia-Pacific and Middle East operations are
running well, and we're progressing several major projects in this segment. This is an area of significant growth for us
over the next five years, with most of the growth coming from Malaysia and APLNG. In Malaysia, we achieved first
oil from Gumusut in November, utilizing an existing floating production, storage, and offloading facility at the Kakap

field. This facility will be used until our dedicated floating production system is completed later this year. We expect to
reach peak production from Gumusut in 2014.
In early October, we also sanctioned the Malikai project, where we expect first production in 2017. And development
activities are also underway in the Siakap, North Petai, and KBB [Kebabangan] products. Also in Malaysia, we
recently executed a production sharing contract [PSC] for exploration Block SB311, offshore Sabah. This block covers
about 250,000 acres, and we are the operator with a 40% working interest. The PSC has a three-year exploration period
with a work program of seismic and two exploration wells.
In China, Peng Lai averaged 43,000 BOE per day of net production during this quarter. In the Panyu, we brought on
nine growth wells if the fourth quarter. The growth development remains ahead of schedule, and we expect to add
about 8,000 BOE per day between now and 2014 as we drill additional wells from the two new platforms. And this new
production is expected to more than offset decline at Panyu.
Also in China, we recently announced a joint study agreement with Sinopec to assess shale gas opportunities in the
Qijiang Block in the Sichuan province. The block covers an area of approximately 1 million acres. And the study will
be carried out over two years, including seismic and drilling obligations.
In Qatar, we secured new long-term LNG sales commitments in the fourth quarter, and we now have about 80% of
QG3 [Qatargas 3] LNG production linked to crude prices under long-term agreements.
In Australia, our APLNG project remains on schedule, and we intend to provide a more fulsome update on the
development of APLNG at the February analyst meeting.
On the exploration front, drilling continues in Australia. In November, we spudded the Zephyros-1 well, the second of
a five-well appraisal program at Poseidon. And in the Canning Basin, we're drilling a second exploration well to test
this 11 million-acre position. So this is very active segment for us just now and we're excited about the development
and exploration opportunities here over the next several years.
Please turn to slide 21, and I'll provide an update on our Europe segment. In Europe, we're focused on progressing our
major projects in the UK and Norway. Operationally, the UK had a challenging quarter due to unplanned downtime in
the East Irish Sea, the southern North Sea, Britannia, and Clair. This downtime accounted for an average of 23,000
BOE per day that was offline in the fourth quarter. The East Irish Sea is still shut in awaiting onshore facilities
upgrades that should be completed in the second quarter.
On a positive note, our Katy field he in the southern North Sea was completed in December, and gas production came
online in January. We expect peak rate production of about 5,000 BOE a day from this field.
In addition in the UK, the Jasmine and Clair Ridge developments are in execution, with first production at Jasmine
expected in the second half of this year. First production at Clair Ridge is targeted for the second half of 2016.
Moving to Norway, the Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II projects are progressing as planned. Ekofisk South, the topside
structural deck sections are being completed, and first production is expected at the end of this year. Eldfisk II is also
on track for production startup at the end of 2014 or early 2015. These projects are running smoothly, and our base
operations in Norway continue to perform well.
Finally, in Poland, we're continuing our exploration drilling program in 2013 as operator in our three Peri-Baltic
western concessions. Just to note, we have significant downtime in 2013 within this segment, as we tie in our new
projects to the Ekofisk and J-Block production platforms. However, we expect to exit the year with very strong growth
from these developments.
The final segment I'll cover is other international on slide 22. There was a lot of activity in this segment too during the
fourth quarter. We announced sales agreements for Kashagan, Nigeria, and Algeria. We expect these transactions to
close in the middle of this year. On this slide, we've shown 2012 average production rates and year-end 2012 reserves
for these assets.

During the fourth quarter, Nigeria was severely impacted by flooding in the Niger delta, as you can see in this lower
picture. The flooding began in late October, and fourth quarter production was impacted by about 13,000 BOE per day.
And first quarter production will also be impacted by this flood related downtime.
In Angola, we secured a rig for our plans to drill four exploration wells starting in 2014. The seismic results in our
Angola blocks are really encouraging, and we look forward to getting underway on drilling in this significant and new
exploration opportunity.
I'll conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating the themes you've heard consistently this morning. We are focused on
safely executing our base business while successfully funding our growth program. We're seeing the benefits of our
conventional and unconventional exploration programs, and we continue to progress on major projects across the
globe.
Now I'll turn the call over to Ryan for some closing comments.
Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Matt. So please turn to slide 23 for some summary comments. I'll conclude today's remarks with a quick
review of our 2013 priorities. These are not going to be a big surprise, as they're a continuation of the priorities we set
for ourselves during last year.
Our highest priority is to focus on safety and operations excellence. This is an imperative and it's a priority we take to
heart at ConocoPhillips and throughout the company.
We made significant progress on our strategic divesture program in 2012, but we still have work to do. Importantly, we
have to complete and close these divestitures, which are expected to generate about $9.6 billion of proceeds. And these
proceeds will largely be directed toward executing our drilling programs in our major growth projects.
As we've told you throughout the year, we have identified projects in hand and underway that will materially change
the growth trajectory of our company over the next few years, and it's important that we execute on these activities. It's
also important that we advance our exploration activities globally in both our conventional and unconventional
portfolios. 2013 and 2014 are important years for testing the opportunities that we've captured.
And certainly last but not least, we'll maintain our commitment to shareholders by continuing to offer a unique value
proposition that delivers growth, margins, and a compelling dividend.
Finally, a reminder; we'll have our first analyst meeting as an independent E&P company in New York on February 28.
And at that meeting, we'll provide more detail on our company's plans for the future and our long-term priorities for
value creation.
So thank you for listening.

<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Yes, hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could clarify the 2013 production guidance. It
looks like it's going to be relatively flat, and certainly the market seems a little disappointed today in that number. But
going back to your previous slides from last year, you did show a dip in expected production in 2013 internationally
and growth in the Lower 48 and North American production. So can you just clarify what's going on with production
and how you see it, this being a bottom in the year? And I have a follow-up after that.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thanks for the question, Faisel. I think the production guidance is really pretty similar to what
we've given in the past. We knew that 2013 would be the low point in our production for the year. So I'm not sure what
additional guidance we can have other than what we've given on the call at this point. What we're trying to do is just
make it clear, now that the asset disposition program has become a little bit more into focus than it has been in the past,
just what the production levels are going to be from the assets long term, going to be part of our portfolio long term.
And that's what we're trying to lay out with this production guidance this morning.
I think part of the – we anticipated being pretty successful in our asset disposition program, so we're probably at the
high end of what some people have probably had in their models for the amount of production that's going out on
dispositions as well.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Let me jump in here quickly. This is Ellen. I appreciate, again, the question. If you look at
what we had in April for 2012 and what we had in April for 2013 and you average it over a couple of years, it ends up
being that we were – that the timing of divestitures actually ends up slipping from 2012 a little bit to 2013. So if you
look at it on a couple-year basis, it ends up being really right on guidance.
I think a way to think about this is exit rate to exit rate. Think about 4Q this year, the number Jeff provided, the 1.510
million BOE per day that had the noise out of this quarter compared to the fourth quarter. To get to the guidance we've
provided, it will be very significant growth quarter over quarter 2013 to 2012. We'll provide all these updates at the
analyst meeting. But I think of it as – or think of it as the divestitures stayed in the portfolio in 2012 a little bit longer,
and exit rate to exit rate is going to be higher because of the timing startups, the project startups.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes, that's an important point is that we are going to start seeing production growth in 2013,
particularly late in the year when we have startups happening in the North Sea and the continued ramp-up in oil sands
and we continue to ramp up in the oil shales, plus the startup of projects in Malaysia.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, great, and just one other question. On the capital program, it looks like, reading the fine
print on slide 15, that roughly $800 million in capital was associated with the asset divestitures at 2012. Is that roughly
the same number in 2013?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: It's probably a little lower than that in 2013. But really much depends upon when the assets
actually end up leaving the portfolio. So all through the year, we're going to need to be giving updates on how we see
the capital program playing out this year.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, and last question from me. Bitumen prices were extremely low in the fourth quarter. Is
there any plan for you guys to try to evacuate that production by other means and pipelines to get a higher realization?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I think, Faisel, over the long term, there will be moves to alternative markets for bitumen from
the Canadian oil sands. I think that's a strategic imperative of the Canadian government, not just the oil companies
working the oil sands, so we will see that happening over time. Of course, the short-term issue we're facing now is very
much associated with refining constraints, like at BP's Whiting refinery. So we don't expect these very wide
differentials to be sustained for more than the next few months. But in the long term, other markets will be developed.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Faisel.

Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks, good morning, everybody.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Doug.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I have a couple of quick ones, please. Jeff, you gave us the earnings numbers associated with the
discontinued ops. But I guess to Faisel's point, it looks like there was over $800 million of spending associated with
those assets. Can you help us with the operating cash flow impact, and if you could clarify whether or not the $15.7
billion, $15.6 billion – $15.7 target for this year for spending assumes the asset sales are out for the whole year, or if
that number is much higher if you base it with the latest sales until the end of the year? And I have a quick follow-up,
please.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Doug, the operating cash flow numbers, so the discontinued operations are Algeria and Nigeria.
And I don't think we have – we're not going to be disclosing particular operating cash flow numbers for each of those
segments. The capital is mostly development of Kazakhstan during – the number that was in 2012. I think that was
probably half to two-thirds of the number that was in the $800 million.
As far as what's in for 2013, we are pursuing a lot of different capital projects with fairly heavy spend, and there are
going to be several things that could impact what our capital program ultimately ends up being in 2013 as we execute
on those projects, and timing of dispositions is really just one of those items. So we've assumed certain timings. But as
I said in the answer to the last question, we're just going to need to be continually updating that as we see the year
develop.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks, Jeff. My follow-up I guess relates to the exploration program. Just to put some context
around this. Jim [Mulva] had spent the last decade trying to secure resources and build up a very large drilling
inventory of gas. And obviously, there was a lot of spending to achieve that. But now you're in a position where you're
still underfunded relative to your CapEx and your dividends, but you're spending $2 billion to $3 billion in exploration.
Can you help us with the logic of why that's the right thing at this point given the $1.5 billion write-off in 2012, why
that's the right strategy at this point given that you should have theoretically had a lot of resource? And I'll leave it
there, thanks.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes, Doug, this is Ryan. I think as we look out and think about the future opportunity, I think
with this unconventional revolution that we're seeing in North America right now and some of the technology advances
in the deepwater arenas that are becoming pretty prospective, it has, in my view, turned from a bit of resource scarcity
that was leading to a lot of merger synergies over the last 10 or 12 years and resource capture into a view now that the
resources aren't so scarce and there's a bit more abundance, certainly on the unconventional side in North America,
what the technology is doing to improve the oil sands performance in Canada, and then what innovation and
technology has done on the deepwater side. And we just think that growing organically, there's the opportunity set to go
do that. And the option value associated with growing organically is – we found better in our portfolio than trying to do
that through an M&A channel or some resource access that way. So we think it's important for the long-term growth.
What the last 10 years did for this company is create a 40-plus billion barrel resource base, and we're investing in that
resource base right now. As we look forward into the future over the next 10 years, we see the exploration and the
organic growth being more a driver to our other growth and development of the company.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I appreciate the answer, Ryan. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Doug.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: My question is on the mix shift that appears to be underway at the company; meaning
besides better profitability in the United States, it appears that there are going to be some positive mix effects overseas
too. And on this point, my question is whether the earnings from the discontinued operations, which I think were listed
as close to zero for 2011 and 2012, were the actual clean operating numbers. And also, do we have any updated
information on the tax implications of the $10 billion of proceeds from those sales? Maybe what I'm trying to get to is
what is the approximate earnings loss in return for the $10 billion of pre-tax proceeds that you're likely to receive?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: The fourth quarter was a challenging – again, so disc-ops is Algeria, Nigeria, and the Kashagan
asset, which of course is not in operation yet, so there's not income or cash flow from these assets. So the adjusted
earnings, as we mentioned, from these assets were $0.02 a share, $27 million during the fourth quarter. That was
probably a particularly low number, though, because of the impact that Matt talked about on the flooding in Nigeria
impacted Nigerian operations. But they weren't significantly higher than that in the previous quarters in the year also.
We generate cash flow a little bit higher than income in those, but we're also reinvesting capital as well. It's a long way
of saying, Doug, that we don't really anticipate that moving those assets out of our portfolio would change our cash
flow from operations very significantly.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: And, Jeff, do you have any insight for us on the tax implications of these divestitures,
meaning you highlighted $10 billion of sales proceeds? Do you know what the cash proceeds might be?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yes, the cash proceeds are going to be close to the numbers that we've highlighted. These
transactions are generally going to be very tax efficient.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Great, that's a great way to create value. And I also have a question for Ryan. Ryan, you
spent a lot of time in Alaska, and it seems like there's movement on a new fiscal regime up there. So my question is
whether or not you feel that this most recent movement is real; and if so, whether or not the investment opportunity
could be meaningful for the company.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes, I do. I think I had conversations with Governor Parnell over the course of last year
leading up to the session that started in January here in Alaska. And he understands the lack of competitiveness and the
fact that the current taxing system really takes away a lot of competitiveness out of the Alaskan opportunities up there.
So I think he's serious about trying to push something through the legislature. I think he has proposed some fiscals on
the oil side. He has put a proposal out there. I don't think – it's going to be a tough haul through the legislature, but I
also think that people are noticing. And we've said as a company that we would be prepared to ramp up our investment
if it got more competitive with the changing fiscal system in Alaska. Part of that's tied, I think, to the work that we're
doing on ANS [Alaska North Slope] gas as well and progressing the work on a potential LNG project, so part of that is
tied into some of this as well. But I'm probably slightly encouraged, but it's a long way until May when the session
ends.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Great, thanks a lot.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thank you.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Doug.

Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Hi, good morning, everyone.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: I'm sorry to be confused about this. But if I look at slide six, and you may have well explained
this and I apologize, but the normalized 2012 is 1.497 million BOE per day.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Correct.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: And the outlook is 1.475 million to 1.525 million BOE per day. Is that the comparable number
that we should think about when we're trying to get to your 3% volume target that we were looking for? I think the
point is that the idea was in order to balance cash against dividend and CapEx, cash in against dividend and CapEx,
you'd be growing volumes and margins at around I think it was 3% per year each. Shouldn't I just be looking at that
normalized number and then looking at the outlook and wondering where's the 3% growth?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I think we've been – or we've tried to be clear in all the presentations that we've given that the
3% to 5% is a multiyear target and that 2013 would probably be the low point in our production going forward. We still
feel like the 3% to 5% production growth long term is the right measure for us.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Okay, so I guess the point that you previously made is that I shouldn't be thinking about 2013
growth. I shouldn't have to think about 2013 growth.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: 3% to 5% we always characterized as off the low point.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: You'll begin to see evidence of production growth as we roll in towards the end of 2013.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yes, and that's the higher margin Malaysian barrels that will begin the road towards the cash
in/cash out balance.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: It's that. It's also the startup of the Jasmine project in the UK, and then the startup of projects in
Norway as well combined the continued ramp-up in the Lower 48 and in the oil sands.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Just to change tack slightly, and you may want to wait for the analyst meeting to talk more
about this, but there's an open question right now about business models amongst big oil and whether or not global
deepwater type operations and activity really sit well with U.S. unconventional. Can you give your perspective on the
business mix, particularly a business mix of this scale which is so differentiated in terms of its sheer size against any
other E&P? Thanks.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes, that's a good question. I think as we look at our portfolio, we've been doing this for quite
some time as a company. We've got large project capacity and capabilities, so we've got the capacity to make and
execute these large projects globally around the world. And we've also got a business model that really at its basis is
multifunctional integrated teams. And we've had a separate Lower 48 organization for the last number of years that has
demonstrated its ability to run and execute an exploitation model or a manufacturing model.
So when I look at the organization, Paul, I look at a group where we can compare ourselves to the smaller
independents. Whether it's Eagle Ford or Permian or Bakken, we look across the fence line and we're competing and
we're in a low quartile position relative to how those folks are executing their plans. And then we have the capacity to
build very large projects around the world whether it's LNG, oil sands, deepwater projects off Sabah or in the Gulf of
Mexico here at home. So I think it adds the diversity, the diversification. The global part of the portfolio just adds a lot
of capacity in something that we're interested in. So we like the mix of high deliverability and scalable resource, and
that's what we're building in the company.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Okay, thanks very much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Yes, good morning, everyone. Just coming back to the longer-term growth, I guess this
1.8 million barrels per day in the longer term is still intact as the shale and the international projects come on stream in
2016.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: That's correct.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: That's correct.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: And then how many rigs do you have running in the Permian for this year?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: In the Permian, I'm not sure how many we have running in the Permian. But right now we're
focused in the Permian on two things, our conventional developments. There's a significant amount of activity going on
in conventional. And we have one or two rigs that are drilling up testing the unconventional plays in the Midland and
Delaware Basins. The exact rig count I don't have off the top of my head in the Permian.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: On conventional, we've got – we exited with four rigs running, and as we've announced,
we've got rigs running testing some of the unconventionals as well. But that would be – we ran – that's about our run
rate for the year, four to five.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: And when I look at the 1.8 million BOE per day, how much roughly in volume terms are
you including, say, from the Permian from this Niobrara sweet spot or from the Canada non-conventional plays that
you're testing this year?
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: We'll go through all that, Ed, at the analyst meeting. We've shown you throughout the year
our production, our multiyear production levels from all our segments, and we'll provide that as well as a bit of a deeper
dive into our sub play production outlook as well. So if you can hold on to that, I would appreciate it.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: I'm trying to gauge when I look at the 1.8 million BOE per day, how much additional
shale upside there is beyond the 1.8 million BOE per day. But I guess I'll have to wait for that until the Analyst Day.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: There's a lot of upside depending upon the pace of the program is the way to think about it.
What we have in here right now – what we've had since April is actually we've laid it out pretty carefully. It assumes
the capital. It assumes a steady ramp in these, and so what remains is how quickly do we go at these programs.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: We'll feed you more in February, Ed.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Great, and then on the disposals side, obviously great execution so far. And I guess with
the cash receipts coming in, there's no pressure to be aggressive on some of the Canadian oil sands or further equity in
APLNG. But I just wondered if there was any update on the timing of those potential sales, whether they were still in
your thought process.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thanks, Ed. No, we still continue to look for options to dilute at APLNG and probably reduce
some of our Canadian oil sands exposure. We have a very large position up there that we know we won't move forward
developing some of that 100%. So no, we're still looking at those options but haven't obviously announced anything
yet.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Okay, thanks very much.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Kate Minyard of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Hi, good morning, everyone; just a couple of questions, the first one just for
clarification in terms of just modeling the year going forward. I know you talked about the downtime in 2Q and 3Q and
also have indicated you'll give some more clarity around the 2013 production guidance at the late February analyst
meeting. But can you just talk a little bit about in terms of modeling the quarters out correctly, maybe the extent of the
downtime in some of the regions in 2Q and 3Q? Are there any countries where we'll be looking at assets being offline
for an entire of either of those quarters? Or can you give us a sense as to the magnitude of the dip in some of the
regions?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, the area or the segment where we have the biggest differential of downtime compared to
normal activities is in Europe. And it's associated with tying in the new growth projects, Ekofisk, Eldfisk, and Jasmine.
So for example, at Ekofisk, we're going to see about 30% more downtime than we usually see, so maybe 28 days of
downtime at Ekofisk. At Eldfisk, we'll see close to two months of downtime for the brownfield activity that needs to go
in to tie in Eldfisk II. And then at J-Block, where we're tying in the Jasmine project, we're going to have over a month
of downtime there, whereas typical downtime would be about 14 days at J-Block. So the differential downtime is
mostly in Europe and associated with these tie-ins. Is that helpful, Kate?
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Yes, that is very helpful. Thanks very much. And then just looking at some of the
margin growth going forward, you've talked about margin improvement across the portfolio coming from factors such
as mix shift and controllable costs. We also saw a cash margin contribution on a per-BOE basis that declined about – I
guess almost 10% or so from 2011 to 2012. I know a lot of that is related to lower natural gas pricing, lower NGLs, and
lower bitumen in North America. But can you talk about the factors that would be driving the further cash margin
improvement? How much of those factors actually manifested what you were able to control as we move from 2011 to
2012 that may have just been robbed by some of the commodity price shifts, and what we'll be looking for in 2013 as
we look for an uptick in cash margins?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So cash margin growth very much is going to follow production growth because if you think
about what we're doing in our portfolio, we're adding new production in areas where the margins are higher than our
current production. So you haven't seen margin growth yet because you haven't really seen production growth yet. So
as we continue to add production in the Lower 48, as we add – as we start up LNG projects, as we start up the Malaysia
projects, as we start up these projects we were just talking about in the North Sea and you see increased production,
that's when you really are going to have noticeable margin growth as well.
This year I think, as you just correctly summarized, we did see degradation in cash margins over 2011 to 2012, but that
really is driven primarily by the significant drops we saw in natural gas prices and NGL prices and bitumen prices. So
when we always talk about margin growth, we talk about margin growth; whatever price assumption you have, if you
just assume that prices are constant across time that we would see per barrel margins growing in this 3% to 5%. And
that again is over a multiyear time period as we bring on these growth projects.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Okay, all right, and then just one final question. I know you talked about the F&D
estimate potentially coming later. But can you give us a sense as to how it might compare with 2011 directionally, or
how it also might compare with the cash contribution per BOE that we saw in 2012? And I'll leave it there, thanks.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So that's another item that I think we would just say that we will give you some updates in
February. And you'll also see some of this as we file our 10-K in late February as well. We're working through those
numbers now, so I think we'd rather just give that guidance in February.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Sure. Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Kate.

Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good morning, Roger.
Operator
Roger, if you are on mute, can you unmute your phone? Okay, we will move on. The next question is from John
Herrlin of Société Générale. Please go ahead.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Good morning, three quick ones. In 2011, you ended with about 29% of your proven reserves,
Conoco's proven reserves, being PUDs. You booked a lot of unconventionals this year. Can you say approximately
how high your PUD count will rise because historically, Conoco has been very underbooked vis-à-vis your peers?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So with the bitumen we announced today, our PUD percentage is about 35%.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, so you're still under. That's fine.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, and it's actually dominated by the oil sands.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Sure.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: That represents about 60% of our PUDs, but more detail will be forthcoming on that.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: That's fine, you're still way under. Regarding benchmarking that Ryan mentioned in the
unconventional plays [UP], could you be a little bit more specific on how you're doing in let's say the Eagle Ford and
Bakken vis-à-vis a lot of the smaller UPs?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Again, that's something that we're going to get more in-depth analysis at the end of next month
at the analyst meeting. It's maybe bit too much detail for the call, but we will give more detail at that time.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, it was worth a shot. The last one for me is Angola. You said you ran seismic, or you
processed some of the seismic. How thick is the salt there for the pre-salt plays? I'm just curious.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Off the top of my head, I don't know the thickness. But clearly, it's got similarities to the
Brazilian side. They were together at the time all this was deposited. So the number off the top of my head, I don't
know. But the seismic is looking very encouraging. I think you're aware of the issues on the graphic on that slide. We're
just outboard of the Cameia discovery. So we know we have a working petroleum system. The seismic looks
encouraging from the potential of identifying these carbonate buildups that form the play on the Brazilian side of the
margin. So we're encouraged and we're looking forward to getting drilling there.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Great, that's it for me. Thank you.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Thanks, John.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, John. We'll take one more question, operator. We're running a little long here, but
let's take one more.
Operator
Our last question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, guys, thank you for taking my questions, several quick ones. Ryan, in addition to you guys
still looking at oil sands and APLNG maybe diluting the interest on, is there any other major oil set that you guys are
still considering, or that's pretty much that the asset sales program would be largely done at this point?

<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Paul, we're always looking at the portfolio and making sure that the assets that we have and the
future investments that are in those assets compete in the portfolio. So it's things like Cedar Creek Anticline that was an
opportunity that presented itself where we got full value. We looked at the future investments in that particular asset
that made more sense to the purchaser than they did to us. It didn't compete in our portfolio. So even though it wasn't
one that was identified and we had talked about, it was an opportunity where we felt like we got full value and got to
redeploy – we'll redeploy those proceeds into capital opportunities that are higher returns for us going forward.
So we've talked about wanting to reduce our oil sands footprint a little bit and some further dilution at APLNG. We're
still working on those. But any other specific assets, it would be premature to say anything about that.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Along that line, one of your smaller competitors in a [indiscernible] (1:11:15) had some fire
work recently. And I think one of the suggestions on the [indiscernible] (1:11:23) is that maybe that it's better off that
you break up the company between the shale oil, which will be having a much higher multiple in comparing to the rest
of the company. And one may argue that that could potentially also apply to ConocoPhillips that the oil sands and the
shale oil would be a higher multiple. I suppose that based on the way – how you answered previous questions that this
is not an option that you guys believe is attractive to you. I just want to make sure that we understand.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes, Paul, I appreciate it. We all read the papers these days and see what's going on. I think as
we came out as an independent company, we laid out our plans. We told the shareholders what we're trying to do to
grow this company and improve the returns and still pay a compelling dividend back to the shareholders. That's what
we're focused on in executing our plan. We think we're on the front end of that plan. We delivered in 2012. I think the
shareholders should be pretty happy with what we did in 2012. We realize we'll reach a lower point in our production
in 2013. We've said that all along because we've said we're going to carve up the portfolio and sell some assets. When
we look at our future, we look at the investments that we're making in the growth projects that we've talked about
today. Those are compelling investments that are high return. They'll move our margins. They'll move our growth. And
then we're doing some exciting things on the exploration side. So we think there's an exciting future. We think
diversification globally and amongst all these different resource types and asset types is important for our company our
size.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Final one for me, just for Matt. Matt, if I look at this year, 2012, reserve replenishment,
excluding oil sands for the rest of the portfolio, it's replacing about 82%. Any idea that over the next couple years,
should we assume 400 million to 500 million barrel a year of the reserve addition from oil sands is a reasonable run
rate, or that the 2012 year was somewhat unique and we're going see a slowdown on that addition rate?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So the bookings in the oil sands essentially follow the project sanctions, and that be tends to be
lumpy depending on how we go – as we go through the project development phases. So I wouldn't expect it to be
consistent at all over the next several years. It will be lumpy as we go through the project sanction phase. We do have a
significant remaining resource base in oil sands that hasn't been converted to reserves yet. But we don't expect a
consistent booking from year to year because it has to follow the project sanctions.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Sure. And based on the project backlog, do you think in the next couple years that the reserve
booking may be substantially less or about the same, or is it going to be higher?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: We continue to expect to replace more than 100% of our reserves as we go forward as we
develop the oil sands, the unconventional, and the other projects we have in our portfolio, but it's not going to be
consistent from year to year. But over the long run, we will be replacing more than 100% of our reserves for the next
five years.
