Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial
measures are included in the press release announcing the first quarter results which I – which, as I have mentioned,
can be found on our website. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items on our financial
results unless otherwise noted. We welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please
limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions.
Now, I will turn the call over to Dave.
David J. Lesar
Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin by saying that our results for the first quarter played
out pretty much as we said it would on our last call. Our international operations were impacted by the normal seasonal
drop-off in the first quarter but revenues and operating income expanded significantly compared to the prior year as we
outgrew our primary competitors.
Sequentially, our North America margins improved substantially as we worked through the guar issue and got our
equipment back to work as customers refresh their budgets. Total company revenue of $7 billion was a record for
Halliburton first quarter and adjusted operating income was $902 million.
Our Sperry Drilling, Multi-Chem, and Baroid product lines achieved record revenues this quarter and from an operating
income perspective, Baroid and Drill Bits also set new records. I'm very pleased with our results in North America
where we saw nearly a 400 basis point sequential improvement to our margins as we worked through our remaining
high price guar inventory, saw activity levels rebound from the dramatic drop-off seen at the end of the fourth quarter
and began to see cost savings materialize from our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives.
The U.S. land rig count averaged 3% lower in the first quarter versus the prior quarter. However, despite reduced
overall rig activity, horizontal rigs were up sequentially and we expect this trend to continue especially in areas like the
Permian Basin. Coupled with the increased adoption of pad drilling and 24-hour operations, we expect to see even
higher service intensity. We believe the oil directed rig count will grow moderately from current levels as our
customers continue to evaluate the pace at which they can more efficiently drill and complete wells. We believe this
continued shift towards efficiency will bode well for us in the coming years as no other company has the ability to
execute factory-type operations as efficiently as Halliburton.
Recently, we have seen an uptick in natural gas prices. However, our outlook for gas activity this year has not
materially changed. We believe we will need to see sustained pricing improvements before gas activity will
meaningfully increase. With the exception of the Marcellus where we are already very active, our view is that natural
gas drilling will not be a major activity driver in 2013 in the U.S. The availability of associated gas and shut-in gas to
meet market demand will likely delay a meaningful uptick in new well drilling. If we see improvement in the gas
basins, it will be late in the year although we are becoming increasingly optimistic about gas activity in 2014.
That all being said, let me remind you that we called the fourth quarter as the bottom for North America margins and
our first quarter results bear that out. Even with the spring break up in Canada, we continue to expect North America
margins will expand over the balance of 2013 subject to the usual year-end seasonality.
Turning now to the international markets. We continue to successfully execute our growth strategy. Relative to the first
quarter of 2012, we grew revenues by 21%, which is the highest among our primary peers and is clear evidence of our
expanding global market share. In fact, compared to our two primary competitors, we have delivered leading
year-over-year international growth now for the last four quarters. In addition, Eastern Hemisphere grew operating
income by an outstanding 39% relative to the first quarter of 2012, which is also the highest in our peer group.
We did experience the typical sequential decline in revenue and margins during the first quarter due to our absence of
seasonally higher year-end software and product sales as well as the normal first quarter seasonal weakness in the
North Sea, Eurasia and Australia. Our thinking for the full year internationally remains consistent. We are forecasting

year-over-year international revenue growth in the low teens and continue to expect our average full-year international
margins will be in the upper teens.
In Latin America, I am happy to announce that we've received the final award approval from Petrobras for both the
high-tech directional drilling and testing contracts. These four-year contracts with extensions for up to another four
years include drilling, logging while drilling and integrated testing services in both the pre-salt and post-salt formations
in the Brazilian offshore market. In both these cases, we won the leading-market position in Brazil. And more
importantly, in the drilling award, we won the largest package even though we were not the lowest bidder. Together,
the potential estimated value of these hard-fought contracts is more than $2 billion, which is expected to significantly
increase our position in the largest deepwater market in the world. These wins are a testament to the ongoing success of
our strategy to provide long-term advanced technology solutions to our customers while increasing a leadership
position in the global deepwater market.
There's no doubt Latin America was a disappointment from a margin standpoint in the first quarter, but the issues were
one-off in nature as we saw activity delays, incurred increased severance costs in Argentina, cost to mobilize on our
new deepwater contracts in Brazil, and a significant rig count reduction in our Mexico IPM projects as we wait on our
large contracts to re-tender. I fully expect Latin America margins to improve moderately in the second quarter and to
average in the upper teens for the second half of the year.
Our growth strategy going forward remains the same. It is clearly working well and does not need to be changed. We
will continue to focus on strengthening in our global position in deepwater, unconventionals and mature fields, and we
continue to be relentlessly focused on industry-leading returns. I am optimistic about the remainder of the year, our
ability to continue rebuilding North American margins and realizing continued revenue and margin growth in our
international business.
Now, I will turn the call to Jeff to provide operational highlights.
Jeffrey Allen Miller
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our first quarter results. Latin America
revenues grew 21% compared to the same quarter last year driven by an expanding revenue base in Mexico, Brazil and
Venezuela. And from a product line perspective, the growth was driven by Sperry Drilling, Baroid fluids and
consulting and project management. Year-over-year, operating income was down 11%, primarily due to activity delays
and higher costs in Argentina and mobilization costs for the recent contract wins in Brazil.
In addition to the deepwater Brazil wins Dave discussed already, we had several highlights with unconventional
activity in Latin America this quarter. In Argentina, we provided integrated completion services for an independent
operator on the largest volume shale well ever pumped in the country. This quarter also marked the first international
application of PermStim, our premium guar alternative where we designed the custom fluid treatment on a shale well in
North Mexico.
The Eastern Hemisphere headline is that compared to the first quarter of 2012, revenue grew by 21% and operating
income increased 39%. And though we experienced the typical sequential decline in revenue and margins during the
first quarter, we did not see the severity of weather disruption typically experienced during the first quarter.
In the Middle East/Asia region, compared to prior year, revenue and operating income increased 25% and 51%,
respectively. We saw the largest growth in the Australia, China and Saudi Arabia markets. This improved performance
reflects the successful startup and execution of contract awards throughout 2012.
Specific to Saudi Arabia, we saw over 30% revenue growth relative to the first quarter of 2012, and it's expected to be
one of our top growth areas in 2013. Notably, during the quarter, we received a direct award for two additional rigs on
our South Ghawar project and we deployed the first complete RapidShift sliding sleeve system in the country. To
support further unconventional development in the region, we are looking forward to opening our tight gas technology
center in Saudi Arabia later this year.

In addition, operations in Iraq posted a profitable quarter and as we refine our portfolio of projects, we expect the
operations to remain profitable for the year. Also of note, our Multi-Chem product line took a significant step forward
on its Eastern Hemisphere footprint, expanding operations with a win in India.
This quarter also marked the opening of our Completion Technology and Manufacturing Center in Singapore. The
center is already delivering high-quality completion tools to our Eastern Hemisphere operations and helping to drive
additional revenue growth and cost improvements.
Turning to Europe, Africa and CIS, relative to the first quarter of 2012, we saw revenue and operating income increase
17% and 25%, respectively. The improvement was driven by higher activity levels in the North Sea, Eurasia, Nigeria
and Central Africa markets. In Angola, we recently secured a wireline formation evaluation logging contract on a
deepwater pre-salt block for a large independent operator. And in Norway, we were awarded a multi-year contract with
Statoil to improve production through multilateral solutions on a mature offshore field.
Across the Europe, Africa and CIS region, we're seeing an uptick in the adoption of unconventional technology. For
example, we're seeing increased use of multistage fracturing across the region and expanded application of rotary
steerables and sliding sleeve technology in developing the tight oilfields of Russia. Now, these are markets with terrific
potential for unconventional development and we're excited about further adoption of our technologies to help clients
develop their resources.
Moving to North America, revenue was down 1% compared to the previous quarter. That's relative to a 3% sequential
drop in the U.S. land rig count. Operating income was up 30% sequentially driven by a lower guar cost, increasing
service intensity and early cost savings resulting from our Frac of the Future and Battle Red initiatives.
Starting with guar, the quarter shaped up as expected with large low-cost guar delivery early in the quarter,
significantly reducing our full quarter average cost. Given the first quarter exit rate for completion activity, our average
guar costs should be at market rate by the end of the second quarter. At the end of the first quarter, approximately 85%
of our crews were under long-term contracts and about three-quarters were working 24-hour operations.
At this point, I'd like to say a few words on stimulation pricing. As we finished the quarter, virtually of our all
long-term hydraulic fracturing contracts have been renewed. Due to the timing of contract startups, we will see some
additional pricing impact on our margins in the second quarter as some recently renegotiated contracts went into effect
at the beginning of April. However, we believe the worst of the pricing pressure is behind us. To support our focus on
improving pricing trends, we will continue to execute our stated strategy around surface efficiencies, custom chemistry
and sub-surface technology delivering differentiated services, which generate superior returns over the long-term.
Our fleets are sold out today and are aligned with customers where we can create the most value for them and deliver
the best returns for Halliburton. I believe our first quarter performance indicates we are on the right track and as a
result, I'm not going to comment on any tit-for-tat reports on pricing, because I feel they are normally self-serving and
anecdotal and I expect that you see them the same way.
With respect to our other product lines, we have experienced some pricing pressure in specific basins but there has not
been a meaningful impact on our margins. The pressure's been focused on cementing, cased-hole wireline and
directional drilling primarily in areas with lower technology requirements, and therefore, smaller competitors in the
market. However, we believe that as activity levels continue to improve throughout the year, this pricing pressure will
subside and our cost optimization initiatives will help offset any further pricing pressures on those service lines.
We're also beginning to have more meaningful discussions with our clients around the technology to make better wells,
which we believe may signal the leading-edge of pricing improvement. We're increasingly optimistic that even in a
market with flat or moderately improved rig count, we will continue to see a shift to pad well activity and more 24-hour
operations. It's our view that the resulting increased well count and stage count could absorb a meaningful percentage
of the excess horsepower and help drive service intensity across the product lines.
In the Gulf of Mexico, first quarter activity was impacted by both maintenance issues on BOP stacks. We expect strong
revenue and profit growth for the year but weighted more to the second half. We believe we will continue to grow our

market share as rigs move to a completion cycle on new wells and we are well-positioned to lead the market and lower
tertiary completions. A good example of how we differentiate ourselves is our Enhanced Single-Trip Multi-Zone
system, which can quickly isolate and stimulate multiple zones in a lower tertiary formation saving operators weeks of
rig time and substantially improving the economics of these ultra-deep wells. For a major operator in the Gulf, we've
already documented an average savings of 18 rig days per well by applying the single-trip technology.
I like our position in North America, and believe it's only going to get better going forward. The Guar issue is largely
behind us and we anticipate better cost optimization will result from our strategic initiatives. We anticipate activity
levels will improve through a combination of modest rig count growth and continued drilling efficiencies over the
course of the year.
I want to conclude with our key areas of focus. First, we are committed to improving our North America margins.
We've seen a dramatic improvement this quarter, but we are not finished. Second, we're committed to growing our
international revenues and margins and achieving a better geographic balance in our business going forward. And
finally, we remain focused on capital discipline and ensuring that we generate the highest returns in our peer group.
And now, Mark will provide some additional financial commentary. Mark?
Mark A. McCollum
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.
Our results for the first quarter reflect a $637 million net-of-tax accrual to increase our contingency reserve related to
the Macondo Multi-District Litigation. The accrual this quarter is in addition to the $191 million net-of-tax accrual
made in the first quarter of 2012. Over the past month or so, we participated in core facilitated settlement discussions
with some of the parties included in the multi-district litigation with the goal of resolving a substantial portion of the
private claims against us in this matter. These discussions are at an advanced stage although they've not yet resulted in
a settlement and the accrual is based on where we are in the negotiations at the present time. Our most recent offer
includes both stock and cash with a cash components payable over an extended period of time.
We are pursuing these settlement discussions in earnest because we believe that an early and reasonably valued
resolution is in the best interest of our shareholders. However, a settlement of this magnitude is complex and requires
the other settling parties to be reasonable on their part too. From a litigation standpoint, we continue to believe that we
have substantial legal arguments and defenses against any liability and that BP is contractually required to indemnify us
as described more fully in our public filings. Therefore, if our settlement discussions are not successful, we are fully
prepared to see this matter to conclusion in the courts. As the MDL trial and other investigations progress, we are
constantly monitoring and evaluating developments and it's possible that we may need to adjust our reserve estimate up
or down in the future.
Our reserve estimate also does not include any potential recoveries from our insurers. Because we're engaged in
ongoing settlement discussions and active trial proceedings, we will not be taking any Macondo-related questions
today. Now, excluding the charge related to the Macondo litigation, our corporate and other expense totaled $120
million this quarter and included approximately $37 million for continued investment in our Battle Red, completion
tools manufacturing and other strategic initiatives. Some of these initiatives will continue throughout 2013, but the
related cost should begin to decline in the second half of the year. We anticipate the impact of these investments will
again be approximately $0.03 per share after tax in the second quarter.
Our legal costs have also increased during the Macondo trial. So in total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will
average between $120 million and $130 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.
I'm pleased to say that we're already beginning to see the payoff of the investments we've made over the last few years
such as the recent opening of the Singapore manufacturing center, a material reduction in our effective tax rate and
finally, cost optimization related to the Battle Red initiative. Next quarter, we intend to give you a further quantification
of the expected savings we can realize from our Battle Red and Frac of the Future programs.

During the quarter, we were positively impacted by retroactive federal tax benefits of $50 million, resulting in an
adjusted first quarter effective tax rate of approximately 23% excluding the charge related to the Macondo litigation.
Due to the benefits from the strategic realignment of our international operations we completed last year and the
continued expansion of our international business for the remaining quarters of the year, we expect the effective tax
rate will be approximately 29%, a 300 basis point improvement over our 2012 rate.
Also during the quarter, we announced a 39% increase to our dividend and the commencement of stock repurchases
under our existing buyback authorization for $1.7 billion. Going forward, our intention is for the dividend to represent
at least 15% to 20% of our net income. As a result of Macondo settlement discussions in the first quarter, we were
unable to repurchase a significant amount of shares. We plan, however, to be much more aggressive in our second
quarter repurchase activity following the anticipated completion of our SEC filings later this week.
Our capital expenditure guidance of approximately $3 billion for the first – for the full year 2013 remains unchanged.
For our international business, as we move into the second quarter, we are anticipating a moderate improvement in
revenue as we recover from the first quarter seasonal drop-off and we expect margins to approach the mid-teens.
For North America, we anticipate a modest improvement in the U.S. rig count in the second quarter. However, given
the stronger U.S. activity levels in the first quarter, coupled with the typical second quarter drop-off in Canadian
activity due to spring breakup, we only expect a slight improvement in sequential revenues for the second quarter.
North America margins should be positively impacted by another 100 basis points or so as our average Guar cost
continues to decline to market levels. We anticipate also that marginal improvement from U.S. activity levels will be
largely offset by pricing from late first quarter contract renewals and by Canadian activity disruptions due to spring
breakup.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments.
David J. Lesar
Okay. Thanks, Mark. So in summary, we're very proud of our strong year-over-year international growth, which was
the highest in our peer group and a solid prove point that we are executing well against our strategy. Our overall
international outlook for the year has not changed. We expect revenues will grow in the area of the low teens and
expect full-year margins will average in the upper teens.
Specifically for Latin America, we had some temporary activity declines in one-off charges across the region, but it
doesn't change our outlook for the full year. The North America headwinds from last year are largely behind us and we
are optimistic about activity levels and continued margin improvement for the remainder of the year. And lastly, with
respect to ongoing Macondo settlement discussions, we are working hard to come to a reasonable settlement that will
be in the best interest of our shareholders. So at that point, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - James C. West>: Good morning, gentlemen, and well done on this quarter.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thanks, James.
<Q - James C. West>: Dave, when I saw you back in January and February, there were two things that really stuck out
of my mind from our conversations. One was that on the international side, you talked about the opportunity set being
really the largest you'd ever seen. And then number two that this was really the time to test pricing in the international
markets. I wonder if we could kind of revisit that if you could talk about that opportunity set. Is it still as large as you

thought a couple months ago? And then really the second is on the pricing side, are you starting to see some more
pricing discipline from your competition? Are you starting to see pricing rise?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, I think with respect to the first comment, the opportunity set in the international markets
remains as large as it has been and I think the largest that we've certainly seen within recent history. So those
opportunities haven't gone away. I think the other point that I should make is that they're not with sort of the Brazil
tendering process behind us; the opportunity set is a whole lot of sort of medium-sized types of opportunities. It's not
any big mega types of tenders out there, which gives us and our competitors, I think, an opportunity to sort of test
where we are in terms of pricing. If you look at where we are bidding today and where we are winning work, I think we
certainly have hit the bottom in terms of international pricing. Believe me, it's still competitive but I believe that that
we're seeing that it is starting to turn up.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay. And then maybe just one follow-up on Mexico. We got some contract re-tendering that
has to go through. How long is that process expected to take before you can get back to work there?
<A - David J. Lesar>: I'll let Jeff handle that one.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yeah. There are a couple of big things to happen sort of mid-year. So I would expect that
through the process, we'll see some sorting out of budgets early at the end of Q1 and then tenders mid-year. And it's
probably later in the year before sort of budgets are refreshed and back to work. But we'd expect during the balance of
this year we'd see that.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah. I think one other thing I might add, James, is that on these contracts, we've gotten
extensions on a number of them, but it's done at a rig count that's less than what we had been working at while we wait
on these tenders to come forward. And that's really part of the reason that the margins have got squeezed, but as I said,
we look at that as sort of a one-off issue.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Thank you very much and congratulations on a great quarter. My question relates to North
America. It seems that margin improvement was much higher than we expected and it feels better than what you
expected as well. Could you provide, Mark, what was the source of the upward surprise in margins in the first quarter?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Yeah, Waqar. As we look at it, we thought probably just given a lower level of activity
expected in Q1 that we would only get a couple hundred basis points from guar savings. We – I think the Street knows
that we had said that we thought we could get 400 basis points to 450 basis points of improvement in our North
America margins from the turn in our guar inventories.
We, I think, in the first quarter just given the higher activity levels got about 300 basis points of that savings on guar,
which leaves the remaining 100 basis points or so for the second quarter, which I've talked about in my comments – in
my prepared comments. The rest of it really when you look at it, is activity related, very strong activity for us. We got
our crews back to work much faster than we thought we would on the pressure pumping side when you look across our
Drilling and Evaluation divisions, they did extremely well. We saw a couple – almost 200 basis points of marginal
improvement across D&E as well. So all – the activity increase for us just well exceeded the pressure that we saw from
continued pricing that we had from rolling some of our pressure pumping contracts in the first quarter.
<Q - Waqar Syed>: Okay. And in terms of – this is the first time that I have heard you guys be positive on the pricing
front as well. What has changed – what gives you that confidence that pricing could pick up later in the year?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah. When I look out – the conversations that we're having with clients these days are more –
are becoming more geared towards making better wells, which leads very quickly into a discussion around chemistry

and chemistry application. And those are applications of our technology, and so maybe not today, but that's the leading
edge of the right discussion to have with a company like Halliburton because we do make better wells when we use that
technology.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hi, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: I guess with kind of the reported rig counts as we can see, I mean activity has trended pretty flattish
over the last month in the U.S. I just wanted to hear kind of the discussion – your discussion, your viewpoint on activity
kind of second and third quarter and what gives you confidence that we uptick from here?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Well, when we look at combination of things. We see increases in pad drilling that obviously
drives service intensity for us. You heard our discussion around sort of leading edge of technology application and
those things combined start to take us to more efficient operations where we're using our equipment. The second thing
is really alignment with the clients that appreciate our efficiency level. And so as we position our equipment in the
basins and with the clients that want that sort of efficiency, we expect to see improvement. So in spite of, say, rig count
modestly increasing, both our share of it and the speed with which that activity happens is going to increase.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Yeah. When you look at the well count, Jeff, I mean the rig count, I mean, yeah, overall, it
didn't look that great, but the horizontal rig count was up. If you look inside of that, the rig count went up with the
customers whom we work for lot of the majors, and then thirdly, we focus more dramatically on well count. And when
we look at activity across the quarter, well count was up and so was our service intensity around stage counts. And so
that drives improved performance when you're – as Jeff said, when you're aligned with the right customers doing the
right type of work with good technology.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: That makes a lot of sense. And my second question is just as you look out, if you think about
exiting this year, so the North American margins were quite a bit better than I had thought. We're going to see
international margin improve through the course of the year. I would still expect international margins to exceed North
America to exit the year. Do you agree with that?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: No. I would not necessarily agree with that. I think it will be a horse race as the year
progresses. Certainly, North America is getting better and – but we still got excess capacity in the North America
market that we'll be dealing with. So there is a fundamental – some pricing pressure that they're facing. Right now, I
mean as the international operations expand and on their base, and the improvement that we see, I think that they could
actually eclipse the North America margin in a year, but it will be very, very close.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks. Good morning and nice quarter.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Thank you.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: So just to be clear, when you're talking about North America and modest price increases as
customers adopt new technology, is this specifically in frac or in other product lines?
<A - David J. Lesar>: This is all product lines. So this is about making better wells, which is a function of well
construction and completions. But I will say, these are the leading-edge as discussions around how to do it. So that –

very encouraged by the discussions, which means there is an appreciation for the technology of how better wells are
made – better producing wells.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, fair enough. And then on North American frac capacity, assuming that we do see
another 6% to 7% growth in the rig count in 2013 and as we've discussed here, growth in the well count and, i.e., rig
efficiencies, do you believe that the frac market could actually be balanced by early 2014 or even late 2013?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: I think based on what we – really, Q1 played out very close to what we thought it would,
maybe a little bit better activity. We always thought as we looked ahead that there still would be some excess capacity
in the frac market, maybe in the 10% to 15% level, too much frac capacity. That could get absorbed very, very quickly
in the early part of 2014 based on what we're seeing.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. Back to North America here real quickly, and you guys have addressed
this in some facets, but not necessarily in others. And I guess my question is, we came into the year with a decent
inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells. That helped propel better completions activity versus drilling activity in
Q1. Drilling activity hasn't been all that brisk year-to-date and yet you guys are actually confidence – confident, sorry,
about the runway remaining for the next quarter or so that – at least that's my interpretation. Can you give us some
more granularity as to which markets look better, which markets look worse and specific discussions you are having
with customers because it sounds like the visibility you see is more nebulous to the market?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah. Bill, let me take this one. I think it really is – it's not a matter of geography. It really is a
matter of your customer base. And we've said for years, we only deal with what we call the fairway players in the U.S.,
North America market. These are the folks that are going to keep rigs up, and their budgets up sort of through thick and
thin, but also those that are dealing with some of the lowest lease cost opportunities there. So we pride ourselves on our
ability to sort of pick and choose who we work for, and we do that. And so it really doesn't matter where they're
working and I really wouldn't get too concentrated and focused on geographies.
It's really what our customer base is and I think, as Mark has said, our customers that we're working for are increasing
their rig counts. They're increasing their budgets, and I think that's what – and we sort of know what their plans are for
the rest of the year. And that's what gives us the increasing confidence of our position in North America from a margin
accretion standpoint, notwithstanding the fact that there are a lot of other companies and customers out there that may
not feel so confident. We just happen to feel really strong and really confident about the customer base we have.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: That is helpful. Thank you. And then the follow-up is on international, your guidance sort of
low teens for the year. You had a 21% year-over-year increase for the first quarter in terms of revenue growth, which
implies, I don't know, a pretty good slowdown with year-over-year growth relative to Q1 for the balance of the year. Is
that conservatism? Or is that based upon conviction that the year-over-year rate of growth is actually going to slow that
much? I mean it's still commendable, but slower than Q1?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Well. Bill, I mean, yeah, it is truly slower than Q1, but I think that as we look year-over-year,
Q1 in 2012 was a bit more dramatically down and so we knew that that Q1 probably would be a little bit higher
percentage. As we look ahead also, we think that particularly in Latin America, things are going to move a little bit
slower possibly than some would forecast. So it's just – maybe it has a little bit of conservatism in it, but we think it's a
pretty fair forecast just based on historically what you see customers do from this point forward. The weak – remember,
last year, we saw some pretty significant growth sequentially in our international markets coming off of Q1. So it really
is in comparison to last year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Great, good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hi, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey. Dave, a question for you. There's a lot of chatter the last couple of days about at least from
one of your competitors getting very optimistic about the acceleration in the international marketplace as you get
through the second half of the year and I think a lot of that is being driven by the prospects of the Saudis to pick up
rigs. I know you're pretty close to the situation out there, very close to the situation out there. I wonder if you can give –
put it into context for us compared to what transpired in Saudi in 2006/2007 into 2008, what – how you compare that to
what you see happening now, and then what kind of impact you expect that to have on capacity and pricing and
opportunities going out late 2013 and into 2014?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Well, I think, sort of on a broad scale, as I indicated before, we are very excited about the
potential in the Eastern Hemisphere markets at this point in time. And we are very optimistic, specifically, about
opportunities in Saudi Arabia. If you look at sort of the myriad of areas that Aramco is looking at increasing: gas
drilling, workover areas, the whole area of lump sum turnkey projects. So – and we're embedded with Aramco in all of
those.
So I think the – look at opportunities in the Red Sea, where we recently won some work with Saudi Aramco. So we're
very excited about that market in particular, and obviously, we'll get our or more than our share of that market as it
comes around. We're in active negotiations with them right now about several projects. Obviously, we can't talk about
them until they're awarded, but we're very optimistic about where we stand on them. So I believe that Saudi is a bit of a
microcosm of what we see the whole international market playing out as, which is very positive over the next several
years.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And in that context, is there a parallel we can draw to what transpired in 2006, 2007 and
the acceleration in business and margins and activity and pricing and everything else that drove this sector for a good
two, two-and-a-half year period?
<A - David J. Lesar>: I certainly hope so.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: All right. All right. That's it for me. Thank you.

<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Jeff, you talked about service intensity and we all know that rig count is becoming
increasingly passé as a metric. And I understand the improvements in technology in your customer base that drive your
business but do you guys have, have you all come up with a number? Is service intensity growing by 5%, 10%? Is there
a number that you all are kind of looking at to put on that?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, we look at different metrics, so...
<A - David J. Lesar>: Right.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: ...numbers of stages and different things that we see out there, and so when we look at it,
we see it improving. I'm not going to give you necessarily a particular metric, but we're forecasting a 9% to 10%
improvement in sort of efficiency of rigs, which gets to what drives sort of the underlying numbers of stages and
numbers of activities. So...

<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Okay. And I know you guys have – we talked a little bit about rig count and all, but
spending, do you think that North America spending will go up this year through the rest of the year? There has been a
great deal of question as to whether the rig count is going to move and like I say, the rig count doesn't matter and the
number of sources we have for footage and wells are kind of sparse. What do you think spending is going to do for the
industry overall for North America for the rest of the year?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: I think the actual spending is probably going to be flat, and I think that's a function of,
again, spending the money faster, which our clients will be able to do. So I don't see a big increase in actual spend
necessarily across the board.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yeah. We've seen Halliburton definitely take the lead here in pushing for more 24-hour work
and pumping in the States, it's obviously great for asset turns and margins, but you can also complete more stages when
you work around the clock. Have you guys gone out and looked at the efficiency gain which is being realized by your
pumping fleet or maybe the pumping fleet as a whole here in the U.S. and how that will impact the retightening of the
market?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: What – our strategy has been to implement our Q10 pump capacity – capability. We've
feathered that into the market sort of ratably as we've retired equipment. But we believe we will see probably a 20%
improvement in our efficiency on the back of our technology. So when I think about capital efficiency and capital
required to address our piece of the market, I believe we'll be more competitive than others certainly in that space.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Is there...
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Let me just add one more comment. Obviously, the impact of 24-hour operations
obviously adds to the efficiency of the industry, but it also eats up your equipment two or three times faster than your
traditional way of doing pressure pumping does. So that in itself also will lend to the consumption of any excess
capacity that's in the market just because the useful life of your equipment tends to require you to have more
maintenance and more ongoing costs. But it does grind the equipment up faster and that tends to take some of the
equipment out of the market a lot faster than it might historically have.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: And that 20% figure, that's primarily related to less backup capacity? Or is that a combination
of less backup capacity and more stages executed per week, per month with the...
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: That's actually in our view the same stages, less horsepower.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: The Q10 runs at a higher rated horsepower than traditional pumps. And so if you just look
through it, you just need 20% less based on what we're seeing it run in the marketplace.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yeah.
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: It means fewer trucks.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Fewer trucks on location.

<A - Mark A. McCollum>: On location.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Got it. And if I could ask a quick question on Mexico. You mentioned a little bit slower going
here in terms of growth rate in LatAm. What's your outlook for gas related activity in Mexico particularly in the
Burgos? Mexico is importing more low-cost gas here from the U.S.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: It's still a bit of – I think it's still a bit of a science experiment in Northern Mexico right
now. As we've talked about over the last couple of calls, we've done some fracs. I think we did the first frac in Northern
Mexico and the results have not been made public on that, so we won't do that today. But I think you should – you'd
consider it as a sort of a prospective science experiment at this point in time but we are optimistic about what might
develop as we go forward.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - David Anderson>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Everyone seems to be downplaying the potential improvements in
natural gas activity you did on this call as well. Strip prices have been now been above $4 for over a month. I'm just
kind of wondering, so many of your customers are starting to lock in hedges. Why won't we see – start to see activity
increasing soon? You talked about your customer base, you stuck with those guys. I'm just kind of curious what they
are saying. What do they need to see to start getting out there again?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: No. I think, Dave, you're right in that $4-plus gas, where they can lock hedges in is getting
to the point where a lot of these fairway players actually can be – actually quite profitable from a return standpoint on
these. I think what we want to convey today is that we're not counting on that and so that the projection we are doing of
where we see the market going the balance of the year. Obviously, if gas prices do stay in that sort of above $4 level, I
think that only adds to the potential optimism that we have about let's say, 2013 and 2014.
<Q - David Anderson>: That number could really change in the second half of the year, if this stays here and if your
customers start coming back, you should – we should see even more upside to your margins?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Yes. That would be our feeling for sure.
<Q - David Anderson>: One other thing, we often hear kind of a lot of your competitors complain about your pricing,
but it also seems a bit like sour grapes considering you guys have a lower cost structure out there. I wonder if you could
just give us a sense as to how much lower you think your costs are compared to your competitors and also how far
along you are in the Battle Red initiative and some of these other cost initiatives?
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: Well, we're not going to comment from a competitive standpoint on where we think we
are relative cost. I think we're making progress on the two initiatives you described, Frac of the Future and Battle Red.
We'll give you – plan to give you a better update on that next quarter. But they do drive efficiency for us and the ability
to, obviously, manage our business. And as I said in my prepared comments, I don't plan to comment on sort of the
tit-for-tat back-and-forth around pricing just because it's anecdotal. Our commitment is to make a return on equipment
we put in the market and that's my commitment and so that's what we're doing.

<Q - Bradley Handler>: Could you – I guess I'll stay with North America to start and this is a bit of a leading
question. And I suppose it is what it is. The – if you are as committed as you are, and you have a process where the
Q10 pump is rolling out. In principle, you cannot retire the older pumps as aggressively and build into an opportunity to
work with these good customers of yours that might be growing their business. Is there any change in philosophy, I
suppose about the retirement strategy of your existing equipment?
<A - David J. Lesar>: No. I mean the new technology is more efficient. It also has better maintenance cycles. So it's
the right thing to do and so what we plan to do is just continue with what we had said in terms of capital discipline
throughout the year. And at this point in the year, we're well into the year.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Oh, sure. No, I appreciate your spending wouldn't change. I just don't know if the retirement
– if the retirement of – well, the retirement intentions might have softened perhaps? I guess just to clarify the question.
<A - Jeffrey Allen Miller>: I think the way that I would characterize it, Brad, is if all of a sudden as we – from the
earlier question, if gas activity were to take off dramatically on us, and we recognize that we weren't putting enough, it
would be easier to dial up our manufacturing just a little bit to get more Q10s out. We've been trying to be very
disciplined in how the Q10s are coming out. We've talked about reducing CapEx, staying with it, generating some
additional cash flow this year. That's an adjustment that we can make if we felt like that the forecast could lend itself to
basically turn out more units rather than keeping the old stuff out in the field and deferring those efficiency gains that
we're trying to capture.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Got it, that's very helpful. If I could ask an unrelated one on Brazil, so the contracts have
been signed. Can you help us a little bit with the ramp – the incremental revenue ramp? Does that take several quarters
here? Should we see full run rates only in 2014? Or does that happen relatively more quickly?
<A - David J. Lesar>: No. I would say look to more to 2014 for the full ramp on that and we will feather equipment
and as we sort of go through the year, but don't expect full on really until the equipment's in place and ready to go.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Cowen Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Good morning.
<A - David J. Lesar>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Given your somewhat optimistic view on gas drilling for 2014 and given the lead times
involved, are you close to the point? Or are you almost at the point where you might consider new equipment building
in domestic pressure pumping?
<A - David J. Lesar>: I think, Jim, that's one of the huge advantages we have by manufacturing our own pumping
equipment is we don't have the real extended lead times that our competitors might have with respect to when they
order up and can dial up their spend there. So I think we really have the luxury of waiting until probably second and
third quarter of this year to take a look at the market before we have to make a decision as to whether or not we want to
ramp up production that could come on stream in 2014. And I think that's part of the reasons that we have the higher
returns is that we have more granularity around our ability to control manufacturing.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. That's a good answer, Dave. And follow up my question is on the formation
evaluation both LWD and wireline business worldwide, if you just exclude Brazil for a second, I know that increasing
penetration in this market has been key to your overall goal of improving margins, I'd say, internationally. Can you
comment and maybe even include the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, do you feel in both LWD and wireline you've gained
share of the market in the past year?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah. I think in the last year, we have gained some share. And I think it's demonstrated by
some of the markets where we're working today. So with our sort of full [ph] FE (54:44) suite of services we're

working in East Africa today and some of the more challenging environments there, we're seeing, as I mentioned,
progress in Angola. We've won some important contracts, bits of work in Asia. So, yes, we're making the progress that
I would expect and partly just demonstrating our capability to deliver in these deepwater markets.
<A - Kelly Youngblood>: Great. Sam, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Thanks. Dave, I was hoping to get your last thoughts on Halliburton's exposure to the
artificial lift market. You have a clear focus on mature fields. And then particularly just in light of GE's announced the
acquisition of Lufkin?
<A - David J. Lesar>: Yeah, if you look at our portfolio, artificial lift is one that clearly was a hole in our – in the
portfolio that we have. We made the acquisition a year ago of Global, and now have an offering in artificial lift that
actually, I think as we said in either the Q3 or Q4 call last year, has exceeded beyond our wildest imagination in terms
of financial performance. And it sort of shows us and gives us a window into what the opportunities in that market will
be. So we are – we're glad to be in the business albeit in a small way right now. But I think that what we've
demonstrated over the years is that when we get focused on a market and put the capital to it, that we basically are
going to be a player.
Now, for us, that's going to be basically in ESP. At this point in time, rod lift and things like that we don't view as
critical to our ability to compete long run in the mature field area, but I think that having the ESP offering is something
that rounds out what we have and it was an important acquisition for us to build on.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Okay, thanks. And, Mark, what's the potential for significantly accelerating the share
repurchase program, particularly if a significant portion of the Macondo settlement is paid in stock? Does that alter the
thinking?
<A - Mark A. McCollum>: Certainly. A settlement on Macondo gives us more certainty as to what we can do with
our cash going forward. I think everyone recognize as we've had a – have a cash placeholder on the balance sheet as it
were to hold in anticipation of what the ultimate exposure on Macondo might be. I think having an earlier resolution of
it, if we are successful in settlement discussions, would give us some certainty then as to what we could do, we
typically need $750 million to $800 million of cash to run the business, and beyond that, everything else creates an
opportunity. And so I think you hit it right. If something were to happen, that would create a lot of opportunity for us to
do some interesting things.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.
Kelly Youngblood
No, Sam, you can go ahead and close out the call. Thank you.
