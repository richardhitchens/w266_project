This conference call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that
could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Any such statements should be considered in
conjunction with cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factor discussions in our filings with the SEC
including our last annual report on form 10-K. Starbucks assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking
statements or information. This conference call is being webcast and an archive of the webcast will be available on our
website at investor.starbucks.com.
Before I turn the call over to Howard, I would like to announce the date of our next biennial Analyst Conference, that'd
be December 4 of this year. And although we are in the early planning stages and will not be formally sending out
invitations soon, it is important to note that we will be hosting this event in our home market, Seattle. We hope you'll
be able to join us for the first conference in Seattle since 2006.
I would now like to turn the call over to Howard Schultz. Howard?
Howard S. Schultz
Thank you, JoAnn, and welcome to everyone on today's call. I'm very pleased to comment on the record second quarter
results that Starbucks announced today and to provide detail around several exciting new initiatives we have underway.
Q1's momentum continued in Q2, with each of our retail segments around the world contributing positively to global
comp store sales increase of 6%, representing our 17th consecutive quarter of comp growth of 5% or greater and record
Q2 revenues of $3.9 billion. Particularly noteworthy was a 7% comp increase delivered by our China and Asia-Pacific
segment and the 6% comp increase delivered by our EMEA segment, the strongest comp growth in EMEA in 14
quarters.
EMEA's performance in Q2 provides powerful evidence of the success of our continuing efforts to transform that
important region where we currently operate 2,065 stores and to position EMEA to resume delivering revenue growth
in operating profitable new stores fulfilling a commitment we made on prior calls.
Record revenues combined with reduced operating costs to drive a 130-basis point increase in consolidated operating
margin to 16.6%, enabling us to deliver an 18.4% or $100 million increase in operating income to $644 million, and a
17% increase in earnings per share, after excluding last year's non-recurring gain to a Q2 record of $0.56 per share.
In January, I shared with you our new senior leadership organizational structure. Central to the new structure is Troy
Alstead's promotion Chief Operating Officer. Today, Troy is focused on day-to-day execution and operational
excellence across Starbucks' business, providing me with the additional time to focus on driving faster, profitable
growth and bolder, more constructive innovation across our company and around the world. I'll provide you with a
preview of what to expect from us in the quarters ahead and then turn the call over to Troy, and Scott Maw, our new
CFO, will take you through our Q2 operating and finance results in detail.
Over the last several years, we have further honed our best-in-class retail site selection, store development and design
and construction expertise. The best evidence of that fact is the tremendous success of our new store class. Sales to
investment ratios of over 2 to 1, REIs – or return on investments in excess of 50% and first-year average unit volumes
of over $1.2 million, all while delivering an enhanced experience to our customers. Several years ago, we saw an
opportunity to reinvent the traditional QSR drive-through format, and as a result, our new class of drive-through stores
are providing Starbucks with a unique ability to connect with the increasing numbers of our customers on the go.
Highly profitable drive-throughs represent a significant growth opportunity for us and continue to remain a focal point
of our store development efforts. And with this, tremendous success of our recently-introduced award-winning
designed drive-through only stores with walk-up windows. We are leveraging our drive-through store portfolio to
provide further incrementality and add another new runway for growth that is strategically complementary to our
high-profile urban street-front locations.

Despite currently operating over 20,000 Starbucks stores in 64 countries, our research clearly demonstrates that
Starbucks still accounts for a very small share of total global coffee occasions and that we are significantly under-stored
in many markets, including North America, China, Brazil and India, today our fastest-growing international market.
Over the months and quarters ahead, you will see us execute against the disciplined, highly-targeted retail store
development and rollout program.
Turning to coffee and tea, coffee will always be at our core and we are making significant investments across our
business, including building our supply chain capabilities and elevating and operating standards to ensure that we
continue to innovate and provide global thought leadership and undisputed authority in coffee-quality sourcing and
roasting. At the same time, as I have previously mentioned, we recently purchased our first operating coffee farm in
Costa Rica and opened our seventh agronomy and farmer support center, this one in Ethiopia.
As I said in the past, tea is the most consumed beverage on earth behind water and represents a $90 billion global
category that we strongly believe is ripe for innovation and it represents an enormous global opportunity for Starbucks.
And we are seizing that opportunity with Teavana. Teavana sources and offers consumers the highest quality estate teas
available anywhere in the world. By summer, Starbucks customers will be able to sample and experience a full range of
Teavana branded handcrafted tea beverages, loose leaf teas and tea merchandise inside their local Starbucks store.
At the same time, we are putting the full power of Starbucks' digital, mobile, social and rewards program against all of
the assets we have against the Teavana brand, affording us a unique ability to target and connect with consumers,
providing us with an unparalleled competitive advantage in the marketplace. Following the opening of our Teavana tea
bars in New York and Seattle, we'll be expanding the concept to Chicago, Los Angeles and additional locations in New
York City in the months ahead.
And that is not all – not nearly all. Last month we announced a one-of-a-kind partnership with Oprah Winfrey. And
starting this coming Tuesday, supported by a comprehensive national advertising and marketing campaign, specially
blended Teavana Oprah Chai will be available in Starbucks and Teavana stores across the U.S. and Canada, enabling us
to further leverage and elevate Teavana brands. Importantly, for every Teavana Oprah Chai tea beverage or product
sold, a donation will be made to the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy foundation to benefit educational
opportunities for youth, a program we at Starbucks could not be more excited about supporting.
In the months and quarters ahead you will see firsthand how Starbucks will disrupt the tea category in ways large and
small that will be reminiscent of how we changed the coffee category, at the same time as we extend our coffee
leadership and authority all over the world.
Customized beverage innovation continues to be a core strength of our company and an area of great interest to our
customers. We have a fantastic lineup of cold, refreshing beverages ready for our customers as the warm weather
arrives, with many markets experiencing Fizzio, Starbucks' new platform of handcrafted cold carbonated beverages for
the very first time. Last summer we tested Fizzio in select markets in the U.S. and Asia, and following the
overwhelming success of those tests, we will be rolling Fizzio out to 3,000 stores across the U.S. sunbelt, in Singapore,
Korea and several cities in China this summer.
We are launching the Fizzio brand with three fantastic flavors: ginger ale, spiced root beer and lemon ale. We'll be
adding additional locally-relevant flavors as the summer progresses. Fizzio combines a healthy, all-natural,
preservative-free alternative to sugar filled sodas with the theater of a custom handcrafted beverage that I am convinced
will be a big hit with consumers and drive traffic and incrementality during the key afternoon day part, just as it did in
the test markets last summer.
Last quarter, we called your attention to a seismic shift in consumer behavior and migration from bricks and mortar
retailing to the web and e-commerce. While many retailers, including many food and beverage QSRs, continue to
grapple with on how to navigate these shifts, Starbucks' record Q2 results unequivocally demonstrate how the
investments we began making years ago to create the world's premier portfolio of digital, social and mobile technology
assets are paying off and in a very big way.

Our integrated gift card loyalty, social and mobile platform is bar none the largest and most successful in the world.
Consider these metrics. Today the Starbucks card program is available in 28 countries. Card transactions now account
for over one-third of all transactions in the U.S. and Canada stores. Over 10 million Starbucks customers are actively
using our mobile app, twice the number from only a year ago, and mobile payments now account for over 14% of
tender in our company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada, rising 75% from just a year ago.
Over 8 million active My Starbucks Rewards members are earning rewards in the form of stars with purchases,
representing 25% of all the transactions in our U.S. company-operated stores. And our first of its kind cross-channel
stars down the aisle program has awarded more than five million stars to customers purchasing packaged coffee in U.S.
grocery stores since the program debuted last July, demonstrating the value and the early-stage opportunity of what we
are calling stars as currency.
Together, our best-in-class card loyalty and mobile assets enable us to deepen our connection to our customers and
create further separation from competitors. But more than that, we believe that to be successful today, a pure-play
bricks and mortar consumer retailer must create a high degree of mobile, social and digital engagement and develop a
seamless relationship with customers. We further believe that accelerating global adoption of smartphones and mobile
technologies in general will continue to transform and evolve the retail landscape in areas of payment, loyalty and
consumer experiences in years to come in ways that just in a year ago we probably could not conceive of.
Today as the retail industry's unquestioned leader in mobile payment and mobile loyalty, we are uniquely positioned to
leverage our digital leadership and to both develop and monetize new platforms, revenue streams and opportunities for
growth in ways that will be highly complementary to our existing core business and our customer base. By way of
example, major tech companies and retailers have recently begun inquiring about whether or not Starbucks would be
willing to license and/or white label our technology in mobile platforms. We are taking a very thoughtful and
disciplined approach as we consider these overtures and what we believe will ultimately prove to be a very significant
additional driver of long-term shareholder value. You'll be hearing much more about our plans around mobile, digital
and loyalty in the months and quarters ahead.
Let me close by underscoring that despite our size and scope, the Starbucks brand and business is still in the very early
stages of its growth and development. The day-to-day management that our senior leadership team is providing the
organization is framing up to lead the company into and through the tremendously exciting next phase of breakthrough
innovation and acceleration. Global growth lies ahead in ways that possibly you probably could not believe just a few
years ago.
And I strongly believe unequivocally that there's never been a better or more exciting time to be a Starbucks partner.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Troy.
Troy Alstead
Thank you, Howard, and good afternoon, everyone. Our record second quarter was the outcome of a continued strong
effort of each four reporting segments. Our business remained extremely healthy and poised for continued growth with
all retail regions growing revenue at rates faster than industry and the Channel Development business just beginning
the top line acceleration. I'll spend the next few minutes discussing the performance of these businesses, then we'll turn
it over to Scott for a discussion of our consolidated results, segment margins and our outlook for the balance of the
year.
Let me start with the Americas segment, which delivered another quarter of solid results in a persistently difficult retail
environment. Total net revenues in the Americas grew $2.8 billion in Q2, up 8% over the prior year. The largest driver
of our revenue increase was the strong comp growth of 6%, with 3% coming from ticket growth and increase traffic
contributing 2%. Encouragingly, both traffic and ticket growth accelerated throughout the quarter. This, combined with
the healthy pipeline of innovation ready to hit our stores in Q3, gives us great optimism for the back half of the year.

One key component to our momentum is food, with food attached to only about one-third of U.S. transactions,
elevating our food program to the level of our coffee excellence represents both the top priority and significant business
opportunities for us, and we're making great headway. La Boulange has significantly improved the quality of our
bakery offerings and now in 6,000 U.S. company-operated stores and another 2,500 licensed stores, it's driving results
as well, helping the food category contribute two points of comp growth in the second quarter. We continue to make
enhancements throughout the lineup and as a result, as we expand to new cities and leverage the operational earnings
from those before, we see stronger and stronger results after launch.
We remain on track to complete the bakery rollout across all U.S. company-operated stores before the end of
September, and thanks to the strong results and demand from our licensees, we will complete the rollout across all U.S.
licensed stores this year as well, add to this our successful new breakfast sandwich offerings, which launched
nationwide March 4 and have already lifted sales of those products by nearly 50%. As our bakery rollout completes,
we'll turn our attention to food and other day parts, including lunch.
We have significantly advanced our lunch program with Bistro Boxes, Paninis & Salads over the past few years, but
there is a much larger prize here and we're ready to go after it. We began testing different lunch options and are
narrowing our focus to the best performers based on results thus far. To ensure we have the right products relevant to
our customers and to the day part and to ensure strong execution when we're ready to roll out the new no lunch
program, we will move deliberately through the test but with a strong purpose. And as we roll out our enhanced lunch
program next year, complemented by a diverse beverage lineup including Teavana tea and in handcrafted sodas, we
absolutely believe Starbucks stores across the U.S. will increasingly be seen as a destination for a quick, delicious and
high-quality lunch.
Now let me wrap up this discussion of food by saying very clearly that food is a huge opportunity and future growth
driver, and we are already seeing very clear and tangible success as we roll the program throughout our stores.
Specifically, food was the single, largest incremental driver of comp growth in the second quarter and food attach
clearly and consistently higher after the launch of La Boulange in the market. Most importantly, we're delighting
customers in new ways with amazing food and will continue to elevate these food experiences across all day parts.
Speaking of day parts I will now talk briefly about what is becoming another opportunity for us going forward and that
is our evenings program. We have tested the evenings program for the past few years in selected stores across several
markets with great results. Evenings food offerings combined with beverages including wine and beer driving
meaningful increase in sales during that time of the day, which has opened up to us an entirely new opportunity to
provide great experiences to our customers and to drive incremental sales and profitability through the stores. Based on
these results, we are no longer testing evenings. We're now moving forward with the rollout of the program in a
disciplined way over multiple years. Ultimately, I'd expect certainly greater than 1,000 stores across the U.S. to have an
evenings' offering.
Our average ticket grew 3% in Q2. As I mentioned, food was a driver as was favorable beverage mix and pricing. Both
limited time and new core beverage offerings continue to resonate with our customers. Our winter and spring
promotion featured caramel flan, which delivered growth even over last year's tremendously successful Vanilla Spice
promotion. And the introduction of Vanilla Macchiato was very well received, delivering incremental transactions at a
higher price point.
Additionally, we're just beginning to leverage our vast My Starbucks Rewards member base to deliver meaningful
marketing and promotions to the right person at the right time. While the absolute number of offers we're sending is
increasing, each one is going to smaller, more precisely segmented sets of members. The effect of this is that our
members receive offers relevant to them and ones they take advantage of. As our membership base and our intelligence
in this area grows this will be an important tool to increase customer frequency and improve already strong retention.
We continue to be pleased with the growth of our licensed stores in the Americas as well. We drove double-digit
revenue growth in our Americas licensed store business, fueled by strong comp growth in grocery stores as well as our
licensed Latin America markets.

Moving now to EMEA where our momentum continues to build each quarter. Q2 was outstanding in every way, in
what is our seasonally softest quarter for revenue growth at its highest rate in two years, comp growth at its highest in
three years and profitability more than tripling over last Q2. Revenue growth in EMEA up 13% to $310 million was a
function of favorable foreign currency exchange, strong comp growth and strong licensed store growth. Comp over 6%
was driven by a 5% lift in transactions and a 1% rise in average ticket. We continue to show strong improvement across
the region, especially in the UK, where our deep focus on operational excellence continues and results are very evident,
especially during the morning peak.
The improved product lineup is also contributing, bolstered by the now complete upgrade of the breakfast program.
The shift to higher-quality offerings as well as the addition of certain healthier options has been well received and
certainly a continually improving economic climate in the UK has also contributed. As good as our company-operated
growth was in EMEA in Q2, licensed store growth was even stronger. The Middle East continues to outperform the
comp growth in the double digits, while excellent results continued from Russia and Turkey, among others. The strong
performance in these markets supports our licensed-focus growth strategy in the region, where today nearly 60% of
stores are licensed, up nearly five percentage points from just a year ago.
In China and Asia-Pacific, the continuity of high-margin growth fuels our long-term aspirations for this dynamic
region. CAP total net revenues grew 24% to $265 million in Q2. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of revenue growth
in excess of 20%. In fact, in 2010 the first year we reported CAP as a separate region; revenues totaled only $407
million. Now in 2014, we are well on our way to exceeding $1 billion in annual revenue. It is impressive growth
trajectory for a tremendous market and a testament to the passion of our partners throughout Asia who deliver a
fantastic Starbucks experience day-in and day-out.
Our future in CAP remains extremely bright. The largest driver of our Q2 revenue growth was from new stores, which
totaled 174 net in the quarter and nearly 700 for the past 12 months. These new stores are delivering outstanding first
year sales and generating strong first year profitability. And the welcoming, sophisticated new store designs are
enhancing our already strong brand reputation in the region and driving trial from new customers. Our existing stores
are also thriving, delivering 7% comp growth in Q2, all as a result of increased traffic. This included a sharp decline in
comp growth in Thailand, where the impact on consumer from political instability weighed on the previously-strong
traffic trend. China grew even faster than the region overall and accelerated over the first quarter with well-balanced
contributions from seasonal promotions, core beverages, tea and food.
Finally, let me touch on our Channel Development business, which again contributed nicely to our record Q2
performance and is primed for a strong second half of fiscal 2014. Revenues of $370 million represented 10% growth
in Q2, in line with our previous guidance accelerating throughout the year. Our diverse premium single cup portfolio
was again the largest driver of revenue growth. We continue to gain share of the K-Cup market, experiencing 33%
growth in dollar sales for the quarter in U.S. food, drug and mass channels. And our recently amended agreement with
Keurig Green Mountain will help drive additional future growth and profitability from this platform.
We are nearing the anniversary of the May 2013 price reduction taken on packaged coffee. Encouragingly, we reached
10% revenue growth in Q2 even with this headwind. As that pricing affect normalizes in second half of the fiscal year
and as we continue to innovate in this space, we see packaged coffee as another growth driver that will sustain Channel
Development's double-digit revenue growth. Now I'm going to turn the call over to our new CFO, Scott Maw to take
you through consolidated results and targets for the full-year. Scott?
Scott Harlan Maw
Thanks, Troy, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to join you on my first quarterly earnings call as a CFO. It
was an outstanding quarter as our global operations continued to produce record-breaking results. We delivered comp
growth in the heart of our target range. We over-delivered against our earnings per share target. We also set Q2 records
for revenue, earnings, operating margin and operating cash flow. And we returned nearly $0.5 billion to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases. At the same time, we invested back into the business, including the addition

of 335 net new stores globally and by introducing La Boulange to over 3,300 U.S. company-operated and licensed
stores.
It's important to note that many of our metrics were impacted by unprecedented store closures and other disruption
from severe weather in the U.S. With that said, the 6% total company comp number was still very much in line with
our targets. We also saw excellent balance globally in our comp growth with two regions at 6% and one at 7%.
Consolidated net revenues were $3.9 billion, an increase of 9% from last year despite unfavorable impacts from both
weather and foreign currency exchange. Consolidated operating income grew 18% to $644 million in the second
quarter, a full $100 million higher than Q2 last year. Consolidated operating margin expanded 130 basis points to
16.6%. Importantly, margins expanded in all four reporting segments. 100 basis points of commodity cost favorability
coupled with strong sales leverage drove improvement.
Taking a quick look at regional profitability, operating income in the Americas grew to $606 million, an increase of
10% over last Q2. Operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 21.6%, due primarily to favorable commodity
costs. We did experience a bit of suppression to Q2 margins due to incremental marketing investment. However, we
anticipate greater leverage to resume in the second half of the year. The combination of solid company-operated and
licensed store growth is driving EMEA profitability higher as well, with operating income growing 240% over last year
to $18 million. We also drove significant expansion in operating margin, up 380 basis points to 5.7% in Q2, with
improvements in every line item. Sales leverage combined with our intense cost focus across the region both in stores
and in G&A were key drivers to the margin expansion.
Moving on to CAP, operating income of $87 million represented strong growth of 27% over last Q2. GAAP operating
margin expanded 80 basis points to 32.8% as we were able to successfully offset the unfavorable margin impact of the
portfolio mix shift towards company-operated stores through leverage on strong sales. And our joint venture
partnerships continued to thrive, with particular strength in South Korea and East China, driving 21% growth in JV
income in Q2. And flow-through for Channel Development in Q2 was exceptional, as we leveraged 10% revenue
growth into 35% profit growth to $127 million.
This was aided by another solid quarter from our North American coffee partnerships, primarily due to strong sales of
bottled frappuccino and iced coffee. Operating margin of 34.4% was a 660 basis point improvement over last year. The
largest driver of this improvement was favorable coffee cost, contributing 510 basis points. Sales leverage and cost
efficiencies also contributed to the margin expansion.
With regard to our other segments, revenue of $119 million was down slightly from last Q2. We saw continued growth
from our newer, emerging businesses including Teavana and Evolution Fresh. However, these were more than offset by
lower revenue from Seattle's Best Coffee as we lapsed significant inventory fill for new account activity last Q2. Our
operating loss in all other segments expanded slightly in the second quarter to $8 million due to investment in our
emerging businesses. Adding it all up, our robust global revenue growth and margin expansion drove earnings per
share to a Q2 record of $0.56.
Finally, a quick comment on liquidity. In addition to amounts available under our credit facility, we have $1.2 billion of
cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter. Q2 operating cash flow was $418 million, up 37% from last year,
driven by strong business unit performance and ongoing working capital efficiencies. Now that we're halfway through
fiscal 2014, I'll provide an updated outlook for the back half of the year.
With the over-delivery on EPS in Q2, we are now targeting full-year fiscal 2014 EPS in the range of $2.62 to $2.68.
That represents very strong 20% to 22% growth over fiscal 2013 when excluding last year's non-recurring gains due to
the sales of equity in Mexico, Chile and Argentina and the fourth quarter reporting of the Kraft litigation charge.
Specific to the third quarter, we continue to target EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.66, and with better visibility into our
business outlook for Q4, we are now targeting EPS in the range of $0.71 to $0.75. With respect to commodities, we
continue to expect a $0.09 to $0.10 EPS benefit for fiscal 2014, which is net of pricing taken in CPG last Q3 as well as
investments back into our business.

Our coffee needs are virtually locked for 2014 and more than 40% locked for fiscal 2015 at prices slightly favorable to
2014. So while coffee prices remain volatile, bouncing back up to over $2 per pound this week, our strategic coffee
buying practices have insulated us from an impact this year and will allow us to continue to target stronger earnings
growth next year.
Consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2014 is now expected at approximately 175 basis points to 200 basis points.
We continue to expect moderate improvements in the Americas, consistent with the first half of the year. In EMEA, we
remain on target for operating margin reaching the high single-digits as evidenced by our strong performance so far this
year. In CAP, we continue to target operating margin in the low 30% range, including year-over-year margin
deceleration in Q3 and Q4, as we [ph] lap (30:40) the extremely strong Japan performance of last Q3 and some
non-routine items in last Q4. And in Channel Development, we are now targeting approximately 500 basis points of
margin expansion in fiscal 2014, driven largely by lower coffee costs and leverage on revenue growth.
Due to a lower than anticipated tax rate in the first half of the year, we are taking our full-year tax rate target down
slightly to 34%. All other targets remain unchanged, including revenue growth of 10% or greater, strong global
comparable store sales growth in the mid-single digits, 1,500 net new stores globally and capital expenditures totaling
approximately $1.2 billion.
Halfway into fiscal 2014, we are extremely pleased with where our business stands. The first half of the year was
challenging with a soft holiday period, unprecedented winter weather and political instability in a number of our global
markets. However, our customers, our partners and our brand have been extraordinarily resilient. Through these
challenges, we have grown revenue by more than 10%, we've grown earnings 20% and we've expanded operating
margin 200 basis points. Our business model is built to adapt, it was built to scale and it was built to deliver results
even in the most challenging period. It has done that.
As we look to the second half of this year and beyond, we are extremely well positioned to benefit from investments in
our people, in our stores and in innovation to continue to deliver world-class shareholder value.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sara Senatore, Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you very much. I want to ask a quick question about a comment that Howard made
about being under-stored in the US. And I guess – or in North America. Obviously, it's very hard to poke holes in such
a strong comp. But one of the things that I noticed is you did step up unit growth over the past year and we have seen
transactions start to trend a little bit lower. So maybe I'm off here and maybe this is strictly weather and ex-weather,
your traffic would have been in the 4% to 5% range, but is there any reason to be concerned that maybe stepping up
unit growth, there is some cannibalization impact that happens? Thank you.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Thank you for the question. I wouldn't isolate any quarter or any period where there's been
any slight downturn in traffic as any indication of a slowing or a lesser opportunity than we strongly believe we have.
We've done a fair amount of research this year with regard to the share of coffee occasions that we have, as well as
looking at the density of our stores in relationship to revenue and share, and I can tell you that there is a strong
indication that we have a significant upside in the U.S. and in Canada.
Also, I think we've done a very good job over the last 12 months to 18 months in creating store designs that are linked
to real estate segmentation, which gives us the ability to almost create any configuration now in terms of size and the
kind of real estate it is. And as I indicated in my comments, this new drive-through opportunity that we think we have
both in the traditional sense and in these walk-up drive-throughs and drive-through onlys are very, very unique and
proving to be a very strong economic model.

And I think playing off Troy's comments, there's so much upside we believe in the incrementality of creating new day
parts fulfilling the needs that customers have other than the peak morning period, and as a result of that, we can put
Starbucks stores in areas that previously you probably thought were not the kind of stores that we would've gone after
because they were morning day part driven. And so I think we've got significant upside.
And I also want to say one other very quickly. This is not 2007 where we're going to grow the company in an
undisciplined way. The discipline, the thoughtfulness around our real estate strategy, both coupled with the qualitative
nature of design and the quantitative analysis that we're putting these decisions through, are very, very strong and very
disciplined but we do believe in short that we have a significant level of runway domestically and in Canada.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: And so just to follow up, you could maintain the traffic that we've seen so strong with this
additional growth?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: I don't see any reason in the near term that we can't have mid single-digits in our company
in terms of comp growth, and a significant portion of that over time will be transactional.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from David Palmer, RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Hi and congratulations on the quarter. You said in the opening remarks that you're starting to
leverage My Starbucks Rewards with more directed marketing, which I found interesting. Could you expand on how
you might be evolving your marketing and what impact that will have. And relatedly, is it possible that you'll be
making alliances with retailers to find ways to share loyalty programs and perhaps spread this targeted approach across
channel to get – these benefits to the Channel Development segment? Thank you.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Thanks, David. Adam Brotman, our Chief Digital Officer is here. Let's let him answer that
question.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: Sure. On the first part, David, we are seeing an increasing amount of ability for us to learn
what is really relevant for our customers because of the data that we have from their card and loyalty purchases. So that
is driving our ability to drive incremental revenue in our core business through personalized offers and use more
relevant communications in general. And then as far as the second part of your question, we are indeed seeing the
expansion of stars as currency and stars down the aisle, as Howard mentioned and as Troy mentioned. And that's
something that we are going to continue to build on. So we mentioned we've had nearly 5 million stars redeemed
already. We continue to see better results than we expected in terms of stars down the aisle and we plan on continuing
that.
<A - Troy Alstead>: I must underscore something Howard said in his remarks and Adam just alluded to, but it's
important to recognize this. We are in the very, very early stages of building out this entire digital program,
understanding how to connect with customers across multiple channels through the loyalty program, the experiences
they have in stores and with the power of the stars that we're already seeing, we're already seeing and still early days as
the translates down the aisle, very early days, so much more to come ahead of us.

<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations as well. I wanted to ask about the traffic trends in
the Americas segment being up 2% this quarter. And I know you referenced weather several times, and I think Troy
you mentioned that the traffic accelerated as the quarter progressed, which seems to mirror the weather impact. But
maybe you could just talk about the context of that number and what you think may be the underlying trend might've
been outside of the weather impact?
<A - Troy Alstead>: David, let me start that and I'll have Cliff Burrows give us some expansion on it. First of all,
there's – as we said, there's no question it was an acute, extreme weather quarter, and of course that is underlying our
performance. I don't – I'm not going to put a number on what things would've been without, but it was a – in terms of
the quarters we've mentioned in our history, we had more stores closed and more disruption to opening hours than
we've ever experienced before, since we kept track of things. So a very acute quarter.
With that said, we couldn't be more ecstatic that we delivered 6% comp growth in that kind of environment, and I think
that speaks to the power of the brand, what our food program [ph] is doing, (39:39) loyalty in it that's driving
customers, the experiences we're providing every day. All of those things are what has helped us overcome what
everybody else out there is experiencing as flat to negative growth as a result of weather. It allowed us to deliver 6%
comp growth. We did see an acceleration, as I mentioned, throughout the quarter. Again not to comment specifically on
what it would've been with or without, but a very, very strong result overall and something we're pleased with. And
perhaps Cliff can add some more texture.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Yes, I'm not sure there was a great deal of strategy. Just to say we're really pleased with the
quarter. Not only did it disrupt our lives and our operation, the extreme weather, but it also obviously disrupted the
lives of our customers and they changed their routines, they changed their habits. And we will see over time I'm sure
the balance particularly in transaction change. But as was said by Howard earlier, if we look forward, we are confident
that we can maintain that mid-single digit comp growth and the balance particularly in transaction will change I'm sure
from quarter-to-quarter.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: As we sit here heading into spring and summer, I don't think we've had this strong of a
pipeline of product that we think is really I think on target for what our customers are expecting from us in terms of
beverage innovation. And I think we're all hoping that we're going to get a very unique level of response, given the
power of Oprah Winfrey.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Glass, Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thanks. Scott, I know you said that coffee is still volatile, et cetera, and you've locked some in
for 2015. But if you had to lock it in today around these prices, what kind of headwind do you think it proposes to 2015
and, perhaps more importantly, I think earlier in the quarter you talked informally about some offsets you think you
could have in a number of areas. What are those, and have you evolved your thinking about how big those offset cost
opportunities are?
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: Yes. We haven't really quantified it because it depends on so many things. It depends on
where the market is, how much pricing we do between now and then. We can obviously calculate it at any point in
time, but given where we are today and the fact that frankly over the last couple of months we haven't been pricing a lot
of coffee, because of the length of our position both for this year and next year, we, a bit have the luxury of time if you
will to see how things settle out in Brazil.
To the second part of your question, to be more specific, when we look at various scenarios, when we do the
calculations, we know that up and down the P&L there are all sorts of things we can do to offset, taking a look at
investments we make, taking a look at our cost structure, and those are things we'll do if we need to as things get more
clear on the coffee price side. The thing to remember is that coffee is only about 15% to 20% of our COGS and

occupancy line on the P&L. It's less than 10% of our total operating costs. And so, just to sort of scale it, that gives us
quite a bit of flexibility on things we can do.
<A - Troy Alstead>: And John, I'll perhaps underscore some of what Scott said, and step up a bit and look at this in a
historical context. We have over a lot of years faced these kind of movements, consistently time after time, the last time
just being a few years ago. And it's important to remember that during all of those times, we delivered very strong
earnings growth margin expansion and in fact over-delivered in our earnings range during the period of that difficult
coffee cost prices just a few years ago. So my point being that number one, we are as protected as I think anybody and
more so than most with respect to forward pricing and contracts. We have long relationships with our farmers and have
great confidence in delivery and our ability to continue to manage what's happening in the marketplace. And we also
have increased discipline and capabilities around managing the P&L as Scott has referred to, it gives us every ability to
continue to deliver very strong growth almost despite what may happen in the broader coffee markets.
<Q - John S. Glass>: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Sharon Zackfia, William Blair.
<Q - Sharon M. Zackfia>: Hi, good afternoon. Howard, you made some interesting comments about licensing out the
technology and being a consumer analyst – I'm not a technology analyst. I'm just curious as you think about it as a
company, what would be the potential risks to you licensing out your technology?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Let's go back to what I said so there's no misunderstanding. We've been approached by tech
companies and national retailers as to whether or not we would consider licensing or white labeling the Starbucks
mobile platform. I think you have to ask yourself, why are they asking us to do this? We have such a significant lead,
there isn't a company that we can identify that's processing anything close to a million transactions a week. And we're
now way over five million. Most of the national retailers did not invest ahead of the growth curve, they do not have the
capability in-house, at this point, to really execute this and to fully understand it. The tech companies themselves
obviously have the tech background and the insight, but they do not have the interface on the physical side with the
consumer to execute it.
So we are in a very unique position, having kind of solved the chicken and egg problem of both the digital technology
and obviously the interface with the consumer. I think we don't look at it as a risk. We look at it clearly as a very
significant upside. And the question we're asking ourselves, and we're asking it through a very positive lens, is we
strongly believe that there's an opportunity to create a monetization here that will be very complementary to the core
business, and in a way could add a flywheel effect of exposing more people to the Starbucks platform. We have not
made the decision as to what we will do, but I can share with you that we are actively pursuing a number of
conversations because we strongly believe that, one, there's a tidal wave of consumer adoption, smartphones and
mobile commerce. And we are in the sweet spot of being in a position to take advantage of that in a very unique
fashion. And I should say domestically and internationally, don't forget we're doing this now in over 20 countries.

Your next question comes from Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you. Can I ask you to talk a bit about the Channel Development segment and the
opportunities both in the U.S. and internationally over the next year or so?
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Sure, Joe.

Channel Development, speak to that.

<A - John Culver>: Yes. Thanks a lot, Joe. Obviously, we're very excited on the quarter performance of double-digit
revenue growth of 10%, operating income growing at 35% and margin expansion at over 600 basis points. So
momentum in the business continues to grow, and particularly as it relates to our K-Cup execution. For the quarter,
K-Cups grew 33% on the quarter versus a category growth of about 28%. And we finished the quarter with the highest
share ever since we launched K-Cups. So really strong momentum in that business. And with the new agreement with
Keurig, we're in a much better position to add SKUs as well as to accelerate the growth down the aisle as it relates to
K-Cups.
On the packaged coffee side, we've also done a lot of work around innovation in that area, introducing the new package
graphics as well as introducing new Blonde SKUs into the mix, as well as adding to the Pike Place Roast expansion as
well. Stars down the aisle continues to be a big piece of the growth in Channel Development, as was previously
mentioned, five million stars redeemed. And really leveraging the strategic flywheel that we are building on the digital
platforms through our retail stores, and driving those customers from our retail stores down the aisle.
From an international perspective, we're very bullish on the opportunity internationally, particularly as it relates to
ready-to-drink and the opportunity that exists there. We have strong businesses that have been built in Japan and Korea.
We've launched China earlier this year, and we continue to see very strong momentum in performance as it relates to
the international business. And we are making investments in that area. Jeff Hansberry, who recently ran Channel
Development, is now in Asia running not only our retail business, but is charged with integrating the channel business
into the retail business there. So a lot of positive momentum, and we're very excited about the future.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Is the ready-to-drink opportunity a North American opportunity as well, or do you see that
as international? I mean I realize you do some ready-to-drink already as I asked that.
<A - John Culver>: Yeah, Joe. I think it's both. I think we've got a very strong ready-to-drink business here in the U.S.
We've got an 11% share of the coffee and energy category. We grew share in the quarter 40 basis points here in the
U.S. and we've got a strong level of base business with our bottled frappuccino, our double shot, and then a pipeline of
innovation coming as it relates to iced coffee, as it relates to refreshers and then also our Discoveries multi-serve
product that we've introduced recently in the last couple of quarters. So both domestically as well as internationally
RTD will be a big piece of the growth opportunity for the channel business overall.

Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Karen A. Holthouse>: Hi. Congratulations on a great comp in the quarter despite all of the headwinds. One of
the things I think there is a huge opportunity for longer term is the lunch business. And when you look at, sort of,
driving that lunch and afternoon day part, have there been differences in adaption in suburban markets where having
drive-throughs might add a unique sort of convenience factor to that? And then, also as you have started to do some
targeted offers around it, how successful has that been at starting to drive frequency in the day part versus the core
breakfast day part?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Karen, it's Cliff Burrows. Thanks for the question. Obviously our focus over the last – really
the last two years has been the acquisition of La Boulange, finding this fantastic range of products and capability and
then building the infrastructure to roll it out, and as we said today, we're over 6,000 stores and 2,500 licensed stores. At
the same time as we're doing that, we are starting now to really test lunch and we will be starting that test in a
significant number of stores in the summer, and I would expect us to start rolling that out in 2015 and get to most of the
markets during that time.
Lunch over the last couple years we have seen growth with our paninis, with our salads and with our sandwich range,
so we know the opportunity is there, but we know we're only just beginning. What we will be doing is leveraging what
we've learned around breakfast and that in part is not only in pastries, but is what we've done recently with breakfast

sandwiches. So that basis plus the infrastructure around the three temperature distribution platform and freezers in
stores gives us opportunities to serve all our stores, sometimes remote markets and sometimes drive-through.
One of the things that have been really encouraging for us is the strength of adoption and purchase of food items
through the drive-through. And I think we have really cracked the code on how do we optimize the customer
experience with the connection with our bracelets; how do we manage a tight range of products to best serve our
customers. So you're going to see us adapt the range for drive-through, you're going to see us adapt it for remote
markets and you're going to see us utilize our three temperature distribution. So a lot to come in there and we're excited
about what the opportunity is in 2015. We started the journey through food, delighted with the quality that we're being
able to deliver and we keep getting stronger and stronger. So much more to come.

Your next question comes from Jason West, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jason T. West>: Thanks. To touch on that same topic a little bit. You mentioned, I think, La Boulange added a
couple points to comps in the quarter. I was wondering if you could kind of frame that versus what had been adding in
prior quarters. And there has been talk about some hiccups in the rollout there and some press articles about the
consumer response to some of the items. If you could just go over how you feel about the success of what you have
rolled out. Do you need to make changes in the way things have been executed, whether it's product or the actual
rollout?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Troy and myself are both fine to answer the question. Jason, thank you for that question.
There is no doubt the challenge we set for ourselves to transform our food business in a very quick time, we are really,
really delighted with the progress. We set ourselves a two-year timeframe to roll this out across the whole of the U.S.,
to put in a consolidated food platform distribution channels and transform the way we delivered food to our customers.
And we have learned a great deal.
One of the advantages with having this in-house capability is we can check and adjust very, very quickly. Each rollout
we've done has gotten stronger than the one before. The ones that we rolled out since the turn of the year have been
absolutely fantastic. We've listened to the customers. Sometimes we will change the ingredients; sometimes we'll
change the shape of product. In our stores next week, will be the new ingredients in a familiar form for Lemon Loaf
Cake, which I think will be extremely well received. Add to that the strength in the breakfast sandwich platform where
we're up a 150% and add to that a fantastic response we've had to the croissants. We're really, really pleased with it and
we're building a new capability.
<A - Troy Alstead>: Thank you, Cliff. And Jason, let me add just a couple of points to that. First of all, food in most
recent quarters had been closer to a point or strong point of comps, so we're seeing an acceleration of the contribution
from food. And remember that is coming despite the fact that food is only in three-fourths or so of the U.S. system and
we're already seeing that significant contribution. So it's very powerful. It's a huge contribution to the business. It is
natural and normal in any major system rollout we do going back to the days when we rolled out frappuccino to
refreshers a couple of years ago. So we'll always do learnings and check and adjust, and most importantly focused on
what are we hearing from our customers and if there's a place for us to respond, we'll do that.
It's important to note there's nothing more that we're doing in La Boulange than we do in any of those rollouts
historically. So frankly, it's been a bit overblown what these changes or issues are. There aren't any. In fact, throughput
will be at its highest level – highest historical level this year. There's absolutely no slowdown in the business. Food is
an important contribution to comp growth. We expect that that tailwind from food will continue for the next year or
two at least as we continue the bakery rollout and then move on to lunch. So very significant contributions
overwhelming, overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers and couldn't be more excited about what food will
mean for us in the quarters ahead.

Your next question comes from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Hi. Great. Thank you. I think I have two questions related to the same point. Store operating
expenses in the Americas didn't lever in this quarter despite the comps. Was it something like weather that maybe
influenced your ability to pick up time and labor in and out of the stores? Was there something unusual that might not
repeat? Secondly, maybe related to that line or maybe not, when we see the use of the Starbucks card grow mobile
which is now 14% and is growing very, very quickly, does the consumer use of mobile allow you to perhaps change the
cost structure in the store – significantly enhance or change the customer experience in perhaps ways that we're not
thinking as more and more consumers do use the mobile platform to interact with your store?
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: So I'll take the first part and then I'll turn it over to Adam for the second part. This is Scott.
There's a number of puts and takes in the store operating expenses but I would say that it was definitely impacted by
both, for the Americas, by both weather and foreign exchange as revenue was impacted. So we did see core operating
leverage excluding that.
<A - Adam B. Brotman>: And mobile payment is definitely helping us with the, both the customer experience and the
store operational experience in terms of key areas such as throughput. We are taking some of the fastest and easiest
ways to pay. We're taking reloads out of the line and giving customers more information literally at their fingertips as
they're waiting in line around personalized offers, where they are with their loyalty status in their star count.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: So in terms of the longer-term, John, it's Cliff, I would really see us utilizing any efficiency
we get from mobile payments to focus on our customer experience. We are introducing fantastic lineup whether it's
new frappuccinos this summer, whether it's the Teavana Opera Chai tea or whether it's Fizzio later in the year, so any
benefit we can get we're going to use that opportunity to share these fantastic new products with our customers.

Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you very much. Actually just one clarification and then a question.
Troy, the clarification, I think I have heard maybe commentary recently, I'm not sure if it was from yourself or others,
but just specific to commodities and everyone's focusing on coffee. I was just wondering, I thought I heard that dairy
should be more concerning and we should be paying more attention to dairy versus coffee. I was wondering if you
could add some color similar to what you provided on coffee in terms on how you protect yourself on dairy and what
mix that is. And then, my question is just you ownership structure broadly speaking, both in the US and abroad. Just
wondering whether there are any shifts, or directionally, which way you guys are thinking in terms of – in the U.S., I
guess it's 60% company ownership. I'm wondering whether you think about moving that more towards licensing. And
obviously, you've already done that in the EMEA. But I think you mentioned it's now 60% licensed. Looking back a
few years, it was 40%. So just wondering is there further opportunity to take that to 80% or whether 60% is the right
amount in EMEA? Thanks.
<A - Troy Alstead>: So let me have Scott take the first question related to dairy commodities and what we're doing in
that space, and then I'll talk about ownership.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: Yes. Thanks, Jeffrey. I think the first thing I'd say about dairy is we do hedge dairy out
about three to six months. The challenge with dairy is the market for hedging and price protecting is just much
shallower and much shorter than it is for coffee but we do protect ourselves out a couple quarters. So we've been able to

manage through some of the price increases that we've seen in dairy. With that said, we have seen some headwind. We
still – it's in that commodities cost favorability of $0.09 to $.10, so that's all-inclusive. So we're completely confident
we can cover it, but we do spend a lot of time looking at ways that we can hedge and manage dairy costs.
<A - Troy Alstead>: And with respect to global ownership, let me speak to each region individually because there a
somewhat varying answer. In the U.S. we've always been predominantly company operated. I expect we will always be
predominantly company operated. We're about 60% of our stores in the U.S. owned and operated. In the coming years
we see a tremendous opportunity to continue accelerating licensed store growth, so it's likely that licensed stores will
grow somewhat faster than new company-owned units, even though we are accelerating both in the U.S. in the coming
years, given the opportunity that we see. And even with that licensed store growth, we will remain still predominantly
company operated in the U.S. and very, very strong returns both at the P&L level and also return on capital even with
that predominantly company-operated structure.
In EMEA, we began discussing and articulating with all of you a year or two ago our very focused strategy to migrate
more toward a licensed structure and we are well on that path as I commented in my earlier remarks and we'll continue
on that path. We're not at the ending point yet of the licensed opportunities we have. We see opportunity to add a
higher return on capital company-owned stores in places, but far and away our growth will be dominated by licensed
execution in Europe and that will continue over a long period of time to shift the ownership mixed more towards
licensed in EMEA.
And then in Asia-Pacific it's actually somewhat different. We've been predominantly licensed going back to our earliest
days of opening in that region back in the late 1990s, and we are on a progression out for shifting that mix a bit closer
to company operated, particularly as we accelerate growth in China with the amazing returns and the huge
opportunities we see in China. So Asia-Pacific will slowly push a bit more toward company-owned over time, although
still likely remain 50-50 or stronger for licensed over the long run.

Your next question comes from Diane Geissler, CLSA.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: Hello.
<A - Howard S. Schultz>: Hi, Diane.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: I wanted to ask the role on the evening hours, moving from tests into launch. Not every store
is going to be conducive to having evening hours. Can you talk about what percentage of the store base you think will
add that day part and also, kind of, the timeframe that you would envision?
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Yes. Thanks, Diane. It's Cliff. We have been testing evenings in about 25 stores in a number
of cities across the U.S. We've been testing in urban locations and suburban locations. What we have seen is the wine
and beer gives the opportunity or the occasion for people to use our stores in a later day part and they use it as a
meeting place, they use it as a relaxing place, they use it for informal social groups to meet.
What we're seeing, which is really positive, it's not just about wine, but it's about the shareable plates of the food and
it's also people buying our traditional beverages, our core beverages, and that's a really healthy place to be because the
tone and mood of the store evolves. We feel very, very confident this is now – it's resonating with our customers. It
gives us an opportunity to grow the day part an increase our revenues and profits in those stores. We see, as we said
earlier, that we can have 1,000 or more over the next several years. We haven't got a final limit on it and we're just
going to learn and grow our way into it, but it's extremely significant in terms of the number and it is accretive to
everything we're doing in the stores.
<A - Scott Harlan Maw>: She was asking also about hours.

<A - Clifford Burrows>: I'm not sure the hours will vary greatly, because many of our stores stay open quite late. And
so the population, it just gives us, I wouldn't describe it as a peak, but it makes the stores much more alive. And we will
push those hours out and adjust them as we do now. I don't see a major cost increase by expanding the hours. I see us
making more use of the hours we're open.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: Okay. Thank you.

The last question comes from Keith Siegner with UBS. You may ask your question.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thank you. And strong quarter, everyone. Cliff, one more question for you. High quality,
rapid customized service has always been this hallmark of the retail stores. And just to circle back, you know, on top of
the strong underlying traffic growth, this moving to the three temperature, you know, model, as you add the La
Boulange breakfast with more warming and now with Fizzio and then La Boulange lunch, can you talk about the
operations hurdles of pulling this all off and maybe tie in what the customer feedback has told you – not about the
products but about the service and is it keeping up with the standards and how you're dealing with this. Thank you.
<A - Clifford Burrows>: Thanks Keith for the question. And [ph] really add aha (65:37) in everything we do. we need
to make sure we take care of the work our partners do and that they are able to be successful and proud of it. We
recognize the tremendous substance they've done over the last 40 odd years. And they continue to deliver amazing
experiences for our customers. Everything we do we are testing to make sure it operationally is as simple as it can be,
that it's relevant for the customer and enhances the overall experience. There's no doubt with every new product there is
a learning curve. And we do everything we can to give the right tools, to give the right support.
I do believe the work we're doing around digital with mobile, technology, over time that will help and make it a much
more seamless experience. Obviously as we build new stores, as we refurbish new stores, we look at ways to make it
more efficient. And that journey will carry on. When we look at Fizzio, the simplicity of making those beverages, and
we are learning from the work we did with frappuccino reinventions several years ago, just to try and make that work
simple. So we're very, very conscious of it. And one, we've got a long line of sight to the launch of these products, two,
we are testing them, and three, we just keep checking and adjusting, involving our partners and listening to customers
to make sure we check and adjust. And I think that's the way Keith, we feel confident and I'm very aware that we will
focus on the experience. And that relationship between our partner and customer is key to our success.
