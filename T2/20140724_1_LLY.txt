Similar to our last call, this morning we're bringing more of our senior leaders into the room here to participate and to
answer your questions, and we hope that this enhances the quality of the information we provide you during these
sessions. Joining me on today's call are: Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Jan Lundberg, our President of
Research Laboratories; Sue Mahony, President of Lilly Oncology, Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes; Dave
Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines, Chito Zulueta, President of Emerging Markets; Jeff Simmons, President of
Elanco Animal Health; and Ilissa Rassner, Brad Robling, and Phil Johnson of Lilly's Investor Relations team.
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current
expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide three
and those outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
information we provide about our products and our pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not
intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Before we get into our Q2 results in detail, I'd like to offer this context. Even as we feel the full brunt of our patent
expiries, we continue to execute our strategy. Our performance is in line with our expectations, and we're on track to
meet the goals we have shared with you for the year. And the steady advance of our pipeline only strengthens our
confidence in our innovation-based strategy.
CYRAMZA launch to a good reception in the U.S. Empagliflozin has been granted approval in the EU. Our insulin
glargine product has been recommended for approval in Europe, and we presented positive data on a number of
late-stage molecules at the recent ASCO and ADA meetings. We anticipate a number of additional regulatory actions
this year as well as additional regulatory submissions and important Phase 3 data readouts. And we continued to
manage our expenses rigorously, even as we invest to ensure successful launches and continue to advance our pipeline.
With that, let's turn to the key events since last quarter's call. Since our last call, we launched CYRAMZA in the U.S. as
a single-agent treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction
adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after prior chemotherapy. We're pleased with the uptake we're seeing
with the reports we're receiving from the sales organization and with feedback from customers on their experience to
date.
We've also had a number of positive developments on the regulatory front spanning diabetes and oncology. The
European Commission approved empagliflozin or JARDIANCE, indicated in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes to
improve glycemic control in adults. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim anticipate
launch of the product in European countries to begin this quarter.
In the U.S., Boehringer Ingelheim resubmitted the empagliflozin NDA to the FDA. This was deemed a Class 1
resubmission, which carries a two-month review period. Consequently, we expect FDA action this quarter.
In Europe, Boehringer Ingelheim submitted the fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin and metformin. Also in
Europe, the CHMP issued a positive opinion recommending approval of our new insulin glargine product for the
treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. This product, which is part of the Lilly Boehringer Ingelheim diabetes
alliance, is the first biosimilar insulin recommended for approval in the European Union.
Moving now to oncology, in the U.S., based on data from the RAINBOW study, we submitted a supplemental BLA for
CYRAMZA as combination therapy in patients with second-line gastric cancer. This will be a standard review, and
therefore we expect FDA action in the first half of 2015. In Europe, where our initial submission was based on the
REGARD monotherapy study, we've now incorporated the RAINBOW data in our submission dossier, which is
currently under review.
And finally, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track status for our BLA for necitumumab as first-line treatment
of metastatic squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. We continue to expect FDA submission before the end of this year.
In clinical news, we had a number of detailed data presentations at the annual meetings of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology and the American Diabetes Association. At the ASCO meeting, we presented detailed data from the
Phase 3 REVEL trial studying ramucirumab in second-line non-small-cell lung cancer. In this study, CYRAMZA

demonstrated statistically significant improvements across multiple efficacy endpoints, including overall survival,
progression-free survival, and overall response rate. The improvement of overall survival and progression-free survival
on the CYRAMZA plus docetaxel arm was consistent across the majority of subgroups, including non-squamous and
squamous histologies. We remain on track to meet our commitment for regulatory submission in the second half of
2014.
We also presented detailed data from the Phase 3 SQUIRE trial studying necitumumab in first-line squamous
non-small-cell lung cancer. In the Phase 3 SQUIRE trial, patients with Stage 4 metastatic squamous non-small-cell lung
cancer showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease control
rate. As I mentioned earlier, we intend to submit this BLA by year end.
Finally, following our initial disclosure at AACR [American Association for Cancer Research] in April, we presented
additional data from the Phase 1 trial of our CDK4/6 inhibitor, abemaciclib. These data were from two different cohort
expansions, one as a single agent in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, and the other in combination
with fulvestrant in patients with advanced breast cancer. Based on these data as well as the data presented at AACR,
we'll begin Phase 3 trials later this year in both advanced breast cancer and advanced lung cancer. We're pleased with
the single-agent activity we've seen with abemaciclib as well as with the product safety profile and believe we could
have a best-in-class molecule.
At the ADA meeting, we presented detailed data from three of the Phase 3 AWARD trials of dulaglutide. There was
significant investor interest in the AWARD-6 trial comparing once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5-milligrams to once-daily
liraglutide 1.8-milligrams. Results from this study showed that dulaglutide 1.5-milligrams was non-inferior to the
highest approved dose of VICTOZA in the reduction of HbA1c from baseline. This was the first head-to-head Phase 3
trial of a GLP-1 to show non-inferiority to liraglutide 1.8-milligrams on this important clinical measure.
Detailed data was also presented for AWARD-2 and AWARD-4 head-to-head trials comparing dulaglutide to insulin
glargine with and without mealtime insulin. Both trials showed that once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5-milligrams provided
significantly greater reductions in blood glucose for patients with Type 2 diabetes. Additionally in both studies,
hypoglycemia rates were lower for dulaglutide 1.5-milligram treated patients compared to insulin glargine.
We're very pleased with the results of these three Phase 3 studies for dulaglutide as well as with those of the Phase 3
studies presented at last year's ADA. If approved, dulaglutide will be the only GLP-1 receptor agonist that is both
once-weekly and ready to use. We believe it could provide patients and physicians an important new treatment option
for Type 2 diabetes.
In the quarter, we also issued two top line press releases for Phase 3 trials, one for our basal insulin peglispro, and the
other for CYRAMZA in second-line hepatocellular cancer. We announced positive top line results for three completed
Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with Type 2 diabetes for basal insulin peglispro, which is being studied as a once-daily
treatment for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferior reduction in HbA1c
compared to insulin glargine was met in all three trials. Having met the primary endpoints, superiority for HbA1c
lowering was examined. And in all three trials, basal insulin peglispro showed a statistically superior reduction in
HbA1c compared with insulin glargine. In addition, in all three clinical trials, patients taking basal insulin peglispro
experienced statistically significant lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia and had comparable to statistically
significant less weight gain than those taking insulin glargine. We remain on track to issue a top line press release this
quarter on our Phase 3 trials in patients with Type 1 diabetes and to make regulatory filings by the first quarter of next
year.
For CYRAMZA, we announced that the Phase 3 REACH trial in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver
cancer, did not meet its primary endpoint. Overall survival favored the CYRAMZA arm but was not statistically
significant. Although the REACH study did not meet its primary endpoint, we are encouraged by the efficacy seen in
specific sub-populations. We plan to discuss these results with regulatory authorities to inform future trials.
In business development news, we announced last week an immunotherapy collaboration with UK-based Immunocore
Limited to research and potentially develop novel T-cell-based cancer therapies. This collaboration will result in a third

quarter charge of $45 million or $0.03 per share of EPS after tax that we've incorporated into our revised guidance for
2014.
Also, we closed the acquisition of Lohmann Animal Health, a privately held Germany company that is a global leader
in poultry vaccines. This acquisition establishes Elanco as a global poultry leader and solidifies Elanco's vaccine
presence and manufacturing capabilities. We also entered into an agreement, contingent upon certain closing
conditions, to sell the feed additives portion of Lohmann's business to a management-led group.
Finally, along with Sanofi, we announced an agreement to pursue regulatory approval of non-prescription Cialis. Under
the terms of the agreement, Sanofi acquired the exclusive rights to market Cialis OTC following Sanofi's receipt of all
necessary regulatory approvals.
In other news, the English High Court determined that the vitamin dosage regimen patents for ALIMTA in the UK,
France, Italy, and Spain would not be infringed by a generic competitor that has stated an intent to market certain
alternative salt forms of pemetrexed in those countries upon expiry of the ALIMTA compound patents in late 2015. We
strongly disagree with this ruling and have appealed the ruling to the Court of Appeal.
In the U.S., based on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Akamai versus Limelight Networks, Teva and APP filed an
unopposed motion asking the Court of Appeals to remand the ALIMTA case back to the District Court to consider the
issue of infringement. No date has been set for a hearing with the District Court. Note that this does not affect the
District Court's decision that our patent is valid. We remain confident that this patent is both valid and enforceable
against generic manufacturers.
A Brazilian labor court ruled against our local subsidiary in a case alleging some employees who were exposed to
hazardous materials in a manufacturing facility operated by the company between 1977 and 2003. We believe the
decision is entirely without merit and we filed an appeal.
Finally, during the second quarter, we executed share repurchases totaling $145 million under our $5 billion share
repurchase program.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter.
Phil Johnson
Thanks, John. First I'll review our GAAP results and then discuss a few non-GAAP measures to provide some
additional insight into the underlying trends in our business.
Moving to slide seven, you can see that our Q2 revenue was $4.9 billion, which is 17% lower than Q2 2013. This
decrease in revenue reflects a decline of $1.1 billion in U.S. Cymbalta sales following the loss of exclusivity in
December last year. In addition, U.S. sales of Evista declined nearly $145 million following that product's loss of
exclusivity in March of this year. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., the rest of our worldwide revenue grew
6%, mainly from volume.
Recall that last quarter we stated that our Japan revenue benefited by about $70 million from higher customer purchases
in advance of an increase in a local consumption tax. As expected, this quarter customer purchases in Japan were
reduced by a similar amount. This negative impact on our overall corporate revenue growth was largely offset by a
benefit in the U.S. related to an adjustment in the reserves for managed Medicaid rebates and discounts.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased 4.4 percentage points, also driven by the loss of U.S. exclusivity for
Cymbalta and Evista.
This quarter the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold resulted in a modest addition to cost
of sales while in last year's quarter it resulted in a modest reduction to cost of sales. Excluding this FX effect from both
2013 and 2014, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 3.4 percentage points, from 79.9% in Q2 2013 to 76.5%
in Q2 this year. As in prior calls, we've included a supplementary slide providing our gross margin percent for the last

10 quarters with and without this FX effect.
Non-GAAP measures are shown on slide eight. Total operating expense, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A,
decreased 11% or nearly $340 million versus Q2 of 2013. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses were down
11% while R&D was down 10%. The reduction in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses was due to the
reduction in U.S. sales and marketing activities for Cymbalta and Evista as well as our ongoing cost containment
efforts. The decline in R&D expenses was driven primarily by a reduction in late-stage development costs.
Other income and expense was net income of $54 million in Q2 2014 compared to a net income of $12 million in the
second quarter of 2013, with this modest change driven by a variety of miscellaneous items.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 22%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points compared to Q2 last year. The main reason for
this increase in the tax rate is a lapse of R&D tax credit at the end of last year.
At the bottom line, net income declined 42% and earnings per share declined 41%. As in Q1, this decline is significant
but very much in line with our expectations and places us on track to achieve our full-year guidance. In slide nine we
provide the same reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted information for our year-to-date results.
Moving to slide 10, you'll find a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS, and additional details about our
reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. As I mentioned last quarter, nearly all our peers
exclude amortization of intangibles from their non-GAAP results while we include this expense. For your modeling
purposes, please note that we recognized amortization expense of $134 million, representing 2.7% of revenue this
quarter.
Now let's look at how price, rate, and volume affected our revenue growth. Given a significant decline in U.S.
Cymbalta and Evista sales, I'll provide you with some color on how that affected revenue growth this quarter.
On slide 11, you can see the total revenue decline of 17% in Q2 2014, which is shown in the yellow box in the middle
of the page, and that this decline was entirely driven by volume. Price added about 1% to revenue growth, while the
impact of FX was nil. Excluding U.S. Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our worldwide revenue grew 6%, with just over
half of that growth coming from volume and the rest from price.
Touching on some of the geographic highlights, for the quarter, U.S. pharma revenue declined 33%, driven by a
volume decline of 36%. Excluding Cymbalta and Evista, the rest of our U.S. pharma revenue increased 13%,
comprised of 5% from volume and 8% from price. The benefit I mentioned earlier from the adjustment for managed
Medicaid utilization had a positive effect, adding two percentage points of this growth in the form of price.
In Japan, as I mentioned earlier, our Q1 revenue benefited by roughly $70 million, as customers increased purchases in
advance of an increase in a consumption tax that went into effect on April 1. As expected, customer purchases in Q2
were reduced by a similar amount, leading to a decline in our Q2 Japan pharma revenue. Specifically, Japan pharma
revenue declined 15% this quarter, driven by a volume decline of 10%. Adjusting for the timing of customer purchases,
our Q2 pharma Japan volume would have increased 5%. You'll also see that the weaker yen is still reducing our growth
rate but at a much lower rate than in prior quarters.
In emerging markets, we saw good performance growth of 8%, partially offset by a 4% negative impact from foreign
exchange. Volume growth of 7% was driven by Humulin, Forteo, Humalog, Vancocin, and Trajenta. Sales in our
largest emerging markets' country, China, grew 15%.
Finally, Elanco Animal Health posted revenue growth of 11%. Strong growth in our U.S. food animal business and in
both food and companion animal products OUS was partially offset by lower U.S. companion animal sales. Also, at the
end of April, we close the acquisition of Lohmann Animal Health. This added nearly $25 million in revenue, primarily
OUS, contributing four percentage points to our worldwide Animal Health growth.

Derica W. Rice
Thanks, Phil.
On slide 12 you'll see the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the growth rates for select items of our income
statement. FX had almost no impact on our revenue or operating expenses this quarter. As Phil mentioned, FX did
cause a modest increase in the growth of cost of sales, with a corresponding negative effect on operating income and
EPS. As result, FX caused our operating income and EPS to decline an additional two to three percentage points.
Slide 13 shows our pipeline as of July 17. Changes since our last earnings call are highlighted with green arrows
showing progression and red arrows showing attrition. As John discussed earlier, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim
received European approval for empagliflozin. In addition, we began Phase 2 testing of a biologic for diabetes. And we
began Phase 1 testing of two biologics, one for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, and the other for
ulcerative colitis. And we terminated development of five assets, three in Phase 2 and two in Phase 1.
Next let me remind you of our key events for 2014 and review our updated 2014 financial guidance. In the first 6.5
months of the year, we're pleased with the progress we've made on the key events we laid out for you at the beginning
of the year. As you can see from the green check marks on slide 14, we've had a productive first half of the year,
advancing our pipeline and sharing Phase 3 data. While I will not go through each item on the slide, I'll give you a
reminder of the potential key events for the remainder of this year and provide updates along the way.
As John mentioned, later this year we'll begin Phase 3 trials for abemaciclib, our CDK4/6 inhibitor, in both advanced
breast cancer and advanced lung cancer. We no longer expect to move blosozumab, our anti-sclerostin antibody for
osteoporosis, into Phase 3 in 2014. The formulation we plan to take into Phase 3 produced injection site reactions at a
higher rate than desired. We'll conduct additional work with the formulation used in Phase 2 before moving forward.
With respect to Phase 3 data, we expect to report top line results this year with detailed data presentations next year for
our basal insulin peglispro studies in patients with Type 1 diabetes, ramucirumab for metastatic colorectal cancer, and
three immunology assets, ixekizumab, tabalumab, and baricitinib.
In addition to the submissions we've already completed this year, we continue to expect regulatory submissions this
year for the fixed-dose combination of empagliflozin and metformin for Type 2 diabetes in the U.S., necitumumab for
first-line squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, and ramucirumab for second-line non-small-cell lung cancer as well as
for gastric cancer in Japan. As we've previously disclosed, we expect to submit our basal insulin peglispro for Type 1
and Type 2 diabetes by the end of the first quarter of 2015, if not earlier.
Also this year, we could have regulatory action on empagliflozin in the U.S., dulaglutide in the U.S. and Europe, and
our new insulin glargine product in the U.S. as well as final EC approval following the recent positive CHMP opinion,
and ramucirumab in advanced gastric cancer in Europe. Now keep in mind that in addition to regulatory approval
timing, the launch timing for our new insulin glargine product will be impacted by a number of factors, including
patent expirations and ongoing litigation.
In other key events for the remainder of 2014, data package exclusivity for Cymbalta will expire in Europe in the
second half of this year, although we do not expect generic duloxetine to enter the European market until 2015.
Now clearly, we have a lot going on in 2014, and we're looking forward to maintaining the momentum from the first
half of this year into the second half.
Now let's turn to our 2014 financial guidance. Our performance through June places us on track to achieve our full-year
financial guidance. Since our last earnings call, there have been some minor pushes and pulls, but no major changes to
our full-year outlook. As a result, our guidance for nearly all line items as shown on slide 15 remains unchanged. We
have revised our GAAP EPS guidance to reflect a charge of $45 million pre-tax or $0.03 per share after tax related to
the oncology licensing deal with Immunocore announced last week. And we've slightly revised our outlook for capital
expenditures, which has been reduced to $1.2 billion.

On slide 16, we provided a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2013 and the associated growth
rates from these numbers to our 2014 guidance.
Now I'll turn the call back over to John.
John C. Lechleiter
Thanks, Derica. Before the Q&A session, let me briefly sum up.
While our revenues and earnings continued their decline, as we expected, at the same time the launch of CYRAMZA
and a number of approvals and impending launches give us great confidence that we're poised for growth in the years
ahead. Our performance is consistent with our expectations, and we're on track to meet our 2014 financial goals.
We recorded growth in the sales of a number of products and key markets as well as in our Elanco Animal Health
business. The 11% decline in our operating expenses shows our ongoing determination to manage expenses rigorously
so we can get the most from our well stocked late-stage pipeline. The steady advance of the pipeline strengthens our
confidence in our innovation-based strategy and our commitment to accelerate discoveries to the people who need
them.
And now I'll turn the call over to Phil for our Q&A session.
Phil Johnson
Thank you, John. Tawny, we're ready for the first caller, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you, two questions. The first is we've seen price competition in diabetes in
various waves starting last year, and recently Glaxo launched their GLP-1 at a pretty big list price discount to existing
therapies, which you rarely see drug companies do. This could have an obvious impact on dulaglutide's [dula] pricing
at launch. I'm sure you'll say it's too early to discuss pricing, but I'm hoping you can still address this in general terms
because it is a worrisome trend, not just for dula and Lilly, but for other products in other categories for a variety of
companies.
Then a second question is on Lilly's plans in terms of M&A activity and also tax inversion. You guys in the past have
been pretty steadfast about only really considering bolt-on acquisitions. Is this still the current stance because if so,
deals of that size probably would not be big enough to qualify you for inversion? So how is Lilly thinking about M&A
and the potential for inversion?
<A - Phil Johnson>: Tim, thank you for the questions. We'll have Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes, take
the question on the pricing and the GLP-1 space; and then Derica Rice, our CFO, take your question on and M&A.
Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Very good. As we all know, pricing in the U.S. has become extremely competitive when
it comes to the diabetes space. This is driven both by payers and competition. I think in this particular case, pricing also
in a certain way reflects the profile of very specific products. We are certainly confident in the profile that we bring
with dulaglutide and the number of trials that we have conducted, so we do think that we have a very strong value
proposition. And of course, as we think about diabetes, our stance continues to be the same. We are a proponent of

choice. We believe choice is important for patients, and we are seeking basically dual access in the diabetes space
whenever this is possible.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Thanks, Enrique. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Tim, as it relates to M&A activity, our stance and strategy has not changed in this space. We
continue to be very interested in looking for those opportunities that can augment our current organic footprint, both
commercially as well as scientifically. And that really lies in the space that you've seen us play in historically. We're
looking for in-licensing deals. And sometimes it's easier to do small M&A transactions to get access to those
technologies. We continue also to be not interested in doing large-scale M&A. We just have not seen the long-term
benefits from those types of transactions. As it relates to inversion, if that ever did come about, it would be a secondary
benefit, not the primary driver of us taking any type of M&A action.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great, thanks, Derica. Tawny, next caller, please.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Hello?
<A - Phil Johnson>: Yes, we can hear you, good morning.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Good morning, guys, thanks. Can you hear me? Sorry about that, I'm sorry. Thanks for
taking the question. Just if I could ask a pipeline question, so all across your pipeline you've had some nice success this
year but perhaps nothing truly transformative. But when I look ahead, I see two things that potentially are really
transformative, solanezumab and the CETP inhibitor, and I was just wondering. I think in the past you've characterized
– not the recent past necessarily, but you've characterized solanezumab as a high-risk pipeline program. I'd love to
know if you still perceive it as such now that the new Phase 3 programs are ongoing. And I guess since we can't do a
deep dive in the earnings call, the same big-picture question on CETP. Do you view that as a high risk, moderate risk,
or low risk asset? And maybe if you could, just remind us on the timelines. Thanks.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great, Mark, thanks for the questions. We'll have Dave Ricks, President of Lilly Bio-Meds,
answer your questions. Jan, if you'd like to chime in on anything after Dave, please feel free to.
<A - David A. Ricks>: Thanks, Mark, for the question. We remain excited about both these programs, the CETP
inhibitor evacetrapib and solanezumab. Importantly, we are confident on the timelines we previously communicated as
to those data readouts, which are clearly not in this year, but are coming up over the next couple years.
And as it relates to CETP inhibitors and ours specifically, we're confident for several reasons. One, the LDL inhibition
of this asset we think is enough by itself to achieve the outcomes we've designed the study to demonstrate. On top of
that, of course, there are other effects, HDL increasing being the most pronounced as well as other cardiovascular
potential impacts. So testing the CETP hypothesis with a complete inhibitor of CETP like evacetrapib we think is
something that's new and we're doing in accelerated trials. So we remain excited about that asset. And should it play
out that it has an impact on cardiovascular risk reduction, we think there's ample market opportunity for such a drug.
For solanezumab, I think as we've communicated since the EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION-2 studies, we believe
in the mild signal we saw in those studies. We've designed a study now which we think will be the definitive test of
solanezumab in mild patients with Alzheimer's. And we've improved, we believe, the probability of success in that
versus EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION-2 by importantly screening out patients who do not have amyloid plaque
and by powering the study appropriately for this population. So bottom line, we're bullish on both of these. Of course,
there is technical risk because both programs did not complete a normal Phase 2 proof-of-concept in the sense that
you're demonstrating the outcome before starting a Phase 3. So I'll stop there and ask Jan if he has any additional
comment.

<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: I think we can also gain some additional confidence from data from competition. The
reason, the report by crenezumab at the Alzheimer meeting in Copenhagen I think supports the data that we have with
solanezumab because it was reported there that this antibody, which has some similarities to sola in its mechanism of
action also reduced the cognition decline in the mild population of Alzheimer's, which I think is the second now
pharmacological agent that actually shows that if you interfere with the amyloid pathway, you can reduce cognition
decline in Alzheimer patients.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Jan. Tawny, next caller, please?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you, just a more mundane question, Derica, your guidance for the full year is 73%, which
assumes a significant deterioration in the second half of the year. Are you just being conservative with your numbers,
or is there something that we're not aware of that we should take into consideration for that? And can you confirm that
that would assume a worsening in the second half?
And, Dave Ricks, for you, just on PCSK-9, I know that is a Phase 2 asset, and it would seem that the PCSK-9 would
directly compete with the CETP inhibitor. What are your plans for this drug? And I think you are probably fourth in
line in bringing a PCSK-9 to the marketplace. So if you can, elaborate a little bit on where you see that project going.
Thanks.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Thanks for the questions, Jami. Derica, do you want to kick us off?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Sure, hi, Jami. Good morning.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Good morning.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: As it relates to our gross margin guidance, let me just walk you through a series of things. One,
typically Q2 is one of our higher gross margin quarters, primarily because, one, we do not have the slowdown that
usually takes place in our production facilities outside the U.S., primarily in Europe, due to the summer holiday. And
also in the fourth quarter, we typically experience the usual maintenance shutdowns. What we expect and what you saw
in the first half of the year is that we had very high production volumes running through our manufacturing facilities,
and we anticipate that those production volumes will be lower in the second half for the reasons I cited earlier. So the
gross margin performance that you're seeing thus far for us is pretty in line with the expectations that we have for the
year.
The second thing that I would also highlight is that also what you will see in the last six months of the year is the full
absorption and dilutive effect of Lohmann Animal Health acquisition, which we talked about the $0.05 hit when we
announced the deal for the year. And we also talked about the fact that it would be dilutive to our gross margin as well.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great, thanks, Derica. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Great, thanks, Jami, for the question on PCSK-9. I think you're correct that we are behind in
this class, but we think the class has a place in the management of cardiovascular risk. Obviously, there are assets in
front of us that are reading out positive data, so the probabilities here look good for the class.
I think for us, really the question is one of differentiation, maybe not so different to the question on the GLPs. We are
conducting right now a Phase 2 experiment to really elucidate a differentiated profile, and I think that data is going be
really key for our decision-making about what to do next, whether that be to proceed full speed ahead, to perhaps share
risk with another partner, or perhaps to have someone else take the asset forward and really move on to other
opportunities. So we need to see that proof of concept. And based on that information, we'll be making some decisions
in the quarters ahead.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Boris with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. First one for Derica, just one item in your guidance that seemed
to change was the CapEx, which seemed to move down on your guidance. Can you maybe just characterize what's
going on in the CapEx line and where that savings is going to be going?
Second question for Jan, it looked as though there was some pruning of the pipeline for your oncology assets. Can you
maybe help us understand what the next assets are beyond ramu [ramucirumab] and neci [necitumumab] within your
strategy that you'll be focusing on within oncology, if there are any in Phase 2 that you could point out?
And then on the Immunocore deal for novel T-cell-based therapies, are there any particular mechanisms that you're
targeting along the T-cell area that you're looking optimize with that co-discovery and co-development strategy?
Thanks.
<A - Phil Johnson>: John, thanks for the questions. Obviously, I'll have Derica take your first question of capital
expenditures. Maybe, John and Sue, you'd like to comment on the oncology questions that John had. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Sure. Hi, John. From a CapEx standpoint, it's really fairly straightforward. Our manufacturing
team and our facilities group have done an excellent job of just driving productivity and being able to bring in projects
still on time but at lower cost. And so that $100 million change in our outlook for CapEx is really spread across a
multitude of projects, capital projects, where they're just eking out increased efficiencies.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Thanks, Derica. John?
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: John, with respect to what you term pruning of the pipeline, I think the fact that we had
three potential cancer drugs fall out of Phase 2 is somewhat a factor of just the abundance of cancer opportunities that
we have in Phase 2 that reflects the ongoing nature of the business, decision-making related to data that we've gathered,
and other priorities that we've reset.
I think going forward, you're going to see Lilly much more focused on the clinical progression of the molecules where
we believe we have a competitive lead and that we believe offer the greatest opportunity for Lilly. We're in a great
position today of really having an abundance of riches, and yet we have finite resources. With an ever more
competitive environment, I think it's important that we put clear focus and resources behind those that we believe
provide for us the greatest potential and the greatest opportunity for patients at the end of the day.
With respect to the T-cell therapies, I'm going to ask Sue to comment both on your second question about the oncology
portfolio and then specifically on immuno-oncology. But we believe immuno-oncology is an important area. We've
said this. We believe we have assets already in our pipeline that really factor into this disease, to this mechanism writ
large. And the Immunocore deal was we think a great opportunity for us to influence the immune cycle, hopefully for
the benefit of cancer treatment in a very specific way. And again, I'll ask Sue to comment in greater detail.
<A - Susan Mahony, Ph.D.>: John, yes. Thanks. Clearly, with regards to the oncology pipeline, we're looking at the
key cancer pathways, including cell cycle inhibition, the tumor micro environment, and immunotherapy. You're aware
of bemaciclib. Obviously, we're very excited about that molecule. We've initiated our Phase 2 study, single-agent study.
We're on track to initiate the fulvestrant Phase 3 study in breast cancer in the next few weeks and the additional Phase 3
studies both in breast cancer with aromatase inhibitors. And in lung cancer, we'll be starting – in K-ras lung cancer
we'll be starting towards the end of this year. So that is a molecule we're very excited about and we're moving forward
rapidly with that.
In other molecules that we have in our pipeline that we are continuing to progress, our c-MET antibody, which is a
bivalent antibody that we believe could have different properties than other agents out there. And then our TGF-beta

small molecule inhibitor, or Galunisertib, which is in Phase 2 development, and is actually a molecule that is getting a
lot more interest because it targets a pathway that modulates and functions T-regulatory cells. So that is one agent that
we believe that could have or does have immune modulating activity. And we're going be seeing further combinations
with that agent both with other targeted agents and with other immunotherapy agents.
Two other agents that we've got in clinical development as well that impact the immune system include CXCR4
peptide antibody, which is in Phase 2 development. And that's involved in the trafficking of immune cells in tumors.
And our CSF1R antibody that's in Phase 1, and that targets monocytes and macrophages involved in creating an
immunosuppressive environment in the tumor. So we have three assets in clinical development that impact the immune
system.
We're also continuing to increase our discovery efforts and capabilities both internally and through recruitment
externally in this area, and we've got a number of targets that we're interested in, in addition to collaborations and
partnerships and potential acquisitions that we're looking at, and Immunocore is the recent one that we've announced
that we're very excited about looking at novel T-cell-based cancer therapies. That deal specifically looks at three
targets. We've identified three targets. We can't tell you what those targets are now, but they're ones that we believe that
have potential. And clearly, if we decide to take those into the clinic, we'll be looking at combinations with other
immuno-oncology assets and other assets within our pipeline for those agents. So we are very excited about the
opportunities that we've got in oncology. And as John said, it's really a case of making sure that we're prioritizing and
putting our focus in the right areas and making sure that we're progressing the molecules that have got the most
potential for patients.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Sue. Tawny, if we can have the next caller, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Schott>: Great, thanks very much, just had a few here. So the first one was, as we look at Lilly
returning to growth and as cash flow starts to recover, can you just share some of your views on tail products and
potential divestitures of non-core assets? We've seen a number of players in this space at least consider looking at
divesting some of those businesses; just thoughts from Lilly in terms of, is that's something that could be on the table.
Second question on the CDK program in breast cancer, I think Pfizer announced it's moving forward with a palbociclib
filing based on Phase 2 data. If that drug is approved early next year, just can you comment a little bit on what that
means competitive for Lilly as you think about your program and the timing of that program relative to Pfizer's launch?
And then finally, and I'm not going to try to pronounce the generic name, but your sclerostin inhibitor, just talk about
next steps from here and your confidence that this is something you can address? Just trying to understand what we
should be watching for on any updates there. Thanks very much.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Chris, thank you for the questions. We'll have Derica take the questions on strategies around
late-stage assets, post-patent assets, Sue Mahony on what the palbociclib potential approval could mean from a
competitive perspective. And then, Dave, you want to take lead, maybe, talking about the sclerostin question; that'd be
great. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Sure. Hi, Chris. As it relates to – I guess this is a little bit of, still, a further extension of our
capital allocation strategy. We've done a number of deals over the last few years to take advantage and make sure we're
maximizing the potential of what's sitting inside not only Lilly's labs but also Lilly's even currently marketed products.
So even if you look at Evista, we did some deals there outside of the U.S. to make sure that we were able to put proper
resourcing behind that at a time when we were diverting some of our other resources more towards the pipeline to
advance the late-stage assets that we saw with future potential.

I think going forward we'll continue, as you've heard even from Dave and from John as well, that we have a pretty
robust and pretty full clinical stage pipeline today. And we believe there are potentially more opportunities than we will
have the capacity to progress on our own. So it is possible that going forward you will see us, as we cycle through
those, deciding which assets we'll go alone and, as Dave said, which assets we may partner and which assets we may
find other ways to monetize the value from. The good news is that we, at the beginning of this cycle, is we're getting
great discovery output from our resource labs, and that's what's affording us these opportunities that lie ahead of us.
And we have no intentions of doing anything that will damage that flow of new molecules moving into the clinic and it
gives us the optionality down the road.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Thanks, Derica. Sue?
<A - Susan Mahony, Ph.D.>: Yeah, with regards to the palbo potential approval, that really doesn't have any
significant impact on our plans for bemaciclib. Clearly our focus is on ensuring that we get our three Phase 3 studies up
and running as quickly as possible this year, which we are on track to do. I'm very confident that the team has got a
good plan in place to ensure that we get rapid enrollment in these studies. We are confident in our molecule. We
believe that we could have a best-in-class molecule here with single-agent activity and continuous dosing. So as I said,
our focus really is ensuring that we get these trials up and running as quickly as possible, and I think we're on track to
do that.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thanks, Sue. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Great. Thanks, Chris. Maybe just quickly as well on the asset mix and looking – change that, I
would say on the late life cycle in-market assets, I think we're open to that as well, but we need to have a transaction
that produces value. So I think when we see those things we move on them. I think the Cialis announcement with
Sanofi this quarter is an example of that, where we're harvesting late life cycle value from Lilly assets.
On sclerostin antibody, pronounced blosozumab for those on the phone, we had completed a proof-of-concept study in
severe osteoporosis. We're excited by that data. We remain excited by that data. In conducting the transition from a
Phase 2 formulation to a final commercial image, we did have some results that surprised us a bit in making that
transition. We need to do a bit more work on the formulation so that we have really a competitive or even differentiated
commercial product image. We had scheduled or had communicated a potential for a start to the Phase 3 program
toward the end of 2014. And today we're just saying that's not going to happen in 2014 because of this delay. As we
have more information, we'll come back to the investment community to share firmer timelines.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Oh, thanks for the question, so just a few quick questions. First off, maybe for Jan, can
you give us your general thoughts on the data that was presented on Roche's crenezumab? I think we've seen some data
that looked somewhat similar. But can you just maybe compare and contrast what we saw with Lilly's solanezumab
versus crenezumab and how these molecules are fundamentally different?
Second question is for Enrique on the launch preparation for dulaglutide. Can you just give us a sense of where we are
as we lead into a potential action date from the FDA? Have we had the facilities? Have they been inspected? How is
inventory building? And how would you recommend that we assess the dulaglutide launch given recent product
launches and perhaps access, although I would think that Lilly might have a bit of a better opportunity given its ability
to leverage the portfolio.
And then just a quick update on the glargine challenge in the U.S. and if you would consider an at-risk launch
following the expiration of the 30-month stay.

And my last question is if you can remind us, post the Lohmann acquisition and perhaps Novartis, Derica, would you
be able to tell us what the overall deal-related non-cash charges that get baked into the P&L on an ongoing basis in
your adjusted earnings? Can you remind us what that number is currently and what it may move to? And then perhaps
what prevents Lilly from moving to the industry standard cash EPS? Thanks a lot.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Okay. Keep us on track here. If we miss one of our questions, don't hesitate to let us know. But I
think we'll go ahead and have Jan talk about the data for Roche's crenezumab; obviously Enrique the two middle
questions on launch prep for dulaglutide and the status of the glargine legal situation here in the U.S.; and then, Derica,
the last one on the non-cash charges. So, Jan, you want to start please?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Yes. First, I would like to make the comment then since it's not a head-to-head trial. I think
it's more comparing then different trials under different conditions. But as I said before, the data are generally
supportive between solanezumab and crenezumab. We should remember, though, that the crenezumab is a Phase 2
trial, which is clearly much smaller than EXPEDITION-1 and EXPEDITION-2. And I think for our EXPEDITION-3,
it's going to be the most important trial, which is even larger, 60% larger than the previous EXPEDITION trials. And
the focus I think here is clear. It's the mild Alzheimer patients that could have the best impact from solanezumab, and
we are selecting the amyloid-positive ones, which is also a key criterion.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Jan. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: First on dulaglutide, we are, by the way, expecting that the trade name is going to be
TRULICITY. We are very much on track. The action date for both the U.S. and Europe is this year. So our launch
preparations are very much ongoing. There's not much more really that I can discuss at this stage, whether it's pricing
or inspections and so forth, just to say that at this stage, things are going on track from our perspective.
When it comes to our new insulin glargine product, we're also expecting tentative approvals this year. And clearly, we
do have in the U.S. the 30-month stay. I can't make many comments about the ongoing litigation. But clearly, we do
not believe that we're infringing any of the asserted patents. So we are hopeful that we can resolve this as soon as we
can, hopefully even before the 30-month stay. But if that is not the case, we have the conviction in terms of what our
position is and that we're not infringing any of those asserted patents. So we will be coming to launch at that stage.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Okay. Enrique, thank you. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Hi, Seamus. For amortization of intangibles that's embedded in our operating results, as you
heard from Phil earlier, for the second quarter about $135 million is what's reflected in our Q2 results; when we think
about Lohmann, if you look at it on a full-year basis, a full 12-month basis, somewhere between $15 million and $20
million.
As it relates to Novartis Animal Health, I'm not able to share that with you until we actually close the deal and we have
the final purchase accounting. So that number is still moving at the moment.
<A - Phil Johnson>: And in terms of any thoughts about moving towards where most of the peers sit of non-GAAP
treatment of amortization, Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Thanks, Phil. We've obviously gotten some input both from people such as yourself, Seamus,
on the sell side as well as we've gotten some inquiries on that from some of our buy-side investors as well. It's
something that we're taking under consideration, and actually we'll plan to come back and inform you as to what our
actions going forward will be.

<Q - Steve Scala>: Thank you. I have three questions. First on dulaglutide, there's no question that you have a
best-in-class asset. But what portion of the GLP market would be receptive to a modestly effective but less expensive
product from GSK? And is that portion 10% or 30%?
Secondly, Lilly has given out some time ago now very specific guidance on SG&A and R&D as a percent of sales
without specifying a year in which that will be achieved. Consensus I believe has Lilly achieving these targets in 2019.
Can you tell us whether Lilly's internal forecast has you achieving these forecasts before 2019? And if you aren't
willing to say, would you say whether Lilly plans to achieve these targets this decade?
And then the final question is that it seems that 2015 is setting up to be a phenomenal year with sales and earnings up
very strongly, yet consensus covers a wide range. What early observations would you like to make about 2015? For
instance, please take the opportunity to rein in the high end of those estimates unless compared to your expectations the
high end is just fine. Thank you.
<A - Phil Johnson>: All right, Steve. Thank you for questions. We'll have Enrique take the dulaglutide question. And,
Derica, if you want to, comment on timing for some of the goals for the SG&A and R&D as a percent of revenue and
then any initial thoughts on 2015. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Steve, thank you for your comments. I'm going to quote you on dulaglutide as a
best-in-class asset. It's very much appreciated. We certainly believe so. Look, on your specific question, there are
different types of profiles in the GLP-1 class, and some look less efficacious. I'll be honest; I think the value
proposition for those products is very complicated. We do know that improved glycemic control leads to a reduction in
complications. That is a very strong value proposition. That's why we seek that. So it is difficult for me to say what
type of share would those products get, but I do not believe it's going to be very much.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Enrique, thank you. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Hi, Steve. As it relates to our margin guidance we've put out there, Steve, we actually have
provided a timeline, at least up to now. What we said is that no later than 2019, or by 2019, we will achieve total
operating expense as a percent sales somewhere in the 48% to 50% range, getting back to the historical levels of
profitability that you've seen from Lilly pre-patent expirations. We still expect to at least meet that timeline. There
clearly will be opportunities to update that outlook as we move forward.
As it relates to 2015, Steve, it's still early. I'm not in a position to share details on our outlook for 2015. What we have
said, though, is that we do coming out of 2014 expect to return to growth and to begin our journey towards expanding
our margins. And so that is the kind of performance you should expect to see. And obviously, in the near future, we'll
have an opportunity to give you more specifics around 2015 as we think about our usual timeline for issuing guidance.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Yes. And typically, Steve, that guidance is given in that first full week of January. So probably
somewhere around January 7 you should expect to be seeing a date reserved for the 2015 guidance call. Tawny, if we
can have the next caller, please?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Thanks so much for taking the questions; so two that I have, one on the CGRP antibody. I
think that's a pipeline asset people don't talk about too much yet. Can you just talk a little more on your expectations
there? We've obviously seen some setbacks previously in that space. What do you think are the differentiating points
for that product? And what would you say are some of the key decision points that you have coming up here?
And then just looking at your slide 14 with the key events, it doesn't look like any other major external data readouts
for the rest of this year. Any chance any of the autoimmune studies that you have ongoing that we might see some of
those at ACR [American College of Rheumatology] later in the year; or if not, should we assume EULAR [European
League Against Rheumatism] next year might be a big meeting for you guys with all three of these assets there?

<A - Phil Johnson>: Vamil, thank you for the questions. We'll have Jan lead off on the CGRP. Dave, feel free to
chime in, I'm going to ask my colleague, Ilissa, if she wants to comment on some of the data readouts for the back half
the year. Jan?
<A - Jan M. Lundberg>: Yes, calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, has been implied as an important mediator in
migraines in quite some time, and it has been shown by small molecules that you can reduce then acute migraines in
terms by giving oral agents. The problem with those agents were that yes, they proved the hypothesis that CGRP is an
important mediator, but they were not safe for chronic use because they have liver toxicity. That's why I think the
antibody in a way comes in with an open door where the mechanist has been proven and antibodies as we have seen
with ours are generally safer, so they are more appropriate also then for potentially chronic use. And as you know, we
described then positive data from a proof-of-concept study recently where the effect in chronic migraine was shown
reducing migraine headache days and also migraine attacks then in so-called episodic migraine. So what we are doing
now with this molecule is to do some more dose-ranging and studying and preparations then for Phase 3. And we also
recently announced that we will start a study on osteoarthritis also for this agent.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Okay, great. Jan, thank you. Dave, any comment?
<A - David A. Ricks>: No.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Okay. Ilissa?
<A - Ilissa Rassner>: Sure. Thanks, Vamil, for the question. So while you're correct that we don't have any detailed
data readouts listed for our immunology portfolio, we are expecting internal data readouts in the second half of this
year, starting with ixekizumab, followed by tabalumab, and then towards the very end of the year the first trial will read
out for baricitinib. Those trials should have detailed data readouts starting in 2015. I'll also remind you that we're
expecting top line results as well for our basal insulin peglispro in diabetes for the Type 1 trials, and that will be in the
third quarter of this year.
<A - Phil Johnson>: As has been our past practice, Vamil, I think you should expect that the various trials that Ilissa
just mentioned would lead to top line press releases, providing an update at a high level on whether or not the trials
have met their endpoints, so kind of safety profile where you're seeing some of our thoughts on next steps for those
molecules. One I might mention that's broader across the portfolio, the REACH trial of ramucirumab in hepatocellular
cancer I think is quite possible and likely to have detailed data presented at a medical meeting before the end of the
year that should give some additional insights into the commentary we provided around some group data that we found
to be quite interesting.
<A - Ilissa Rassner>: And then also for ramucirumab, there's the colorectal data that would also read out towards the
end of this year, possibly early next year, and could have a top line readout as well.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Right.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Thanks for taking the questions. On GLP-1s, we should see Phase 2 data for Novo's oral
GLP-1 in 2Q 2015. I was just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on this approach and how you view it as a
potential competitive threat to the GLP-1 market as well as the DPP-4s and SGLT2s.

On SGLT2 fixed combos, one of your competitors has stated that they view the approval of these as a significant
inflection point for the acceleration of cost growth. I was just wondering how you're thinking here about this
opportunity. And do you share this view?
And then finally just on the basal insulin peglispro, I think I heard you say that U.S. filings are going to be 1Q 2015 or
earlier. What are the factors that could lead to an earlier filing and how soon could this be? Thanks a lot.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Colin, thank you very much for the questions, and those are all directed to Enrique
Conterno. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Thanks. On oral GLP-1s, we have said that this is an area that is attractive and is an area
that we're very much looking at as well. I won't comment. I think your question is probably more appropriate for one of
our competitors.
When it comes to the fixed-dose combination, if you are referring to the fixed-dose combination between a GLP-1 and
insulin, we clearly see the combination of a GLP-1 and insulin as important therapy. We do believe with dulaglutide
and our insulin portfolio, we can provide very significant value when it comes to providers and payers. We do believe
that the restriction that if you dose by having a fixed-dose combination in this particular case in a certain way takes
away from the flexibility that endocrinologists want and need given how insulin is titrated.
Without giving some indications here, but I should also comment about the SGLT2 and DPP-4 fixed-dose combination.
We do believe this is an important product for us. Of course, we are developing this with Boehringer Ingelheim. We
have submitted this in the U.S., and we believe we are significantly ahead of our competition. Today, about 25% of
SGLT2 use is on top of a DPP-4, so that gives you a sense of the possibilities for overall class growth and branded
growth and the impact that this fixed-dose combination could have.
Finally, you asked about whether we could file earlier than Q1 on basal insulin peglispro. That is a possibility. But at
this stage, I think what we said is we will file by Q1. Clearly, we are working on getting the readout for our Type 1
studies. And we expect that we are going be seeing this later this quarter, and we expect the press release together with
that.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Great. Thank you, Enrique.
<A - Phil Johnson>: You're welcome. Next caller, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I've got two questions around insulin glargine products. Just
fair to say, can you just give us a bit more color on why you added the 3-mil cartridge to your filing, and does this
potentially relate to being able to come to the market with a product such as the OptiClik device which Ypsomed had
previously there to try and get around to some of the SoloSTAR patents? And then secondly, can you just update us a
bit more on your thoughts around timing of the European launch and what kind of presentation the product would have
in terms of device or not? Thank you.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great, Jeff, thank you for the questions. We'll stay with Enrique.
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. On insulin glargine, we have submitted two separate NDAs, you're right, one for
pre-filled pens and one for insulin for cartridges. Clearly, those are two independent NDAs. We have been sued on each
one of them, so that's all I will say basically at this stage. But we will be intending to basically oppose the patent
expirations and resolving the ongoing litigation to be able to bring both of those to the market.
Your second question was related to Europe. Clearly, the patent expiration for Lantus is in 2015, and we are expecting
tentative approval this year. So we are very much in our preparations, but that's as much as I can comment. Of course,

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, thank you for taking the questions, a question on ramucirumab for second-line
metastatic colorectal cancer. My understanding is that the Phase 3 trial, those patients could have been treated with
AVASTIN first-line. So how should we think about the process of this trial given the similar mechanism of action and
given the clinical profile we've seen with ramu so far? Thank you.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Thank you very much, Alex. Sue Mahony, please?
<A - Susan Mahony, Ph.D.>: Yes, Alex, you're right. This is a second-line trial after AVASTIN in first-line. Clearly,
we'll wait and see what the data shows. We'll have that data towards the end of this year, and we'll be announcing top
line and then we plan to present it at a scientific meeting next year. So I think it's too early to speculate at this point.
We'll have to see what the data shows us.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Okay, great. Thank you very much and, Tawny, next caller, please.
Operator
Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: My first question is how are you thinking about the biologic psoriasis market. There are
several players there. So are you thinking about your product being differentiated?
Second, there was a comment earlier on the call about an adjustment of U.S. for managed Medicaid. How big was that
adjustment? Can you just explain what happened there?
And then third, just on the insulin products, any major changes in the quarter? Humalog/Humulin seemed to be
bouncing around first quarter/second quarter quite a bit relative to what I would have thought the scripts were doing. So
if you could, just give us a sense of what's going on there. Thanks.
<A - Phil Johnson>: We'd be absolutely happy to, Marc. Thanks for the questions. Dave Ricks, why don't you go
ahead and start with the biologic market with psoriasis? Derica, if you could, comment please on the managed
Medicaid situation; and Enrique, for the U.S. insulin sales trends we've been seeing. Dave?
<A - David A. Ricks>: Yes, thanks. Marc, as it relates to psoriasis treatment, we've seen a rapid growth of TNF use
over the last decade in treating moderate to severe psoriasis. And then more recently, of course an alternate mechanism
was STELARA, which has been met with great success in the market. We believe IL-17s are another step forward in
therapy for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. And you can see some of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 readouts from
the three competitors, which are all neck and neck in the very last stages of testing here. The promise of the class is
really to move the standard of what good is from a PASI 75 clearance to really something north of that, PASI 90 or
total clearance, which can now be possible for these patients who suffer from this difficult condition. And we see
IL-17s delivering PASI 100 or complete clearance substantially above both anti-TNFs and STELARA. So that's the
value proposition for the class.
Within the class, of course we have own differentiation strategy, which includes, of course, efficacy. We'll have to see
the safety as it bears out, and then dosing regimens, which are all different between the various players. We have not
disclosed or read out our Phase 3 program, and that will be coming soon in a top line fashion. So we'll wait to say any

more until when we see those data in a complete form. But we're bullish on the class.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Excellent, great. Thanks, Dave. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Hi, Marc. As it relates to the U.S. and the managed Medicaid, this is really us, as we got
additional receipts in from customers, we were able to true-up the accruals and the provisions on our books.
Dollar-wise, it's about $60 million, which in effect was about two percentage points of growth in the U.S. So just as a
reminder, our U.S. overall sales was down about 30%. If you were to exclude the impact of the Cymbalta and Evista
patent expirations, our growth was a positive 13%, which was about eight percentage points of price, five percentage
points of volume. So of that eight percentage points of price, two percentage points of that was the managed Medicaid
adjustment.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Excellent. Thank you, Derica. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. Marc, you are correct. When we look at the underlying script growth for our
insulin business in the U.S., Q1 and Q2 are very comparable. But we do see, in terms of our reported sales, we were at
minus 1% for Humalog in Q1, and we were 17% growth for Q2, so big difference there. Let's remember that in Q1 we
had a significant wholesaler destocking that impacted the growth rate. In the case of Humalog, that impact was eight to
nine percentage points in Q1, so that explains part of the difference. And in Q2 we just discussed managed Medicaid.
In the case of Humalog that impact was 4%. So we had I guess some very unique impacts to each one of those quarters.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Tawny, next caller, please?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Damien Conover with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
<Q - Damien L. Conover>: Great, thanks for taking the question. Just a follow up on the insulin franchise, just had a
question for the pricing power with Humulin. It looks like a very strong growth in the U.S. with price and just wanted
to understand that in the context of the Express Scripts negotiations on getting on the formulary there, but still being
able to drive some price. Wondering if that price is coming from customers outside that formulary or if that formulary
still allows for some pricing power.
And then secondly, when you think about the renegotiations with the PBMs, and we're likely to see the formularies in
August; wanted to see if anything strategically has changed with the negotiations there after you've had a couple
quarters here of a more aggressive negotiation that happened last year? Thank you.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Excellent. Damien, thank you for the questions. Enrique Conterno?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: Sure. On Humulin, a big part of our human insulin franchise in the case of Humulin is
that we have a very unique product in Humulin U-500, which basically has significant growth and where the pricing
pressures are not as high as with the rest of the insulin franchise. And you basically see some of that reflected in terms
of both price and volume.
Your second question related to our ongoing discussions or negotiations with the PBMs and payers. I won't be able to
share much in that front.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Okay, great. Damien, thanks for questions. Tawny, next caller, please?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks and good morning. I wanted to just go back briefly to the inversion subject for John and

hear how your and the board's thinking, John, on the subject has evolved over the past year or so. And a nitpicky
follow-up, Derica, you indicated that Lilly isn't considering or doesn't generally agree with large-scale M&A for Lilly.
But would a $20 billion to $30 billion deal definitionally be considered large-scale M&A? Thanks.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Okay, great, thank you very much for the questions. Welcome back to the fold. I wasn't expecting
to hear you on the call, but it's great to hear your voice. Derica, for the inversion and the definition of large-scale,
please?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Okay, well to me, $20 billion to $30 billion is a pretty large number, at least from my basic
math class in Alabama.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: So maybe the rest of the question is moot then.
<A - Derica W. Rice>: So but again, even as we were preparing to go through our series of patent expirations, and
there was a lot of speculation of what others thought we needed to do to manage our way through this tough period in
the history of Lilly. And clearly large-scale M&A was one of the options that was on the table. And again, as we
looked at all the data, both looking at other transactions by other firms that historically there is that near-term benefit
you can gain; but longer term, the core to this industry and we believe the core to our business as Lilly is your ability to
innovate and get new molecules out of your labs that create clinical differentiation. And so that's where we've chosen to
focus and expend our energy.
So when we think about business development transactions, ways that we can augment that innovative platform or
footprint for us, we're absolutely interested in. Things that would begin to create a distraction and could begin to
hamper or dampen our ability to produce new, innovative research and development are things that we're really quite
not interested in at the moment. And for us, it's been a combination of those smaller deals bolting onto our organic
strategy. And I see that being the path going forward.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great.
<A - John C. Lechleiter>: Gregg, it's John. Likewise, it's nice to hear from you. I think the only other comment I
would make is, look, I think that the activity around inversions right now, this points to a failure of our U.S. tax code.
And it really keeps American companies, not just pharma industry but across industries, from being competitive with
their overseas counterparts, and it's really – we've been talking about tax reform. I think the first TV interview I gave
when I became CEO in 2008; a big discussion was tax reform. We need a lower rate. We need a territorial system. We
don't need BAND-AID approaches in between. It's time for the Congress to step up to the bar and get this thing done.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Purcell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark D. Purcell>: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Staying with diabetes, lots of questions, but I just
wanted, for clarification for the glargine product in Europe. Should I expect from some of the comments you made so
far to see this product launched in Europe in Q2 next year? And then in terms of the SGLT2/DPP-4 combo, clearly
you're about a year ahead. So again, given heading in towards the Class 1 review, how confident you are of launching
that product after the PDUFA early 2015?
Straying away from diabetes and thinking about your margin targets and where you're heading with a very broad
pipeline, some of these areas you're heading into are fairly crowded. There could be some fierce battles in primary care
in cholesterol. Obviously there's some entrenched competition, increasing competition in the immunology space. So
how would you consider going alone on some of these assets outside your core areas at the moment versus partnering
with players already in this space?

And then lastly, clearly some very rigorous management of SG&A and R&D costs, as you mentioned several times on
the call. Should we be more comfortable now towards the lower end of your guidance range for SG&A and R&D cost
lines for the full year, or are there phasing effects such as initiation of new R&D trials, which we need to be alerted to
at this point? Thanks a lot.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great, Mark. Thank you for the questions. We'll have Enrique take the questions on the insulin
glargine and the European Union and then thoughts on the launch timing for SGLT2/DPP-4 combo. And then for the
going alone versus partnering, how we think about that given some the investments required to compete in these
marketplaces, Derica, if I'd ask you to maybe make a comment. Dave, since some of these fall into your business in
particular, if you want to make comments as well, please feel free to. And then, Derica, if you'd comment on the lower
end of the guidance ranges we've got for SG&A and R&D and how people should be thinking about where we're
tracking. Enrique?
<A - Enrique A. Conterno>: So when it comes to glargine in Europe, as I mentioned, we are expecting to launch after
the patent expiration in Europe. I do not believe that I provided an exact date on that. But clearly, we are undertaking
all of the preparations so that we can do that. When it comes to the SGLT2/DPP-4 combination, the empa/lina
fixed-dose combination, we had shared that we have submitted that. We shared that early this year, which basically
puts us with an action date of early 2015.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Derica?
<A - Derica W. Rice>: Mark, I'll start with the guidance in terms of operating expenses. I'm not able to guide the
investment community to one end or the other of the range. What I can say is we feel very good about meeting those
goals that we established for the year, and we feel very confident that we'll be within the ranges that we've provided.
As relates to I guess your earlier question also around as we look at our portfolio, the good news is that we believe we
produced an abundance of clinical opportunities in our pipeline, and some of those are in some of our core areas and
some of those or maybe outside or tangential. Clearly, we'll be able to evaluate each of those molecules and decide
which path we choose to pursue as we consider each one of those. But the good news is that we have optionality. And,
Dave, I don't know if there's anything you'd like to add to that.
<A - David A. Ricks>: Nothing more than we would always look I think almost for every asset options to partner
either the share risk if it's a clinical stage asset or, as it matures, trade value. Sometimes by accessing reach, sometimes
by capability, or there's other unique portfolio fits or portfolio trade options that manifest themselves. So we're
open-minded about all that, but it has to make sense in terms of value creation. We're not going talk about those in
advance in this setting, but I think that's our mindset as it relates to partnering.
<A - Phil Johnson>: Excellent. Thanks, Dave. Tawny, next caller, please?

Okay. Thanks, Phil, and I'll be brief.
To all of those on the call, we appreciate your continued interest in Lilly. Our performance once again is in line with
our expectations this quarter. We're on track to meet our 2014 financial goals and continued progress advancing the
pipeline places us on track to return to growth and margin expansion post-2014. We believe our strategy is the right one
for Lilly to create value for patients, for physicians, payers, and of course our shareholders. And our ability to execute
so far gives us increasing confidence that Lilly is indeed poised for growth. As always, you can expect we'll keep you
