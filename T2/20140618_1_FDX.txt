And now our Chairman, Fred Smith, will share his views on the quarter.
Frederick W. Smith
Good morning, everyone. This is of course the quarterly earnings call for FedEx, but before we get into the business
issues, let me note that during the quarter, we experienced to unprecedented and inexplicable tragedies. First, a
highway crash in California of the FedEx Freight vehicle and a bus of students, which resulted in the worst accident in
our history with 10 fatalities and others injured. Then a shooting at a FedEx Ground facility in Atlanta by a troubled
young man, who before committing suicide, shot six people with two seriously wounded. All 300,000-plus of us at
FedEx grieve for those who lost their lives and those injured, and we again extend our deepest sympathies and
condolences to their families and friends.
Now to the scheduled business of this call. As you can see, our numbers are fairly straightforward. Ground and Freight
are performing well, and Express remains on track to achieve its profit improvement plan despite the fuel headwinds
we've experienced.
This summer, two of our long-serving and finest executives will be retiring in July. Cathy Ross, the Chief Financial
Officer of FedEx Express, is leaving after 30 years with FedEx. Mike Fryt, our Corporate Vice President of Tax, is also
retiring after 19 years with the company. I'd like to thank Cathy and Mike for their service, their many contributions to
FedEx. And all of us wish them nothing but the best in their retirement.
Now let me ask Mike Glenn to give you our economic forecast, and then Alan Graf will comment on our results and
the FY 2015 outlook. Mike?
T. Michael Glenn
Thank you, Fred.
Our U.S. GDP forecast is now 2.2% for calendar 2014 and 3.1% for calendar 2015. The change to calendar 2014 is
entirely due to bad weather and the inventory shift in the first quarter. Our expectations for economic growth for the

remainder of the year have actually improved somewhat. We expect industrial production growth of 3.6% this year and
3.7% in calendar 2015. The global economy is recovering from the Q1 setback in the U.S. and slowdown in China and
should steadily improve. We expect global growth of 2.7% in calendar 2014 and 3.1% in calendar 2015.
Now let me make a couple of comments on the company's yield performance by segment. Excluding the impact of fuel,
year-over-year Express domestic package yield increased 0.9% in the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by weight
and product mix. The Ground package yield increased 2.9% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of fuel. The
year-over-year increase was driven by rate and discount, product mix, and extra service fees. Excluding fuel,
international export Express package yield increased 3%, primarily driven by rate and discount improvement, package
weight, and product mix.
And finally, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per hundredweight declined 0.4% year over year in the fourth quarter.
Rates, however, improved during the quarter. Changes in other shipment characteristics, including higher weight per
shipment, resulted in the year-over-year decline in yield per hundredweight but contributed to margin improvement.
The higher weight per shipment drove an increase in yield per shipment.
And now I'm going to turn it over to Alan Graf for his comments.
Alan B. Graf
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone.
We had an outstanding fourth quarter. Our EPS of $2.46 is an increase of 15% on an adjusted basis, and we achieved a
corporate 10% operating margin. Ground played a prominent role in our success this quarter with a 19.5% operating
margin, and Freight's income grew an impressive 51% versus last year's adjusted income. All of our segments increased
operating income on an adjusted year-over-year basis despite one fewer operating day.
Express had a solid quarter. Express operating income was up 3% versus the last year's adjusted income. And operating
margin improved to 6.8% despite the significant negative net impact of fuel in the quarter. International Priority
volume stabilized after four quarters of decline. IP box volume grew to 2%, while lower yielding distribution services
volume declined. International export yields increased 2%, as improved rates, higher weight per package, and favorable
service mix more than offset lower fuel surcharges. These are clear indications that our yield management efforts are
working.
Turning to our Ground segment, Ground achieved a 19.5% operating margin, benefiting from 8% higher average daily
volume and increased revenue per package. SmartPost volumes declined 8% in the quarter, but volumes increased 15%
excluding the changes in shipping patterns from one large customer. Overall yields increased 8% for SmartPost.
FedEx Freight also had an excellent quarter with operating income increasing $41 million versus last year's adjusted
income. Freight's less-than-truckload average daily shipments grew 12% in Q4, with a 14% increase in demand for
Priority service.
During FY 2014, FedEx repurchased 36.8 million shares for approximately $5 billion. 9.9 million of those were
acquired in the fourth quarter. At the end of FY 2014, we had 287 million shares outstanding. Our buyback contributed
approximately $0.12 per diluted share for the quarter and $0.07 per share for the full fiscal year.
Our strong flow of cash from operations enabled us to announce last week that we were boosting our quarterly dividend
by $0.05 per share for a total of $0.20 per share, up 33% from our previous dividend.
During the quarter we announced two pricing changes. Freight increased its published fuel surcharge indices by three
percentage points effective June 2. Ground will apply dimensional-weight pricing to all shipments effective in January
2015. Currently Ground only applies dim-weight pricing to package over three cubic feet in size. This change better
aligns our pricing with our cost to deliver.

Turning now to the outlook, based on the economic outlook that Mike talked about and the momentum we have, we
project earnings of $8.50 to $9.00 per diluted share for FY 2015. This outlook assumes no net year-over-year fuel
impact and includes an approximately $0.45 benefit from share buyback, which was substantially completed in FY
2014. A total of 5.3 million shares remain on our existing share repurchase authorization as of May 31 and we will
complete the share repurchases this year.
We are laser focused on improving operating results for all of our operating segments. For FY 2015 we anticipate
revenue and earnings growth from ongoing improvements in all of our transportation segments with moderate global
economic growth driving volume and yield increases. Our overarching goal is to achieve annual double-digit operating
margins for the total company in the near future.
We expect revenues and earnings to increase at Express during FY 2015 primarily due to improved U.S., domestic and
international yield, as we continue to focus on revenue quality and through ongoing on execution of our profit
improvement programs and great cost management.
We have an Express business plan to exit FY 2016 with a run rate of $1.6 billion in additional operating profit
compared to what we achieved in FY 2013. This plan of course is dependent on U.S., economic and global trade
growth. It also will be backend loaded as our various cost reduction and efficiency programs continue to gain traction.
Ground segment revenues and operating income are expected to grow in FY 2015 led by volume growth across all our
major services due to market share gains.
We also anticipate yield growth in FY 2015 through yield management programs including a recently announced
dimensional weight rating changes. We expect continued revenue and operating income growth at the Freight segment
as well in FY 2015 driven by volume and revenue per share per shipment increases from our differentiated LTL
services as well as continued improvement in network and operational optimization.
A recent increase to our fuel surcharge rates for certain LTL shipments will also benefit yields in FY 2015. We believe
that our outlook is realistic and achievable but there are variables that can affect the outcome that are not in our control
including of course fuel prices, pension return on assets and pension plan discount rates as well as weather. Also global
trade growth can have an outsized effect on our results. While global trade growth is improving, it is still below
historical norms. We do expect the pace of trade growth improvement to continue throughout calendar year 2014 and
into calendar year 2015.
As Fred mentioned, two of our finance executives are leaving in July. Cathy Ross will be replaced with Elise Jordan
who will move from her position as Senior VP of Strategic Financial Planning and Analysis at Express. Elise has 31
years of experience at Express and although we will miss Cathy, Elise will do a fantastic job for us.
Mike Fryt, our Corporate Vice President of Tax, will be replaced by Bobby Brown who has 22 years with the company.
Both Mike and Bobby were in Washington, D.C. last week and will be there this week as well walking the house of
Congress discussing advantages of lower corporate tax rate. I'd like to thank Cathy and Mike for their exemplary
leadership and wish both of them well in their retirement.
A few other factors; we look at our tax rate for FY 2015. We think the effective tax rate will be between 36% and 37%
depending on the amount and source of operating income. We should note FY 2014 was 36.3%. Our U.S. pension plans
have substantial funds to meet expected benefit payments and is well funded. Because of our strong asset returns, we
expect lower retirement plan cost in FY 2015. Our CapEx for FY 2014 came in below our projection at a total of $3.5
billion as some projects were deferred into FY 2015. CapEx for FY 2015 is expected to increase to approximately $4.2
billion due to these deferrals as well as planned aircraft deliveries to support our fleet modernization program, one of
the keys to our profit improvement program and the continued expansion of the Ground network.
We are very focused on achieving double-digit corporate operating margins in the near term and generating healthy
cash flows. Our balance sheet remains strong, all the initiatives we are working on are designed to ensure the near and
long-term success of FedEx and include our goal to provide superior returns for our shareowners, which we have
demonstrated greatly in FY 2014.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Congrats on the double-digit margins in the fourth quarter. It's been a
long time. It's so nice to see but talking about that pace of gains and looking at your outlook, can you talk about the
shifting buckets and how you expect the pace of improvements now that you've got all the employees that you had
targeted or had accepted your plan to leave the payrolls? Is that all now in the run rate number? Or can we still see
some of that accrete into fiscal 2015? Maybe just talk about the pace to get to that $859 run rate you're talking about.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I'm going to let Dave take the bulk of this answer but I just want to start out by saying that
obviously the international revenue outlook and global trade outlook today are significantly lower than they were in
October of 2012 when we set out the five pillars. So we've had to significantly revise how we get to the 1.6. We're still
working hard. We'll still get to generally in those categories, but we've had to adjust our international network to be
able to reach those goals. So we significantly have less capacity than we did in October of 2012 and I'll let Dave talk
about what his team is doing to continue us down the road.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Alan. And thanks for the question, Ken. Fred commented on it and Alan did also.
We are on track and on target to hit our profit improvement by the end of – running out of FY 2016. But as importantly
we're on track and on target to run out FY 2015 on track and on target at 75% of all the profits that we actually talked
about in 2012. Alan's right though. We actually have a different makeup and a different mix. We have better cost
management and partly because of the global shift of business. We had more deferred traffic that entered into our
marketplace and into our network quite frankly than we did in 2012. So we've taken down some capacity, realigned our
networks. I wanted to thank all of our Express teams all around the world for actually doing a terrific job of resetting
their priorities and realigning our network. And by the way, in the fourth quarter, Alan mentioned it as well, we had
significant fuel headwinds and one less operating day and still beat our operating profit margin and profits
year-over-year.
<A - Mickey Foster>: We have a question off the Internet from William Flinn. This is a question for Bill. Moving
forward, how will Freight get back to the levels of operating income seen in FY 2006 and 2007? Are you more focused
on cost and productivity or growth initiatives that this point?
<A - William J. Logue>: Okay. Good question. Again, first, we're very pleased with our quarter. And as we stated
back in the 2010, 2011 timeframe, our objective was to get back Freight to the double-digit margins and we're very
pleased with this quarter. We have a solid business plan for FY 2015. And I would just say that from an overall Freight
perspective, our focus is on balance, really going after a good balance between yield and volume for the business. The
operating team has done a great job on productivity. So we'll continue network design, focus on yield and volume
growth as we move forward, and that will continue as we march towards our objective of double-digit margins.
Operator
And we will take our next question over the phone line from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Mike or Alan, you guys had talked a little bit about the Ground dim-weight changes in your
prepared remarks. Could you discuss a little bit how you see those changes aiding the overall improvement that you're
expecting with regard to yields for the segment?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Thank you. The FedEx Ground dim change is an extension of the dimensional-weight pricing
policy that we've had in place for some time. Dimensional weight pricing is a common industry practice, as you know,

and it has been in place for Ground for packages measuring 3 cubic feet or more for several years. So what we're really
doing is bringing consistency to the Ground and Express segment by applying the dimensional weight policy to all
packages. It's important to note that we announced this change several months ahead of when we would typically
announce a price change and the reason for that is to give us plenty of time to work with customers to refine their
packaging specs, to make sure that the packaging moving through our system and the system of our customers is the
most efficient, which will benefit both the customer and FedEx.
So, we're taking a very collaborative approach working with our customers on this, making sure that they have access
to our packaging lab and we're working with them on a customer-by-customer basis as required to make necessary
changes to improve their efficiency. So it will have a positive impact. Obviously if we can improve the efficiency of the
packaging that creates capacity in the network for us, which is a positive thing.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.
<Q - Nate J. Brochmann>: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to talk a little bit on the
international side. It was good to hear the Priority kind of flattening out a little bit. I was just wondering a couple
things, one, is that maybe because of some growth you're seeing out of those regions? Or because of market share
gains? Or because we're kind of seeing the bottom of the trade down impact? And then going forward regarding your
investment in that area, given the kind of sluggish growth rates, what are you guys thinking in terms of just general
investment? Thank you.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: This is Dave Bronczek. Let me answer the International Priority question. First of all it's
important to note that for FedEx Express International Priority in our global network represents 74% of all of our
International revenue. So it's always been and will always be a prominent dominant role in our network. And to the
point that Alan made, our IP Box grew 2% this quarter and our IP yields grew 2% this quarter. We did shift some
traffic that was deferred out of our networks that's actually benefited the customer and benefited of FedEx. So I just
wanted to make sure that the understanding for International Priority, it's still the vast majority of our revenue in our
network.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: There's a question from Art Hatfield [Raymond James] over the Internet. Can you discuss
the long-term trend on CapEx beyond 2015?
We're basically spending capital on two major initiatives. The first is the growth in our Ground network as we continue
to exploit the great improvements that the Ground team had put in place over the last decade; and second, to modernize
our aircraft fleet. We're not adding capacity. But every time we bring on one of these new fuel-efficient airplanes and
replace the legacy capacity, we get immediate hit to the profitability of the company and build a much stronger
long-term future. So I think we believe capital is going to stay in the same general area that you've seen it. But as Alan
mentioned in his remarks, we're very focused on improving our margins and improving our cash flow and EBITDA. So
while the CapEx will remain high in absolute terms, we believe as a percentage of revenues they should drift down. But
the primary expenditure are on those two programs that I just mentioned.
Operator
Thank you. And we will take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on that point as you see the margin expansion
roll forward, how should we think about cash allocation from a shareholder return standpoint? Obviously a nice
dividend increase that was announced a week ago, you're almost done with the buyback. Should we expect more on
that side? Is that going to be more a regular part of the cash allocation strategy as we move into fiscal 2015 and
beyond?

<A - Alan B. Graf>: Hi, Chris. It's Alan. Let me just say that echoing what Fred said, we have plenty of room for
investment in fleet modernization at Express and Ground as well as to continue to provide return to our shareholders.
And as I said, we're going to finish the buyback, the remaining authorization of 5.3 million shares, if not by the end of
the quarter, certainly by the end of the calendar year. So we are continuing that. We had great discussions with our
board about this subject, and it's an item of focus for us. I'm not going to commit to anything at this point, but we have
it right in front of us as one of the objectives to continue to do along with getting to double-digit corporate margins.
Operator
Thank you. And we will take our next question from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie Capital.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you provide a little bit more color on what
happened with SmartPost during the quarter? I think you mentioned it was attributed to a particular customer, so just a
little detail on that. And then how you think about the direction of SmartPost going forward; as B2C density improves,
is there a desire to reduce your reliance on SmartPost at all, especially as postal rates increase, so just how you think
about that?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Hi, Kelly. This is Henry Maier. Year-over-year volume comps for SmartPost were really
impacted by one customer who changed their distribution model earlier in the year. If you exclude that one customer,
SmartPost grew roughly 14.5% over the year. That's still a pretty good business. We are uniquely positioned to ride this
wave that e-commerce is generating. And I've talked about this before here, it's a portfolio play with SmartPost for
largely customers who want offer free shipping, and then FedEx Home Delivery for high-touch, high-visibility
customers who choose that type of service for their product. I don't think that those can be disconnected. Our customers
increasingly are telling us that they want the option for both services in the portfolio, and that's the way we think about
this.
Operator
Thank you. We will now take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks, good morning. I'm just curious. Within Ground, what type of margins just
directionally are you expecting going forward, with the initiatives that you have there in CapEx and OpEx to grow it
out? I was just curious on the sense for that. Thanks.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Hey, Scott. This is Henry Maier. First of all, let me reiterate that the Ground team, and that
includes me, would not be satisfied with anything less than margins in the high teens. We are laser-focused on reducing
our costs through state-of-the-art technology and disciplined expense control. And we're focused on sound capacity
investments, improving our yields, and producing industry-leading margins. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. We will take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: Great. Thanks, guys, good morning. Just shifting over to the FedEx Freight segment for a moment,
could you maybe talk about what drove the strength in your LTL daily shipments in the quarter, especially on the
Priority side? And then secondly, we've been hearing some rumblings about the potential for a second GRI in LTL
world this year. Given that you guys are the market leader, is there any color you can add around that? Do you think the
market is strong enough to support a second GRI this year? Thank you.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Thank you, Jack. First of all, let me say we don't comment on the competitive pricing
strategy at all. I couldn't speculate regarding what others might do regarding GRIs. We've announced our GRI and we
announced the change to the fuel surcharge, as Alan mentioned. So I can't speculate on what others might do.

The growth that we're seeing in FedEx Freight is driven by several things. One is a very positive customer response to
the value proposition that we have, which allows a selection between Priority and Economy services. Two is the
outstanding service that we're delivering at FedEx Freight. And the third point, which is significant, is we've seen an
increase in demand from small and midsize customers and that in large part is due to the great collaboration we have
between the operating units all the way down to the ramp level in our sales team. They're executing to perfection in
terms of the strategy that we've laid out. And as Bill said, it's allowing us to be very efficient in terms of growing our
business with the proper balance between shipment growth and yield improvement to maximize margin. So that's really
what you're seeing and we're very pleased with that and we plan to continue that strategy.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Part of the guidance for 2015 was that fuel
would be flat year-over-year. I was wondering if you could give us any sensitivities around how changes in fuel might
impact 2015 earnings. For example, if fuel prices are 5% higher or 5% lower, what would be the risk or benefit to
profits?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Allison, this is a very volatile part of our business on a short-term look on the P&L. And it really
depends on the timing of what happens with fuel price in our surcharges versus what happened last year with the timing
of prices and surcharges. So it's not just simply fuel price, it's the relationship of fuel price to when we can catch up
with the surcharge and how fast that is compared to what happened in the previous years. So we have had some years
were we've had some thrilling impacts to the P&L, both good and bad. And so what we're saying in our guidance is that
right now we're not expecting for the corporation to have that happen this year but of course with things that are going
on in the Middle East, it's a big wildcard. And so we want to make sure that we called that out as a risk. It's also a
possible opportunity. But if fuel prices continue to go up, there's also the elasticity impact of the size of the fuel
surcharge to how our customers react to that in terms of the selection of the service that we're providing.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yes. Thanks. I'd like to ask about an aspect of the growth strategy. Would you please
explain the importance of your recent investment in the national hub in Mexico and comment on key growth drivers
you find attractive in this market, please?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, this is Dave. That was part of the MultiPack acquisition we made down there. A
terrific domestic company that went along with our business we've already had in Mexico. We see a lot of trade back
and forth from Mexico to the United States. It's increasing. A lot has shifted out of Asia, quite frankly, into Mexico. So
the acquisition we made several years ago now is very valuable for our going forward profitability. It's also part of the
whole network down in Latin America as Mexico plays such a key role in that whole part of the world. It's a good call
out. I appreciate that. The hub is up and running, 65,000 handling packages a day, and it can go up from there. So we're
doing very well down there and Juan Cento and his team are to be commended for that.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from William Green with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Hi, good morning. Mike, I was hoping to ask you a little bit more on the dim weight. I think
in the past you talked about dim weight adding $100 million or so to the revenue line. Is this change bigger than that?
And along those lines, dim weight is not something you address in your annual price increases. Should that change? Or

is this sort of something you put in place, let it go for a few years and it won't really affect pricing beyond this year?
Thank you.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: First of all, it would be difficult for me to speculate on the impact of the Ground
dimensional-weight price change because, as I mentioned, one of the things that we are working on right now is
helping our customers utilize more efficient packaging. I don't think I have to tell you if you receive any kind of
packages at your home, whether they're cookies from grandma or an e-commerce package, they're not always packed
efficiently. So there's sufficient opportunity out there for us to work with customers to make better packaging decisions,
which would obviously significantly impact the extent to which the dim weight change is actually applied in terms of
billing.
I certainly can't speculate and would not speculate on the bottom-line impact of dimensional-weight change but we're
constantly evaluating all of our pricing policies. And as you recall several years ago we made a change to the dim
weight divisor for Express and Ground and that has served FedEx well. We followed that up with this change and we'll
continue to evaluate those. But we look at dimensional weight pricing changes, GRIs and another surcharges and extra
service charge fees as part of an entire pricing strategy and yield management strategy.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: This is Alan. I want to add to that a little bit. It's actually more beneficial from a return on
invested capital standpoint to have our customers adjust their packaging than for us to collect a dim surcharge. That's
because we basically get free space with no capital investment. So it's an equal driver if not more important for that to
occur.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: This is Fred Smith here. Let me make a comment on this in the context of a broader issue
and that is the initiative on behalf of the entire LTL and ground parcel industry to have the federal standards for the
twin trailers, which are the standard in these sectors, increase from 28 feet to 33 feet. A lot of times the general news
media talks about quote, the trucking industry, and of course it's divided into two parts. The truckload sector, which use
53 foot trailers, and oftentimes those trailers are used to pull very heavy loads, which make it controversial in terms of
road repair and so forth.
In the ground parcel business and the LTL business in both cases, you cube out long before you weight out. So if the
federal standard were increased, there would be millions and millions of fewer miles driven per day. It's about an 18%
increase in cube, massive amounts of fuel saved and CO2 emissions avoided and you would actuarially eliminate over
400 accidents per year just by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.
So the entire industry is behind us and we're very hopeful it will pass in Congress soon, because again it's safer, it's
more efficient and it's less fuel. And it's in exactly the same vein as this dimensional weight increase. At the end of the
day with fuel prices where they are today, this industry must do everything it can to more efficiently utilize the cubic
space because we do not come up against weight limits, only against cube limits.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Hi. Thanks very much. I have a question for Henry on the Ground side. We've see margins expand at
the fastest sequential rate we've seen in years but rates are still slightly below last year's level. And so I'm just trying to
understand a couple things. One, can you help us understand like what drove the magnitude of growth sequentially?
Obviously there's some seasonality in there but it has been a noticeable pick up in acceleration. And can we assume that
this sort of momentum continues so we can see margins in Ground sort of rival the fiscal 2012 levels again? Thanks.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Thanks, Tom. Well, I mean, the short answer is, is the reason why we had the margin
improvement over the third quarter is we stopped plowing snow. That's a simple answer. I mean once the weather went
back to being something close to normal and we removed a lot of those expenses, I mean everything normalized pretty
quickly both on the operational side of the house for us and what we see with respect to customer shipping patterns.

In regard to your question about fourth quarter margins versus last year, the biggest reason for the difference is simply
higher network expansion costs year-over-year. We've talked about our increased CapEx for capacity expansion. You
can't grow 10% a year the way we've been growing the last couple years without adding more capacity to the network
and we've had to do that. And we do that from a very disciplined standpoint with very high ROIC hurdles before we
approve a project.
So I don't know what more I can say about that. I hope that answers your question but I said at the outset here that we're
just simply not satisfied with anything other than margins in the high teens at FedEx Ground. And our operations team
works very hard to control expenses and when we design these facilities, particularly the new ones; they include
state-of-the-art material handling equipment to reduce our cost over the long-term. Thanks.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: We have a question over the Internet from Ben Hartford at Baird. It basically is about
acquisitions and will our strategy change as our capacity to support both increased returns to shareholders and larger
scale acquisitions?
Let me take the front part of this and then ask Alan if he wants to comment on it. Our policy toward acquisitions is not
going to change. Basically we look at a lot of things but there are three factors that govern whether we have any interest
in an acquisition whether it's a large entity or a small tuck-in entity.
Number one, that there's got to be a strategic rationale for making the acquisition; second, that the technology,
particularly the IT part and the corporate culture fit. And third that we don't overpay, because there's no reason to
overpay for something and thereby decrease margins or your earnings. So, Alan, you want to comment further on that?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: We like acquisitions. We're always looking. With Fred's three criteria I think guiding us, I think
we have made some great acquisitions over the years, Flying Tiger, Caliber which was RPS, which is now Ground
which will probably have more EBITDA this year than we paid for it. We've also not made some acquisitions that have
been great. We didn't have a culture fit or it was going to be too expensive. And as we look back on it, we're thankful
for some of the moves we haven't made. So it's a two-way street. Our eyes are always open and we'll continue to look
but that's the way we've always been.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Ross with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - David G. Ross>: Good morning, everyone. Back to the pricing side of things, the dim pricing at FedEx Freight,
we haven't seen density-based pricing in LTL for a while, but there has been a lot of chatter about getting rid of the old
classification system and moving to more of dimensional pricing there. How do you see the pricing direction at FedEx
Freight? Can you move to dimensional soon? What would be the impediments to doing so?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike. Clearly, there are multiple considerations when making these pricing
decisions. We operate in a very fragmented LTL space and certainly aware of some of the optional density-based
pricing that is being offered in the segment to some customers. As the leader in the LTL industry in terms of revenue
and volume, certainly we have a clearer view of the market conditions, and we'll consider any opportunities to more
efficiently price the LTL service.
I think it is important to note that the class system that is used today is overly complicated. Having said that, that
doesn't mean that change occurs quickly. This is a pricing system that has been in place for decades and will take time
to modify. Many customers like it and they don't want to get rid of it, and some customers are more open to different
pricing strategies. So we'll continue to evaluate the opportunities and work with customers. But I think it would serve
the industry well over the long haul if the LTL pricing environment was simplified.
<A - William J. Logue>: Hey, Dave, let me add a couple comments. In this fiscal year, we'll be rolling out some of the
dim capturing machines out there to really go out there and capture dims on our current business. Twofold, number one
it helps us with our classification and current pricing for existing business, but also more importantly it builds up our

costing file so we can really see as we go forward with our renegotiations on contracts and so forth, to get a better real
look at the actual costing. So once we've built that database, it's going to help us have the ability long term to go out
there and move towards, as Mike said, the dimensional based pricing solutions which will come over a period of time.

Thank you. We will take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Andrew Gordon>: Hey, good morning. This is Andrew Gordon on for Scott Group. Henry, I just wanted to
piggyback off of Kelly's earlier question on SmartPost if you don't mind, and sorry if I'm asking you to repeat yourself.
But can you clarify what you meant by that one large customer's change in shipping patterns as you called it? I'm
wondering if they shifted volumes to their regular Ground business or if it's possible that they're deferring some
volumes, or do you expect that this was just a complete exit of their business. And then lastly, was the strong yield
growth in SmartPost, would you say it was exclusively due to this customer's actions or largely impacted by it? Thanks.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: I think the short answer is that the distribution change was made to go directly to the Postal
Service as opposed to using SmartPost to get their packages into the USPS. Regarding yields, we've been focused on
yields at SmartPost for some time. We are confident we'll replace this customer's volume with volume that is not only
higher yielding but has better margins than the business that left. I can also tell you, and I can't tell you to what extent,
but we believe that some of that volume also ended up in other FedEx networks. And the other thing I would say is that
I don't believe all of it will leave. So I hope that answers your question.
Operator
Thank you. And we will take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yes, good morning, everyone. Kind of a two-part question but both related. I
wanted to follow up from Dave's earlier comments that it looks like you guys are well on track to achieve this 75% of
the $1.6 billion in the run rate by the end of fiscal 2015. Dave, does that mean that Express EBIT could actually be
north of $2 billion for fiscal 2016? And then secondly, Alan, I also wanted to follow up on your conversation about
reaching the full $1.6 billion. You did say that you're looking for better domestic and international trade growth. Can
you perhaps expand upon that? What type of growth levels are you looking for to achieve those numbers?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: This is Dave. I'll go first. I'm just going to comment that what we talked about in 2012 was
our profit improvement plan and I just wanted to say again we're on target. We got there a little bit differently. And so
I'm not sure how Alan adds it up at the end of the day but for us and what was important for us is we ended up coming
up with a plan that we are now executing for the end of FY 2015 to be on target and the end of FY 2016 to be on target.
Alan?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: It used to be that international trade was a multiple of global GDP, and those days have passed.
However, we are, as Mike told you, looking for improvement in the global GDP through calendar 2014 and certainly
into 2015, and with that we do expect global trade will pick up. I don't think it'll be a multiple of GDP but we do expect
it to pick up. And when it does we have the best, fastest, most global network out there and we should benefit from it.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: In that regard, we got a question over the Internet from Michael Mathay,
AllianceBernstein. I'll take part of this and then ask Dave to put some color on it. Can you provide an update on the
Osaka hub and the long-term impact for the Express business?
Our strategy in the Express business, to reiterate, is to operate an unduplicated backbone Priority network that allows
people to move door-to-door Express shipments of parcels and light freight between almost any two points on the
planet within one to two business days. And not dissimilar to Freight and Ground, we also offer an Economy service,
which in the main is moved on other people's networks because we have an extra day or so to process it and customers
make the choice between Priority and Economy. Same pickup and delivery operations, same information technology,

same scanning and so forth, and we think that that is a very winning strategy.
The Osaka hub was an extraordinarily important piece to this puzzle. And I'm going to ask Dave to comment on it
because he was out there for the opening. But with our 777 airplanes, we can come off of the Osaka hub and go straight
into our major hubs in the United States, which we do every day, and back to our hubs in Europe. And it's the fastest
possible service with the latest possible pickup and the ability to add any point on the network without having to have a
trans-Pacific frequency. So this has been an integral part of our long-term strategy and plan. And I'll ask Dave to
comment on it because again he was out there just recently.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Fred, and that's exactly right. It's nothing short of spectacular. I was there in April
for the ribbon cutting. The employees there are fantastic. The customers all showed up in big numbers and they're
supporting our network out there and they told us they would and they have. Fred's right. You can come off of Osaka
and go all the way to Europe into our Charles de Gaulle hub. You can go to the United States. The fastest, latest pickup
times; you can come off of there with deferred traffic, which we also have. You load up all of our containers and all of
those flights and so they're all full.
It's been one of our better strategic initiatives that we put in place in many, many years. And all I can tell you is that it's
very efficient, very successful. You can flex up off of that hub as trade goes up and you can flex down if it were to go
down. So it's actually perfect.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: Let me just add that one of the objectives that we've been after aside from the fact of
improving our operating margins is to do what Dave just said, is to provide much more flexibility in this network so
that we can move much quicker than we've been able to do in the past, which should prevent us from having a big
down cycles as we react to this big huge fixed cost network. We're getting more and more nimble and we're going to
continue to improve that over the next 24 months.
Operator
Thank you. We will take our next question from Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Thank you, and good morning, gentlemen. What's your outlook as it relates to FedEx Trade
Networks' growth for fiscal year 2015? I'm just curious. How should we think about both the air and ocean side as it
relates to FedEx Trade Networks? Thank you.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: This is Dave, again, and then Fred wanted to comment as well, but let me just say that's it's
been a very big part of our whole portfolio. It's been very significant. When we talk to very big customers or small, but
in the main very big, they're looking for fast overnight. We've got that with our 777s. And when they want deferred, we
now have that in a big way with our ocean forwarding business in FedEx Trade Networks. But more importantly we
now can go to a customer and bundle the whole portfolio in a way that we couldn't do in the past. So it's been very
successful.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: I just wanted to make a comment about the international transportation segment. I gave
three speeches over the winter which are published on the FedEx IR website. And I think one of the problems I see and
sometimes with people commenting on international trade and the air cargo business specifically, is you don't break it
into the granular sectors that we see on a day-to-day basis. And you really have to understand it in terms of the
door-to-door Express segment, the general air cargo segment, and the ocean freight segment.
And what customers are increasingly doing is moving to a more just-in-time, door-to-door regime for the things that are
important. And in that segment is both priority and economy because you're talking about the difference between one to
two days and two to four days. Still massively faster than sea freight but as the cost of fuel continues to go up, people
are doing all kinds of things including relocating things to Mexico, which is why we several years ago bought a
wonderful company in Mexico and we're now uniquely positioned for the cross-border NAFTA trade there. And then
the commodity freight is sort of toggling between the Express segment and the sea freight segment. And that's where
people get a little bit off-base is they tend to look at the market as much more holistic than it actually is.

Thank you. We will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey, thanks for taken my question. Dave, maybe you could comment a little bit on
productivity and capacity utilization levels you're seeing in the Express network today and how much better you think
those levels could get over the course of the next two years in the restructuring program?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks for the question and I meant to comment on this earlier. We talked about
International all the time but our U.S. domestic express team is doing a fantastic job. They've had attrition and they
haven't back filled people in the past and going forward that will continue to be the case. We've consolidated facilities,
we've consolidated routes, productivity is going up, efficiency is going up, the restructuring and transformation in the
United States is very significant in our plans going forward. So the United States team that's listening to this call, I
wanted to thank them and congratulate them as well. We talk about international a lot but as importantly the United
States express team.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: David, this is Alan. I just wanted to add our use of technology here is unbelievable. The
productivity that we're driving, the efficiencies that we're driving through the great technology we have and that we're
developing is making a big impact on these productivity issues. We couldn't do without it, frankly, and there's more to
come here. And we're getting traction every day, and I'd like to turn it over to my partner, Rob Carter, to talk about that.
<A - Rob B. Carter>: One of the key elements of the profit improvement program was technology whether it was
taking down the cost of technology and deploying more efficient and modern technology across the board or helping
our operating friend operate their business more effectively with great technology. So we're proud to be a part of these
improvements and there is more to come like Alan said we're making significant investments in modernizing and
simplifying our technology as well as improving speed to market.
Operator
Thank you. We will take our next question from Jeff Kaufman with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been hit, Alan, real quick, you mentioned
pension expense being reconfigured for next year. The markets are up quite a bit over the last year. Could you quantify
how much lower you believe your pension expense could be in 2015 versus 2014 in terms of how you're thinking about
forward guidance?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: It will definitely be a significantly lower number in 2015 and 2014 as was 2014 versus 2013. Jeff,
it was on the back of a very strong return on assets. We actually had another discount rate decrease at our measurement
date which was May 31 which was a little surprising. But offsetting that, we have merit increases, we have healthcare
increases and hopefully as the company does better, we're going to rebuild our annual incentive tools to higher levels.
So we're going to use some of that pension good news to put it in additional programs for our employees and that's all
in the guidance.
Operator
